With the work that my team
has already done

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.096
on separation of nanoscale biomarkers

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.056
for rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.616
I am optimistic
that within the next decade,

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.216
this type of technology will be available,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.120
