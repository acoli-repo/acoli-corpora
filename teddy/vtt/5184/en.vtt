00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:09.202
This is Mabel.

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:14.577
Mabel is an aphid, a small insect 
in the same order as cicadas, stink bugs,

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:16.567
and bed bugs.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:20.590
All these bugs pierce their prey 
and suck out vital fluids.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.820
Aphidsâ€™ prey are plants.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.560
And what aphids are after 
is buried within the plant,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.730
flowing in tubes made from single cells 
strung end-to-end.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.513
These are called sieve tubes and together 
they form the plumbing system
