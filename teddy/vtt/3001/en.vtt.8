00:03:57.548 --> 00:04:01.956
Can you guess how much
Teresia spends, on average,

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.577
each month on inventory --

00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:07.274
stocks of new clothes
that she gets from Nairobi?

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.009
One thousand five hundred US dollars.

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:15.965
That's around 20,000 US dollars
invested in trade goods and services

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.544
every year.

00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:19.018
This is Teresia,

00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.439
the invisible one,

00:04:20.463 --> 00:04:21.743
the hidden middle.

00:04:22.442 --> 00:04:26.535
And she's only the first rung
of the small entrepreneurs,

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:30.650
the micro-businesses that can be found
in these market towns.
