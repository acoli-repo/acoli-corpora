00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.098
just on inventory --

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.409
we're not talking about
the additional services

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.267
or the support ecosystem.

00:05:35.864 --> 00:05:39.452
These are the ones who fit
neither the policy stereotype

00:05:39.476 --> 00:05:41.880
of the low-skilled and the marginalized,

00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:44.775
nor the white-collar,
salaried office worker

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:46.660
or civil servant with a pension

00:05:46.684 --> 00:05:50.056
that the middle classes
are allegedly composed of.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.632
Instead, what we have here
are the proto-SMEs

00:05:54.656 --> 00:05:58.451
these are the fertile seeds
of businesses and enterprises

00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:00.418
that keep the engines running.
