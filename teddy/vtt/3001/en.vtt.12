that keep the engines running.

00:06:00.442 --> 00:06:02.177
They put food on your table.

00:06:08.774 --> 00:06:11.167
they make the machines
that make your french fries

00:06:11.191 --> 00:06:12.417
and they make your beds.

00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:15.846

00:06:17.037 --> 00:06:19.406

00:06:22.704 --> 00:06:26.360
And they're mashed together
with the vast informal sector

00:06:26.384 --> 00:06:31.457
that doesn't bother to distinguish
between smugglers and tax evaders
