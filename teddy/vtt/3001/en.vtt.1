00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:31.459
As part of a task of mapping
the informal trade ecosystem,

00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:34.016
we've done an extensive literature review

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.991
of all the reports and research
on cross-border trade in East Africa,

00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:40.826
going back 20 years.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.184
This was to prepare us for fieldwork
to understand what was the problem,

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:49.370
what was holding back informal trade
in the informal sector.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.494
What we discovered
over the last 20 years was,

00:00:53.518 --> 00:00:57.271
nobody had distinguished
between illicit --

00:00:57.295 --> 00:01:01.740
which is like smuggling or contraband
in the informal sector --
