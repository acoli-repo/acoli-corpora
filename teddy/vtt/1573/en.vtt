00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
what it could be,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and what your relationship to it is.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And in doing that, I want to offer you a vision,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
an imagined future, if you will,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of how, as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
"Once in a lifetime

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and hope and history rhyme."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I want to start with these word pairs here.
