Before I start, I'd like to know
who's in charge today?

00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:05.793
Is it me?

00:00:06.127 --> 00:00:07.545
Is it you?

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:09.547
Is it someone behind the curtain?

00:00:10.506 --> 00:00:13.676
My point is, we think of leadership
as a role for the few

00:00:13.718 --> 00:00:15.720
and the rest get to just lean back.

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:19.015
Now, that, of course, might be OK
for an event like this,

00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:21.434
but I believe that leadership by the few,

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:24.896
it's not going to help us solve
the problems ahead.

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:29.776
These problems are complex
and coming at us faster and faster.
