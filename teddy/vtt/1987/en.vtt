00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So historically there has

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
been a huge divide between what people

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
consider to be non-living systems on one

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
side, and living systems on the other side.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So we go from, say, this beautiful and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
complex crystal as non-life, and this rather

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
beautiful and complex cat on the other side.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Over the last hundred and fifty years or so,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
science has kind of blurred this distinction

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
between non-living and living systems, and

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
now we consider that there may be a kind

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of continuum that exists between the two.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We'll just take one example here:
