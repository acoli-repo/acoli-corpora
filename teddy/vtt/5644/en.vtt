00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:09.491
Maybe the fates got clumsy.

00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:12.311
Maybe Poseidon had one of his angry days.

00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:15.621
However it happened, 
the underworld is overcrowded,

00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:20.157
and Zeus has ordered Hades
to let some spirits out.

00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:24.599
Hades arranges all the souls
of the dead in a line before Cerberus.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.489
When one of his three heads bites 
down on the soul in front of it,

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.219
theyâ€™ll get returned 
to the land of the living.
