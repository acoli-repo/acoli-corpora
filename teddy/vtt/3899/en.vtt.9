This does not diminish
the value of education.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.136
Indeed, I'm a university professor.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.176
There are clear
intrinsic values to education,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.616
along with a public responsibility

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.776
to expose everyone
to a high-quality education,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.216
from grade school
all the way through college.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.376
But education is not the panacea.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.296
In fact, blacks who live in families
where the head graduated from college

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.096
typically have less wealth

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.040
than white families
where the head dropped out of high school.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.736
Perhaps we overstate
the functional role of education
