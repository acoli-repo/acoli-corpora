00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.256
and provide a more comprehensive
social security program,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.280
designed to provide capital finance
from cradle all the way through grave.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.656
We envision endowing American newborns
with an average account of 25,000 dollars

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.296
that gradually rises
upwards to 60,000 dollars

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.696
for babies born into the poorest families.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.056
Babies born into the wealthiest families

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.856
would be included as well
in the social contract,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.840
but they would receive a more
nominal account of about 500 dollars.
