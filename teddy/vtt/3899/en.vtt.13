00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.616
will likewise sanction those
that are not astute,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.456
those that lack motivation
or those that are simply lazy.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.240
In other words, the deserving poor
will receive their just rewards.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.696
What is glaringly missing
from this narrative

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.376
is the role of power and capital,

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.736
and how that power and capital

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.376
can be used to alter the rules
and structure of transactions and markets

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.816
in the first place.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.296
Power and capital become self-reinforcing.
