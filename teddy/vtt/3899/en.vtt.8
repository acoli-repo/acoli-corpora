00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.016
This framing is wrong.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.016
The directional emphasis is wrong.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.256
It is more likely that meager
economic circumstance,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.176
not poor decision making
or deficient knowledge,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.096
constrains choice itself
and leaves people with no options

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.656
but to turn to predatory finance.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.856
In essence, education
is not the magic antidote

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.856
for the enormous inherited disparities

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.600
that result from laws,
policies and economic arrangement.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.736
This does not diminish
the value of education.
