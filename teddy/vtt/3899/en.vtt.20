00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.096
The extent of our dramatic inequality
is at least as much a problem of politics

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.080
as it is a problem of economics.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.656
It is time to get beyond
the false narratives

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.776
that attribute inequality
to individual personal deficits

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.480
while largely ignoring
the advantages of wealth.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.896
Instead, public provisions of a baby trust

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.576
could go a long way towards eliminating

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.616
the transmission of economic advantage
or disadvantage across generations

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.296
and establishing a more moral
and decent economy
