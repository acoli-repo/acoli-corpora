00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.736
Perhaps we overstate
the functional role of education

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.216
at the detriment of understanding
the functional role of wealth.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.880
Basically, it is wealth
that begets more wealth.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.456
That's why we advocate for baby trust.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.456
An economic birthright
to capital for everyone.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.016
These accounts
would be held in public trust

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.440
to be used as a foundation
to an economically secure life.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.176
The concept of economic rights
is not new nor is it radical.
