00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.296
Even in times of economic
expansion, inequality grows.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.296
Over the last 45 years,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.936
wealth disparity
has increased dramatically,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.816
and essentially, all the economic gains
from America's increase in productivity

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.600
have gone to the elite
or the upper middle class.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.216
Yet, much of the framing
around economic disparity

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.576
focuses on the poor choices

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.136
of black, Latino and poor borrowers.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.016
This framing is wrong.
