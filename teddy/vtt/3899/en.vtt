00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:03.096
There is a narrative,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.416
an idea that with resilience,
grit and personal responsibility

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.680
people can pull themselves up
and achieve economic success.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.216
In the United States
we call it the American dream.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.280
A similar narrative
exists all over the world.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.416
But the truth is that the challenges
of making this happen

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.536
have less to do with what we do

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.736
and more to do with the wealth position
in which we are born.
