00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.776
indicates that the typical black family
has about 17,000 dollars in wealth,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.976
and that's inclusive of home equity,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.936
while the typical white family
has about 170,000.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.136
That is indicative
of an absolute racial wealth gap

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.216
where the typical black household
has about 10 cents for every dollar

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.360
held by the typical white family.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.776
But regardless of race,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.536
the market alone has been inadequate
to address these inequalities.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.296
Even in times of economic
expansion, inequality grows.
