00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, what I'm going to do is

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
just give you the latest episode of India's --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is cricket.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's got love, joy, happiness,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
sadness, tears, laughter,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
lots of deceit, intrigue.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
when the audience interest changes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And that's exactly what cricket has done.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's jumped 20 years
