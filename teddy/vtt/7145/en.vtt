00:00:01.038 --> 00:00:02.746
I often have this strange thought

00:00:02.746 --> 00:00:05.329
that aliens come down to Earth
to check us out.

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.038
They beam up a hundred scientists
and they ask them,

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.871
"What's going on on your planet?"

00:00:09.913 --> 00:00:11.829
And the aliens quickly learn something:

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:13.871
that all of these scientists
have concluded

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:17.788
that pollution from our industrial
activity is irreversibly heating the earth

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:20.996
in a way that will make it very hard
for us to live here safely.

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:22.371
Then they do the same thing,

00:00:22.413 --> 00:00:24.579
but this time they beam up
another 100 people,

00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:27.454
and they're not scientists,
they're regular people like us.

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:28.913
They could count on one hand

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:31.746
how many of those people
would even mention climate change.
