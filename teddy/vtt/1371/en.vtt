00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because until a couple of years ago,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
people knew hardly anything about us,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and I could basically come out here

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and say only good things about us.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But in the last couple of years

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we've become infamous for a couple of things.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
First, of course, the economic meltdown.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It actually got so bad

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
(Laughter)

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and no reserve.
