00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm here to talk about

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the wonder and the mystery

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The wonder is about the fact

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000

the amazing return of our conscious mind.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We recovered minds with a complete sense of self

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and a complete sense of our own existence,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We should, in fact,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because without having this possibility of conscious minds,
