What does it mean to be normal?

00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:06.733
And what does it mean to be sick?

00:00:09.087 --> 00:00:12.544
I've asked myself this question
from the time I was about seven,

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:15.091
when I was diagnosed
with Tourette syndrome.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.219
Tourette's is a neurological disorder

00:00:17.243 --> 00:00:22.679
characterized by stereotyped movements
I perform against my will, called tics.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:26.539
Now, tics are technically involuntary,

00:00:26.563 --> 00:00:29.778
in the sense that they occur
without any conscious attention

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:31.402
or intention on my part.
