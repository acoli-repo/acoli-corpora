00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:02.177
but unless you have Tourette's,
you probably think you can't relate.

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:05.042
But I bet you can.

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:08.681
So, let's try a little experiment here
and see if I can give you

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:11.807
a taste of what my experience feels like.

00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:12.981
Alright, ready?

00:01:13.776 --> 00:01:15.053
Don't blink.

00:01:15.077 --> 00:01:16.688
No, really, don't blink.

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:19.918
And besides dry eyes, what do you feel?

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.857
Phantom pressure?

00:01:23.794 --> 00:01:25.103
Eyelids tingling?

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:27.095
A need?

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.405
Are you holding your breath?

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:30.580
(Laughter)
