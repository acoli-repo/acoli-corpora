00:07:32.387 --> 00:07:34.474
So I delved deeper,

00:07:34.498 --> 00:07:37.323
into a field called social neuroscience.

00:07:37.347 --> 00:07:39.641
And that is a newer,
interdisciplinary field,

00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:42.357
and there I found reports
that linked the striatum

00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:45.196
not just to social anomalies in mice,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.672
but also in people.

00:07:47.458 --> 00:07:53.135
As it turns out, the social
neurochemistry in the striatum

00:07:54.243 --> 00:07:58.950
is linked to things
you've probably already heard of.

00:07:58.974 --> 00:08:00.403
Like oxytocin,
