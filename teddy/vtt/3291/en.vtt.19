00:09:26.839 --> 00:09:30.371
And the striatum
and opioid signaling in it

00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:33.283
has been deeply linked with loneliness.

00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:40.394
When we don't have enough signaling
at opioid receptors,

00:09:40.418 --> 00:09:46.131
we can feel alone in a room full of people
we care about and love, who love us.

00:09:46.774 --> 00:09:51.283
Social neuroscientists, like Dr. Cacioppo
at the University of Chicago,

00:09:51.307 --> 00:09:54.147
have discovered that loneliness
is very dangerous.

00:09:54.873 --> 00:09:56.133
And it predisposes people

00:09:56.157 --> 00:10:00.330
to entire spectrums
of physical and mental illnesses.
