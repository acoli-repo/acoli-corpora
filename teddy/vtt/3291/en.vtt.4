00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:05.879
So, let's shift the conversation from
what it means to be normal versus sick

00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:11.181
to what it means that a majority of us
are both normal and sick.

00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:16.054
Because in the final analysis,
we're all humans

00:02:16.078 --> 00:02:20.928
whose brains provide
for a spectrum of experiences.

00:02:22.563 --> 00:02:25.309
And everything on that spectrum
of human experiences

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:29.696
is ultimately produced by brain systems

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.653
that assume a spectrum
of different states.
