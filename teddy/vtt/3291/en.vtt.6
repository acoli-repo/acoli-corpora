on the impulsive and compulsive
behavioral spectrums.

00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:07.466
Because so much of my own
experience of my own body

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.728
and my own behavior

00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:11.077
has existed all over that map.

00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:18.335
So with the spotlight
on the opioid crisis,

00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:23.056
I've really found myself
wondering lately:

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.696
Where on the spectrum
of unvoluntary behavior

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.867
do we put something like abusing
opioid painkillers or heroin?
