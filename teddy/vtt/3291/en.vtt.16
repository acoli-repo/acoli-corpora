Like oxytocin,

00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:04.602
which is that hormone that makes
cuddling feel all warm and fuzzy.

00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:09.083
But it also implicates
signaling at opioid receptors.

00:08:09.943 --> 00:08:12.379
There are naturally occurring
opioids in your brain

00:08:12.403 --> 00:08:15.792
that are deeply linked
to social processes.

00:08:18.754 --> 00:08:23.493
Experiments with naloxone,
which blocks opioid receptors,

00:08:23.517 --> 00:08:28.851
show us just how essential
this opioid-receptor signaling is

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:30.447
to social interaction.
