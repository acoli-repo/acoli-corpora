where they can be
of service to each other,

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.244
where they can be helpful.

00:12:02.268 --> 00:12:04.076
Being of service lets people connect.

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.251
So --

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:15.265
if we don't have the ability
to authentically connect,

00:12:15.289 --> 00:12:19.541
our society increasingly lacks
this ability to authentically connect

00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:25.355
and experience things that
are transcendent and beyond ourselves.

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:26.977
We used to get this transcendence

00:12:27.001 --> 00:12:30.214
from a feeling of belonging
to our families and our communities.
