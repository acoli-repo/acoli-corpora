00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:30.580
(Laughter)

00:01:30.604 --> 00:01:31.755
Aha.

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:32.929
(Laughter)

00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:39.458
That's approximately
what my tics feels like.

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:44.006
Now, tics and blinking,
neurologically speaking, are not the same,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.578
but my point is that you
don't have to have Tourette's

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:53.601
to be able to relate to my experience
of my premonitory urges,

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:59.272
because your brain can give you
similar experiences and feelings.
