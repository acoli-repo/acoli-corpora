00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.354
entirely across the room for me,
because I will eat it all.

00:11:00.378 --> 00:11:01.529
I will.

00:11:01.553 --> 00:11:05.219
And that brings up another thing
that makes social disconnection

00:11:05.243 --> 00:11:06.687
so dangerous.

00:11:07.346 --> 00:11:09.680
If we don't have the ability
to connect socially,

00:11:09.704 --> 00:11:14.545
we are so ravenous for our social
neurochemistry to be rebalanced,

00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:16.863
we're likely to seek relief from anywhere.

00:11:16.887 --> 00:11:22.728
And if that anywhere
is opioid painkillers or heroin,

00:11:22.752 --> 00:11:28.813
it is going to be a heat-seeking missile
for our social reward system.
