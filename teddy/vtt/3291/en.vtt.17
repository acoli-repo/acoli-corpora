00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:30.447
to social interaction.

00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:38.054
When people are given naloxone --
it's an ingredient in Narcan,

00:08:38.078 --> 00:08:41.362
that reverses opioid overdoses
to save lives.

00:08:41.386 --> 00:08:43.847
But when it's given to healthy people,

00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:47.537
it actually interfered
with their ability to feel connected

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:50.373
to people they already knew
and cared about.

00:08:51.275 --> 00:08:57.156
So, something about not having
opioid-receptor binding

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.145
makes it difficult for us to feel
the rewards of social interaction.
