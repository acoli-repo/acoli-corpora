or intention on my part.

00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:36.997
But there's a funny thing
about how I experience tics.

00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:41.641
They feel more unvoluntary
than involuntary,

00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:44.625
because I still feel like it's me
moving my shoulder,

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.249
not some external force.

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:51.521
Also, I get this uncomfortable sensation,
called premonitory urge,

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:52.915
right before tics happen,

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:55.323
and particularly
when I'm trying to resist them.

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:58.681
Now, I imagine most of you out there
understand what I'm saying,

00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:02.177
but unless you have Tourette's,
you probably think you can't relate.
