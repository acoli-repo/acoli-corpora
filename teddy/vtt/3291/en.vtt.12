that orchestrate wiring
to the striatum during development.

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:08.003
And yes, that is my former license plate.

00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:09.439
(Laughter)

00:06:09.463 --> 00:06:11.273
And for the record, I don't recommend

00:06:11.297 --> 00:06:15.407
any PhD student get a license plate
with their thesis topic printed on it,

00:06:15.431 --> 00:06:18.104
unless they're prepared
for their experiments not to work

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:19.299
for the next two years.

00:06:19.323 --> 00:06:20.477
(Laughter)

00:06:20.501 --> 00:06:22.108
I eventually did figure it out.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:27.545
So, my experiments were exploring
how miswiring in the striatum

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:29.633
relates to compulsive behaviors.

00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:32.434
Meaning, behaviors that are coerced
