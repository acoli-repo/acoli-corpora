and it knows to trigger

in the past under those same conditions.

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:41.990
Do you know why I became a neuroscientist?

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.911
Because I wanted to learn
what made me tick.

00:05:45.935 --> 00:05:48.389
(Laughter)

00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:49.959
Thank you, thank you.

00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:51.246

(Applause)

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:59.443
So in graduate school,
I studied genetic factors

00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:03.201
that orchestrate wiring
to the striatum during development.
