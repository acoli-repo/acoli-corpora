00:04:26.173 --> 00:04:31.529
indeed, how we relate to the concept
of disease when it comes to addiction --

00:04:31.553 --> 00:04:35.665
makes an enormous difference
for how we treat people with addictions.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.479
So, we tend to think of pretty much
everything we do as entirely voluntary.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.887
But it turns out
that the brain's default state

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:51.892
is really more like a car
idling in drive than a car in park.

00:04:52.672 --> 00:04:55.180
Some of what we think we choose to do

00:04:55.204 --> 00:04:59.219
is actually things that we
have become programmed to do

00:04:59.243 --> 00:05:01.029
when the brakes are released.
