So again, what does it mean to be normal,

00:02:36.443 --> 00:02:38.403
and what does it mean to be sick,

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:43.442
when sickness exists on the extreme end
of a spectrum of normal?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.578
As both a researcher who studies
differences in how individuals' brains

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.372
wire and rewire themselves,

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:54.395
and as a Touretter
with other related diagnoses,

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:59.025

by failures of self-regulation

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.318
on the impulsive and compulsive
behavioral spectrums.
