00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If we look around us,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
much of what surrounds us

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
started life as various rocks and sludge

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
buried in the ground in various places in the world.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They look like TV cameras, monitors,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
annoying radio mics.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And so this magical transformation

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is what I was trying to get at with my project,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which became known as the Toaster Project.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And it was also inspired by this quote

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
from Douglas Adams,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the situation is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
