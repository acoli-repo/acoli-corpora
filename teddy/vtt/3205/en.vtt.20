00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.216
needing specialized care,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.696
probably from pain medicine.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.456
The pain docs saw their job
as getting pain under control

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.536
and when I couldn't
get off the medication,

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.256
they saw me as the purview
of addiction medicine.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.416
But addiction medicine is overstressed

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.680
and focused on those suffering
from long-term substance use disorder.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.160
In short, I was prescribed a drug
that needed long-term management

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.976
and then I wasn't given that management,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.840
and it wasn't even clear
whose job such management was.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.480
This is a recipe for disaster
