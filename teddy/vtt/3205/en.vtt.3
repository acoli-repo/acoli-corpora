00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.456
The result, put another way,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.680
was hell.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.616
The early stages of withdrawal
feel a lot like a bad case of the flu.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.416
I became nauseated,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.176
lost my appetite,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.136
I ached everywhere,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.720
had increased pain
in my rather mangled foot;

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.040
I developed trouble sleeping
due to a general feeling of restlessness.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.056
At the time,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.000
I thought this was all pretty miserable.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.096
That's because I didn't know
what was coming.
