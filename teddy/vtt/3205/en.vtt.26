00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.096
If my physician had given me that plan,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:05.040
my taper would have taken several months
instead of a few weeks.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.576
I'm sure it wouldn't have been easy.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.960
It probably would have been
pretty uncomfortable,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.640
but maybe it wouldn't have been hell.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.776
And that seems like
the kind of information

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.520
that someone who prescribes
this medication ought to have.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.320
In closing,

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.616
I need to say that properly managing
prescribed opioids

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.800
will not by itself solve the crisis.
