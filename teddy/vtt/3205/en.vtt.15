I didn't know any better at the time,
so I took her advice.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.896
I hung up and I started
calling those places,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.336
but it took me virtually no time at all

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.176
to discover that many of these facilities

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.616
are geared towards those battling
long-term substance use disorder.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.016

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.896
but transitioning them
onto the safer, longer-acting opioids:

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.976
methadone or buprenorphine
for maintenance treatment.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.960
In addition, everywhere I called
had an extensive waiting list.
