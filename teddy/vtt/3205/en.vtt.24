As somebody who has had
severe, real, long-lasting pain,

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.960
I can assure you these medications
can make life worth living.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.176
And second:

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.136
we can still fight the epidemic
while judiciously prescribing opioids

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.736
to people who really need them

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.320
by requiring that doctors properly
manage the pills that they do prescribe.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.816
So for instance,

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.160
go back to the tapering regimen
that I was given.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.016
Is it reasonable to expect

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.880
that any physician who prescribes opioids
knows that that is too aggressive?
