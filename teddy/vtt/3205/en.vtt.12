00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.216
And I know that sounds dramatic,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.976
because to me,
standing up here years later,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.856
whole and healthy --

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.160
to me, it sounds dramatic.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.720
But I believed it to my core

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.840
because I no longer had any hope

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.741
that I would be normal again.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.456
The insomnia became unbearable

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.480
and after two days
with virtually no sleep,

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.280
I spent a whole night
on the floor of our basement bathroom.
