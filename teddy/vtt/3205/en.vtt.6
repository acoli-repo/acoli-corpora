Sadiye became concerned,
and she called the prescribing doctor

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.160
who very helpfully advised
lots of fluids for the nausea.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.816
When she pushed him and said,
"You know, he's really quite badly off,"

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.016
the doctor responded,
"Well, if it's that bad,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.920
he can just go back to his
previous dose for a little while."

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.080
"And then what?" I wondered.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.240
"Try again later," he responded.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.176
Now, there's no way that I was going
to go back on my previous dose

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.680
unless I had a better plan for making
it through the withdrawal next time.
