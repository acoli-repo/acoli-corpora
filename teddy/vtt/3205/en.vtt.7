00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.200
And so we stuck to riding it out
and dropped another dose.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.360
At the beginning of week three,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.880
my world got very dark.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.016
I basically stopped eating,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.816
and I barely slept at all

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.680
thanks to the jitters
that would keep me writhing all night.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.736
But the worst --

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.141
the worst was the depression.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.536
The tears that had felt
like a misfire before

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.760
now felt meaningful.
