The medical community has in fact
started to react to this crisis,

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.496
but much of their response has involved
trying to prescribe fewer pills --

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.136
and absolutely,
that's going to be important.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.416
So for instance,
we're now gaining evidence

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.416
that American physicians
often prescribe medication

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.976
even when it's not necessary

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.216
in the case of opioids.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.216
And even when opioids are called for,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.520
they often prescribe
much more than is needed.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.496
These sorts of considerations
help to explain why America,

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.136
despite accounting for only five percent
of the global population,
