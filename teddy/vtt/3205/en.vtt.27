00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.800
will not by itself solve the crisis.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.000
America's epidemic
is far bigger than that,

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:41.016
but when a medication is responsible
for tens of thousands of deaths a year,

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.240
reckless management
of that medication is indefensible.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.936
Helping opioid therapy patients
to get off the medication

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.976
that they were prescribed

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.440
may not be a complete solution
to our epidemic,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.440
but it would clearly constitute progress.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.456
Thank you.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.320
