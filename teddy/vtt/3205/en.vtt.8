00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.896
Several times a day
I would get that welling in my chest

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.640
where you know the tears are coming,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.136
but I couldn't stop them

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.080
and with them came
desperation and hopelessness.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.816
I began to believe
that I would never recover

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.200
either from the accident
or from the withdrawal.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.935
Sadiye got back on the phone
with the prescriber

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.216
and this time he recommended
that we contact our pain management team

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.936
from the last hospitalization.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.536
That sounded like a great idea,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.870
so we did that immediately,
