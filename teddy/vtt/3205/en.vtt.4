00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.096
That's because I didn't know
what was coming.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.976
At the beginning of week two,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.240
my life got much worse.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.120
As the symptoms dialed up in intensity,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.976
my internal thermostat
seemed to go haywire.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.856
I would sweat profusely almost constantly,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.816
and yet if I managed to get myself out
into the hot August sun,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.640
I might look down and find myself
covered in goosebumps.

00:02:23.537 --> 00:02:26.776
The restlessness that had made
sleep difficult during that first week

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.120
now turned into what I came to think of
as the withdrawal feeling.
