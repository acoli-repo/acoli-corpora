00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.695
I was nonchalant, having given
this information to many doctors

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.616

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.416
My doctor turned serious

real conversation I'd had

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.640
about my opioid therapy, period.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.536
I had been given no warnings,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.176
no counseling,
