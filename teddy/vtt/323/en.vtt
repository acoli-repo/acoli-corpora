00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:02.436
I haven't told many people this,

00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:04.832
but in my head, I've got

00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:06.969
thousands of secret worlds all going on

00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:09.270
all at the same time.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.603
I am also autistic.

00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:13.549
People tend to diagnose autism

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.868
with really specific 
check-box descriptions,

00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:19.916
but in reality, it's a whole
variation as to what we're like.

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:21.649
For instance, my little brother,

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:23.426
he's very severely autistic.

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:25.688
He's nonverbal. He can't talk at all.

00:00:25.688 --> 00:00:28.180
But I love to talk.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.483
People often associate autism
