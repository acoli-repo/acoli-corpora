00:00:57.346 --> 00:01:00.349
and that's not true.

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:03.150
But that's not just with 
autistic people, either.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.490
I've seen it with LGBTQ people,

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.910
with women, with POC people.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.428
People are so afraid of variety

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:13.229
that they try to fit everything 
into a tiny little box

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.524
with really specific labels.

00:01:15.524 --> 00:01:17.155
This is something that actually

00:01:17.155 --> 00:01:19.833
happened to me in real life:

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:22.521
I googled "autistic people are ..."

00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:24.624
and it comes up with suggestions

00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:26.649
as to what you're going to type.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.404
I googled "autistic people are ..."

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:31.617
and the top result was "demons."
