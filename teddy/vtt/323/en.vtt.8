00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:01.929
and I can pick these people as my friends.

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.349
But if you think about it, what is normal?

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.160
What does it mean?

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.940
Imagine if that was the best 
compliment you ever received.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.221
"Wow, you are really normal."

00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.606
(Laughter)

00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:17.010
But compliments are,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.418
"you are extraordinary"

00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:20.252
or "you step outside the box."

00:04:20.252 --> 00:04:21.973
It's "you're amazing."

00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:23.863
So if people want to be these things,

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:26.371
why are so many people 
striving to be normal?

00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:31.385
Why are people pouring their 
brilliant individual light into a mold?
