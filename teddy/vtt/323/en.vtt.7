00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:30.165
they didn't really agree that it was cute.

00:03:30.165 --> 00:03:32.830
It can be that people 
don't want to be friends

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.807
with the girl that starts 
screaming in an algebra lesson.

00:03:35.807 --> 00:03:39.713
And this doesn't normally 
happen in this day and age,

00:03:39.713 --> 00:03:43.290
but it can be that people don't want 
to be friends with the autistic girl.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.572
It can be that people 
don't want to associate

00:03:46.572 --> 00:03:49.336
with anyone who won't 
or can't fit themselves

00:03:49.336 --> 00:03:52.306
into a box that's labeled normal.

00:03:52.306 --> 00:03:54.472
But that's fine with me,

00:03:54.472 --> 00:03:56.606
because it sorts the wheat from the chaff,

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:59.373
and I can find which people 
are genuine and true

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:01.929
and I can pick these people as my friends.
