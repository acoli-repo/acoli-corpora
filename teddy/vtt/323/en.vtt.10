00:04:57.295 --> 00:05:00.287
I've presented documentaries to the BBC,

00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:02.526
I'm in the midst of writing a book,

00:05:02.526 --> 00:05:04.674
I'm doing this — this is fantastic —

00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:07.925
and one of the best 
things that I've achieved,

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:10.510
that I consider to have achieved,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.492
is I've found ways of communicating

00:05:12.492 --> 00:05:14.337
with my little brother and sister,

00:05:14.337 --> 00:05:17.700
who as I've said are nonverbal. 
They can't speak.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.560
And people would often write
off someone who's nonverbal,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.294
but that's silly, because 
my little brother and sister

00:05:23.294 --> 00:05:25.987
are the best siblings that 
you could ever hope for.

00:05:25.987 --> 00:05:28.274
They're just the best, 
and I love them so much

00:05:28.274 --> 00:05:31.829
and I care about them 
more than anything else.
