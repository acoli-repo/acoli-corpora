00:05:28.274 --> 00:05:31.829
and I care about them 
more than anything else.

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:34.507
I'm going to leave you with one question:

00:05:34.507 --> 00:05:37.644
If we can't get inside the person's minds,

00:05:37.644 --> 00:05:39.737
no matter if they're autistic or not,

00:05:39.737 --> 00:05:42.774
instead of punishing anything
that strays from normal,

00:05:42.774 --> 00:05:44.529
why not celebrate uniqueness

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.590
and cheer every time someone
unleashes their imagination?

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.166
Thank you.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:55.346
