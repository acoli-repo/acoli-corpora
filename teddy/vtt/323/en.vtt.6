00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:00.264
(Laughter)

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:04.684
Also, when my imagination takes hold,

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.518
my body takes on a life of its own.

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:09.476
When something very exciting
happens in my inner world,

00:03:09.476 --> 00:03:10.980
I've just got to run.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.896
I've got to rock backwards and forwards,

00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:14.684
or sometimes scream.

00:03:14.684 --> 00:03:16.934
This gives me so much energy,

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:19.555
and I've got to have an 
outlet for all that energy.

00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:21.659
But I've done that ever 
since I was a child,

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.377
ever since I was a tiny little girl.

00:03:23.377 --> 00:03:26.246
And my parents thought it was 
cute, so they didn't bring it up,

00:03:26.246 --> 00:03:27.864
but when I got into school,

00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:30.165
they didn't really agree that it was cute.
