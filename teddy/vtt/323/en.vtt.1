People often associate autism

00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:34.156
with liking maths and 
science and nothing else,

00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:35.955
but I know so many autistic people

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:38.328
who love being creative.

00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:40.770
But that is a stereotype,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.626
and the stereotypes of things

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:45.888
are often, if not always, wrong.

00:00:45.888 --> 00:00:48.306
For instance, a lot of people

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:52.559
think autism and think 
"Rain Man" immediately.

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.051
That's the common belief,

00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:57.346
that every single autistic 
person is Dustin Hoffman,

00:00:57.346 --> 00:01:00.349
and that's not true.
