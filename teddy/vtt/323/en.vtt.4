00:01:59.634 --> 00:02:01.614
and there's the world in my mind,

00:02:01.614 --> 00:02:04.651
and the world in my mind 
is often so much more real

00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:07.138
than the real world.

00:02:07.138 --> 00:02:10.509
Like, it's very easy for 
me to let my mind loose

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.380
because I don't try and fit 
myself into a tiny little box.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.619
That's one of the best 
things about being autistic.

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.588
You don't have the urge to do that.

00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:20.356
You find what you want to do,

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:23.140
you find a way to do it, 
and you get on with it.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.293
If I was trying to fit myself into a box,

00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:27.445
I wouldn't be here, I 
wouldn't have achieved

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:29.595
half the things that I have now.

00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:31.371
There are problems, though.
