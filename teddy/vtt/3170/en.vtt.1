00:00:26.164 --> 00:00:30.461
I saw them and felt
a sense of joy and adventure.

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:34.574
This excitement felt like
a feeling to go forward

00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:37.266
into something I knew nothing about.

00:00:38.196 --> 00:00:42.855
My passion and connection to garden
started at that exact moment.

00:00:43.427 --> 00:00:46.395
When spring arrived,
I ran so fast through the house,

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:48.156
speeding ahead of my mother's voice.

00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:53.355
I pulled on my red corduroy jumper
and my grey plaid wool hat

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.569
before my mother could get her jacket on.

00:00:55.982 --> 00:00:58.877
I catapulted out of the front screen door

00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:02.055
and threw myself
on a fresh carpet of grass.
