Now they are lining
parks and courtyards,

00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:34.438
painted on walls and even
in blighted lots off the street.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.608
If you were in Berlin, Germany,

00:02:37.632 --> 00:02:41.051
you would have seen my garden
at Stilwerk Design Center,

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:46.481
where rosemary and lavender,
hydrangea and lemon balm

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:49.839
trailed up the glass elevators
to all six floors.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.402
In 2009, I planted "Philosophers Garden,"

00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:56.624
a garden mural,

00:02:56.648 --> 00:02:59.931
blooming at the historic
Frederick Douglass High School

00:02:59.955 --> 00:03:01.364
in Memphis, Tennessee.
