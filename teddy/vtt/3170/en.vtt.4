00:01:57.744 --> 00:02:02.522
the blooms from my mother's gardens
have healed all the way from her halo

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:05.079
to the roots on the soles of our feet.

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:09.680
In our last conversation before her death,

00:02:09.704 --> 00:02:13.053
she encouraged me to go
anywhere in the world

00:02:13.077 --> 00:02:14.743
that would make me happy.

00:02:16.076 --> 00:02:20.597
Since then, I have planted her gardens

00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:23.153
through art installations
throughout the world,

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:25.710
in countries of the people that I meet.

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:30.537
Now they are lining
parks and courtyards,
