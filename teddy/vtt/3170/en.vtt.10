00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.943
It's the same for humans
in the garden of hardship.

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.126
In this garden,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.417
when the caterpillar transforms
into a chrysalis,

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:12.343
this involves some struggle.

00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:14.255
But it's a challenge with a purpose.

00:05:14.756 --> 00:05:16.851
Without this painful fight

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:20.053
to break free from
the confines of the cocoon,

00:05:20.077 --> 00:05:23.601
the newly formed butterfly
can't strengthen its wings.

00:05:24.228 --> 00:05:28.592
Without the battle, the butterfly dies
without ever taking flight.
