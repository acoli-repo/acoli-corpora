Gardening has taught me
that planting and growing a garden

00:03:31.998 --> 00:03:35.347
is the same process as creating our lives.

00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:38.878
This process of creation
begins in the spring,

00:03:38.902 --> 00:03:41.702
when you break up the soil and start anew.

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:46.809
Then it's time to clear out
the dead leaves,

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:49.253
debris and roots of the winter.

00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:52.569
The gardener must then make sure

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.505
that a good disposition
and the proper nutrients

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.515
are correctly mixed in the soil.
