00:00:00.904 --> 00:00:03.825
At age four, I found a garden,

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:06.249
living underneath the kitchen floor.

00:00:06.778 --> 00:00:10.252
It was hiding behind
leftover patches of linoleum

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:13.533
on the worn-out floor
my mother was having removed.

00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:17.347
The workman was busy
when the garden caught my attention.

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:23.370
My eyes became glued to the patterns
of embroidered roses

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:25.793
blooming across my childhood landscape.

00:00:26.164 --> 00:00:30.461
I saw them and felt
a sense of joy and adventure.
