00:00:00.642 --> 00:00:03.802
Companies are losing control.

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:05.407
What happens on Wall Street

00:00:05.407 --> 00:00:07.738
no longer stays on Wall Street.

00:00:07.738 --> 00:00:11.624
What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube. (Laughter)

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:15.840
Reputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.416
Management teams seem increasingly

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:21.440
disconnected from their staff. (Laughter)

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.965
A recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe

00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:27.609
their employees are inspired by their firm.

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.756
However, in the same survey, only four percent

00:00:29.756 --> 00:00:32.199
of employees agreed.
