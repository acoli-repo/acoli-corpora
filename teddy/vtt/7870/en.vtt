Susan Cain: The idea of bittersweetness
is that we live in a constant state,

00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:07.436
all humans do,

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:12.316
it's a constant state
of a kind of existence simultaneously

00:00:12.356 --> 00:00:15.516
of joy and sorrow, dark and light,

00:00:15.556 --> 00:00:16.996
bitter and sweet.

00:00:17.596 --> 00:00:18.996
And then what comes with that

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:23.876
is a heightened awareness
of impermanence in all things,

00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:28.636
and also a kind of curiously piercing joy
at the beauty of the world.

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:33.116
Because there's something
about having this deep awareness
