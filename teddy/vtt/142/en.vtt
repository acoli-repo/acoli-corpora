00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.380
I've learned some of
my most important life lessons

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.879
from drug dealers

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.250
and gang members

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.503
and prostitutes,

00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:18.130
and I've had some of my most
profound theological conversations

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.704
not in the hallowed halls of a seminary

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:24.120
but on a street corner

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.051
on a Friday night, at 1 a.m.

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:33.872
That's a little unusual, since I am
a Baptist minister, seminary-trained,
