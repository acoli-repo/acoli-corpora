00:06:28.232 --> 00:06:30.921
Second, we need to invest in technology.

00:06:30.945 --> 00:06:34.316
Right now, you can add something
like a building or a local landmark

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.090
to the map in just a few seconds,

00:06:36.114 --> 00:06:37.365
but learning to map

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.577
and mapping easily
and quickly on a mobile

00:06:39.601 --> 00:06:40.784
can be a problem.

00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:43.155
We need to invest in technologies

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:46.799
to make mobile edits to the map
possible at a massive scale.

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:49.842
And third, we need to raise awareness.

00:06:49.866 --> 00:06:52.216
Aid projects across the world need to know

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.137
that these maps are free
and available for them to use

00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:58.724
and that they can request maps
for the areas that they're working in.

00:06:58.748 --> 00:07:01.962
For me, this is one of the most
wonderful things about this project.
