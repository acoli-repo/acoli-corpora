00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:31.476
and this is what those community
health workers produced.

00:02:31.873 --> 00:02:33.985
This map has everything
you need to navigate,

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:35.408
like the rivers and bridges,

00:02:35.432 --> 00:02:39.253
but it also has every local landmark,
the school, the football pitch, the plaza.

00:02:39.277 --> 00:02:41.350
And I'm pleased to say
that a few weeks ago,

00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:43.732
we got a call from
those community health workers,

00:02:43.756 --> 00:02:46.863
and they're using this map
in their response containing COVID-19.

00:02:47.593 --> 00:02:48.953
So you might be thinking:

00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:51.247
Why aren't these places
on commercial maps?

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:54.762
In short, mapping the most
vulnerable places in our world

00:02:54.786 --> 00:02:57.384
just hasn't been a priority
for for-profit companies,

00:02:57.408 --> 00:03:01.255
whose business models typically rely
on advertising and data sales.
