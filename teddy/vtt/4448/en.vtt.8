00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.961
but add all those contributions together,

00:04:01.985 --> 00:04:04.914
and you can map entire cities
in just a couple of days.

00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:08.028
And second, local mapping.

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:10.981
People living and working
in the places we're mapping

00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:12.897
take that base map and color it in,

00:04:12.921 --> 00:04:16.725
for example, identifying:
Is this building a school or a hospital?

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:20.153
Those people add information

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:22.008
We found people able and eager to map

00:04:22.032 --> 00:04:24.405
in even the most challenging
situations worldwide,

00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:26.897
and we've optimized the tools
to work on smartphones

00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:28.807
costing as little as 30 dollars.

00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:30.722
Additionally, the tools work offline,
