00:03:27.998 --> 00:03:31.080
Just as anyone can read or edit
an article on Wikipedia,

00:03:31.104 --> 00:03:33.415
anyone can use or edit
the map in OpenStreetMap,

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.224
and the resulting map is public good,

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:36.850
free and open for anyone to use,

00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:39.144
creating one map for all of us.

00:03:39.168 --> 00:03:41.006
It works in two phases.

00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:44.125
Buildings and roads might not
be on the map yet,

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:46.588
but you can see them clearly
in satellite imagery.

00:03:46.612 --> 00:03:50.321
Volunteers working anywhere in the world
turn satellite images into maps

00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:52.227
through drawing the buildings and roads

00:03:52.251 --> 00:03:53.402
on top of them.

00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:54.687
We call this a base map.

00:03:55.354 --> 00:03:57.380
On average, each time a volunteer logs in,

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.966
they map an area less than
10 kilometers squared,

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.961
but add all those contributions together,
