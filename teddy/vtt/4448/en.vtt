00:00:01.261 --> 00:00:04.374
When Hurricane Maria
hit Puerto Rico in 2017,

00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:07.471
we all watched as a disaster
played out on our screens.

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:10.112
At least 160,000 people were displaced,

00:00:10.136 --> 00:00:12.211
and nearly 3,000 people died.

00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:14.707
Electricity was cut off
to the entire island,

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.896
and some neighborhoods
didn't get power back for 11 months.

00:00:18.326 --> 00:00:20.838
Many of those watching
didn't know how to help.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.879
Some donated to international NGOs.

00:00:23.903 --> 00:00:26.072
Some lobbied their elected officials.

00:00:26.096 --> 00:00:27.664
But as with so many crises,

00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:30.449
so many of us simply gave in
and felt helpless.
