00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:32.675
the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières,
UNICEF to name a few --

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.316
and we currently have a queue
of more than 2,000 places

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.675
needing to be mapped.

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.419
So that's the story so far.

00:05:39.443 --> 00:05:42.097
But wouldn't it be great
if these places were on the map

00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:43.439
before they were in crisis?

00:05:43.463 --> 00:05:45.252
Now we're ready for a step change.

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:47.174
Over the past few years,

00:05:47.198 --> 00:05:50.856
we've gained access to global,
regularly updated satellite imagery.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.255
Machine learning and AI
are helping human mappers

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:54.587
to work more efficiently.

00:05:54.942 --> 00:05:58.088
And worldwide, more and more people
are willing and able

00:05:58.112 --> 00:05:59.707
to map their communities.
