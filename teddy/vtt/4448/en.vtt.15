00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.544
those programs will have more impact
than they would do otherwise,

00:07:30.568 --> 00:07:34.328
leading to a meaningful difference
in lives saved or improved.

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:38.169
But it's so much more than that.

00:07:38.704 --> 00:07:43.683
It's 2020, and one billion people
in our world are not visible.

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:45.533
That's wrong.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.783
This is a tool through which
every citizen of Planet Earth

00:07:48.807 --> 00:07:50.679
can become known and seen,

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:52.803
to literally be put on the map.

00:07:53.263 --> 00:07:55.786
My peers complain about being
too overconnected,

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.448
so how can it be possible
for more than a billion people

00:07:58.472 --> 00:07:59.723
to remain invisible?

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:02.622
Luckily, this is a problem
even the laziest among us
