00:06:58.748 --> 00:07:01.962
For me, this is one of the most
wonderful things about this project.

00:07:01.986 --> 00:07:04.837
It isn't really about HOT
or any single organization.

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:06.441
It's about creating a foundation

00:07:06.465 --> 00:07:09.555
on which so many
organizations will thrive.

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:11.262
Whatever we do,

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:14.091
disasters and crises will still happen,

00:07:14.115 --> 00:07:17.001
and humanitarians
will still respond to them.

00:07:17.413 --> 00:07:19.344
Development programs will continue,

00:07:19.368 --> 00:07:21.782
but without maps,
they'll lack critical information

00:07:21.806 --> 00:07:24.636
about what to expect in the community
before they get there.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.406
With open, free, up-to-date maps,

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.544
those programs will have more impact
than they would do otherwise,
