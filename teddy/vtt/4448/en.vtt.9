Additionally, the tools work offline,

00:04:30.746 --> 00:04:34.377
so people without regular access
to cell service can still contribute,

00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:37.261
adding things to the map
as they go about their daily lives,

00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:40.526
and then uploading when they get access
to cell service or WiFi.

00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:44.561
In 10 years, we've seen people
from all walks of life take part.

00:04:45.022 --> 00:04:47.221
Refugees have mapped broken water points.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:50.743
Rural women have added place names
in Indigenous languages.

00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:53.779
And, in doing so, people become
active agents of change

00:04:53.803 --> 00:04:55.461
in their communities.

00:04:55.485 --> 00:05:00.161
Since 2010, HOT has engaged
over 200,000 volunteers
