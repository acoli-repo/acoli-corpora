00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:30.449
so many of us simply gave in
and felt helpless.

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:32.815
At the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team,

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:34.252
also known as HOT,

00:00:34.276 --> 00:00:35.728
we did something different.

00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:38.641
We mobilized 6,000 volunteers
across the world

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:41.859
who mapped every home
and every road in Puerto Rico.

00:00:41.883 --> 00:00:45.396
And here you can see the maps
those volunteers made taking shape.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.040
Responders then used those maps
to assess the state of buildings and roads

00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:52.649
and to provide emergency funds,
WiFi and phone-charging points

00:00:52.673 --> 00:00:54.701
to people whose homes were damaged.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.393
All crises,

00:00:56.417 --> 00:00:59.501
including the COVID-19 pandemic
we're living through right now,

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.447
have devastating characteristics.
