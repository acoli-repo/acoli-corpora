00:02:57.408 --> 00:03:01.255
whose business models typically rely
on advertising and data sales.

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.699
This leaves out the poorest communities

00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:06.350
and means that individual
aid organizations create maps

00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:08.447
for the small areas
that they're working in

00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:13.247
in offline systems which rapidly
become out-of-date when a project ends.

00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:15.932
So what we have here
is a lack of easily shareable

00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:17.710
and easily updatable data.

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.738
But we also have a solution.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.224
We map with a tool
called OpenStreetMap,

00:03:22.248 --> 00:03:24.013
which was founded in 2006

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.522
and is a free, open-source tool
which anyone can use to map the world.

00:03:27.998 --> 00:03:31.080
Just as anyone can read or edit
an article on Wikipedia,
