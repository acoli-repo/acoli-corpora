00:01:59.673 --> 00:02:01.794
Think how inefficient it is
to manage a team

00:02:01.818 --> 00:02:03.369
who need to work in this place

00:02:03.393 --> 00:02:05.801
without a map to tell them
where they need to go.

00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:08.166
Then, once they're in the right village,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.161
how can they collect some data
and associate it to that place?

00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:14.598
Those community health workers
know that needs in this region are high,

00:02:14.622 --> 00:02:17.091
particularly anemia
and malnutrition among children.

00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:19.290
They just don't know
where those children are,

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:20.871
or what is causing that problem.

00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:24.033
They want to be able to locate
the home of every child under five,

00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:26.106
but how can they do that without a map?

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.733
After a brief training,
we went out to make a map,

00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:31.476
and this is what those community
health workers produced.
