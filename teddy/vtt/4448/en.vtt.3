So what does not being
on the digital map actually look like?

00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:34.488
I live in Peru, and a few months ago,

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:37.210
some community health workers
asked us to help them map.

00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:39.220
Obviously, where they were wasn't mapped,

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:42.012
so to get there, we asked
a local mayor to draw the route.

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:43.351
This is what he drew.

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:45.666
This piece of paper
was hard to follow. (Laughs)

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.761
We didn't really know
what these lines were.

00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:50.899
He put some numbers on there
that he assured us were travel times,

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:52.321
but as we were driving along,

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.453
these did not correspond to our reality.

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:56.986
But this isn't about me getting lost

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.252
or about shaming
someone's bad drawing skills.

00:01:59.673 --> 00:02:01.794
Think how inefficient it is
to manage a team
