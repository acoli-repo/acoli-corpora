00:04:55.485 --> 00:05:00.161
Since 2010, HOT has engaged
over 200,000 volunteers

00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:03.175
who have mapped an area
home to more than 150 million people

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.380
in OpenStreetMap.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:07.138
Those maps have been used
by search and rescue operations

00:05:07.162 --> 00:05:09.861
to free hundreds of people
trapped in collapsed buildings

00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:11.686
after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.599
They've been used to provide
polio vaccinations to children

00:05:14.623 --> 00:05:16.213
across all of rural Nigeria.

00:05:16.237 --> 00:05:19.256
And they've mapped the camps,
routes and new homes

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.258
of more than eight million refugees
fleeing South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:27.304
We work with the biggest
humanitarian organizations in the world

00:05:27.328 --> 00:05:29.261
to make sure these maps have impact --

00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:32.675
the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières,
UNICEF to name a few --
