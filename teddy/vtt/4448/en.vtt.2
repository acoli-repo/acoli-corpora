00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.447
have devastating characteristics.

00:01:02.038 --> 00:01:04.518
But many of them have one thing in common:

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:08.176
the people hit the hardest are often
literally not on the map.

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:12.755
Right now, more than one billion people
live in places that are not mapped.

00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:15.042
If you look those places up online,

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.943
you'll see nothing but a blank.

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:20.256
And that blank isn't just
a huge statement of disrespect

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.239
to our fellow human beings,

00:01:22.263 --> 00:01:23.896
it's an injustice,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.424
causing very direct, very real
and very avoidable human suffering.

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:32.007
So what does not being
on the digital map actually look like?
