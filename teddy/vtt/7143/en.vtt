00:00:00.563 --> 00:00:02.197
Simone Ross: Good morning, Kiran.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.797
Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw: Hi, Simone.

00:00:03.797 --> 00:00:06.063
SR: Thank you so much
for joining us here today.

00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:10.630
How do you think that the challenges
of the past year will, sort of --

00:00:10.663 --> 00:00:12.397
Do you think they will either hinder

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.097
or improve equitable access
to health care?

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.730
KMS: Well, you know, Simone,
one thing is very clear --

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.563
that COVID-19 actually pointed out to us
that we are all in it together.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.963
And I think it also exposed
many frailties and fragilities

00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:31.497
of the health-care systems
around the world.
