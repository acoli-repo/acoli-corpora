00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:31.356
that shows you which countries
had a problem with trachoma.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.211
And you may ask me,
"Well, does this strategy actually work?"

00:05:35.634 --> 00:05:36.824
Yes, it does.

00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:40.779
This map shows you the progress
that we've made to date.

00:05:40.803 --> 00:05:44.875
The green countries believe
they've already eliminated trachoma,

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:47.883
and they have either been through
or are in the process of

00:05:47.907 --> 00:05:50.618
having that validated by the WHO.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:53.269
Countries in yellow
have the money they need,

00:05:53.293 --> 00:05:56.563
they have the resources
to eliminate trachoma.

00:05:56.937 --> 00:05:59.414
And some of them are really nearly there.

00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:02.874
But the red countries,
they don't have enough funding.
