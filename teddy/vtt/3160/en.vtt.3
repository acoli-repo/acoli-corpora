Now, it's a very old disease.

00:01:32.188 --> 00:01:37.296
What you can see is a photo
of a wall of a tomb in Northern Sudan.

00:01:37.855 --> 00:01:40.827
A colleague and I were traveling
in a very remote village,

00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:44.388
and we asked an old man
to take us down into a little tomb.

00:01:44.955 --> 00:01:47.805
Now, on the wall, we saw two eyes.

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.145
One is crying,

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:51.757
and you can see
there are tweezers next to it.

00:01:52.127 --> 00:01:55.642
Simon said to me, "My God,
do you think that's trachoma?"

00:01:56.103 --> 00:01:59.169
So we sent this picture
to the British Museum,

00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:02.454
and they confirmed that, yes,
this is trachoma.
