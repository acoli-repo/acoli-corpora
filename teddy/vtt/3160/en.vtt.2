So what you'll often see
in places like Ethiopia

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:04.845
are girls who have tweezers
like this around their necks,

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.986
and they use them
to pluck out their eyelashes.

00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:11.126
But of course, that only gives them
temporary respite,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.709
because they just grow back
more vicious than before.

00:01:15.538 --> 00:01:19.616
There are around two million
people in the world

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.703
who are blind or visually impaired
because of trachoma.

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:27.625
And we believe there may be
as many as 200 million people

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:28.799
who are at risk.

00:01:29.418 --> 00:01:31.703
Now, it's a very old disease.
