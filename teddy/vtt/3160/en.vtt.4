00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:02.454
and they confirmed that, yes,
this is trachoma.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.164
So, thousands of years ago,

00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:09.014
the ancient Nubians
were painting pictures of trachoma

00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:10.902
on the walls of their tomb.

00:02:10.926 --> 00:02:12.926
And the tragedy is

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.272
that disease is still rampant
in that area today.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.529
And the crazy thing is,
we know how to stop it.

00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:26.048
And what's great is that the trachoma
community have all come together

00:02:26.072 --> 00:02:27.837
to pool their efforts.

00:02:28.157 --> 00:02:31.299
We don't compete; we collaborate.
