00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:31.895
where hundreds of thousands
of community volunteers

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.951
will distribute those drugs to the people.

00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:38.133
Now, we train those volunteers,

00:03:38.157 --> 00:03:42.221
and we also help the ministries
with all that complex logistics.

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.656
And every one of those volunteers
has a pole like this.

00:03:48.526 --> 00:03:50.260
It's called a "dose pole."

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:52.272
This one's from Cameroon.

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.189
And you can see it's marked
different colors,

00:03:55.213 --> 00:03:58.783
and you can tell how many pills
you should give somebody,

00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:00.607
based on how tall they are.
