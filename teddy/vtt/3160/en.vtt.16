00:07:57.737 --> 00:08:00.240
some words from
the founder of Sightsavers,

00:08:00.264 --> 00:08:02.547
a guy called Sir John Wilson.

00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:04.964
Now, he was blinded at the age of 12.

00:08:04.988 --> 00:08:06.285
And he said,

00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:08.909
"People don't go blind by the million.

00:08:09.468 --> 00:08:12.166
They go blind one by one."

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:15.202
And in the excitement of being able to say

00:08:15.226 --> 00:08:18.650
we've got rid of trachoma
for the whole country,

00:08:18.674 --> 00:08:23.293
let's not forget that, actually,
this is a devastating disease

00:08:23.317 --> 00:08:26.355
that destroys the lives
of individual people.

00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:28.657
People like Twiba.

00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:31.281
Now, I met Twiba last year in Tanzania.
