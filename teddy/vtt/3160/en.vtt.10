00:04:59.158 --> 00:05:01.463
It took us three years,

00:05:01.487 --> 00:05:04.840
but we went through 29 countries,

00:05:04.864 --> 00:05:09.912
and we taught local health workers
to go district by district,

00:05:09.936 --> 00:05:14.959
and they examined the eyelids
of over two and a half million people.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.297
And they used Android phones
in order to download the data.

00:05:19.776 --> 00:05:22.553
And from that, we were able to build a map

00:05:22.577 --> 00:05:25.101
that showed us where the disease was.

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:27.547
Now, this is a very high-level map

00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:31.356
that shows you which countries
had a problem with trachoma.
