00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:31.281
Now, I met Twiba last year in Tanzania.

00:08:31.618 --> 00:08:34.863
She had had trachoma
for as long as she could remember.

00:08:34.887 --> 00:08:38.293
And a couple of months before I met her,
she'd had the operation.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.134
It's no exaggeration to say

00:08:41.158 --> 00:08:44.451
that this had totally
transformed her life.

00:08:45.198 --> 00:08:49.181
We'd saved the sight that she had left,
and she was free of pain.

00:08:49.515 --> 00:08:51.047
She could sleep.

00:08:51.071 --> 00:08:53.229
She could work, she could socialize.

00:08:53.848 --> 00:08:55.148
And she said to me,

00:08:56.222 --> 00:08:58.110
"I have my life back."

00:08:58.587 --> 00:09:02.053
And it was impossible
not to be moved by her story.
