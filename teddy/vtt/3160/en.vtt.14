(Applause)

00:07:05.277 --> 00:07:08.053
Now, this map here shows you
the impact that we'll have --

00:07:08.077 --> 00:07:10.395
look how many countries are going green.

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:13.467
And there, you can see progress
in Ethiopia and Nigeria.

00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:16.412
Now, yes, there are some countries
that are still red.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.237
These are mainly countries
which are in conflict --

00:07:19.261 --> 00:07:23.050
places like Yemen, South Sudan --
where it's very difficult to work.

00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:28.340
So, we have the team,
the strategy and the map.

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:32.436
And we also have the relationships
with the governments
