What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale,

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:04.405
significant and long-term resource investment,

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:07.210
the expertise of many different kinds of people

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.198
and different kinds of minds, and for individuals,

00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:13.462
consumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse

00:02:13.462 --> 00:02:15.782
that we really want as consumers,

00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:18.725
and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise,

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:23.765
and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation.

00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:26.102
Peers are giving and doing things

00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:29.109

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.933
What do they bring? They bring this fabulous diversity,
