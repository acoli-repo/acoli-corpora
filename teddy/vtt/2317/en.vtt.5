00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.351
It delivers localization and customization,

00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:41.758
specialization, and all of this aspect about social networks

00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:44.606
and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there?

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:48.702
It's natural for me. Me and my friends, I can connect to them easily.

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:52.265
And it also delivers really fabulous innovation,

00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:53.681

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:57.097
So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product,

00:02:57.097 --> 00:03:01.677
and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do.
