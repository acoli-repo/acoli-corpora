the first peer production, Peer, Inc. company, I'd say,

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:05.617
they figured out early on, we need to have ratings

00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:09.001
and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff.

00:08:09.001 --> 00:08:12.249
We can flag that and we can put it to the side, and people

00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:16.564
who are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it.

00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:21.622
So going back, this is my look of excitement and joy,

00:08:21.622 --> 00:08:24.056
because all this stuff that I'd also been hoping for

00:08:24.056 --> 00:08:26.083
actually really did happen, and what's that?

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:28.896
That is the diversity of what's going on.

00:08:28.896 --> 00:08:31.528
You have these different fabulous owners
