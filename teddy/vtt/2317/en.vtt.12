00:05:57.514 --> 00:06:01.260
and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.091
they'd never thought of it before.

00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:06.458
Way too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers,

00:06:06.458 --> 00:06:09.242
trying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom,

00:06:09.242 --> 00:06:12.830
and the result was that we were able to provide owners

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.122
protection for their own driving records and their own history.

00:06:17.122 --> 00:06:18.938
The cars are completely insured during the rental,

00:06:18.938 --> 00:06:22.602
and it gives drivers what they need, and what do they need?

00:06:22.602 --> 00:06:25.107
They need a low deductible,

00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:27.355
and 24-hour roadside assistance.

00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:30.239
So this was a trick to get these two sides.
