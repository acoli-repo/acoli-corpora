00:00:01.657 --> 00:00:05.419
Twelve years ago, I founded Zipcar.

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:08.265
Zipcar buys cars and parks them

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:10.841
throughout dense metropolitan areas

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:13.969
for people to use, by the hour and by the day,

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.258
instead of owning their own cars.

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:20.142
Each Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars,

00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:23.246
and each driver drives about 80 percent less

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:25.606
because they're now paying the full cost,

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:28.182
all at once, in real time.

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:32.427
But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.
