00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:31.190
But what's really happening is that we've got the power

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.395
of a free and open Internet,

00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:36.600
and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.287
and the peers are now in partnership with the company,

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:43.504
creating shared value on shared values,

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:48.473
and each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.

00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:51.515
I call this Peers, Inc.

00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:54.076
The incorporated side, the company,

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:56.893
is doing things that it does really well.

00:01:56.893 --> 00:02:00.662
What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale,
