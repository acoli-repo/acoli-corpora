00:02:57.097 --> 00:03:01.677
and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do.

00:03:01.677 --> 00:03:06.041
The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds.

00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:08.029
Some of my favorite examples:

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.982
in transportation, Carpooling.com. Ten years old,

00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:13.385
three and a half million people have joined up,

00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:15.943
and a million rides are shared every day.

00:03:15.943 --> 00:03:19.175
It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent

00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:22.262
of 2,500 TGV trains,

00:03:22.262 --> 00:03:26.238
and just think, they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car.

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:28.982
This is all happening with excess capacity.

00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:32.469
And it's not just with transportation, my love,
