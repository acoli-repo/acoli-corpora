00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:32.427
But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:36.678
Now, a decade later, it's really time to push the envelope a little bit,

00:00:36.678 --> 00:00:38.663
and so a couple years ago I moved to Paris

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:41.342
with my husband and youngest child,

00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:44.562
and we launched Buzzcar a year ago.

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:47.819
Buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:49.486
to their friends and neighbors.

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:54.742
Instead of investing in a car, we invest in a community.

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:57.069
We bring the power of a corporation

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:00.182
to individuals who add their cars to the network.
