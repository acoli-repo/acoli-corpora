00:03:58.444 --> 00:04:02.640
TopCoder has 400,000 engineers who are delivering

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.440
complex design and engineering services.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.993
When I talked to their CEO, he had this great line.

00:04:08.993 --> 00:04:13.783
He said, "We have a community that owns its own company."

00:04:13.783 --> 00:04:16.055
And then my all-time favorite, Etsy.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:19.326
Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:20.992
and they're selling it in a marketplace.

00:04:20.992 --> 00:04:24.407
It just celebrated its seventh anniversary,

00:04:24.407 --> 00:04:26.975
and after seven years, last year it delivered

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:32.467
530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals
