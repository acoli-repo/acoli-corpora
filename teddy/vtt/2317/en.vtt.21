00:10:27.964 --> 00:10:30.805
call it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of us

00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:33.681
about the power of the hive,

00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:36.617
and its incredible facility to create this platform

00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:40.638
that individuals want to participate and innovate on.

00:10:40.638 --> 00:10:44.058
And for me, when I think about our future,

00:10:44.058 --> 00:10:47.386
and all of those problems that seem incredibly large,

00:10:47.386 --> 00:10:50.472
the scale is impossible, the urgency is there,

00:10:50.472 --> 00:10:53.506
Peers, Inc. provides the speed and scale

00:10:53.506 --> 00:10:58.092
and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems.

00:10:58.092 --> 00:11:03.409
All we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation -- nontrivial.
