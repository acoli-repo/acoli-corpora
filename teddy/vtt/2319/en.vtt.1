00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.538
And so when I moved to New York City after college

00:00:31.538 --> 00:00:34.498
and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression,

00:00:34.498 --> 00:00:37.250
I did the only thing I could think of at the time.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.262
I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me

00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:43.675
for strangers, and tucked them all throughout the city,

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:46.518
dozens and dozens of them. I left them everywhere,

00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:50.720
in cafes and in libraries, at the U.N., everywhere.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.775
I blogged about those letters and the days

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:54.749
when they were necessary, and I posed

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.412
a kind of crazy promise to the Internet:

00:00:57.412 --> 00:00:59.798
that if you asked me for a hand-written letter,

00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:03.119
I would write you one, no questions asked.
