I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason

00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:05.356
to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day,

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:07.708

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:11.385
in email, in Facebook, in texting or cell phones in general.

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:13.940
And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.081

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.157
which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital,

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:26.502

00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:29.133

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.538
