00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:32.947
like never before to write and mail strangers letters

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:35.804
when they need them most, but most of all,

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:39.100
fueled by crates of mail like this one, my trusty mail crate,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.340
filled with the scriptings of ordinary people,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.041
strangers writing letters to other strangers not because

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:48.832
they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee,

00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:52.444
but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing.

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:53.958
But, you know, the thing that always gets me

00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.494
about these letters is that most of them have been written

00:01:57.494 --> 00:02:02.198
by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper.
