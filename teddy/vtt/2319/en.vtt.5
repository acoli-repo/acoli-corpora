00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:31.338
which is a conversation starter, let me tell you.

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:33.647
If you ever need one, just carry one of these. (Laughter)

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:36.480
And a man just stared at me, and he was like,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.969
"Well, why don't you use the Internet?"

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.442
And I thought, "Well, sir, I am not a strategist,

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:46.208
nor am I specialist. I am merely a storyteller."

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:48.889
And so I could tell you about a woman

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.799
whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan,

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.345
and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation,

00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:57.805
and so she tucks love letters throughout the house

00:02:57.805 --> 00:02:59.933
as a way to say, "Come back to me.

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:01.491
Find me when you can."
