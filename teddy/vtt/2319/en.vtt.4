00:01:57.494 --> 00:02:02.198
by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper.

00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:05.903
They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters.

00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:07.772
They're the ones from my generation,

00:02:07.772 --> 00:02:10.638
the ones of us that have grown up into a world

00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:13.721
where everything is paperless, and where some

00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:16.783
of our best conversations have happened upon a screen.

00:02:16.783 --> 00:02:19.141
We have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook,

00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:23.431
and we speak swiftly in 140 characters or less.

00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:26.103
But what if it's not about efficiency this time?

00:02:26.103 --> 00:02:28.932
I was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate,

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:31.338
which is a conversation starter, let me tell you.
