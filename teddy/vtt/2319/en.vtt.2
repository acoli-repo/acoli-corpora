00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:03.119
I would write you one, no questions asked.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.195
Overnight, my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak --

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.886
a single mother in Sacramento, a girl being bullied

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:13.806
in rural Kansas, all asking me, a 22-year-old girl

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:16.452
who barely even knew her own coffee order,

00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:18.998
to write them a love letter and give them a reason

00:01:18.998 --> 00:01:21.327
to wait by the mailbox.

00:01:21.327 --> 00:01:24.151
Well, today I fuel a global organization

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:26.827
that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox,

00:01:26.827 --> 00:01:29.457
fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media

00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:32.947
like never before to write and mail strangers letters
