WEBVTT

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:02.555
is pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once,

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:03.990
that is an art form

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.165
that does not fall down to the Goliath of "get faster,"

00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:10.037
no matter how many social networks we might join.

00:04:10.037 --> 00:04:12.882
We still clutch close these letters to our chest,

00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:15.516
to the words that speak louder than loud,

00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:17.873
when we turn pages into palettes to say the things

00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:19.439
that we have needed to say,

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:22.127
the words that we have needed to write, to sisters

00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:25.649
and brothers and even to strangers, for far too long.

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:29.215
Thank you. (Applause)

00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:32.462
(Applause)
