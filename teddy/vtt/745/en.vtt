00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.667
I get asked a lot what the difference
between my work is

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:06.976
and typical Pentagon
long-range strategic planners.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.976
And the answer I like to offer is

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.976
what they typically do is they think
about the future of wars

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.976
in the context of war.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.976
And what I've spent 15 years
doing in this business --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.239
and it's taken me almost
14 to figure it out --

00:00:18.263 --> 00:00:22.976
is I think about the future of wars
in the context of everything else.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.976
So I tend to specialize
on the scene between war and peace.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.976
The material I'm going to show
you is one idea from a book

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.976
with a lot of ideas.
