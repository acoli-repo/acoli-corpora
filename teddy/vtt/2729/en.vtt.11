00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.292
are giving or getting
annual performance reviews.

00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:33.581
You look back over
your successes over the year,

00:05:33.605 --> 00:05:35.650
your "opportunities for growth."

00:05:35.674 --> 00:05:37.697
And this serves its purpose,

00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:41.151
but I find it's more effective
to do this looking forward.

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:43.769
So I want you to pretend
it's the end of next year.

00:05:44.326 --> 00:05:46.687
You're giving yourself
a performance review,

00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:51.227
and it has been an absolutely
amazing year for you professionally.

00:05:52.034 --> 00:05:57.821
What three to five things did you do
that made it so amazing?

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:02.534
So you can write next
year's performance review now.
