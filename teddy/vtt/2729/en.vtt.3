00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:32.499
Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits
of time here and there, add it up,

00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:34.807
we will finally get
to everything we want to do.

00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:37.743
But after studying how successful
people spend their time

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:40.404
and looking at their
schedules hour by hour,

00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:43.724
I think this idea
has it completely backward.

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:47.947
We don't build the lives
we want by saving time.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.126
We build the lives we want,

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:53.603
and then time saves itself.

00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:56.345
Here's what I mean.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.063
I recently did a time diary project

00:01:58.087 --> 00:02:02.291
looking at 1,001 days in the lives
of extremely busy women.
