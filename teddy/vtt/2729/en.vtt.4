00:01:58.087 --> 00:02:02.291
looking at 1,001 days in the lives
of extremely busy women.

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:04.959
They had demanding jobs,
sometimes their own businesses,

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:07.118
kids to care for,
maybe parents to care for,

00:02:07.142 --> 00:02:08.472
community commitments --

00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:10.309
busy, busy people.

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.006
I had them keep track
of their time for a week

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.343
so I could add up how much
they worked and slept,

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:18.176
and I interviewed them
about their strategies, for my book.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.189
One of the women whose time log I studied

00:02:20.213 --> 00:02:22.276
goes out on a Wednesday night
for something.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.929
She comes home to find
that her water heater has broken,

00:02:24.953 --> 00:02:27.589
and there is now water
all over her basement.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.834
If you've ever had anything
like this happen to you,
