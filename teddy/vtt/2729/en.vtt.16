00:07:59.591 --> 00:08:01.887
toward my personal
and professional priorities

00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:03.065
right now."

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:04.105
(Laughter)

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:06.746
But we are willing to think
about what those should be.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.975
So take a little bit
of time Friday afternoon,

00:08:08.999 --> 00:08:15.189
make yourself a three-category priority
list: career, relationships, self.

00:08:16.382 --> 00:08:19.580
Making a three-category list reminds us

00:08:19.604 --> 00:08:23.094
that there should be something
in all three categories.

00:08:23.118 --> 00:08:24.374
Career, we think about;

00:08:24.398 --> 00:08:25.905
relationships, self --

00:08:25.929 --> 00:08:27.248
not so much.

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:29.170
But anyway, just a short list,

00:08:29.194 --> 00:08:30.623
two to three items in each.
