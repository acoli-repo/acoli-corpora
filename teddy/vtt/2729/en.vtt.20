I think we can find time
for what matters to you.

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:04.990
If you want to spend
more time with your kids,

00:10:05.014 --> 00:10:07.319
you want to study more
for a test you're taking,

00:10:07.343 --> 00:10:10.688
you want to exercise for three hours
and volunteer for two,

00:10:10.712 --> 00:10:11.866
you can.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.531
And that's even if you're working
way more than full-time hours.

00:10:15.885 --> 00:10:17.937
So we have plenty of time, which is great,

00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:19.187
because guess what?

00:10:19.211 --> 00:10:22.049
We don't even need that much
time to do amazing things.

00:10:22.486 --> 00:10:25.233
But when most of us have
bits of time, what do we do?

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:27.359
Pull out the phone, right?

00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:29.995
Start deleting emails.
