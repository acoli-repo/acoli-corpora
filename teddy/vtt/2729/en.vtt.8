00:03:59.683 --> 00:04:00.839
Of course, right?

00:04:00.863 --> 00:04:03.282
But the reason she was
unavailable to speak with me

00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:05.246
is that she was out for a hike,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.308
because it was a beautiful spring morning,

00:04:07.332 --> 00:04:08.895
and she wanted to go for a hike.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.256
So of course this makes me
even more intrigued,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.456
and when I finally do catch up with her,
she explains it like this.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.747
She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do,

00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:21.205
every minute I spend, is my choice."

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.981
And rather than say,

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:25.434
"I don't have time to do x, y or z,"

00:04:25.893 --> 00:04:31.007
she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z
because it's not a priority."
