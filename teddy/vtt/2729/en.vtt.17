00:08:29.194 --> 00:08:30.623
two to three items in each.

00:08:31.013 --> 00:08:33.394
Then look out over the whole
of the next week,

00:08:33.418 --> 00:08:35.133
and see where you can plan them in.

00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:38.181
Where you plan them in is up to you.

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:41.667
I know this is going to be more
complicated for some people than others.

00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:45.213
I mean, some people's lives
are just harder than others.

00:08:45.674 --> 00:08:48.943
It is not going to be easy
to find time to take that poetry class

00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:51.697
if you are caring for multiple
children on your own.

00:08:52.058 --> 00:08:53.229
I get that.

00:08:53.253 --> 00:08:55.460
And I don't want to minimize
anyone's struggle.

00:08:55.484 --> 00:09:00.010
But I do think that the numbers
I am about to tell you are empowering.
