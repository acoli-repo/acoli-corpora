00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:32.468
Otherwise, we're puttering
around the house

00:10:32.492 --> 00:10:33.752
or watching TV.

00:10:34.114 --> 00:10:36.967
But small moments can have great power.

00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:39.610
You can use your bits of time

00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:42.290
for bits of joy.

00:10:43.195 --> 00:10:46.064
Maybe it's choosing to read
something wonderful on the bus

00:10:46.088 --> 00:10:47.452
on the way to work.

00:10:47.476 --> 00:10:49.875
I know when I had a job
that required two bus rides

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.444
and a subway ride every morning,

00:10:51.468 --> 00:10:54.371
I used to go to the library
on weekends to get stuff to read.

00:10:54.395 --> 00:10:58.886
It made the whole experience
almost, almost, enjoyable.

00:10:59.857 --> 00:11:03.044
Breaks at work can be used
for meditating or praying.
