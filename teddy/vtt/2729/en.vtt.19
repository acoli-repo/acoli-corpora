00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:30.811
maybe a main job and a side hustle.

00:09:30.835 --> 00:09:33.305
Well, that leaves 62 hours
for other things.

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:35.229
You say you're working 60 hours.

00:09:35.253 --> 00:09:37.681
Well, that leaves 52 hours
for other things.

00:09:37.705 --> 00:09:39.747
You say you're working more than 60 hours.

00:09:39.771 --> 00:09:41.328
Well, are you sure?

00:09:41.352 --> 00:09:43.086
(Laughter)

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.016
There was once a study comparing
people's estimated work weeks

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.435
with time diaries.

00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:50.135
They found that people claiming
75-plus-hour work weeks

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:52.263
were off by about 25 hours.

00:09:52.287 --> 00:09:53.981
(Laughter)

00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:56.326
You can guess in which direction, right?

00:09:57.567 --> 00:09:59.780
Anyway, in 168 hours a week,

00:09:59.804 --> 00:10:02.768
I think we can find time
for what matters to you.
