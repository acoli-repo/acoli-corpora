00:08:55.484 --> 00:09:00.010
But I do think that the numbers
I am about to tell you are empowering.

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:04.913
There are 168 hours in a week.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:10.663
Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours.

00:09:11.295 --> 00:09:14.028
That is a lot of time.

00:09:14.627 --> 00:09:17.818
If you are working a full-time
job, so 40 hours a week,

00:09:17.842 --> 00:09:20.934
sleeping eight hours a night,
so 56 hours a week --

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.538
that leaves 72 hours for other things.

00:09:24.622 --> 00:09:26.529
That is a lot of time.

00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:28.841
You say you're working 50 hours a week,

00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:30.811
maybe a main job and a side hustle.
