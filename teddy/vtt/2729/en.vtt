When people find out
I write about time management,

00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:06.263
they assume two things.

00:00:07.564 --> 00:00:10.548
One is that I'm always on time,

00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:12.984
and I'm not.

00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:14.870
I have four small children,

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:17.710
and I would like to blame them
for my occasional tardiness,

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:19.842
but sometimes it's just not their fault.

00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:23.112
I was once late to my own speech
on time management.

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:24.176
(Laughter)

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.773
We all had to just take a moment
together and savor that irony.

00:00:28.972 --> 00:00:32.191
The second thing they assume
is that I have lots of tips and tricks
