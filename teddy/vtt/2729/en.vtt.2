Being extremely judicious
in microwave usage:

00:01:02.023 --> 00:01:04.746
it says three to three-and-a-half
minutes on the package,

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.206
we're totally getting in on
the bottom side of that.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.969
And my personal favorite,
which makes sense on some level,

00:01:09.993 --> 00:01:13.745
is to DVR your favorite shows so you can
fast-forward through the commercials.

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:16.061
That way, you save
eight minutes every half hour,

00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:18.182
so in the course of two hours
of watching TV,

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:19.749
you find 32 minutes to exercise.

00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:20.789
(Laughter)

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.098
Which is true.

00:01:22.587 --> 00:01:25.208
You know another way to find
32 minutes to exercise?

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:27.961
Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right?

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:29.001
(Laughter)

00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:32.499
Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits
of time here and there, add it up,
