00:06:58.046 --> 00:07:00.684
Please, don't send it.

00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:02.439
But you can write it.

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:06.177
And now, between the performance
review and the family holiday letter,

00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:09.438
we have a list of six to ten goals
we can work on in the next year.

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:12.261
And now we need to break
these down into doable steps.

00:07:12.285 --> 00:07:14.493
So maybe you want
to write a family history.

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.770
First, you can read
some other family histories,

00:07:16.794 --> 00:07:18.056
get a sense for the style.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.287
Then maybe think about the questions
you want to ask your relatives,

00:07:21.311 --> 00:07:23.160
set up appointments to interview them.

00:07:23.184 --> 00:07:24.645
Or maybe you want to run a 5K.

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.830
So you need to find a race and sign up,
figure out a training plan,

00:07:27.854 --> 00:07:30.227
and dig those shoes
out of the back of the closet.
