00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:32.933
And so the key to time management

00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:35.776
is treating our priorities

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.847
as the equivalent
of that broken water heater.

00:03:40.162 --> 00:03:41.312
To get at this,

00:03:41.336 --> 00:03:44.781
I like to use language from one
of the busiest people I ever interviewed.

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:47.093
By busy, I mean she was running
a small business

00:03:47.117 --> 00:03:48.586
with 12 people on the payroll,

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.633
she had six children in her spare time.

00:03:50.657 --> 00:03:53.275
I was getting in touch with her
to set up an interview

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.795
on how she "had it all" -- that phrase.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.628
I remember it was a Thursday morning,

00:03:57.652 --> 00:03:59.659
and she was not available
to speak with me.

00:03:59.683 --> 00:04:00.839
Of course, right?
