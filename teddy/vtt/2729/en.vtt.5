00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.834
If you've ever had anything
like this happen to you,

00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:33.738
you know it is a hugely damaging,
frightening, sopping mess.

00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:36.472
So she's dealing with the immediate
aftermath that night,

00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:38.373
next day she's got plumbers coming in,

00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:41.897
day after that, professional cleaning
crew dealing with the ruined carpet.

00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:43.987
All this is being recorded
on her time log.

00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:46.311
Winds up taking seven hours of her week.

00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:48.473
Seven hours.

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.981
That's like finding
an extra hour in the day.

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:55.628
But I'm sure if you had asked her
at the start of the week,

00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:58.870
"Could you find seven hours
to train for a triathlon?"

00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:03.698
"Could you find seven hours
to mentor seven worthy people?"
