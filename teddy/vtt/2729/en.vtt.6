00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:03.698
"Could you find seven hours
to mentor seven worthy people?"

00:03:03.722 --> 00:03:06.413
I'm sure she would've said
what most of us would've said,

00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:10.881
which is, "No -- can't you see
how busy I am?"

00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:13.318
Yet when she had to find seven hours

00:03:13.342 --> 00:03:16.141
because there is water
all over her basement,

00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:18.675
she found seven hours.

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:23.206
And what this shows us
is that time is highly elastic.

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:25.637
We cannot make more time,

00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:29.840
but time will stretch to accommodate
what we choose to put into it.
