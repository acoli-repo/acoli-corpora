she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z
because it's not a priority."

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:36.077
"I don't have time," often means
"It's not a priority."

00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:39.963
If you think about it,
that's really more accurate language.

00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:42.551
I could tell you I don't have time
to dust my blinds,

00:04:42.575 --> 00:04:43.744
but that's not true.

00:04:43.768 --> 00:04:46.208
If you offered to pay me $100,000
to dust my blinds,

00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:47.832
I would get to it pretty quickly.

00:04:47.856 --> 00:04:48.872

00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:50.531
Since that is not going to happen,

00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:53.159
I can acknowledge this is not
a matter of lacking time;

00:04:53.183 --> 00:04:54.784
it's that I don't want to do it.

00:04:54.808 --> 00:04:58.194
Using this language reminds us
that time is a choice.

00:04:58.218 --> 00:04:59.391
And granted,

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:02.447
there may be horrible consequences
for making different choices,
