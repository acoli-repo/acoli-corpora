00:12:27.078 --> 00:12:31.537
As the answer is sought, other phenomena are typically discovered

00:12:31.537 --> 00:12:33.182
and other questions are asked.

00:12:33.182 --> 00:12:36.198
This first of the two strategies is like a hunter,

00:12:36.198 --> 00:12:40.447
exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry,

00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:43.366
who finds other quarries along the way.

00:12:43.366 --> 00:12:46.198
The second strategy of research

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:47.990
is to study a subject broadly

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:52.766
searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena

00:12:52.766 --> 00:12:56.567
like a hunter in what we call "the naturalist's trance,"

00:12:56.567 --> 00:13:00.230
the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting,
