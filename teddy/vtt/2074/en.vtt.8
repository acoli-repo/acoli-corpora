00:03:55.275 --> 00:04:01.278
Where elite mathematicians and statisticians

00:04:01.278 --> 00:04:06.343
and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm

00:04:06.343 --> 00:04:10.046
of science, the remaining large majority of

00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:14.758
basic applied scientists, including a large portion of those who could be

00:04:14.758 --> 00:04:20.110
said to be of the first rank, are the ones who map the terrain, they scout

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.862
the frontiers, they cut the pathways,

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.598
they raise the buildings along the way.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.774
Some may have considered me foolhardy,

00:04:28.774 --> 00:04:32.535
but it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics
