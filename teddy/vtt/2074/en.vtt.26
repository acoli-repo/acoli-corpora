00:12:56.567 --> 00:13:00.230
the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting,

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.614
any quarry worth taking.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.967
The search is not for the solution of the problem,

00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:07.174
but for problems themselves worth solving.

00:13:07.174 --> 00:13:09.166
The two strategies of research,

00:13:09.166 --> 00:13:12.351
original research, can be stated as follows,

00:13:12.351 --> 00:13:16.639
in the final principle I'm going to offer you:

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:20.903
For every problem in a given discipline of science,

00:13:20.903 --> 00:13:24.478
there exists a species or entity or phenomenon

00:13:24.478 --> 00:13:26.424
ideal for its solution.

00:13:26.424 --> 00:13:31.822
And conversely, for every species or other entity
