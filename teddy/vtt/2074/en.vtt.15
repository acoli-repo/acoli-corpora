00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:32.767
to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward.

00:07:32.767 --> 00:07:35.319
If that step proves too difficult for

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:39.491
the person or team that made the discovery,

00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:44.790
a mathematician can then be added by them

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.087
as a collaborator.

00:07:47.087 --> 00:07:49.246
Consider the following principle,

00:07:49.246 --> 00:07:54.446
which I will modestly call Wilson's Principle Number One:

00:07:54.446 --> 00:07:58.846
It is far easier for scientists

00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:03.415
including medical researchers, to require needed collaboration
