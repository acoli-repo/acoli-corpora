00:11:27.142 --> 00:11:31.253
may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect

00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:33.289
to other bodies of knowledge.

00:11:33.289 --> 00:11:35.158
Well, if that's the case,

00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:39.300
good. Why hard instead of easy?

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:44.155
The answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four.

00:11:44.155 --> 00:11:47.574
In the attempt to make scientific discoveries,

00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:49.567
every problem is an opportunity,

00:11:49.567 --> 00:11:51.062
and the more difficult the problem,

00:11:51.062 --> 00:11:53.822
the greater will be the importance of its solution.

00:11:53.822 --> 00:11:57.630
Now this brings me to a basic categorization

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.505
in the way scientific discoveries are made.
