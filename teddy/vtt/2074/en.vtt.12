00:05:59.374 --> 00:06:04.278
I finally got around to calculus as a 32-year-old tenured professor at Harvard,

00:06:04.278 --> 00:06:08.904
where I sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students,

00:06:08.904 --> 00:06:11.334
little more than half my age.

00:06:11.334 --> 00:06:12.806
A couple of them were students

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:16.062
in a course I was giving on evolutionary biology.

00:06:16.062 --> 00:06:21.318
I swallowed my pride, and I learned calculus.

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:24.414
I found out that in science and all its applications,

00:06:24.414 --> 00:06:28.376
what is crucial is not that technical ability,

00:06:28.376 --> 00:06:31.545
but it is imagination in all of its applications.
