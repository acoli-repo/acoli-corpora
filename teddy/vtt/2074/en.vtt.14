00:06:56.614 --> 00:07:01.174
during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant.

00:07:01.174 --> 00:07:06.373
Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied

00:07:06.373 --> 00:07:07.790
for its own sake.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:13.431
Of foremost importance is a thorough, well-organized knowledge

00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:20.080
of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.520
you propose to enter.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.646
When something new is discovered,

00:07:23.646 --> 00:07:28.615
it's logical then that one of the follow-up steps is

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:32.767
to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward.
