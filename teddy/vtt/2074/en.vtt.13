but it is imagination in all of its applications.

00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:35.879
The ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.815
pictured by intuition.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:43.159
I found out that advances in science rarely come upstream

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:46.191
from an ability to stand at a blackboard

00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:49.326
and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:51.182
and equations.

00:06:51.182 --> 00:06:56.614
They are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work,

00:06:56.614 --> 00:07:01.174
during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant.
