00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.505
in the way scientific discoveries are made.

00:12:00.505 --> 00:12:03.869
Scientists, pure mathematicians among them,

00:12:03.869 --> 00:12:07.136
follow one or the other of two pathways:

00:12:07.136 --> 00:12:09.246
First through early discoveries,

00:12:09.246 --> 00:12:11.390
a problem is identified

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.222
and a solution is sought.

00:12:13.222 --> 00:12:15.751
The problem may be relatively small;

00:12:15.751 --> 00:12:21.172
for example, where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread?

00:12:21.172 --> 00:12:27.078
Or larger, what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe?

00:12:27.078 --> 00:12:31.537
As the answer is sought, other phenomena are typically discovered
