00:09:56.423 --> 00:10:01.534
There is the quickest way advances are likely to occur,

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:05.151
as measured in discoveries per investigator per year.

00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:06.758
You may have heard the

00:10:06.758 --> 00:10:10.518
military dictum for the gathering of armies:

00:10:10.518 --> 00:10:13.239
March to the sound of the guns.

00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:19.749
In science, the exact opposite is the case: March away from the sound of the guns.

00:10:19.749 --> 00:10:22.454
So Wilson's Principle Number Three:

00:10:22.454 --> 00:10:25.798
March away from the sound of the guns.

00:10:25.798 --> 00:10:27.662
Observe from a distance,

00:10:27.662 --> 00:10:29.759
but do not join the fray.

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:32.127
Make a fray of your own.
