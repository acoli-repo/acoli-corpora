00:03:27.247 --> 00:03:30.566
you may go, to serve as teachers

00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:32.574
during the span of your career.

00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:34.649
I'll now proceed quickly,

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:37.838
and before else, to a subject that is both a vital asset

00:03:37.838 --> 00:03:41.270
and a potential barrier to a scientific career.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.750
If you are a bit short in mathematical skills,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.079
don't worry.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.590
Many of the most successful scientists

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.790
at work today are mathematically semi-literate.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.275
A metaphor will serve here:

00:03:55.275 --> 00:04:01.278
Where elite mathematicians and statisticians
