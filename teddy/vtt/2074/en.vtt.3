00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:33.262
so startling in its countless twists and turns, that no one can predict

00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:37.710
its outcome even a decade from the present moment.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.407
There will come a time, of course,

00:01:39.407 --> 00:01:43.158
when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge,

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:45.294
which actually began in the 1600s,

00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:48.110
has to peak and level off,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.358
but that's not going to matter to you.

00:01:49.358 --> 00:01:50.672
The revolution is going to continue

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:53.630
for at least several more decades.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.374
It'll render the human condition

00:01:55.374 --> 00:01:57.720
radically different from what it is today.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.038
Traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow
