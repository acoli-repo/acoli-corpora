00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:03.415
including medical researchers, to require needed collaboration

00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:05.533
in mathematics and statistics

00:08:05.533 --> 00:08:09.214
than it is for mathematicians and statisticians

00:08:09.214 --> 00:08:13.310
to find scientists able to make use of their equations.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.404
It is important in choosing the direction to take in science

00:08:17.404 --> 00:08:23.150
to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply,

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.790
and focus on that.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:29.486
Keep in mind, then, Wilson's Second Principle:

00:08:29.486 --> 00:08:34.022
For every scientist, whether researcher, technician,
