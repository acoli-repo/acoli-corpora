00:10:28.943 --> 00:10:31.896

is just this single drop of knowledge

00:10:35.598 --> 00:10:38.292
in a vast ocean of questions.

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:41.512
And if we want to learn more,

00:10:41.536 --> 00:10:43.883
to discover more, to understand more,

00:10:44.955 --> 00:10:46.934
then we need to explore more.

00:10:48.096 --> 00:10:51.258
The ability to accurately
keep time in deep space

00:10:51.282 --> 00:10:55.427
will revolutionize the way
that we can explore this universe,

00:10:55.451 --> 00:10:59.311
and it might just be one of the keys
to unlocking some of those secrets

00:10:59.335 --> 00:11:01.051
that she holds so dear.
