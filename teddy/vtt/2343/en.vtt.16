Can you see an astronaut
standing on the surface of Mars

00:08:00.626 --> 00:08:03.376
with Olympus Mons rising
in the background,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.087

00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:08.640

00:08:08.664 --> 00:08:11.496
and to chart a course to get
where she needs to go?

00:08:12.022 --> 00:08:13.529

much further away than Mars,

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.053

from the Earth in order to navigate

00:08:25.077 --> 00:08:26.617
is just not realistic.

00:08:27.032 --> 00:08:30.506
Imagine in this scenario
that we can have a constellation,
