00:03:26.296 --> 00:03:30.851
because getting it wrong
by just a tiny fraction of a second

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:34.999
might mean the difference between
your spacecraft safely and gently landing

00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:36.961
on the surface of another planet

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:40.113
or creating yet another
crater on that surface.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.280
Just a tiny fraction of a second,

00:03:42.304 --> 00:03:46.153
and it can be the difference
between a mission's life or death.

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:51.340
So we measure that signal time
very, very accurately here on Earth,

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.177
down to better than
one-billionth of a second.

00:03:54.823 --> 00:03:56.950
But it has to be measured here on Earth.

00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:02.193
There's this great imbalance of scale
when it comes to deep space exploration.
