00:05:29.687 --> 00:05:31.231
So it would be great

00:05:31.255 --> 00:05:34.462
if we could measure that signal time
directly at the spacecraft.

00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:39.400
But the miniaturization
of atomic clock technology is ...

00:05:39.424 --> 00:05:41.018
well, it's difficult.

00:05:41.543 --> 00:05:44.791
Not only does the clock technology
and all the supporting hardware

00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:46.652
need to shrink down,

00:05:46.676 --> 00:05:49.220
but you also need to make it work.

00:05:50.328 --> 00:05:53.459
Space is an exceptionally
harsh environment,

00:05:53.483 --> 00:05:55.857
and if one piece breaks
on this instrument,

00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:59.112
it's not like we can just send
a technician out to replace the piece

00:05:59.136 --> 00:06:00.670
and continue on our way.
