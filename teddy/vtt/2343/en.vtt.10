to get there and back again.

00:05:02.158 --> 00:05:04.958
And here's the thing
about these spacecraft:

00:05:04.982 --> 00:05:07.080
they move really fast.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.555
And Voyager 1 doesn't stop and wait
for us to send directions from Earth.

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:14.407
Voyager 1 keeps moving.

00:05:14.802 --> 00:05:17.113
In that 40 hours that we are waiting

00:05:17.137 --> 00:05:19.700
to hear that echo signal
here on the Earth,

00:05:19.724 --> 00:05:23.930
Voyager 1 has moved on
by about 1.5 million miles.

00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:28.980
It's 1.5 million miles further
into largely uncharted territory.

00:05:29.687 --> 00:05:31.231
So it would be great
