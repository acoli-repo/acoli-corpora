00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:01.085
You see, that same signal
that we use for navigation

00:09:01.109 --> 00:09:04.096
tells us something
about where it came from

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.989
and the journey that it took
as it traveled from antenna to antenna.

00:09:08.693 --> 00:09:13.023
And that journey, that gives us data,
data to build better models,

00:09:13.047 --> 00:09:17.645
better models of planetary atmospheres
throughout our solar system.

00:09:18.169 --> 00:09:22.830
We can detect subsurface oceans
on far-off icy moons,

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:27.270
maybe even detect tiny ripples in space
due to relativistic gravity.

00:09:28.224 --> 00:09:32.897
Onboard autonomous navigation
means we can support more spacecraft,
