00:06:57.984 --> 00:07:01.515
Well, instead of doing
all of the spacecraft navigation

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:02.699
here on the Earth,

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:05.236
what if we let the spacecraft
navigate themselves?

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.871
Onboard autonomous navigation,
or a self-driving spacecraft, if you will,

00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:11.944
is one of the top technologies needed

00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:14.447
if we are going to survive
in deep space.

00:07:15.343 --> 00:07:18.740
When we inevitably send humans
to Mars or even further,

00:07:18.764 --> 00:07:21.289
we need to be navigating
that ship in real time,

00:07:21.313 --> 00:07:23.689
not waiting for directions
to come from Earth.

00:07:24.412 --> 00:07:27.757
And measuring that time wrong
by just a tiny fraction of a second

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.877
can mean the difference between
a mission's life or death,
