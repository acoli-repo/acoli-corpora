00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.877
can mean the difference between
a mission's life or death,

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:33.916
which is bad enough for a robotic mission,

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.749
but just think about the consequences
if there was a human crew on board.

00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:40.683
But let's assume that we can
get our astronauts

00:07:40.707 --> 00:07:42.740
safely to the surface
of their destination.

00:07:42.764 --> 00:07:46.342
Once they're there, I imagine they'd like
a way to find their way around.

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:48.389
Well, with this clock technology,

00:07:48.413 --> 00:07:51.985
we can now build
GPS-like navigation systems

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:54.176
at other planets and moons.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.293
Imagine having GPS on the Moon or Mars.

00:07:57.317 --> 00:08:00.602
Can you see an astronaut
standing on the surface of Mars
