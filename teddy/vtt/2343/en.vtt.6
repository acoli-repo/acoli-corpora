You see, I can't just pull out my ruler
and measure how far away my spacecraft is.

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:03.292
But I can measure

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:06.889
how long it takes a signal
to get there and back again.

00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:11.092
And the concept is exactly
the same as an echo.

00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:14.489
If I stand in front of
a mountain and I shout,

00:03:14.513 --> 00:03:18.140
the longer it takes for me
to hear my echo back at me,

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.762
the further away that mountain is.

00:03:20.786 --> 00:03:25.392
So we measure that signal time
very, very accurately,

00:03:26.296 --> 00:03:30.851
because getting it wrong
by just a tiny fraction of a second
