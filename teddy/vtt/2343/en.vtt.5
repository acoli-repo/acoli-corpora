00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:30.222
it's like me standing here in Los Angeles
and shooting an arrow,

00:02:30.246 --> 00:02:34.953
and with that arrow, I hit a target
that's the size of a quarter,

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:39.652
and that target the size of a quarter
is sitting in Times Square, New York.

00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:44.141
Now, I have the opportunity
to adjust the course of my spacecraft

00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:46.490
a few times along that trajectory,

00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:49.797
but in order to do that,
I need to know where it is.

00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:54.002
And tracking a spacecraft
as it travels through deep space

00:02:54.026 --> 00:02:57.363
is fundamentally a problem
of measuring time.

00:02:57.387 --> 00:03:01.627
You see, I can't just pull out my ruler
and measure how far away my spacecraft is.
