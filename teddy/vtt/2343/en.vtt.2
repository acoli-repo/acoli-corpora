00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.527
from over 90 million miles away.

00:01:01.064 --> 00:01:03.705
It was livestreamed from Mars.

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:07.066
Meanwhile,

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.988
the two Voyager spacecraft --

00:01:09.012 --> 00:01:13.798
now, these are these two
almost unbelievably intrepid explorers.

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:14.998
They were launched

00:01:15.022 --> 00:01:18.758

were being introduced to Han Solo

00:01:18.782 --> 00:01:20.102
for the first time.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.378
And they are still sending back data
from interstellar space

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:26.507
over 40 years later.

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:31.498
We are sending more spacecraft
further into deep space
