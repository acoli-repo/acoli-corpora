00:05:59.136 --> 00:06:00.670
and continue on our way.

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:07.268
The journeys that these spacecraft take
can last months, years,

00:06:07.292 --> 00:06:08.996
even decades.

00:06:09.586 --> 00:06:14.397
And designing and building a precision
instrument that can support that

00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:18.528
is as much an art as it is
a science and an engineering.

00:06:20.131 --> 00:06:23.322
But there is good news: we are making
some amazing progress,

00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:27.690
and we're about to take
our very first baby steps

00:06:27.714 --> 00:06:30.724
into a new age of atomic space clocks.
