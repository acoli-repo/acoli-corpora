Onboard autonomous navigation
means we can support more spacecraft,

00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:35.479
more sensors to explore the universe,

00:09:35.503 --> 00:09:39.491
and it also frees up navigators --
people like me --

00:09:39.515 --> 00:09:42.435
to work on finding the answers
to other questions.

00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:47.262
And we still have
a lot of questions to answer.

00:09:48.014 --> 00:09:51.980
We know such precious little
about this universe around us.

00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:58.117
In recent years, we have discovered
nearly 3,000 planetary systems

00:09:58.141 --> 00:10:00.389
outside of our own solar system,
