There's this great imbalance of scale
when it comes to deep space exploration.

00:04:03.051 --> 00:04:09.678
Historically, we have been able to send
smallish things extremely far away,

00:04:09.702 --> 00:04:12.514
thanks to very large things
here on our home planet.

00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:15.840
As an example, this is the size
of a satellite dish

00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:19.088
that we use to talk
to these spacecraft in deep space.

00:04:19.112 --> 00:04:23.008
And the atomic clocks that we use
for navigation are also large.

00:04:23.032 --> 00:04:25.450
The clocks and all of their
supporting hardware

00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:27.913
can be up to the size of a refrigerator.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:33.695
Now, if we even want to talk about
sending that capability into deep space,
