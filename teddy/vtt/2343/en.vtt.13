00:06:27.714 --> 00:06:30.724
into a new age of atomic space clocks.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.208
Soon we will be launching

00:06:33.232 --> 00:06:36.572
an ion-based atomic clock
that is space-suitable.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:40.442
And this clock has the potential
to completely flip the way we navigate.

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:42.361
This clock is so stable,

00:06:42.385 --> 00:06:43.929
it measures time so well,

00:06:43.953 --> 00:06:46.939
that if I put it right here
and I turned it on,

00:06:46.963 --> 00:06:48.665
and I walked away,

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:51.862
I would have to come back
nine million years later

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:54.690
for that clock's measurement
to be off by one second.

00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:57.960
So what can we do with a clock like this?

00:06:57.984 --> 00:07:01.515
Well, instead of doing
all of the spacecraft navigation
