00:09:58.141 --> 00:10:00.389
outside of our own solar system,

00:10:00.763 --> 00:10:04.968
and those systems are home
to almost 4,000 exoplanets.

00:10:04.992 --> 00:10:06.955
To put that number in context for you:

00:10:06.979 --> 00:10:10.116
when I was learning about planets
for the first time as a child,

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.993
there were nine,

00:10:12.017 --> 00:10:14.070
or eight if you didn't count Pluto.

00:10:14.094 --> 00:10:16.233
But now there are 4,000.

00:10:17.312 --> 00:10:19.573
It is estimated that dark matter

00:10:19.597 --> 00:10:23.133
makes up about 96 percent of our universe,

00:10:23.157 --> 00:10:25.526
and we don't even know what it is.

00:10:26.034 --> 00:10:28.919
All of the science returned

00:10:28.943 --> 00:10:31.896
from all of our deep space
missions combined
