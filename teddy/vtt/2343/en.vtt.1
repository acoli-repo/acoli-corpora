00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:30.930
And hearing that news was possible
because of two small cube sets

00:00:30.954 --> 00:00:33.471
that went along to Mars with InSight.

00:00:34.453 --> 00:00:39.755
Those two cube sets essentially
livestreamed InSight's telemetry

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:41.044
back to Earth,

00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:43.808
so that we could watch in near-real time

00:00:43.832 --> 00:00:48.103
as that InSight lander went screaming
towards the surface of the red planet,

00:00:48.738 --> 00:00:50.517
hitting the atmosphere of Mars

00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:54.386
at a top speed of about
12,000 miles per hour.

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.800
Now, that event was livestreamed to us

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.527
from over 90 million miles away.
