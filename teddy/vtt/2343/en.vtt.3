00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:31.498
We are sending more spacecraft
further into deep space

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:32.944
than ever before.

00:01:33.647 --> 00:01:36.653
But every one of those
spacecraft out there

00:01:36.677 --> 00:01:39.202
depends on its navigation being performed

00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:41.121
right here at Earth

00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:43.982
to tell it where it is
and, far more importantly,

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:45.375
where it is going.

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:50.198
And we have to do that navigation
here on Earth for one simple reason:

00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:53.326
spacecraft are really bad
at telling the time.

00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:56.269
But if we can change that,

00:01:56.293 --> 00:01:59.597
we can revolutionize
the way we explore deep space.
