00:02:00.448 --> 00:02:02.889
Now, I am a deep space navigator,

00:02:02.913 --> 00:02:05.563
and I know you're probably
thinking, "What is that job?"

00:02:05.587 --> 00:02:09.552
Well, it is an extremely unique
and also very fun job.

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:11.505
I steer spacecraft,

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.177
from the moment they separate
from their launch vehicle

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:16.546
to when they reach
their destination in space.

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:20.247
And these destinations --
say Mars for example, or Jupiter --

00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:22.200
they are really far away.

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:25.184
To put my job in context for you:

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:30.222
it's like me standing here in Los Angeles
and shooting an arrow,
