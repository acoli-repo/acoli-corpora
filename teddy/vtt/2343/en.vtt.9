Now, if we even want to talk about
sending that capability into deep space,

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:35.619
that refrigerator needs to shrink down

00:04:35.643 --> 00:04:38.609
into something that can fit
inside the produce drawer.

00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:41.267
So why does this matter?

00:04:41.878 --> 00:04:45.880
Well, let's revisit one of our
intrepid explorers, Voyager 1.

00:04:47.157 --> 00:04:51.464
Voyager 1 is just over
13 billion miles away right now.

00:04:51.873 --> 00:04:54.571
As you know, it took
over 40 years to get there,

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:59.812
and it takes a signal traveling
at the speed of light over 40 hours

00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:01.580
to get there and back again.
