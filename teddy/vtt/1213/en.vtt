00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:02.654
When I was a young boy,

00:00:02.654 --> 00:00:05.262
I used to gaze through the microscope of my father

00:00:05.262 --> 00:00:08.620
at the insects in amber that he kept in the house.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.177
And they were remarkably well preserved,

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.422
morphologically just phenomenal.

00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:15.616
And we used to imagine that someday,

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.225
they would actually come to life

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:19.222
and they would crawl out of the resin,

00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:21.966
and, if they could, they would fly away.

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.342
If you had asked me 10 years ago whether or not

00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:27.540
we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.015
I would have told you, it's unlikely.
