00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And if I would also look at India,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
you have another type of inequity, actually, in India.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Uttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Kerala is flying on top there,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
matching United States in health,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
but not in economy.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
is forging forward.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Now in India, the big inequities are within the state,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
rather than between the states.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And that is not a bad thing, in itself.
