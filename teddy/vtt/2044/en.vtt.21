00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
you see that in between them

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and ahead of them,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
is the whole emerging economies of the world,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the "flat world."

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You can see that in health and education,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
a large part of the world population is putting forward,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
but in Africa, and other parts,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
as in rural Guizhou in China,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
there is still people with low health and very low economy.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We have an enormous disparity in the world.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.
