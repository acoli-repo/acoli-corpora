00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
by trying to predict precisely

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
at what year

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the average income per person

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
in India, in China, will reach that of the West.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And I don't mean the whole economy,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
because to grow an economy

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
of India to the size of U.K. --

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that's a piece of cake, with one billion people.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But I want to see when will the average pay, the money

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
for each person, per month,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
in India and China,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But I will start with a historical background.
