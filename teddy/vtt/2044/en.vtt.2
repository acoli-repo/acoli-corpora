00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
(Laugher)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And that, to me,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that personal experience

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
was the first time in my life

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that the mindset I grew up with

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
was changed.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And I realized that perhaps

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the Western world will not continue

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to dominate the world forever.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's that realization of someone you meet

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that really made you change your ideas about the world.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It's not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny.
