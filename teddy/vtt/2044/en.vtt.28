00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
But what I'm really worried about is war.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Will the former rich countries really accept

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
a completely changed world economy,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and a shift of power away from where it has been

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
the last 50 to 100 to 150 years,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
back to Asia?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And will Asia be able to handle that

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
new position of being in charge

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
of being the most mighty, and the governors of the world?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So, always avoid war,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
because that always pushes human beings backward.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Now if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
get ready for a world in equity,
