00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Now, back to my projections.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
When will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I will show income per person on this axis instead,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
poor down here, rich up there.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And then time here, from 1858

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I start the world.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And we shall see what will happen with these countries.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You see, China under foreign domination

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K.
