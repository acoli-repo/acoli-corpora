00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
maintained its national sovereignty.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And let's see how much difference that can make.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And I will do that by bringing these bubbles

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
back to a Gapminder graph here,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
where you can see each bubble is a country.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The size of the bubble here is the population.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
On this axis, as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And on that axis I have life expectancy, the health of people.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And I also bring an innovation here.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I have transformed the laser beam

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
into an ecological, recyclable version here, in green India.
