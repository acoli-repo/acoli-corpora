00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
(Applause)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to find the text of the telegram

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And it ends like this: "This telegraph

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
civilization, liberty and law throughout the world."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Those are nice words. But I got sort of curious

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
of what he meant with liberty, and liberty for whom.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And we will think about that

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858.
