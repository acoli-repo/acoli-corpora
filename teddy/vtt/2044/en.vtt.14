00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
In 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
in a way which surprised the world.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And what happened?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
What happens in the after independence?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
You can see that the health started to improve.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Children started to go to school.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Health services were provided.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
This is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
China recovered. Then they said,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
"Nevermore, stupid central planning."

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But they went up here, and India was trying to follow.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And they were catching up indeed.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And both countries had the better health, but still

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
a very low economy.
