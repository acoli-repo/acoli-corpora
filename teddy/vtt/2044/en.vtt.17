00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
If I would split China, look here,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Shanghai has already catched up.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Shanghai is already there.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And it's healthier than the United States.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
But on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
inland provinces of China, is there.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
the rural part of Guizhou goes down there.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
You see this enormous inequity in China,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
in the midst of fast economic growth.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And if I would also look at India,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
you have another type of inequity, actually, in India.
