00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and electricity is really what is needed in India and China.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
You know the climate. We have great international experts

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
within India telling us that the climate is changing,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and actions has to be taken,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
otherwise China and India would be the countries

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
most to suffer from climate change.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And I consider India and China the best partners in the world

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
in a good global climate policy.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But they ain't going to pay

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
for what others, who have more money,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
have largely created, and I can agree on that.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
But what I'm really worried about is war.
