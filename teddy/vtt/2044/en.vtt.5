00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But I will start with a historical background.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I will start at 1858.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
1858 was a year of great technological

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
advancement in the West.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That was the year when Queen Victoria

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
was able, for the first time, to communicate

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
with President Buchanan,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And they were the first to "Twitter" transatlantically.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
(Laughter)

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
(Applause)
