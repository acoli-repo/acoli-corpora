00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
when the income per person in India and China

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
was even above that of Europe.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
But 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and India had been de-industrialized.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And you can see that the countries who were growing

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
their economy was United States and United Kingdom.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and Japan was starting to catch up.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
India was trying down here.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Can you see how it starts to move there?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
But really, really natural sovereignty was good for Japan.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And Japan is trying to move up there.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And it's the new century now. Health is getting better,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
United Kingdom, United States.
