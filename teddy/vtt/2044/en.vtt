00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Once upon a time,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
at the age of 24,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I was a guest student during one month

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of a public health course.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And that changed my mindset forever.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The course was good, but it was not the course content

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in itself that changed the mindset.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It was the brutal realization,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the first morning,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that the Indian students were better than me.
