00:00:01.636 --> 00:00:04.916
Today, I would like
to talk to you about beauty

00:00:04.956 --> 00:00:10.116
and how we've got it all wrong when it
comes to our perceptions of women,

00:00:10.156 --> 00:00:12.996
particularly Aboriginal women.

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:17.796
But before I do, I would like to
acknowledge the traditional custodians

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:20.356
of the land in which I stand upon:

00:00:20.396 --> 00:00:23.676
the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation.

00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:28.996
I pay my respects to the elders past,
present and emerging

00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:33.316
and give thanks to our ancestors
who guide and protect us.
