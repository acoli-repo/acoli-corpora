00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The Highline

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
is an old, elevated rail line

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And it was originally a freight line

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that ran down 10th Ave.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And it became known as "Death Avenue"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because so many people were run over by the trains

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and he became known as the "West Side Cowboy."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But even with a cowboy,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
about one person a month

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
was killed and run over.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So they elevated it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They built it 30 ft. in the air, right through the middle of the city.
