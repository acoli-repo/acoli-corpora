AG: Great leaders
do realize it's happening

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.776

of spreading humility in a team.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.560
We'll hear from him after the break.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.216
OK, this is going to be
a different kind of ad.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.776

interesting cultures of their own.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.776

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.000
to explore something
that piqued my curiosity.
