00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.056
or even the third best to add real value.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.456
ML: So he wasn't athletic enough
to stop Kobe Bryant

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.800
from getting his shot up.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.416
He didn't smother him as a defender.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.136
But he was smart enough
and kind of canny enough on the floor

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.776
to force Kobe Bryant
to places on the floor

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.816
where he was a less efficient shooter.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.416
And so Kobe Bryant might get his points,
but he had to take a lot more shots

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.656
to get his points.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.296
So he was doing all these things
that are very subtle and very valuable

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.776
that no star would bother to do,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.696
and none of that really
got measured conventionally.
