00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.216
and that a lot of what a star does
is maximize those stats.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.936
AG: That's Michael Lewis.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.776
You might be familiar with his books,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.976
like "Moneyball" and "The Blind Side."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.056
He's spent a lot of his career
writing about why we get talent so wrong.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.176
ML: Some of the things the stars do
are maybe not as valuable as we think.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.536
If you see a volume shooter,
a guy who scores a lot of points,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.056
but he might be scoring the points
and so he gets classified as a star,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.216
but he might be scoring
those points in a way

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.056
that actually kind of hurts the team,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.336
taking lots of bad shots,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.576
not making a high percentage of his shots.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.696
Each time you're on a court,
only one person can take the shot.
