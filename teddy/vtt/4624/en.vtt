Shane Battier: I can't really
ever remember a time

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.376
when I didn't have
some sort of ball in my hand.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.055
Adam Grant: This is Shane Battier.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.976
Growing up, he was a standout athlete.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
SB: My first love growing up was baseball.

00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:14.496
I thought I was going to be
a Major League pitcher,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.136
and a funny thing happened.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.056
When I was in sixth grade,
I was six feet tall

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.656
and in seventh grade I was six foot four,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.496
and in eighth grade, I was six foot eight,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.776
so that's when I switched
and became a basketball guy first.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.216
AG: Shane was the National Basketball
Player of the Year in high school
