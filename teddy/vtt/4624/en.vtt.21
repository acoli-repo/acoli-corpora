AG: You can start to see
how Shane elevated each of his teams.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.656
He made the players around him better,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.880
not just better basketball players,
but better teammates too.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.496
I think part of what's happening
in this kind of situation

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.176
has to do with an emotion.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.296
It's called moral elevation.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.856
You might not have heard of it,

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.216
but social scientists
are pretty excited about it.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.736
Sara Algoe: Moral elevation
is a feeling that you get

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.440
when you see somebody else's
moral goodness.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.176
AG: That's Sara Algoe,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.840
one of the first psychologists
to study moral elevation.
