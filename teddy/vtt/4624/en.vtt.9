00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.296
that are very valuable

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.376
that don't get the same
amount of attention

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.856
and that may be beneath
the dignity of a star to perform

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.200
and you need other kinds of people
to do those things.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.376
AG: Lots of stars means lots of egos

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.640
and lots of egos means infighting.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.680
To overcome that problem,
you need humility.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.496
Humility is having the self-awareness
to know what you're good at

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.176
and what you're not good at.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.656
Studies show that when
you have humility in a team,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.056
people are more likely
to play to their strengths.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.776
Instead of going for the spotlight,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.456
they take on the roles
where they can help the team win.
