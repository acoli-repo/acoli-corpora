I study how to make work not suck

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.976
and in this show, I take you
to some truly unusual places

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.120
where they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
Thanks to JPMorgan Chase
for sponsoring this episode.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.856
Today, humility,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.920
a hidden ingredient in great teams.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.856
When it's time to put together a team,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.680
most people look for the best talent.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.216
I hear it in every industry.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.480
We don't take B players, only A players.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.360
But what actually happens
when you have a whole team of stars?
