00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.000
to explore something
that piqued my curiosity.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.736
(Music)

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.936

They're often a huge waste of time.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.056
Gordon Smith figured that out quickly.

which of course

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.776
AG: Now he's at JPMorgan Chase
with a new title.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.336
GS: I am the Co-President
and Chief Operating Officer
