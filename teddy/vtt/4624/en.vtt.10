00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.456
they take on the roles
where they can help the team win.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.496
ML: The stars are overrated
and the role players are underrated.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.336
The role players,
the people we think of not as stars,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.536
might be doing sometimes
things that are extremely valuable,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.336
but that don't get the attention
that the stars do.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.616
AG: On the Miami Heat,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.776
after the big three failed to win
a championship their first year,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.616
they didn't add yet another star.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.080
They picked up Shane Battier.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.696
Michael wrote a huge profile of Shane
in the "New York Times Magazine."

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.376
He called Shane the "no-stats all-star,"

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.096
because Shane didn't score a lot of points
or grab that many rebounds,
