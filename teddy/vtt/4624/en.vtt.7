Each time you're on a court,
only one person can take the shot.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.056
If what the star is is a scoring machine,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.816
it's kind of inefficient
to have five of them on the court

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.416
who are focused on that

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.816
when there are other things
that need to be done.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.256
AG: This was a problem for the Miami Heat.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.056
In 2010, they tried to build a dream team
by bringing in two free agent stars,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.960
LeBron James and Chris Bosh.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.136
But they already had a star, Dwyane Wade.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.303
Their first press conference
was a wild affair

00:03:58.327 --> 00:04:00.696
with fireworks and a crowd of thousands.
