00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.216
are less likely to win World Cup
qualifying matches.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.816
And in a study of NBA basketball

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.096
over a decade,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.776
teams with only three star players

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.280
won more games
than teams with four or five.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.296
The star-studded teams had fewer assists,
missed more of their shots

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.096
and grabbed fewer rebounds.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.856
The players struggled to coordinate.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.080
They all wanted to be the alpha dog.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.496
Michael Lewis: I think what's going on
is how we define star

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.376
is largely a function
of the statistics that are used

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.376
to measure performance on the court

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.216
and that a lot of what a star does
is maximize those stats.
