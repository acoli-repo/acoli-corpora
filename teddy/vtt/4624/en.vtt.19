no one cares what your role was.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.320
All they know is wow,
you were part of that team.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.576
AG: Three, show openness
to learning from others.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.320
Shane's passion for learning
rubbed off on his teammates.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.056
SB: We were playing Kevin Durant one time

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.936
and I said, "Hey LeBron, do me a favor.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.256
When Kevin Durant catches it
in the post on the left block,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.816
make him shoot the ball
over his left shoulder."

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.698
So LeBron's like, "OK, I will. I will."

00:09:55.722 --> 00:09:58.656
LeBron made Kevin Durant
go over his left shoulder

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.480
and he missed all three shots.
