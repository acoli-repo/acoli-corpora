00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.056
AG: All kinds of emotions
can be contagious.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.656
That can shape the team's culture
and even affect performance.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.656
SB: Contagion is positive, it's negative

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.056
and the way it operates is that first,
there's behavioral mimicry,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.416
and all that means
is that we literally mimic

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.536
the nonverbal and the facial
expressions of the people around us.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.776
It has to do with attention.
It's who we're looking at.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.920
AG: And who we're looking at
most often on a team is the leader.
