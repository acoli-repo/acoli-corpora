and I wasn't even reporting to her,
she was just working in my environment.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.736
I knew she was negative
but I didn't think much of it.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.120
And then one week Meg went on vacation.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.256
And it was amazing.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.416
Like suddenly the team, me, everybody --

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.496
our shoulders lowered,
we were more relaxed and happy.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.096
And then she came back

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.136
and everything went back to the way it was

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.736
and I was like, "Oh my gosh,

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.816
how amazing that this person,
who I didn't even report to

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.656
could have such a tremendous influence
on not only my mood,

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.616
but the mood of everybody else.
