00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.096
because Shane didn't score a lot of points
or grab that many rebounds,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.576
but when he was on the court,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.896
every one of his teams
was statistically more likely to win.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.976
ML: Shane had broadly two big effects.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.896
On his own teammates,
he made everybody more efficient.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.616
When he was on the court,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.216
the shot the team took
tended to be a better shot

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.336
than it was when he wasn't on the court.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.456
And on the defensive end,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.856
he made the other team
slightly less efficient.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.376
