to help you find leads for a new job.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.016
SA: For many people
that can trigger this little moment of,

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.376
"Hey! That's really amazing."

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.840
And even though
it's a small little gesture,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.856
it can still be really moving.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.536
A lot of people say that they
experience warm feelings in their chest,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.976
and so in our data, what we see

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.096
is that people who
experience moral elevation

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.160
from seeing other people's virtuous acts
actually want to be virtuous themselves.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.696
AG: There's evidence that in teams,
humility can be contagious.
