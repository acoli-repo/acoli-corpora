00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.376
SB: I tried to make my coaches sweat

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.816
every single second
that I was off the court,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.840
saying, "How are we going to win
this game with Shane on the bench?

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.120
And "I need to find a way
to play him more."

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.296
And you do that by doing all the things

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.856
that no one else wants to do.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.896
For me, that was the exciting plays
like diving for loose balls,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.656
taking charges, running back on defense,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.536
being the most enthusiastic,
being the most communicative,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.656
being a great teammate.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.976
Really the things that just take
awareness and energy,
