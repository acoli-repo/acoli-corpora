00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.216
AG: Shane was the National Basketball
Player of the Year in high school

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.656
and again in college.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.200
He was so good that he
was drafted into the NBA.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.336
But when he got to the pros,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.376
he quickly discovered
that it was a whole new league.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.560
Everyone around him was way more talented.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.520
At that level, he didn't have
the raw physical ability to be a star.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.656
He heard coaches
and players dismissing him.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.376
SB: And people looked at my limitations
and said, "Well Battier's not athletic

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.496
and he doesn't run pick-and-roll
and he can't really dribble.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.536
AG: We've all been in that position,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.799
where our teammates
have more talent than we do.
