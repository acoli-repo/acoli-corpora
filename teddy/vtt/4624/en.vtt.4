00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.176
The evidence is pretty clear:

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.736
no matter where you work,
having an entire team of superstars

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.479
can be a total disaster.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.776
It turns out that if you have
a team of 10 people,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.000
you're better off
with six stars than eight.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.976
You see it on Wall Street.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.536
Teams with mostly top analysts
make worse financial recommendations

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.736
than teams that have a mix
of stars and average performers.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.576
Same is true in soccer.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.856
National teams with too many top players

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.216
are less likely to win World Cup
qualifying matches.
