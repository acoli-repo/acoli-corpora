00:07:58.385 --> 00:08:01.821
And whole plantations
of carbon-capture machines.

00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:05.076
Perhaps an industry
twice or four times the size

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.281
of today's oil and gas business

00:08:07.305 --> 00:08:11.582
to undo the damage that was done
by those businesses in past decades.

00:08:12.202 --> 00:08:14.884
We would need a new kind
of infrastructure,

00:08:14.908 --> 00:08:17.040
poured by a different kind of cement,

00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:18.982
because today, if cement were a country,

00:08:19.006 --> 00:08:21.609
it would be the world's
third biggest emitter.

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:24.879

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:30.975
We would need to build seawalls and levees
