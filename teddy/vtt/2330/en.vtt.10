00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:02.246
and the political obstacles
are in fact enormous.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.271
But it is a simple fact --

00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:06.629
the main driver of global warming
is human action:

00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:08.704
How much carbon
we put into the atmosphere.

00:05:08.728 --> 00:05:10.728
Our hands are on those levers.

00:05:11.046 --> 00:05:15.543
And we can write the story
of the planet's climate future ourselves.

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:18.667
Not just can -- but are.

00:05:18.691 --> 00:05:21.714
Since inaction is a kind of action,

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:25.548
we'll be writing that story ourselves
whether we like it or not.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.468
This is not just any story,

00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:33.061
all of us holding the future
of the planet in our hands.
