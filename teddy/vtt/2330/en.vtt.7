00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.624
in the entire history of humanity

00:03:31.648 --> 00:03:35.101
have been produced
in just the last 30 years.

00:03:35.942 --> 00:03:39.164
That's since Al Gore published
his first book on warming.

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:42.997
It's since the UN established
its IPCC climate change body.

00:03:43.363 --> 00:03:46.101
We've done more damage since then

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:49.648
than in all the centuries,
all the millennia before.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.331
Now I'm 37 years old,

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:55.402
which means my life contains
this entire story.

00:03:55.863 --> 00:04:00.180
When I was born,
the planet's climate seemed stable.
