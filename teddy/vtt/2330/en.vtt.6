00:02:57.434 --> 00:03:00.371
can endure these new conditions

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:01.545
and what can't.

00:03:02.947 --> 00:03:05.034
And things will get worse from here.

00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:07.860
Now for a very long time,

00:03:07.884 --> 00:03:10.978
we were told that climate change
was a slow saga.

00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:13.720
It started with the industrial revolution,

00:03:13.744 --> 00:03:15.315
and it had fallen to us

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:17.450
to clean up the mess
left by our grandparents

00:03:17.474 --> 00:03:20.196
so our grandchildren
wouldn't be dealing with the results.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.087
It was a story of centuries.

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:25.943
In fact, half of all of the emissions

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:29.165
that have ever been produced
from the burning of fossil fuels

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.624
in the entire history of humanity
