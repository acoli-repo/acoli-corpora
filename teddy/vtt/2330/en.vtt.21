00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.307
And even if we take dramatic action

00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:34.696
and avoid some of these
truly terrifying worst-case scenarios,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.565
it would mean living
on an entirely different planet.

00:10:39.193 --> 00:10:42.162
With a new politics, a new economics,

00:10:42.186 --> 00:10:44.376
a new relationship to technology

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.709
and a new relationship to nature --

00:10:46.733 --> 00:10:49.462
a whole new world.

00:10:50.336 --> 00:10:52.270
But a relatively livable one.

00:10:53.074 --> 00:10:54.860
Relatively prosperous.

00:10:55.987 --> 00:10:57.137
And green.

00:10:58.392 --> 00:11:00.587
Why not choose that one?
