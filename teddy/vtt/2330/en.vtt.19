00:09:28.927 --> 00:09:30.855
our culture, our economics,

00:09:30.879 --> 00:09:32.315
our status quo bias,

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:35.767
our disinterest in taking seriously
anything that really scares us.

00:09:36.149 --> 00:09:37.549
Our shortsightedness.

00:09:37.855 --> 00:09:39.655
Our sense of self-interest.

00:09:39.974 --> 00:09:43.323
And the selfishness
of the world's rich and powerful

00:09:43.347 --> 00:09:45.947
who have the least incentive
to change anything.

00:09:46.717 --> 00:09:48.590
Now, they will suffer too,

00:09:49.392 --> 00:09:52.153
but not as much as those with the least,

00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:54.907
who have done the least 
to produce warming

00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:56.586
and have benefited the least

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.760
from the processes that have brought us
to this crisis point

00:09:59.784 --> 00:10:02.282
but will be burdened most
in the decades ahead.
