00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:31.504
with renewable energy
whose costs are falling so rapidly.

00:06:32.402 --> 00:06:34.291
We'd need a new kind of plane,

00:06:34.315 --> 00:06:36.957
because I don't think
it's particularly practical

00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:39.290
to ask the entire world
to give up on air travel,

00:06:39.314 --> 00:06:41.274
especially as so much of the global South

00:06:41.298 --> 00:06:43.486
is, for the very first time,
able to afford it.

00:06:44.558 --> 00:06:46.828
We need planes that won't produce carbon.

00:06:46.852 --> 00:06:49.209
We need a new kind of agriculture.

00:06:49.233 --> 00:06:53.003
Because we probably can't ask people
to entirely give up on meat and go vegan,

00:06:53.027 --> 00:06:54.950
it would mean a new way of raising beef.

00:06:54.974 --> 00:06:56.767
Or perhaps an old way,

00:06:56.791 --> 00:07:00.077
since we already know
that traditional pasturing practices
