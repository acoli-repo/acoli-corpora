But they are also, I think, exhilarating.

00:04:35.268 --> 00:04:37.760
Because they are ultimately a reflection

00:04:37.784 --> 00:04:41.243
of how much power we have
over the climate.

00:04:41.807 --> 00:04:44.260
If we get to those hellish scenarios,

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.871
it will be because
we have made them happen,

00:04:46.895 --> 00:04:49.828
because we have chosen
to make them happen.

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:55.037
Which means we can choose
to make other scenarios happen, too.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.822
Now that may seem too rosy to believe

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:02.246
and the political obstacles
are in fact enormous.
