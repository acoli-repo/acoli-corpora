00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:31.363
and modern civilization
and industrial civilization,

00:02:31.387 --> 00:02:35.871
everything we know about ourselves
as biological creatures,

00:02:35.895 --> 00:02:39.037
as social creatures,
as political creatures,

00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:41.728
all of it is the result
of climate conditions

00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:44.434
we have already left behind.

00:02:45.752 --> 00:02:50.331
It's like we've landed
on an entirely different planet,

00:02:50.355 --> 00:02:52.696
with an entirely different climate.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.332
And we now have to figure out

00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:57.410
what of the civilization
that we've brought with us

00:02:57.434 --> 00:03:00.371
can endure these new conditions
