When I was born,
the planet's climate seemed stable.

00:04:01.447 --> 00:04:03.320
Today,

00:04:03.344 --> 00:04:05.677
we are on the brink of catastrophe.

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.709
The climate crisis
is not the legacy of our ancestors.

00:04:11.387 --> 00:04:14.471
It is the work of a single generation.

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:16.759
Ours.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.699
This may all sound like bad news.

00:04:19.723 --> 00:04:21.643
Which it is, really bad news.

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:24.048
But it also contains, I think,

00:04:24.072 --> 00:04:27.405
some good news,
at least relatively speaking.

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:29.896
These impacts are terrifyingly large.
