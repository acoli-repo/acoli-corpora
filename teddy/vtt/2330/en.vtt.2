00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:00.085
I was very, very wrong.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.356
Now most people, if they were telling you
about climate change,

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.259
will tell you a story about the future.

00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:07.942
If I was doing that, I would say,

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.327
"According to the UN,
if we don't change course,

00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:11.593
by the end of the century,

00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:14.379
we're likely to get about four degrees
Celsius of warming."

00:01:14.403 --> 00:01:17.359
That would mean, some scientists believe,

00:01:17.383 --> 00:01:19.041
twice as much war,

00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:20.418
half as much food,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.101
a global GDP possibly 20 percent smaller
than it would be without climate change.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:30.283
That's an impact that's deeper
than the Great Depression,
