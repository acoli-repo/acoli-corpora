00:05:58.105 --> 00:06:00.977
It could mean if we developed
better technology,

00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:03.763
we wouldn't even need
to deploy them that broadly,

00:06:03.787 --> 00:06:07.206
because it's been estimated
that just a sliver of the Sahara desert

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.504
absorbs enough solar power
to provide all the world's energy needs.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.976
But we'd probably need
a new electric grid,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.984
one that doesn't lose
two-thirds of its power to waste heat,

00:06:17.008 --> 00:06:19.458
as is today the case in the US.

00:06:19.482 --> 00:06:22.299
We could use some more
nuclear power, perhaps,

00:06:22.323 --> 00:06:25.768
although it would have to be an entirely
different kind of nuclear power,

00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:28.434
because today's technology
simply isn't cost-competitive

00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:31.504
with renewable energy
whose costs are falling so rapidly.
