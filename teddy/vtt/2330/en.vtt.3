00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:30.283
That's an impact that's deeper
than the Great Depression,

00:01:30.307 --> 00:01:32.041
and it would be permanent.

00:01:32.537 --> 00:01:36.308
But the impacts are actually happening
a lot faster than 2100.

00:01:36.332 --> 00:01:38.301
By just 2050, it's estimated,

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:41.761
many of the biggest cities
in South Asia and the Middle East

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:45.340
will be almost literally
unlivably hot in summer.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.410
These are cities that today are
home to 10, 12, 15 million people.

00:01:52.887 --> 00:01:55.110
And in just three decades,

00:01:55.134 --> 00:01:57.532
you wouldn't be able
to walk around outside in them

00:01:57.556 --> 00:02:00.531
without risking heatstroke
or possibly death.
