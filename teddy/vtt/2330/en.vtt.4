That may not sound like a lot,

00:02:08.775 --> 00:02:12.695
but it actually puts us entirely
outside the window of temperatures

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.431

00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:26.276
the development of agriculture,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.332
the development
of rudimentary civilization

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:31.363
and modern civilization
and industrial civilization,
