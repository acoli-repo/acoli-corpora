00:06:56.791 --> 00:07:00.077
since we already know
that traditional pasturing practices

00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:01.986
can turn cattle farms

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.157
from what are called carbon sources,
which produce CO2,

00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:07.243
into carbon sinks, which absorb them.

00:07:07.658 --> 00:07:09.190
If you prefer a techno solution,

00:07:09.214 --> 00:07:11.737
maybe we can grow
some of that mean in the lab.

00:07:11.761 --> 00:07:14.349
Probably, we could also feed
some real cattle seaweed,

00:07:14.373 --> 00:07:18.563
because that cuts their methane emissions
by as much as 95 or 99 percent.

00:07:19.841 --> 00:07:22.020
Probably, we'd have to do
all of these things,

00:07:22.044 --> 00:07:24.777
because as with every aspect
of this puzzle,

00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:27.793
the problem is simply
too vast and complicated

00:07:27.817 --> 00:07:30.925
to solve in any single silver-bullet way.
