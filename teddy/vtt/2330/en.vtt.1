WEBVTT

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.833
with all of modern life
a fortress against its forces.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.840
In other words,

00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:36.594
like just about everybody I knew,

00:00:36.618 --> 00:00:39.665
I lived my life complacent

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:41.150
and deluded

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.641
about the threat from global warming.

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:47.305
Which I took to be happening slowly,

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.448
happening at a distance

00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:53.940
and representing only a modest threat
to the way that I lived.

00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:56.982
In each of these ways,

00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:00.085
I was very, very wrong.
