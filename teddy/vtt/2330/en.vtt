00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.959
I'm here to talk about climate change,

00:00:02.983 --> 00:00:06.129
but I'm not really an environmentalist.

00:00:06.563 --> 00:00:09.880
In fact, I've never really
thought of myself as a nature person.

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:13.106
I have never gone camping,
never gone hiking,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.597
never even owned a pet.

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:17.299
I've lived my whole life in cities,

00:00:17.323 --> 00:00:19.022
actually just one city.

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:21.942
And while I like to take trips
to visit nature,

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.442
I always thought it was something
that was happening elsewhere,

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.815
far away,

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.833
with all of modern life
a fortress against its forces.
