00:02:27.254 --> 00:02:30.599
as something that's more
about dulling the pain of waiting,

00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:34.506
well, then you can start fiddling
around with the psychology.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.578
So if you have a progress bar
that just moves at a constant rate --

00:02:38.602 --> 00:02:41.578
let's say, that's really
what's happening in the computer --

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:44.859
that will feel to people
like it's slowing down.

00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:46.954
We get bored.

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.109
Well, now you can start
trying to enhance it

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:52.895
and make it appear to move
more quickly than it really is,

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.626
make it move faster at the beginning,
like a burst of speed.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.994
That's exciting, people feel like,
"Oh! Something's really happening!"
