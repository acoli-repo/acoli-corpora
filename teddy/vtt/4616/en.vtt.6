00:03:00.018 --> 00:03:04.047
Then you can move back into a more
naturalistic growth of the progress bar

00:03:04.071 --> 00:03:05.382
as you go along.

00:03:05.406 --> 00:03:08.600
You're assuming that people are focusing
on the passage of time --

00:03:08.624 --> 00:03:10.327
they're trying to watch grass grow,

00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:13.331
they're trying to watch a pot of water,
waiting for it to boil,

00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:15.747
and you're just trying
to make that less boring,

00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:17.997
less painful and less frustrating

00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:19.347
than it was before.

00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:22.372
So the progress bar at least gives you

00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:24.857
the vision of a beginning and an end,

00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:26.575
and you're working towards a goal.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.552
I think in some ways,
it mitigates the fear of death.
