Like, when you see that progress bar,

00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:04.833
it sort of locks your attention
in a tractor beam,

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:06.873

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:15.852

00:02:21.853 --> 00:02:23.991
[Progress...]

00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:27.230
But once you start thinking
about the progress bar

00:02:27.254 --> 00:02:30.599
as something that's more
about dulling the pain of waiting,
