How many people are bored at their desk

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:04.019
for how many hours every day

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:06.393
and how many days a week
and how many weeks a year

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:07.995
for how many years in their life?

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.604
[Small thing. Big idea.]

the Progress Bar]

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:24.111
The classic one that's been used
for years is a horizontal bar.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:27.976
I mean, this goes back
to pre-computer versions of this

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.314
on ledgers, where people would fill in
a horizontal bar from left to right
