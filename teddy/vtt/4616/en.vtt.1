00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.314
on ledgers, where people would fill in
a horizontal bar from left to right

00:00:32.338 --> 00:00:35.954
to show how much of a task
they had completed at a factory.

00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:38.154
This is just the same thing on a screen.

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:39.985
Something happened in the 70s

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.773
that is sometimes referred
to as "the software crisis,"

00:00:42.797 --> 00:00:45.705
where suddenly, computers
were getting more complicated

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.007
more quickly than anyone
had been prepared for,

00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:50.817
from a design perspective.

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:55.150
People were using percent-done
indicators in different ways.

00:00:55.174 --> 00:00:57.819
So you might have a graphical
countdown clock,

00:00:57.843 --> 00:01:00.638
or they would have a line of asterisks
