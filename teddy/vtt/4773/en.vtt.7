And methods like cupping your hands
over your mouth,

00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:36.102
or licking and smelling your wrist
don't work perfectly either.

00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:38.736
One study showed 
that even when people do this,

00:03:38.736 --> 00:03:41.212
they tend to rate the smell subjectively

00:03:41.212 --> 00:03:44.772
according to how bad 
they thought it was going to be.

00:03:44.772 --> 00:03:47.791
But there's one simple,
if socially difficult,

00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:50.551
way of finding out how your breath smells:

00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:54.282
just take a deep breath and ask a friend.
