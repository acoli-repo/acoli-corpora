00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:31.682
For example, they'll break proteins 
into their component amino acids

00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:35.804
and then break those down even further
into various compounds.

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:38.879
Some of the foul-smelling 
byproducts of these reactions,

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:42.190
such as hydrogen sulfide and cadaverine,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.954
escape into the air

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:47.565
and waft their way 
towards unsuspecting noses.

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:52.253
Our sensitivity to these odors
and interpretation of them as bad smells

00:01:52.253 --> 00:01:56.876
may be an evolutionary mechanism
warning us of rotten food

00:01:56.876 --> 00:01:58.809
and the presence of disease.

00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:02.020
Smell is one of our most intimate
and primal senses,
