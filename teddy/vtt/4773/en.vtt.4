Smell is one of our most intimate
and primal senses,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.485
playing a huge role 
in our attraction to potential mates.

00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:10.693
In one poll, 59% of men and 70% of women

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:14.710
said they wouldn't go on a date 
with someone who has bad breath,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.898
which may be why Americans alone

00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:21.816
spend $1 billion a year 
on various breath products.

00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:25.062
Fortunately, most bad breath 
is easily treated.

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:29.301
The worst smelling byproducts come from
gram-negative bacteria

00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:32.190
that live in the spaces 
between gums and teeth
