This horrible scourge is halitosis,
otherwise known as bad breath.

00:00:31.828 --> 00:00:36.165
But what causes it,
and why is it so universally terrifying?

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:39.281
Well, think of some of the worst
odors you can imagine,

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:43.621
like garbage, feces or rotting meat.

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:48.312
All of these smells come from the activity
of microorganisms,

00:00:48.312 --> 00:00:50.211
particularly bacteria,

00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:52.487
and, as disgusting as it may sound,

00:00:52.487 --> 00:00:58.789
similar bacteria live in the moisture-rich
environment of your mouth.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.234
Don't panic.
