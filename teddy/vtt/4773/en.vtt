00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:12.713
There is a curse that has plagued humanity
since ancient times.

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:16.080
The Greeks fought it by chewing
aromatic resins,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.331
while the Chinese resorted to egg shells.

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:21.385
In the ancient Jewish Talmud,

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:25.465
it's even considered 
legal grounds for divorce.

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:31.828
This horrible scourge is halitosis,
otherwise known as bad breath.
