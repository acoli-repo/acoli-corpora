Don't panic.

00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:03.386
The presence of bacteria in your body
is not only normal,

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:05.920
it's actually vital 
for all sorts of things,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.778
like digestion and disease prevention.

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:12.751
But like all living things,
bacteria need to eat.

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.882
The bacteria in your mouth 
feed off of mucus,

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:17.322
food remnants,

00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:19.694
and dead tissue cells.

00:01:19.694 --> 00:01:22.817
In order to absorb nutrients
through their cell membranes,

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:26.834
they must break down the organic matter
into much smaller molecules.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:31.682
For example, they'll break proteins 
into their component amino acids
