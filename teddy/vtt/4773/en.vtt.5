between gums and teeth

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.219
and on the back of the tongue.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.238
By brushing and flossing our teeth,

00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:39.137
using antibacterial mouthwash at bedtime,

00:02:39.137 --> 00:02:42.577
gently cleaning the back of the tongue
with a plastic scraper

00:02:42.577 --> 00:02:45.685
and even just eating a healthy breakfast,

00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:49.832
we can remove many of these bacteria
and their food sources.

00:02:49.832 --> 00:02:53.017
In some cases, 
these measures may not be enough

00:02:53.017 --> 00:02:57.197
due to dental problems, 
nasal conditions, or rarer ailments,

00:02:57.197 --> 00:03:00.987
such as liver disease 
and uncontrolled diabetes.
