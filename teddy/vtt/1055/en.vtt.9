00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and we're just doing these little labors?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So I created this drawing tool.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And I said, "I'll pay you two cents for your contribution."

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And I started collecting sheep.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And I collected a lot, a lot of different sheep.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Lots of sheep.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I took the first 10,000 sheep that I collected,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
where you can actually buy collections of 20 sheep.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
You can't pick individual sheep,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And juxtaposed against this grid,
