If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and where they were located.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And if you find one that you're interested in,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
you can actually click on it and open up an information panel

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
where you're able to rate that frame,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
which helps it bubble up to the top.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And you can also see the way that it was drawn.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Again, you can get the playback and personal contribution.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
In addition to that, it's listed, the artist's name, the location,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
how long they spent drawing it.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And you can pick a style. So this one was tagged "Abstract."

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
But there's a bunch of different styles.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And you can sort the video a number of different ways.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
You can say, "I want to see the pointillist version

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
or the sketchy version or the realistic version.
