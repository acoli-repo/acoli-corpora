00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So I'm going to show you a few of the projects

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that I've been working on over the last couple years

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that reflect on our lives and our systems.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is a project called Flight Patterns.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What you're looking at is airplane traffic

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
over North America for a 24-hour period.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
As you see, everything starts to fade to black,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and you see people going to sleep.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Followed by that, you see on the West coast

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
planes moving across, the red-eye flights to the East coast.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And you'll see everybody waking up on the East coast,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
followed by European flights coming in the upper right-hand corner.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Everybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You see San Francisco and Los Angeles
