00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I think data can actually make us more human.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Recently, a wise media theorist Tweeted,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
"The 19th century culture was defined by the novel,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the 20th century culture was defined by the cinema,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and the culture of the 21st century

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
will be defined by the interface."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I believe this is going to prove true.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Our lives are being driven by data,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the presentation of that data is an opportunity

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So I'm going to show you a few of the projects

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that I've been working on over the last couple years
