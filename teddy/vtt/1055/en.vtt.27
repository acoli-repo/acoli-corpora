AK: What better way to pay tribute to the man

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
than to make something for one of his songs.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Collaborator: I felt really sad when he died.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And I just thought it'd be wonderful,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
it'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Collaborator Two: It really allows

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
it's got a very powerful feeling to it.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Collaborator Four: I've seen everybody
