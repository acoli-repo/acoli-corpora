00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And you can see, over time, the ways the airports change.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You see the holding patterns that start to develop

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in the bottom of the screen.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And you can see, eventually the airport actually flips directions.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This is visualizing international communications.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So it's how New York communicates

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
with other international cities.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
for the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And it had a live feed with a 24-hour offset,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
so you could see the changing relationship

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and some demographic info

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
coming through AT&amp;T's data and revealing itself.
