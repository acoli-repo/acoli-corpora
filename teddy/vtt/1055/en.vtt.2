00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You see San Francisco and Los Angeles

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left-hand corner.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I think it's one thing to say there's 140,000 planes

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
being monitored by the federal government at any one time,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This is a time-lapse image of that exact same data,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but I've color-coded it by type,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And I started making these, and I put them into Google Maps

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and allow you to zoom in and see individual airports

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and the patterns that are occurring there.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So here we can see the white represents low altitudes,
