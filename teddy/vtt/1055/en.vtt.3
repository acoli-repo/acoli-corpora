00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So here we can see the white represents low altitudes,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and the blue are higher altitudes.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And you can zoom in. This is taking a look at Atlanta.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You can see this is a major shipping airport,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and there's all kinds of activity there.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You can also toggle between altitude

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
for model and manufacturer.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
See again, the diversity.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And you can scroll around and see

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This is scrolling up the East coast.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You can see some of the chaos that's happening in New York

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
with the air traffic controllers

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
having to deal with all those major airports next to each other.
