WEBVTT

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
called the Mechanical Turk -- named after this guy.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And it's based on the premise that there are certain things

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that are easy for people, but really difficult for computers.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So they made this web service and said,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
"Any programmer can write a piece of software

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and tap into the minds of thousands of people."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The nerdy side of me thought, "Wow, this is amazing.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I can tap into thousands of people's minds."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And the other nerdy side of me thought,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
"This is horrible. This is completely bizarre.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
What does this mean for the future of mankind,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
where we're all plugged into this borg?"

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I was probably being a little extreme.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and we're just doing these little labors?
