00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
you see this one guy writing, "$0.01!!! Really?"

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
That's all I'm getting paid for this?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
(Laughter)

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
So the last Mechanical Turk project I'm going to talk to you about

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
is called Bicycle Built for 2000.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
You may recognize these two guys.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
This is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the '60s,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
where they created the song "Daisy Bell,"

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
which was the world's first singing computer.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
You may recognize it from "2001: A Space Odyssey."

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
When HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
as a reference to when computers became human.
