00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Which I was pretty surprised by.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I expected people to be wondering, "Why did I draw a sheep?"

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And I think it's a pretty valid question.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Sheep were the first animal

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
the first to be selectively bred for production traits,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
the first animal to be cloned.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Obviously, we think of sheep as followers.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And there's this reference to "Le Petit Prince"

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
He draws sheep after sheep.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The narrator's only appeased when he draws a box.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And he says, "It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It's about your own interpretation and doing something different."
