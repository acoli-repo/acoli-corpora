00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
having to deal with all those major airports next to each other.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So zooming back out real quick,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
we see, again, the U.S. -- you get Florida down in the right-hand corner.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Moving across to the West coast,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
you see San Francisco and Los Angeles --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
big low-traffic zones

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
across Nevada and Arizona.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I started taking a look as well at different perimeters,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This is looking at ascending versus descending flights.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And you can see, over time, the ways the airports change.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You see the holding patterns that start to develop
