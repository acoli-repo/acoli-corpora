00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
coming through AT&amp;T's data and revealing itself.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and CurrentCity.org.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So you're seeing the daily ebb and flow

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
until we approach New Year's Eve, where everybody says, "Happy New Year!"

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
(Laughter)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So this is an interactive tool

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that you can move around and see different parts of the city.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This is looking at another event. This is called Queen's Day.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So again, you get this daily ebb and flow

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city
