00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
to celebrate the night before,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
which happens right here.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And then you can see people celebrating the next day.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So now on to something completely different.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Some of you may recognize this.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
except for one thing: it's not a robot at all.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
There's actually a legless man that sits in that box

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and controls this chess player.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
This was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
called the Mechanical Turk -- named after this guy.
