beyond the four-by-three or sixteen-by-nine window

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
But most importantly, I think,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
to contribute something for everyone.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
What if we had a very low commitment,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
of the home where you grew up.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And you type in the address --

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
it actually creates a music video specifically for you,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
pulling in Google maps and Streetview images
