It's about your own interpretation and doing something different."

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And I like that.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times."

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
It's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
during the Industrial Revolution.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So there were no longer shoe makers,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
but now there are people slapping soles on people's shoes.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So I thought this was an interesting clip

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
to divide into 16 pieces

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
This basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and on the right side you see that frame

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
as interpreted by 16 people
