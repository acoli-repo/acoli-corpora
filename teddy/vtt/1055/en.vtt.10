00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And juxtaposed against this grid,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
you see actually, by rolling over each individual one,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I think there's something really interesting

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
to watching people as they go through this creative toil --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
something we can all relate to,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
versus this massive distributed grid.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Kind of amazing what some people did.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So here's a few statistics from the project.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
which would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour.
