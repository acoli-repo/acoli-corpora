00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
as interpreted by 16 people

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
who have no idea what it is they're doing.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And this was the inspiration for a project

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
which is making money.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
We asked people to draw what it was that they saw.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
But here there was no sheep-like criteria.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
People, if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
it actually made it into the bill.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
what it was they were asked to do.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
So we took these hundred dollar bills,
