00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
when I was at UCLA going to grad school,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I was also working at a place called the Center for Embedded Network Sensing.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So basically motion through 3D space.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
who said, "Wait a minute.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video?"

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So we did exactly that.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
We made a music video for one of my favorite bands, Radiohead.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
was not just shooting a video with lasers,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
but we also open sourced it,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and we made it released as a Google Code project,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to build their own versions of it.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And people were making some amazing things.
