00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
as a reference to when computers became human.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So we resynthesized this song.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This is what that sounded like.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
We broke down all the individual notes

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Daisy Bell: ♫ Daisy, Daisy ... ♫

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Aaron Koblin: And we took all of those individual pieces,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and we fed them into another Turk request.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
This is what it would look like if you went to the site.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
You type in your code,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
but you first test your mic.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
You'd be fed a simple audio clip.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
(Honk)

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice.
