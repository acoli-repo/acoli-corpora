00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to build their own versions of it.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And people were making some amazing things.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
This is actually two of my favorites:

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
the pin-board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
More recently, somebody even 3D-printed Thom Yorke's head,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
which is a little creepy, but pretty cool.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So with everybody making so much amazing stuff

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and actually understanding what it was they were working on,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
where people were working together to build something.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And I met a music video director named Chris Milk.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And we started bouncing around ideas

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
to make a collaborative music video project.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
But we knew we really needed the right person
