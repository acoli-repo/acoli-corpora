00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and a lot of light and dark comes into it.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And in a weird way,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
that's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
It's the sum total of his life,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
all the things that had happened --

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
the bad things, the good things.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
You're hearing a person's life.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
AK: So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
what you'll see is the video playing above.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And below it are all the individual frames

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
that people have been submitting to the project.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So this isn't finished at all,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail
