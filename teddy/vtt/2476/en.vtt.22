maybe even figuring out the methods
to preserve them at low temperatures,

00:11:01.617 --> 00:11:04.733
so that we can preserve
their genetic diversity

00:11:04.757 --> 00:11:06.639
and work with them more often.

00:11:06.984 --> 00:11:09.857
But this is still so low-tech.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:15.275
We are limited by the space on our bench,
the number of hands in the lab

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:19.469
and the number of coffees
we can drink in any given hour.

00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:22.598
Now, compare that to our other crises

00:11:22.622 --> 00:11:25.835
and our other areas
of concern as a society.

00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:29.917
We have advanced medical technology,
we have defense technology,

00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:31.538
we have scientific technology,
