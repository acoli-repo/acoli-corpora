00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:31.285
And on the eastern end of the island,

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.253
where the reefs are intact and thriving,

00:02:33.277 --> 00:02:36.236
you could barely tell
a tropical storm had passed.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.585
But in town, where corals had died
from overfishing, from pollution,

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.712
the tropical storm picked up
the dead corals

00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:46.678
and used them as bludgeons
to kill the corals that were left.

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:49.678
This is a coral that I studied
during my PhD --

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.271
I got to know it quite well.

00:02:51.295 --> 00:02:54.374
And after this storm
took off half of its tissue,

00:02:54.398 --> 00:02:56.067
it became infested with algae,

00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:58.846
the algae overgrew the tissue
and that coral died.

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:03.378
This magnification of threats,
this compounding of factors
