00:03:56.838 --> 00:04:00.507
when it's an abstract thing
they can barely understand?

00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:04.443
If they don't understand
what a coral is or where it comes from,

00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:07.134
or how funny or interesting
or beautiful it is,

00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:09.797
why would we expect them
to care about saving them?

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.828
So let's change that.

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:14.393
What is a coral
and where does it come from?

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:17.455
Corals are born
in a number of different ways,

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.702
but most often by mass spawning:
all of the individuals of a single species

00:04:21.726 --> 00:04:23.062
on one night a year,

00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:25.799
releasing all the eggs
they've made that year

00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:27.017
into the water column,

00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.485
packaged into bundles with sperm cells.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.985
And those bundles go to the surface
of the ocean and break apart.
