00:10:26.492 --> 00:10:31.236
So this is the first pillar coral baby
that anyone ever saw.

00:10:31.786 --> 00:10:37.206
(Applause)

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.404
And I have to say --
if you think baby pandas are cute,

00:10:40.428 --> 00:10:41.666
this is cuter.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.673
(Laughter)

00:10:44.236 --> 00:10:47.360
So we're starting to figure out
the secrets to this process,

00:10:47.384 --> 00:10:50.732
the secrets of coral reproduction
and how we might help them.

00:10:51.089 --> 00:10:52.937
And this is true all around the world;

00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:55.853
scientists are figuring out new ways
to handle their embryos,

00:10:55.877 --> 00:10:57.035
to get them to settle,

00:10:57.059 --> 00:11:01.593
maybe even figuring out the methods
to preserve them at low temperatures,
