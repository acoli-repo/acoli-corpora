00:12:58.545 --> 00:13:03.972
Coral reefs are hardworking animals
and plants and microbes and fungi.

00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:07.616
They're providing us with art
and food and medicine.

00:13:08.012 --> 00:13:11.588
And we almost took out
an entire generation of corals.

00:13:11.975 --> 00:13:16.016
But a few made it anyway,
despite our best efforts,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.172
and now it's time for us to thank them
for the work they did

00:13:19.196 --> 00:13:24.021
and give them every chance they have
to raise the coral reefs of the future,

00:13:24.045 --> 00:13:25.533
their coral babies.

00:13:25.557 --> 00:13:26.752
Thank you so much.

00:13:26.776 --> 00:13:32.971
