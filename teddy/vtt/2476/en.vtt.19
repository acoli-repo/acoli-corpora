00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:30.477
scientists had never found
a baby pillar coral.

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:33.217
We weren't even sure
if they could still reproduce,

00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.240
or if they were still reproducing.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.429
So four years ago, we started
following these at night

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:42.742
and watching to see if we could
figure out when they spawn in Curaçao.

00:09:43.992 --> 00:09:46.680
We got some good tips
from our colleagues in Florida,

00:09:46.704 --> 00:09:50.762
who had seen one in 2007, one in 2008,

00:09:50.786 --> 00:09:53.459
and eventually we figured out
when they spawn in Curaçao

00:09:53.483 --> 00:09:54.842
and we caught it.

00:09:54.866 --> 00:09:57.564
Here's a female on the left
with some eggs in her tissue,

00:09:57.588 --> 00:09:59.508
about to release them into the seawater.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:02.169
And here's a male
on the right, releasing sperm.
