00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.253
you were fully understood or appreciated?

00:00:33.113 --> 00:00:35.369
The people in our communities
who do these jobs

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:39.026
deserve our attention, our love
and our deepest support.

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:41.860
But people aren't the only ones
in our communities

00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:43.686
who do these difficult jobs.

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:46.876
These jobs are also done
by the plants, the animals

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.332
and the ecosystems on our planet,

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:52.845
including the ecosystems I study:
the tropical coral reefs.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.602
Coral reefs are farmers.

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:58.836
They provide food, income
and food security

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.423
for hundreds of millions
of people around the world.
