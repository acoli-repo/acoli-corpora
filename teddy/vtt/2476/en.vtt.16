00:07:57.799 --> 00:08:00.978
that pink, that white, those crevices,
those hard surfaces --

00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:02.745
in our conservation projects.

00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:04.230
We can also use that knowledge

00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:07.793
if we're going to put something
underwater, like a sea wall or a pier.

00:08:07.817 --> 00:08:10.857
We can choose to use the materials
and colors and textures

00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:14.712
that might bias the system
back toward those corals.

00:08:15.487 --> 00:08:17.464
Now in addition to the surfaces,

00:08:17.488 --> 00:08:19.985
we also study the chemical
and microbial signals

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:22.037
that attract corals to reefs.

00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:24.961
Starting about six years ago,
I began culturing bacteria

00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:27.077
from surfaces where corals had settled.

00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:29.934
And I tried those one by one by one,

00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.724
looking for the bacteria that would
convince corals to settle and attach.
