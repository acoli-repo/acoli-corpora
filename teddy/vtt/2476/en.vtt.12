Now, there are only a few hundred species
of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000.

00:06:04.435 --> 00:06:09.169
But these systems house millions
and millions of other species,

00:06:09.193 --> 00:06:11.677
and that diversity is what
stabilizes the systems,

00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:13.915
and it's where we're finding
our new medicines.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.008
It's how we find new sources of food.

00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:20.182
I'm lucky enough to work
on the island of Curaçao,

00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:22.462
where we still have reefs
that look like this.

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:26.797
But, indeed, much of the Caribbean
and much of our world

00:06:26.821 --> 00:06:28.687
is much more like this.

00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:31.734
