00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.724
looking for the bacteria that would
convince corals to settle and attach.

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:37.898
And we now have many
bacterial strains in our freezer

00:08:37.922 --> 00:08:39.431
that will reliably cause corals

00:08:39.455 --> 00:08:42.424
to go through that settlement
and attachment process.

00:08:42.448 --> 00:08:43.647
So as we speak,

00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:46.091
my colleagues in Curaçao
are testing those bacteria

00:08:46.115 --> 00:08:49.439
to see if they'll help us raise
more coral settlers in the lab,

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:52.050
and to see if those coral settlers
will survive better

00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:53.883
when we put them back underwater.

00:08:54.304 --> 00:08:57.529
Now in addition to these tools,
we also try to uncover the mysteries

00:08:57.553 --> 00:09:00.006
of species that are under-studied.
