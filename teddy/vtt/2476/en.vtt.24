00:11:56.784 --> 00:12:00.809
I've been trying to help corals
become parents for over 10 years now.

00:12:01.563 --> 00:12:03.733
And watching the wonder of life

00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:07.784
has certainly filled me with amazement
to the core of my soul.

00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:11.290
But I've also seen how difficult
it is for them to become parents.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.630
The pillar corals spawned
again two weeks ago,

00:12:14.654 --> 00:12:17.543
and we collected their eggs
and brought them back to the lab.

00:12:17.567 --> 00:12:19.625
And here you see one embryo dividing,

00:12:19.649 --> 00:12:22.523
alongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize

00:12:22.547 --> 00:12:24.207
and will blow up.

00:12:24.532 --> 00:12:27.267
They'll be infected with bacteria,
they will explode

00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:31.033
and those bacteria will threaten
the life of this one embryo
