00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:30.339
that phrase drives me nuts.

00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:34.054
Whether I see it in a tweet,
in a news headline

00:03:34.078 --> 00:03:37.665
or the glossy pages
of a conservation brochure,

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.512
that phrase bothers me,

00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:42.464
because we as conservationists
have been sounding the alarms

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.892
about the death
of coral reefs for decades.

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:48.976
And yet, almost everyone I meet,
no matter how educated,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.823
is not sure what a coral is
or where they come from.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.814
How would we get someone to care
about the world's coral reefs

00:03:56.838 --> 00:04:00.507
when it's an abstract thing
they can barely understand?
