00:06:59.193 --> 00:07:02.468
And we're starting to think
that baby corals may have the ability

00:07:02.492 --> 00:07:06.095
to adjust to some of the conditions
that the adults couldn't.

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:08.135
They may be able to adjust

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:12.041
ever so slightly more readily
to this human planet.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.933
So in the research I do
with my colleagues in Curaçao,

00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:19.470
we try to figure out
what a baby coral needs

00:07:19.494 --> 00:07:21.018
in that critical early stage,

00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:22.209
what it's looking for

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.773
and how we can try to help it
through that process.

00:07:24.797 --> 00:07:27.638
I'm going to show you three examples
of the work we've done

00:07:27.662 --> 00:07:29.599
to try to answer those questions.
