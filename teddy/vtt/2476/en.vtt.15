A few years ago we took a 3D printer
and we made coral choice surveys --

00:07:35.374 --> 00:07:37.310
different colors and different textures,

00:07:37.334 --> 00:07:40.204
and we simply asked the coral
where they preferred to settle.

00:07:40.228 --> 00:07:43.213
And we found that corals,
even without the biology involved,

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:46.396
still prefer white and pink,
the colors of a healthy reef.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.555
And they prefer crevices
and grooves and holes,

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:51.603
where they will be safe
from being trampled

00:07:51.627 --> 00:07:52.943
or eaten by a predator.

00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:54.732
So we can use this knowledge,

00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:57.775
we can go back and say
we need to restore those factors --

00:07:57.799 --> 00:08:00.978
that pink, that white, those crevices,
those hard surfaces --
