Scientists have studied
in increasing detail

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.540
the loss of the world's coral reefs,

00:06:33.564 --> 00:06:37.125
and they have documented
with increasing certainty the causes.

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:40.141
But in my research, I'm not
interested in looking backward.

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:43.226
My colleagues and I in Curaçao
are interested in looking forward

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.607
at what might be.

00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:48.293
And we have the tiniest reason
to be optimistic.

00:06:48.824 --> 00:06:50.601
Because even in some of these reefs

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:54.274
that we probably could have
written off long ago,

00:06:54.298 --> 00:06:58.763
we sometimes see baby corals
arrive and survive anyway.

00:06:59.193 --> 00:07:02.468
And we're starting to think
that baby corals may have the ability
