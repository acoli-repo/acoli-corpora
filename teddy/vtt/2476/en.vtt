00:00:00.836 --> 00:00:03.124
What was the most
difficult job you ever did?

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:05.164
Was it working in the sun?

00:00:05.564 --> 00:00:08.350
Was it working to provide food
for a family or a community?

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:13.069
Was it working days and nights
trying to protect lives and property?

00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:14.852
Was it working alone

00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:18.256
or working on a project
that wasn't guaranteed to succeed,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.097
but that might improve
human health or save a life?

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:26.670
Was it working to build something,
create something, make a work of art?

00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:28.978
Was it work for which you were never sure

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.253
you were fully understood or appreciated?
