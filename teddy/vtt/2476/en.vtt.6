This magnification of threats,
this compounding of factors

00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:08.236
is what Jeremy Jackson describes
as the "slippery slope to slime."

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.252
It's hardly even a metaphor
because many of our reefs now

00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:15.840
are literally bacteria
and algae and slime.

00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:18.566
Now, this is the part of the talk

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.479
where you may expect me
to launch into my plea

00:03:21.503 --> 00:03:24.176
for us to all save the coral reefs.

00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:26.943
But I have a confession to make:

00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:30.339
that phrase drives me nuts.
