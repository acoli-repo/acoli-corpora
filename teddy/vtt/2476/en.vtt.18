00:08:57.553 --> 00:09:00.006
of species that are under-studied.

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:04.128
This is one of my favorite corals,
and always has been:

00:09:04.152 --> 00:09:06.641
dendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral.

00:09:07.073 --> 00:09:09.980
I love it because it makes
this ridiculous shape,

00:09:10.004 --> 00:09:13.147
because its tentacles
are fat and look fuzzy

00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:14.611
and because it's rare.

00:09:14.635 --> 00:09:17.109
Finding one of these on a reef is a treat.

00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:18.847
In fact, it's so rare,

00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:21.387
that last year it was listed
as a threatened species

00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:23.266
on the endangered species list.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.597
And this was in part because
in over 30 years of research surveys,

00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:30.477
scientists had never found
a baby pillar coral.
