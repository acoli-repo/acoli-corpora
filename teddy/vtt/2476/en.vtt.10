00:04:56.753 --> 00:05:00.706
At the end of all this cell division,
they turn into a swimming larva --

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.464
a little tiny blob of fat
the size of a poppy seed,

00:05:04.488 --> 00:05:07.158
but with all of the sensory
systems that we have.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:12.838
They can sense color and light,
textures, chemicals, pH.

00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:15.863
They can even feel pressure waves;
they can hear sound.

00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:17.547
And they use those talents

00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:20.404
to search the bottom of the reef
for a place to attach

00:05:20.428 --> 00:05:22.027
and live the rest of their lives.

00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:25.427
So imagine finding a place
where you would live the rest of your life

00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:27.224
when you were just two days old.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.547
They attach in the place
they find most suitable,
