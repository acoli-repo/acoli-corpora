00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:02.169
And here's a male
on the right, releasing sperm.

00:10:02.783 --> 00:10:06.467
We collected this, we got it
back to the lab, we got it to fertilize

00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:09.775
and we got baby pillar corals
swimming in our lab.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.060
Thanks to the work
of our scientific aunts and uncles,

00:10:13.084 --> 00:10:15.941
and thanks to the 10 years of practice
we've had in Curaçao

00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:18.158
at raising other coral species,

00:10:18.182 --> 00:10:22.057
we got some of those larvae
to go through the rest of the process

00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:23.733
and settle and attach,

00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:26.468
and turn into metamorphosed corals.

00:10:26.492 --> 00:10:31.236
So this is the first pillar coral baby
that anyone ever saw.
