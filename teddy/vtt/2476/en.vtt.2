00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.423
for hundreds of millions
of people around the world.

00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:04.157
Coral reefs are security guards.

00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:06.938
The structures that they build
protect our shorelines

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:08.819
from storm surge and waves,

00:01:08.843 --> 00:01:12.509
and the biological systems
that they house filter the water

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.932
and make it safer for us to work and play.

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:18.114
Coral reefs are chemists.

00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:21.907
The molecules that we're discovering
on coral reefs are increasingly important

00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:25.504
in the search for new antibiotics
and new cancer drugs.

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:27.683
And coral reefs are artists.

00:01:27.707 --> 00:01:29.202
The structures that they build

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:31.776
are some of the most
beautiful things on planet Earth.
