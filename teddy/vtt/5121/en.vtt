00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:09.778
Imagine two people are listening to music.

00:00:09.778 --> 00:00:10.615
What are the odds

00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:11.375
that they are listening

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:13.180
to the exact same playlist?

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.783
Probably pretty low.

00:00:14.783 --> 00:00:18.370
After all, everyone has very different tastes in music.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.735
Now, what are the odds

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:20.921
that your body will need

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.154
the exact same medical care and treatment

00:00:23.154 --> 00:00:24.924
as another person's body?

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.301
Even lower.

00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:27.772
As we go through our lives,

00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:29.763
each of us will have very different needs

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.806
for our own healthcare.
