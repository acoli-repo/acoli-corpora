00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.644
And so here's the video that we recorded,

00:04:02.644 --> 00:04:06.568
and we recorded it at thousands
of frames per second,

00:04:06.568 --> 00:04:08.890
but even if you look very closely,

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.841
all you'll see are some leaves

00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.906
that are pretty much
just sitting there doing nothing,

00:04:13.906 --> 00:04:18.712
because our sound only moved those leaves
by about a micrometer.

00:04:19.103 --> 00:04:23.379
That's one ten-thousandth of a centimeter,

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:27.535
which spans somewhere between
a hundredth and a thousandth

00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:29.834
of a pixel in this image.

00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:32.768
So you can squint all you want,
