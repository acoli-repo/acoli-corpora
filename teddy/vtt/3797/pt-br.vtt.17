00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:42.007
(Áudio) "Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:08:42.007 --> 00:08:47.546
and everywhere that Mary went,
that lamb was sure to go."

00:08:47.546 --> 00:08:51.173
AD: E aqui está o que conseguimos
recuperar do nosso vídeo silencioso

00:08:51.173 --> 00:08:53.858
capturado do lado de fora,
atrás da janela.

00:08:53.858 --> 00:08:58.373
(Áudio) "Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:08:58.373 --> 00:09:03.730
and everywhere that Mary went,
that lamb was sure to go."
