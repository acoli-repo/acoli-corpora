(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:05.902
(Applause)

00:05:10.058 --> 00:05:11.997
So how is this possible?

00:05:11.997 --> 00:05:16.341
How can we get so much information
out of so little motion?

00:05:16.341 --> 00:05:21.702
Well, let's say that those leaves
move by just a single micrometer,

00:05:21.702 --> 00:05:26.010
and let's say that that shifts our image
by just a thousandth of a pixel.

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:29.841
That may not seem like much,

00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:31.837
but a single frame of video
