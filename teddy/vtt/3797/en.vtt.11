00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:31.837
but a single frame of video

00:05:31.837 --> 00:05:35.094
may have hundreds of thousands
of pixels in it,

00:05:35.094 --> 00:05:38.548
and so if we combine all
of the tiny motions that we see

00:05:38.548 --> 00:05:40.846
from across that entire image,

00:05:40.846 --> 00:05:43.469
then suddenly a thousandth of a pixel

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:46.244
can start to add up
to something pretty significant.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.505
On a personal note, we were pretty psyched
when we figured this out.

00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:52.825
(Laughter)

00:05:52.825 --> 00:05:56.078
But even with the right algorithm,

00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:59.695
we were still missing
a pretty important piece of the puzzle.

00:05:59.695 --> 00:06:03.299
You see, there are a lot of factors
that affect when and how well
