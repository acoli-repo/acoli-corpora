00:13:29.928 --> 00:13:32.889
In fact, I've actually done this
with my cell phone before.

00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:35.141
But we do want to see the object vibrate,

00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:36.274
so to make that happen,

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:39.620
we're just going to bang a little bit
on the surface where it's resting

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.758
while we record this video.

00:13:47.398 --> 00:13:51.069
So that's it: just five seconds
of regular video,

00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:53.205
while we bang on this surface,

00:13:53.205 --> 00:13:56.718
and we're going to use
the vibrations in that video

00:13:56.718 --> 00:14:01.262
to learn about the structural
and material properties of our object,
