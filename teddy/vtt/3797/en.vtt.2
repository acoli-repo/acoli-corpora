00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:00.933
and if you were to hold
the infant on the right,

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.324
you would feel the rise
and fall of her chest

00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:04.714
as she took each breath.

00:01:05.762 --> 00:01:09.338
And these motions carry
a lot of significance,

00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:12.681
but they're usually
too subtle for us to see,

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.957
so instead, we have to observe them

00:01:14.957 --> 00:01:17.857
through direct contact, through touch.

00:01:18.997 --> 00:01:20.262
But a few years ago,

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:24.667
my colleagues at MIT developed
what they call a motion microscope,

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:29.051
which is software that finds
these subtle motions in video

00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:32.613
and amplifies them so that they
become large enough for us to see.
