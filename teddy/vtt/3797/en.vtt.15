00:07:28.513 --> 00:07:33.225
(Audio) Mary had a little lamb!
Little lamb! Little lamb!

00:07:33.225 --> 00:07:37.313
(Applause)

00:07:37.313 --> 00:07:39.194
AD: And this was really significant,

00:07:39.194 --> 00:07:43.313
because it was the first time
we recovered intelligible human speech

00:07:43.424 --> 00:07:45.765
from silent video of an object.

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:48.156
And so it gave us this point of reference,

00:07:48.156 --> 00:07:52.027
and gradually we could start
to modify the experiment,

00:07:52.106 --> 00:07:55.911
using different objects
or moving the object further away,

00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:58.681
using less light or quieter sounds.

00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:02.761
And we analyzed all of these experiments
