00:10:28.344 --> 00:10:31.061
there's a slight time delay
between each row,

00:10:31.061 --> 00:10:34.218
and this causes slight artifacts

00:10:34.218 --> 00:10:37.701
that get coded into each frame of a video.

00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:41.507
And so what we found
is that by analyzing these artifacts,

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:46.122
we can actually recover sound
using a modified version of our algorithm.

00:10:46.122 --> 00:10:48.034
So here's an experiment we did

00:10:48.034 --> 00:10:49.729
where we filmed a bag of candy

00:10:49.729 --> 00:10:51.470
while a nearby loudspeaker played

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.442
the same "Mary Had a Little Lamb"
music from before,

00:10:54.442 --> 00:10:58.645
but this time, we used just a regular
store-bought camera,

00:10:58.645 --> 00:11:01.819
and so in a second, I'll play for you
the sound that we recovered,
