00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.928
and that diaphragm is designed
to move readily with sound

00:03:00.928 --> 00:03:05.735
so that its motion can be recorded
and interpreted as audio.

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:09.403
But sound causes all objects to vibrate.

00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:14.883
Those vibrations are just usually
too subtle and too fast for us to see.

00:03:14.883 --> 00:03:18.621
So what if we record them
with a high-speed camera

00:03:18.621 --> 00:03:22.197
and then use software
to extract tiny motions

00:03:22.197 --> 00:03:24.287
from our high-speed video,

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:28.561
and analyze those motions to figure out
what sounds created them?

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.308
This would let us turn visible objects
into visual microphones from a distance.
