00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:02.761
And we analyzed all of these experiments

00:08:02.761 --> 00:08:06.383
until we really understood
the limits of our technique,

00:08:06.383 --> 00:08:08.333
because once we understood those limits,

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:10.679
we could figure out how to push them.

00:08:10.679 --> 00:08:13.860
And that led to experiments like this one,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.599
where again, I'm going to speak
to a bag of chips,

00:08:16.599 --> 00:08:21.429
but this time we've moved our camera
about 15 feet away,

00:08:21.429 --> 00:08:24.262
outside, behind a soundproof window,

00:08:24.262 --> 00:08:27.065
and the whole thing is lit
by only natural sunlight.

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:30.684
And so here's the video that we captured.
