(Applause)

00:16:01.412 --> 00:16:04.384
And so you could imagine giving this
to a film director,

00:16:04.384 --> 00:16:06.103
and letting him control, say,

00:16:06.103 --> 00:16:11.025
the strength and direction of wind
in a shot after it's been recorded.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:17.345
Or, in this case, we pointed our camera
at a hanging curtain,

00:16:17.345 --> 00:16:21.474
and you can't even see
any motion in this video,

00:16:21.474 --> 00:16:24.399
but by recording a two-minute-long video,

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:26.837
natural air currents in this room

00:16:26.837 --> 00:16:31.249
created enough subtle,
imperceptible motions and vibrations
