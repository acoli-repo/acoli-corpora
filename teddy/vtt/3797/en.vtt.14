Mary had a little lamb!
Little lamb! Little lamb!

00:07:00.836 --> 00:07:05.336
(Laughter)

00:07:05.336 --> 00:07:08.150
AD: So this experiment
looks completely ridiculous.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.938
(Laughter)

00:07:09.938 --> 00:07:12.283
I mean, I'm screaming at a bag of chips --

00:07:12.283 --> 00:07:13.834
(Laughter) --

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:15.951
and we're blasting it with so much light,

00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:20.430
we literally melted the first bag
we tried this on. (Laughter)

00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:23.799
But ridiculous as this experiment looks,

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:25.587
it was actually really important,

00:07:25.587 --> 00:07:28.513
because we were able
to recover this sound.

00:07:28.513 --> 00:07:33.225
(Audio) Mary had a little lamb!
Little lamb! Little lamb!
