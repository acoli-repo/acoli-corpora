00:15:27.722 --> 00:15:30.903
but we found that it works
in a lot of situations

00:15:30.903 --> 00:15:32.778
that you might not expect,

00:15:32.778 --> 00:15:35.546
especially if you give it longer videos.

00:15:35.546 --> 00:15:38.054
So for example,
here's a video that I captured

00:15:38.054 --> 00:15:40.353
of a bush outside of my apartment,

00:15:40.353 --> 00:15:43.441
and I didn't do anything to this bush,

00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:46.146
but by capturing a minute-long video,

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:49.524
a gentle breeze caused enough vibrations

00:15:49.524 --> 00:15:53.111
that we could learn enough about this bush
to create this simulation.
