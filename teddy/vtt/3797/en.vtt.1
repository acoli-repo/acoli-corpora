On the left here, you see video
of a person's wrist,

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.486
and on the right, you see video
of a sleeping infant,

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:40.632
but if I didn't tell you
that these were videos,

00:00:40.632 --> 00:00:44.393
you might assume that you were looking
at two regular images,

00:00:44.393 --> 00:00:46.065
because in both cases,

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:49.112
these videos appear to be
almost completely still.

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:54.060
But there's actually a lot
of subtle motion going on here,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.452
and if you were to touch
the wrist on the left,

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:58.448
you would feel a pulse,

00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:00.933
and if you were to hold
the infant on the right,
