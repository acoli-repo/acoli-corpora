And so this technology is really powerful
because it takes these phenomena

00:02:02.232 --> 00:02:04.599
that we normally have
to experience through touch

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.556
and it lets us capture them visually
and non-invasively.

00:02:09.104 --> 00:02:13.515
So a couple years ago, I started working
with the folks that created that software,

00:02:13.515 --> 00:02:16.882
and we decided to pursue a crazy idea.

00:02:16.882 --> 00:02:19.575
We thought, it's cool
that we can use software

00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:22.710
to visualize tiny motions like this,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.168
and you can almost think of it
as a way to extend our sense of touch.

00:02:27.168 --> 00:02:31.227
But what if we could do the same thing
with our ability to hear?
