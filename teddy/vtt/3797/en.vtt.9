00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:32.768
So you can squint all you want,

00:04:32.768 --> 00:04:36.103
but motion that small is pretty much
perceptually invisible.

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:41.824
But it turns out that something
can be perceptually invisible

00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:44.633
and still be numerically significant,

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:46.635
because with the right algorithms,

00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:50.322
we can take this silent,
seemingly still video

00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:51.849
and we can recover this sound.
