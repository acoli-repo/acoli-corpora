00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:01.596
Because the experiments
I've shown you so far

00:10:01.596 --> 00:10:03.918
were done with a camera,
a high-speed camera,

00:10:03.918 --> 00:10:06.797
that can record video
about a 100 times faster

00:10:06.797 --> 00:10:08.724
than most cell phones,

00:10:08.724 --> 00:10:11.533
but we've also found a way
to use this technique

00:10:11.533 --> 00:10:13.763
with more regular cameras,

00:10:13.763 --> 00:10:17.832
and we do that by taking advantage
of what's called a rolling shutter.

00:10:17.832 --> 00:10:22.630
You see, most cameras
record images one row at a time,

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:28.332
and so if an object moves
during the recording of a single image,

00:10:28.344 --> 00:10:31.061
there's a slight time delay
between each row,
