00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:32.613
and amplifies them so that they
become large enough for us to see.

00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:36.899
And so, if we use their software
on the left video,

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.149
it lets us see the pulse in this wrist,

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.844
and if we were to count that pulse,

00:01:41.844 --> 00:01:44.199
we could even figure out
this person's heart rate.

00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:48.160
And if we used the same software
on the right video,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.387
it lets us see each breath
that this infant takes,

00:01:51.387 --> 00:01:55.524
and we can use this as a contact-free way
to monitor her breathing.

00:01:56.884 --> 00:02:02.232
And so this technology is really powerful
because it takes these phenomena
