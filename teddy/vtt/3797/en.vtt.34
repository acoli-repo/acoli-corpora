00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:03.314
So here are the amazing people
who worked with me on these projects.

00:17:04.057 --> 00:17:09.653
(Applause)

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.876
And what I've shown you today
is only the beginning.

00:17:15.876 --> 00:17:17.989
We've just started to scratch the surface

00:17:17.989 --> 00:17:20.961
of what you can do
with this kind of imaging,

00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:23.247
because it gives us a new way

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:28.066
to capture our surroundings
with common, accessible technology.

00:17:28.066 --> 00:17:29.995
And so looking to the future,

00:17:29.995 --> 00:17:32.032
it's going to be
really exciting to explore
