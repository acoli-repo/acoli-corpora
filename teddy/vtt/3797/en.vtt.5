But what if we could do the same thing
with our ability to hear?

00:02:32.508 --> 00:02:37.173
What if we could use video
to capture the vibrations of sound,

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:40.000
which are just another kind of motion,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.346
and turn everything that we see
into a microphone?

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:46.207
Now, this is a bit of a strange idea,

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:48.793
so let me try to put it
in perspective for you.

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:53.011
Traditional microphones
work by converting the motion

00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:56.610
of an internal diaphragm
into an electrical signal,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.928
and that diaphragm is designed
to move readily with sound
