00:11:57.946 --> 00:12:00.036
In fact, people have been using lasers

00:12:00.036 --> 00:12:02.835
to eavesdrop on objects
from a distance for decades.

00:12:03.978 --> 00:12:06.003
But what's really new here,

00:12:06.003 --> 00:12:07.443
what's really different,

00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:11.738
is that now we have a way
to picture the vibrations of an object,

00:12:11.738 --> 00:12:15.151
which gives us a new lens
through which to look at the world,

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.661
and we can use that lens

00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:21.560
to learn not just about forces like sound
that cause an object to vibrate,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.848
but also about the object itself.

00:12:24.975 --> 00:12:26.668
And so I want to take a step back

00:12:26.668 --> 00:12:30.917
and think about how that might change
the ways that we use video,
