Most of us think of motion
as a very visual thing.

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:10.977
If I walk across this stage
or gesture with my hands while I speak,

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:13.238
that motion is something that you can see.

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:19.737
But there's a world of important motion
that's too subtle for the human eye,

00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:21.778
and over the past few years,

00:00:21.778 --> 00:00:23.775
we've started to find that cameras

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:27.185
can often see this motion
even when humans can't.

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:29.856
So let me show you what I mean.
