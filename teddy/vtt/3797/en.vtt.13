We would just get noise back.

00:06:30.117 --> 00:06:33.437
And so a lot of our early
experiments looked like this.

00:06:33.437 --> 00:06:35.643
And so here I am,

00:06:35.643 --> 00:06:39.683
and on the bottom left, you can kind of
see our high-speed camera,

00:06:39.683 --> 00:06:41.866
which is pointed at a bag of chips,

00:06:41.866 --> 00:06:44.815
and the whole thing is lit
by these bright lamps.

00:06:44.815 --> 00:06:49.180
And like I said, we had to be
very careful in these early experiments,

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.688
so this is how it went down.

00:06:51.688 --> 00:06:55.449

Mary had a little lamb!
Little lamb! Little lamb!
