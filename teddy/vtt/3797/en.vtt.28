00:13:56.718 --> 00:14:01.262
to learn about the structural
and material properties of our object,

00:14:01.262 --> 00:14:06.096
and we're going to use that information
to create something new and interactive.

00:14:12.866 --> 00:14:15.519
And so here's what we've created.

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:17.748
And it looks like a regular image,

00:14:17.748 --> 00:14:20.859
but this isn't an image,
and it's not a video,

00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:23.227
because now I can take my mouse

00:14:23.227 --> 00:14:26.086
and I can start interacting
with the object.
