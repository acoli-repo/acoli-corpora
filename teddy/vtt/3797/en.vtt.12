00:05:59.695 --> 00:06:03.299
You see, there are a lot of factors
that affect when and how well

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:05.296
this technique will work.

00:06:05.296 --> 00:06:08.500
There's the object and how far away it is;

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.894
there's the camera
and the lens that you use;

00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:14.985
how much light is shining on the object
and how loud your sound is.

00:06:15.945 --> 00:06:19.320
And even with the right algorithm,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.710
we had to be very careful
with our early experiments,

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.102
because if we got
any of these factors wrong,

00:06:25.102 --> 00:06:27.470
there was no way to tell
what the problem was.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.117
We would just get noise back.
