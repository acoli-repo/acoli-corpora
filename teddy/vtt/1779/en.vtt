00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.853
This sound,

00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:09.588
this smell,

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:13.693
this sight

00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:17.221
all remind me of the campfires of my childhood,

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:24.617
when anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames.

00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:27.540
There was this wondrous ending

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.106
when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison.
