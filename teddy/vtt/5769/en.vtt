00:00:01.182 --> 00:00:06.755
For too long, those of us
who live in cities big and small

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.846
have accepted the unacceptable.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.211
We accept that in cities
our sense of time is warped,

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:19.156

and long distances

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:26.903
