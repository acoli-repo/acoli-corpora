00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:04.173
There have been many revolutions
over the last century,

00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:08.417
but perhaps none as significant
as the longevity revolution.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:13.592
We are living on average
today 34 years longer

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:16.094
than our great-grandparents did --
think about that.

00:00:16.118 --> 00:00:19.372
That's an entire second adult lifetime

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:21.170
that's been added to our lifespan.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:23.081
And yet, for the most part,

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:26.476
our culture has not come to terms
with what this means.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.265
We're still living with the old paradigm

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.266
of age as an arch.
