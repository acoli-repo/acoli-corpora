I'm a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist,

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:06.747
I'm actually interested in how the brain learns,

00:00:06.747 --> 00:00:10.114
and I'm especially interested in a possibility of

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:14.846
making our brains smarter, better and faster.

00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:17.722
This is in this context I'm going to tell you

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:20.472
about video games. When we say video games,

00:00:20.472 --> 00:00:23.010
most of you think about children.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.988
It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.

00:00:26.988 --> 00:00:29.906
But let's be frank.

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:34.695
When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?
