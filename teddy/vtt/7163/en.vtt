[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]

00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:07.871
For me, public space is political.

00:00:07.913 --> 00:00:09.996
I work with communities around the world,

00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:12.996
and as we know,
every community has problems.

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:15.663
Some of these problems are solved
through the ballot box

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:16.871
or city hall meetings

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:20.704
or community efforts, like bike lanes
and potholes and school budgets.

00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:24.496
But some problems are beyond
the reach of these structures,

00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:26.038
like food deserts,

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:27.496
community well-being

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:29.954
and the loss of cultural identity.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:33.329
These problems cannot be solved
with the existing tool sets.
