00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.950
the honest truth is I have
pretty much no idea what I'm doing.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.054
I want them to be
happy and healthy in their lives,

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:38.064
but I don't know what I'm supposed to do

00:00:38.088 --> 00:00:40.094
to make sure they are happy and healthy.

00:00:40.118 --> 00:00:43.095
There's so many books
offering all kinds of conflicting advice,

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:44.655
it can be really overwhelming.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.775
So I've spent most of their lives
just making it up as I go along.

00:00:49.034 --> 00:00:52.050
However, something changed me
a few years ago,

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:54.872
when I came across a little secret
that we have in Britain.

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:58.846
It's helped me become more confident
about how I bring up my own children,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.279
and it's revealed a lot about
how we as a society can help all children.
