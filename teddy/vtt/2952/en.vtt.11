The first lesson for successful life,
everyone, is this:

00:05:30.214 --> 00:05:32.070
choose your parents very carefully.

00:05:32.094 --> 00:05:33.095
(Laughter)

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:36.171
Don't be born into a poor family
or into a struggling family.

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:40.106
Now, I'm sure you can see
the small problem here.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.568
We can't choose our parents
or how much they earn,

00:05:43.592 --> 00:05:46.821
but this British study has also struck
a real note of optimism

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:50.196
by showing that not everyone
who has a disadvantaged start

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.815
ends up in difficult circumstances.

00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:55.799
As you know, many people
have a tough start in life,

00:05:55.823 --> 00:05:58.682
but they end up doing very well
on some measure nevertheless,

00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:00.497
and this study starts to explain how.
