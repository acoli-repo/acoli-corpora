00:03:28.484 --> 00:03:31.820
so, no other country in the world
is tracking generations of children

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.180
in quite this detail.

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.800
These are some of the best-studied
people on the planet,

00:03:36.824 --> 00:03:39.928
and the data has become
incredibly valuable for scientists,

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:43.246
generating well over 6,000
academic papers and books.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:47.564
But today I want to focus
on just one finding --

00:03:47.588 --> 00:03:51.922
perhaps the most important discovery
to come from this remarkable study.

00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:54.284
And it's also the one
that spoke to me personally,

00:03:54.308 --> 00:03:57.622
because it's about how to use science
to do the best for our children.

00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:01.385
So, let's get the bad news
out of the way first.
