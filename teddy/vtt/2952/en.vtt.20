00:09:57.603 --> 00:10:00.616
between the rich and poor children
by about 50 percent.

00:10:01.472 --> 00:10:05.623
Now that means that poverty
leaves a really lasting scar,

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:09.029
and it means that if we really want
to ensure the success and well-being

00:10:09.053 --> 00:10:10.490
of the next generation,

00:10:10.514 --> 00:10:14.402
then tackling child poverty
is an incredibly important thing to do.

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:18.270
Now, what does all this mean
for you and me?

00:10:18.294 --> 00:10:20.724
Are there lessons here
we can all take home and use?

00:10:20.748 --> 00:10:22.278
As a scientist and a journalist,

00:10:22.302 --> 00:10:24.850
I like to have some science
to inform my parenting ...

00:10:25.912 --> 00:10:28.669
and I can tell you that when
you're shouting at your kids

00:10:28.693 --> 00:10:29.953
to go to bed on time,

00:10:29.977 --> 00:10:33.009
it really helps to have
the scientific literature on your side.
