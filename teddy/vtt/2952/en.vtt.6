The amount of information
that's now been collected on these people

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.871
is just completely mind-boggling.

00:03:03.895 --> 00:03:06.085
It includes thousands
of paper questionnaires

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.976
and terabytes' worth of computer data.

00:03:08.473 --> 00:03:11.299
Scientists have also built up
a huge bank of tissue samples,

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:15.803
which includes locks of hair,
nail clippings, baby teeth and DNA.

00:03:16.498 --> 00:03:21.053
They've even collected 9,000 placentas
from some of the births,

00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:25.391
which are now pickled in plastic buckets
in a secure storage warehouse.

00:03:26.564 --> 00:03:28.460
This whole project has become unique --

00:03:28.484 --> 00:03:31.820
so, no other country in the world
is tracking generations of children
