These studies show
that certain things that parents do

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.722
are correlated with good
outcomes for children,

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:38.159
but we don't necessarily know
those behaviors caused the good outcomes,

00:07:38.183 --> 00:07:40.565
or whether some other factor
is getting in the way.

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:42.834
For example, we have to take
genes into account,

00:07:42.858 --> 00:07:45.005
and that's a whole other talk in itself.

00:07:45.489 --> 00:07:47.712
But scientists working
with this British study

00:07:47.736 --> 00:07:49.902
are working really hard to get at causes,

00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:51.947
and this is one study I particularly love.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.153
In this one,

00:07:53.177 --> 00:07:56.044
they looked at the bedtime routines
of about 10,000 children

00:07:56.068 --> 00:07:57.860
born at the turn of the millennium.

00:07:57.884 --> 00:08:00.213
Were the children going to bed
at regular times,
