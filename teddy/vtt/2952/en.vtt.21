00:10:29.977 --> 00:10:33.009
it really helps to have
the scientific literature on your side.

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:34.052
(Laughter)

00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:35.679
And wouldn't it be great to think

00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:38.412
that all we had to do to have
happy, successful children

00:10:38.436 --> 00:10:41.135
was to talk to them,
be interested in their future,

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:43.733
put them to bed on time,
and give them a book to read?

00:10:43.757 --> 00:10:44.907
Our job would be done.

00:10:45.369 --> 00:10:46.838
Now, as you can imagine,

00:10:46.862 --> 00:10:50.071
the answers aren't quite
as simple as that.

00:10:50.095 --> 00:10:52.286
For one thing, this study
looks at what happens

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.731
to thousands and thousands
of children on average,

00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:58.353
but that doesn't necessarily say
what will help my child or your child

00:10:58.377 --> 00:11:00.114
or any individual child.
