00:04:56.714 --> 00:05:00.031
but some of these differences emerge
at a really shockingly early age.

00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:01.689
In one study,

00:05:01.713 --> 00:05:03.608
children who were growing up in poverty

is one of the most difficult questions
that we face today.

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.490
So there we have it.

00:05:27.514 --> 00:05:30.190
The first lesson for successful life,
everyone, is this:
