Talking and listening to a child,

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:02.203
responding to them warmly,

00:07:02.227 --> 00:07:04.195
teaching them their letters and numbers,

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:05.891
taking them on trips and visits.

00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:08.932
Reading to children every day
seems to be really important, too.

00:07:09.504 --> 00:07:10.892
So in one study,

00:07:10.916 --> 00:07:14.203
children whose parents were reading
to them daily when they were five

00:07:14.227 --> 00:07:17.276
and then showing an interest
in their education at the age of 10,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.321
were significantly less likely
to be in poverty at the age of 30

00:07:21.345 --> 00:07:23.937
than those whose parents
weren't doing those things.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:29.152
Now, there are huge challenges
with interpreting this type of science.

00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:32.336
These studies show
that certain things that parents do
