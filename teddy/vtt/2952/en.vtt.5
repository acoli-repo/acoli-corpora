00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:30.224
(Laughter)

00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:33.643
Now, this wartime study
actually ended up being so successful

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.436
that scientists did it again.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.799
They recorded the births
of thousands of babies born in 1958

00:02:38.823 --> 00:02:40.747
and thousands more in 1970.

00:02:41.096 --> 00:02:43.098
They did it again in the early 1990s,

00:02:43.122 --> 00:02:45.170
and again at the turn of the millennium.

00:02:45.194 --> 00:02:48.860
Altogether, more than 70,000 children
have been involved in these studies

00:02:48.884 --> 00:02:50.897
across those five generations.

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:53.112
They're called the British birth cohorts,

00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:55.899
and scientists have gone back
and recorded more information

00:02:55.923 --> 00:02:58.272
on all of these people
every few years ever since.

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:02.267
The amount of information
that's now been collected on these people
