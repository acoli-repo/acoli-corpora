00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:00.497
and this study starts to explain how.

00:06:01.337 --> 00:06:03.438
So the second lesson is this:

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:05.287
parents really matter.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.058
In this study,

00:06:07.082 --> 00:06:09.200
children who had engaged,
interested parents,

00:06:09.224 --> 00:06:11.288
ones who had ambition for their future,

00:06:11.312 --> 00:06:14.146
were more likely to escape
from a difficult start.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.195
It seems that parents and what they do
are really, really important,

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:20.323
especially in the first few years of life.

00:06:20.927 --> 00:06:22.595
Let me give you an example of that.

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:23.813
In one study,

00:06:23.837 --> 00:06:27.893
scientists looked at about 17,000 children
who were born in 1970.

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:31.726
They sifted all the mountains of data
that they had collected
