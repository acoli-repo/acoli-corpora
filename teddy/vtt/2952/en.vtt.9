00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.107
to end up with worse jobs
and to earn less money.

00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:34.138
Now, maybe that sounds really obvious,

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:36.857
but some of the results
have been really surprising,

00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:38.834
so children who had a tough start in life

00:04:38.858 --> 00:04:41.362
are also more likely to end up
unhealthy as adults.

00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:43.492
They're more likely to be overweight,

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:44.851
to have high blood pressure,

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:46.968
and then decades down the line,

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:51.365
more likely to have a failing memory,
poor health and even to die earlier.

00:04:53.777 --> 00:04:56.690
Now, I talked about what happens later,

00:04:56.714 --> 00:05:00.031
but some of these differences emerge
at a really shockingly early age.
