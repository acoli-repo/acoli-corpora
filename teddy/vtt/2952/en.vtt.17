00:08:27.003 --> 00:08:31.056
That means that they picked up
a magazine, a picture book, a story book.

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:34.579
The data showed that children
who were reading for pleasure

00:08:34.603 --> 00:08:36.863
at the ages of five and 10

00:08:36.887 --> 00:08:39.783
were more likely to go on in school
better, on average,

00:08:39.807 --> 00:08:41.778
on school tests later in their lives.

00:08:41.802 --> 00:08:43.507
And not just tests of reading,

00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:45.671
but tests of spelling and maths as well.

00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:49.315
This study tried to control
for all the confounding factors,

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:51.823
so it looked at children
who were equally intelligent

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:53.879
and from the same social-class background,

00:08:53.903 --> 00:08:57.286
so it seemed as if it was the reading
which really helped those children

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.453
go on and score better on those
school tests later in their lives.
