00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.258
and the ones who struggle much more,

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:33.283
and then we can sift through
all the information we've collected

00:01:33.307 --> 00:01:36.207
and try to work out why
their lives turned out different.

00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:39.187
This British study --
it's actually a kind of crazy story.

00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.616
So it all starts back in 1946,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.881
just a few months
after the end of the war,

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:45.336
when scientists wanted to know

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.155
what it was like for a woman
to have a baby at the time.

00:01:48.752 --> 00:01:51.159
They carried out
this huge survey of mothers

00:01:51.183 --> 00:01:54.128
and ended up recording the birth
of nearly every baby

00:01:54.152 --> 00:01:56.715
born in England, Scotland
and Wales in one week.

00:01:57.127 --> 00:01:59.511
That was nearly 14,000 babies.
