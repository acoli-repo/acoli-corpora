The questions they asked these women

00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:04.753
are very different than the ones
we might ask today.

00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:06.503
They sound really old-fashioned now.

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:07.862
They asked them things like,

00:02:07.886 --> 00:02:09.092
"During pregnancy,

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:12.225
did you get your full extra ration
of a pint of milk a day?"

00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:16.774
"How much did you spend
on smocks, corsets,

00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:19.717
nightdresses, knickers and brassieres?"

00:02:20.838 --> 00:02:22.405
And this is my favorite one:

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.681
"Who looked after your husband
while you were in bed with this baby?"

00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:30.224
