00:07:57.884 --> 00:08:00.213
Were the children going to bed
at regular times,

00:08:00.237 --> 00:08:03.135
or did they go to bed
at different times during the week?

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:06.732
The data showed that those children
who were going to bed at different times

00:08:06.756 --> 00:08:09.129
were more likely
to have behavioral problems,

00:08:09.153 --> 00:08:11.862
and then those that switched
to having regular bedtimes

00:08:11.886 --> 00:08:14.272
often showed an improvement in behavior,

00:08:14.296 --> 00:08:15.652
and that was really crucial,

00:08:15.676 --> 00:08:17.948
because it suggested
it was the bedtime routines

00:08:17.972 --> 00:08:20.687
that were really helping things
get better for those kids.

00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:22.882
Here's another one to think about.

00:08:22.906 --> 00:08:24.064
In this one,

00:08:24.088 --> 00:08:26.979
scientists looked at children
who were reading for pleasure.

00:08:27.003 --> 00:08:31.056
That means that they picked up
a magazine, a picture book, a story book.
