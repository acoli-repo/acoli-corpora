00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:01.385
So, let's get the bad news
out of the way first.

00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:05.261
Perhaps the biggest message
from this remarkable study is this:

00:04:06.137 --> 00:04:09.352
don't be born into poverty
or into disadvantage,

00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:10.590
because if you are,

00:04:10.614 --> 00:04:13.299
you're far more likely
to walk a difficult path in life.

00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:16.985
Many children in this study
were born into poor families

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.336
or into working-class families that had
cramped homes or other problems,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.838
and it's clear now
that those disadvantaged children

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:26.954
have been more likely to struggle
on almost every score.

00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:29.328
They've been more likely
to do worse at school,

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.107
to end up with worse jobs
and to earn less money.
