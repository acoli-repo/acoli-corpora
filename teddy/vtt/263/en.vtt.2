That's because it's not broken:

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.042
it's misunderstood.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:07.143
Our culture has had a skewed
and medically incorrect picture

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.143
of female sexuality

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:11.684
going back centuries.

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:16.434
If over half of women
have some kind of sexual problem,

00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:20.292
maybe our idea of sexuality
doesn't work for women.

00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:25.083
We need a clearer understanding
of how women actually work.

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:28.184
I'm a journalist,

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:29.643
and I recently wrote a book

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:34.000
about how our understanding
of female sexuality is evolving.
