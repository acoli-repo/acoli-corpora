00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.643

In a medical journal in 2005,

00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:16.726
Dr. Helen O'Connell, a urologist,

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.601
warned her colleagues that this structure

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:23.851
in basic medical journals --

00:05:23.875 --> 00:05:25.750

This could have serious
consequences for surgery.
