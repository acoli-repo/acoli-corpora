It contains almost as much
erectile tissue as the penis.

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:35.667
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:37.934
It looks a little like a swan.

00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.893
(Laughter)

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:43.309
This sculpture is by an artist
named Sophia Wallace

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:46.434
as part of her "Cliteracy" project.

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:47.768
(Laughter)

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:49.893
She believes we need more "cliteracy,"

00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:52.309
and it's true, considering
that this structure

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:57.708
was only fully 3-D mapped
by researchers in 2009.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.268
That was after we finished mapping
the entire human genome.
