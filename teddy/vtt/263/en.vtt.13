Some people feel
that all this is a trivial issue.

00:06:34.417 --> 00:06:36.934
I was writing my book
when I was at a dinner party

00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:41.208
and someone said, "Isn't sexuality
a first-world problem?

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:46.542
Aren't women dealing with more
important issues all over the world?"

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.226
Of course they are.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.476
But I think the impulse to trivialize sex
is part of our problem.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.309
We live in a culture
that seems obsessed with sex.

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:00.750
We use it to sell everything.
