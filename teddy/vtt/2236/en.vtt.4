00:01:58.942 --> 00:02:01.371
Now I would wager
that in the United States,

00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:04.053
these are the most well-known chromosomes

00:02:04.077 --> 00:02:05.648
for one simple fact:

00:02:05.672 --> 00:02:08.934
that we say X equals "girl,"
and Y equals "boy" --

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.418
that they are responsible for sex.

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:13.022
And -- and I had to learn this --

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:15.506
but when I'm talking about "sex" here,

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.688
I'm talking about the way biology
gives us gonads,

00:02:18.712 --> 00:02:20.649
which are our ovaries and our testes --

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:23.847
I'm not talking about gender,
which is how we identify.

00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:26.680
And so, as a reporter at the show --

00:02:26.704 --> 00:02:31.093
"Radiolab," the audio documentary
program I work for --
