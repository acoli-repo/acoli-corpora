00:11:57.293 --> 00:12:00.560
of the almost 1,100 genes
on the X chromosome,

00:12:00.584 --> 00:12:03.585
how many do you think have to do
with sex and reproduction?

00:12:03.609 --> 00:12:05.742
Like, get a number in your head.

00:12:07.347 --> 00:12:08.497
Four percent.

00:12:09.736 --> 00:12:12.760
That means 96 percent
of the rest of that chromosome

00:12:12.784 --> 00:12:15.735
is doing something that has nothing
to do with your gonads.

00:12:16.466 --> 00:12:18.918
And I guess as all of these,

00:12:18.942 --> 00:12:20.728
sort of, some of them social stories,

00:12:20.752 --> 00:12:23.585
some of them scientific stories,
some of these facts,

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:26.849
started to add up, I just thought, like,

00:12:26.873 --> 00:12:29.135
why are we calling these
the sex chromosomes?

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:31.992
Or if we are, like,
maybe we all like that name,
