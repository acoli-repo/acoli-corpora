WEBVTT

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:31.992
Or if we are, like,
maybe we all like that name,

00:12:32.016 --> 00:12:36.007
should we just allow ourselves
to think about them

00:12:36.031 --> 00:12:37.406
a little more broadly?

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.724
Because if we do,

00:12:38.748 --> 00:12:43.621
like, what insights would we gain,
as people, as scientists?

00:12:43.645 --> 00:12:46.319
And we're at this point
where we're thinking about, like,

00:12:46.343 --> 00:12:47.899
how do we want to teach science,

00:12:47.923 --> 00:12:49.093
what do we want to fund,

00:12:49.117 --> 00:12:51.459
like, who do we want to be
as a society, you know?

00:12:51.483 --> 00:12:56.918
And I just wondered if it wasn't a moment
to rethink the biology of X and Y,

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:59.117
and at the very least,

00:12:59.141 --> 00:13:01.514
to remember, like,
the footnotes of history,
