00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:30.332
He called it the "X element."

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:31.546
(Laughter)

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.198
And he was like,
"We'll just fill in that X later."

00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:38.070
And then, fast-forward 10 years later,

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:40.093
and there is an American scientist,

00:00:40.117 --> 00:00:42.498
and she is looking through her microscope,

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:44.355
also at insect cells.

00:00:44.887 --> 00:00:46.283
And she sees something funny.

00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:48.429
There's more of this dark stuff.

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:49.609
And it's kind of tiny,

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.545
it's hanging out near the X element.

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.141
And eventually, someone was like,

00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:55.899
"Well, if that one thing's called X,

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:58.121
should we call this other thing Y?"

00:00:58.145 --> 00:00:59.684
And like that, (Snaps fingers)

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:01.739
the sex chromosomes had been discovered.
