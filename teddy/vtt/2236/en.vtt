00:00:00.594 --> 00:00:02.000
OK.

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:05.246
So we are going to start in 1891,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.595
when a German scientist
was looking through a microscope

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:10.204
at insect cells.

00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:11.916
And he saw something kind of funny.

00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:16.109
At the center of the cells,
there was this dark stuff.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.903
No one had ever seen it before.

00:00:17.927 --> 00:00:21.601
And he noticed that as the cells
would multiply and divide,

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.045
it would go into some of the new cells

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.347
but not the others.

00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:28.331
He didn't know what it was,
so he gave it a really great name.

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:30.332
He called it the "X element."
