00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.599
and such a powerfully connotated name.

00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:35.481
There was a fear that it would
actually be really limiting --

00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:37.615

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.204
And you can see they ended up
getting "sex chromosome" --

00:04:44.228 --> 00:04:46.831

since we settled on that name,

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.382
you can see it starts
to get a little complicated.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.008
So around 1960 --
