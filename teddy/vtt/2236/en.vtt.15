MW: Seems like kind of an oversight.

00:07:31.092 --> 00:07:32.252
I don't know.

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:34.476
But I think it's interesting,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.109
because what you see is if you start
looking at these chromosomes

00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:40.442
through the lens of sex,

00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:42.619
what naturally falls in place behind

00:07:42.643 --> 00:07:45.172
is we look at them
through the lens of gender,

00:07:45.196 --> 00:07:47.315
and the traits
that we associate with gender.

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:48.831
So men were violent,

00:07:48.855 --> 00:07:51.117
and Y explained why they were in prison.

00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:52.562
The X did not do that,

00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:54.458
because like, you know, what's X?

00:07:54.482 --> 00:07:56.768
We don't associate it with violence.

00:07:56.792 --> 00:08:00.125
And while we don't believe
in supermales today --
