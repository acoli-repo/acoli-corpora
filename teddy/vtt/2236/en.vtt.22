00:10:59.944 --> 00:11:01.857
The last place that I'll share with you

00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:04.093
where these chromosomes
got complicated for me

00:11:04.117 --> 00:11:06.212
is this one thing that Melissa told me.

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:09.591
(Audio) Wilson: You can't 
survive without an X chromosome.

00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:11.783
No matter your gonads,
no matter your identity,

00:11:11.807 --> 00:11:14.315
every single human being
has to have an X chromosome,

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:17.110
because without one,
the rest of your body doesn't develop.

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:19.302
MW: Why do we call this
the female chromosome?

00:11:19.326 --> 00:11:21.556
OK, this is something
I had never though about,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.000
but literally, every single person
in this audience has an X chromosome,

00:11:25.024 --> 00:11:26.175
I'm not lying.

00:11:26.199 --> 00:11:28.737
Every single person on the planet
has an X chromosome,

00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:32.118
but no one is going around like,
"This is the every-person chromosome."
