00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:32.118
but no one is going around like,
"This is the every-person chromosome."

00:11:32.142 --> 00:11:33.317

one of the craziest things I found out.

00:11:53.983 --> 00:11:57.269
Which is, when you think
about the X chromosome,

00:11:57.293 --> 00:12:00.560
of the almost 1,100 genes
on the X chromosome,
