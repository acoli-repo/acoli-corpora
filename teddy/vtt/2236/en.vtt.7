There was diplosome and heterochromosome

00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:34.093
and idiochromosome,

00:03:34.117 --> 00:03:37.768
and most of the names had to do
with their structure, their shape,

00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:39.172

00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:41.196
And then there was "sex chromosome,"

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.347
which they had been given
because of the fact

00:03:43.371 --> 00:03:46.403
that we had started seeing that the X
would go with the females,

00:03:46.427 --> 00:03:49.093
and the Y would often go with the males.

00:03:49.498 --> 00:03:51.918
But scientists were like,

00:03:51.942 --> 00:03:54.760
"Do we really want
to call them sex chromosomes?"

00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:59.011
And science historian Sarah Richardson
is the one who told me this story.

For three decades, scientists were like,
