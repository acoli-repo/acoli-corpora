00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:01.739
the sex chromosomes had been discovered.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:03.970
So chromosomes,

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:05.724
you probably all know what they are,

00:01:05.748 --> 00:01:07.098
but I will tell you anyways.

00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:08.609
They're made up of DNA --

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:11.101
everything has it,
it's the blueprint of life,

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:12.680
we've got rats, we've got trees,

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:15.076
we've got insects, we've got humans.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.287
And in the case of human chromosomes,

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:21.318
geneticist Melissa Wilson
broke it down for me like this.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.652
(Audio) Melissa Wilson: Typically,
you'll get one copy of every chromosome

00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:26.934
from your genetic mom

00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.597
and one copy of every chromosome
from your genetic dad,

00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:31.726
and we have 22 of these
