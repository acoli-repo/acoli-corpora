WEBVTT

00:06:58.633 --> 00:07:00.966
And then, there was one other thing.

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:04.673
(Audio) SR: Going back
and looking at those original findings

00:07:04.697 --> 00:07:06.894
in that high-security
psychiatric institution,

00:07:06.918 --> 00:07:11.623
they had also found
a high number of individuals

00:07:11.647 --> 00:07:13.965
with an extra X chromosome.

00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:17.510
So these are XXY, as opposed to XYY.

00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:18.685
(Audio) MW: Really?

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:20.664
(Audio) SR: Yeah. 
Now, they never claimed

00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:22.863
that the individuals
with an extra X chromosome

00:07:22.887 --> 00:07:24.154
were superfemales.

00:07:24.458 --> 00:07:28.839
They never investigated
whether they had higher rates of violence.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.068
MW: Seems like kind of an oversight.
