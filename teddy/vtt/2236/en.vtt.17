She was like a hot shot,
a rising superstar.

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:36.739
And the night before her race,
they had her DNA scanned.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.990
Now at the time, this was a thing
that they were doing,

00:08:40.014 --> 00:08:41.164
because they were like,

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:45.093
"OK, we don't want men
covertly racing as women,

00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:47.720
so we're going to scan the women

00:08:47.744 --> 00:08:49.736
and make sure all their Xs line up."

00:08:51.165 --> 00:08:54.323
And so I heard this story
from Ruth Padawer

00:08:54.347 --> 00:08:56.776
who was a New York Times Magazine reporter

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.894
and she reported on María.
