(Audio) Sarah Richardson:
For three decades, scientists were like,

00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:05.180
"You should not call them
the sex chromosomes.

00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:07.760
The X and Y have many functions,

00:04:07.784 --> 00:04:11.847
and you wouldn't assume
that a single chromosome

00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:13.640
controls a single trait.

00:04:13.664 --> 00:04:17.905
Imagine calling one chromosome
the 'urogenital chromosome,'

00:04:17.929 --> 00:04:20.237
or the 'liver chromosome.'"

00:04:21.118 --> 00:04:23.523
MW: Scientists, if you dig 
into the history --

00:04:23.547 --> 00:04:25.055
it's really cool, you should --

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:29.996
were hesitant to, like,
commit to such a specific name
