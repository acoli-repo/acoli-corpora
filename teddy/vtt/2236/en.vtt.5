00:02:26.704 --> 00:02:31.093
"Radiolab," the audio documentary
program I work for --

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:34.537
I was like, what's up
with these sex chromosomes?

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:37.300
You know, that's kind of my job,
I think things are weird,

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.236
and then I get to call people about them

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.661
and ask questions,
and then hopefully they answer.

00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:43.685
And in this case,
a lot of people answered.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.237
And in the two years I had
of reporting on X and Y,

00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:49.879
as part of "Gonads,"
the series on sex and gender

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:51.863
I ended up doing for "Radiolab,"

00:02:51.887 --> 00:02:57.045
I found out that these two chromosomes
live in a world that is unexpected,

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.878
a little unsettling;

00:02:58.902 --> 00:03:00.758
where things that I thought were facts
