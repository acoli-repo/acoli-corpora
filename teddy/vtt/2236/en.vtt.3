00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:31.726
and we have 22 of these

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.243
that you get one copy from mom
and one copy from dad.

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:37.702
And then there's a 23rd pair, X and Y.

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:41.537
Molly Webster: So while all
the other chromosomes are numbered,

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:43.354
one through 22,

00:01:43.378 --> 00:01:46.093

But in this instance, they were like,

00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:54.712

00:01:54.736 --> 00:01:56.902
and then we'll give them a title."

00:01:56.926 --> 00:01:58.918
They called them the sex chromosomes.

00:01:58.942 --> 00:02:01.371
Now I would wager
that in the United States,
