00:07:56.792 --> 00:08:00.125
And while we don't believe
in supermales today --

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:01.323
God, I hope we don't --

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:03.181
we don't believe in supermales today,

00:08:03.205 --> 00:08:06.545
there is a very similar conversation
that's still happening

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:10.309
around inherent violence
in boys and biology.

00:08:12.045 --> 00:08:15.640
So my next stop
on the weird world of X and Y,

00:08:15.664 --> 00:08:19.280
or things feeling
a little topsy-turvy, is 1985.

00:08:19.616 --> 00:08:23.291
The World University Games
were set to happen in Japan,

00:08:23.315 --> 00:08:29.532
and the Spanish hurdler María José
Martínez-Patiño was scheduled to run.

00:08:29.556 --> 00:08:32.127
She was like a hot shot,
a rising superstar.
