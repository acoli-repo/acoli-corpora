00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.894
every time we have built
larger telescopes,

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:04.117
we have learned something
about the universe;

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:06.967
we've made discoveries, without exception.

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:12.645
We've learned in the 20th century
that the universe is expanding

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.393
and that our own solar system
is not at the center of that expansion.

00:05:17.757 --> 00:05:23.036
We know now that the universe
is made of about 100 billion galaxies

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.710
that are visible to us,

00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:30.145
and each one of those galaxies
has 100 billion stars within it.
