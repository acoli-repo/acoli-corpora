00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:31.020
that is, they have birth,
they have middle ages

00:07:31.044 --> 00:07:33.374
and some of them
even have dramatic deaths.

00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:39.944
So the embers from those stars actually
then form the new stars that we see,

00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:43.779
most of which turn out to have
planets going around them.

00:07:44.272 --> 00:07:48.307
And one of the really surprising results
in the last 20 years

00:07:48.331 --> 00:07:52.457
has been the discovery
of other planets going around other stars.

00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:54.387
These are called exoplanets.

00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:59.407
And until 1995, we didn't even know
the existence of any other planets,

00:07:59.431 --> 00:08:01.765
other than going around our own sun.
