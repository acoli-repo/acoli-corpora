00:02:29.154 --> 00:02:32.137
to build what will be, when it's finished,

00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:35.465
the largest optical
telescope in existence.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.145
It's called the Giant
Magellan Telescope, or GMT.

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:44.481
This telescope is going to have mirrors
that are 8.4 meters in diameter --

00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:45.667
each of the mirrors.

00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:47.330
That's almost 27 feet.

00:02:47.354 --> 00:02:51.826
So it dwarfs this stage -- maybe
out to the fourth row in this audience.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.874
Each of the seven mirrors
in this telescope

00:02:54.898 --> 00:02:58.682
will be almost 27 feet in diameter.

00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:02.634
Together, the seven mirrors
in this telescope will comprise
