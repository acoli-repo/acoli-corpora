00:12:25.334 --> 00:12:31.015
This is a simulated image
of a cluster in a nearby galaxy.

00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:33.624
"Nearby" is astronomical,
it's all relative.

00:12:33.648 --> 00:12:36.151
It's tens of millions of light-years away.

00:12:36.175 --> 00:12:38.189
This is what this cluster would look like.

00:12:38.213 --> 00:12:40.381
So look at those four bright objects,

00:12:40.405 --> 00:12:44.412
and now lets compare it with a camera
on the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:12:44.436 --> 00:12:47.615
You can see faint detail
that starts to come through.

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:53.934
And now finally -- and look how dramatic
this is -- this is what the GMT will see.

00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.328
So, keep your eyes on those
bright images again.

00:12:56.352 --> 00:13:00.770
This is what we see on one of the most
powerful existing telescopes on the Earth,
