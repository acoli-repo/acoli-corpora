that will be scanning the sky
every few nights.

00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:02.892
There will be radio telescopes,

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:06.424
sensitive to long-wavelength
radio radiation.

00:02:06.448 --> 00:02:09.563
And then there will be
telescopes in space.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:12.484
There'll be a successor
to the Hubble Space Telescope;

00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:14.545
it's called the James Webb Telescope,

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.054
and it will be launched in 2018.

00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:18.784
There'll be a satellite called TESS

00:02:18.808 --> 00:02:22.181
that will discover planets
outside of our solar system.

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:26.889
For the last decade,
I've been leading a group --

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.130
a consortium -- international group,

00:02:29.154 --> 00:02:32.137
to build what will be, when it's finished,
