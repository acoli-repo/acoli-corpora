00:13:27.995 --> 00:13:31.344
And so we plan on building this telescope
with the first four mirrors.

00:13:31.368 --> 00:13:35.497
We want to get on the air quickly,
and be taking science data --

00:13:35.521 --> 00:13:40.100
what we astronomers call
"first light," in 2021.

00:13:41.031 --> 00:13:44.477
And the full telescope will be finished
in the middle of the next decade,

00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:45.897
with all seven mirrors.

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:50.100
So we're now poised to look back
at the distant universe,

00:13:50.124 --> 00:13:51.432
the cosmic dawn.

00:13:51.804 --> 00:13:55.937
We'll be able to study other planets
in exquisite detail.

00:13:56.424 --> 00:14:00.161
But for me, one of the most
exciting things about building the GMT
