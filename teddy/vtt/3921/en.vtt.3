00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:32.065
It's no exaggeration to say that
the Southern Hemisphere is going to be

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:35.504
the future of astronomy
for the 21st century.

00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:39.367
We have an array
of existing telescopes already,

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:41.423
in the Andes mountains in Chile,

00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:46.584
and that's soon to be joined by a really
sensational array of new capability.

00:01:46.608 --> 00:01:49.807
There will be two international groups
that are going to be building

00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:55.307
giant telescopes, sensitive
to optical radiation, as our eyes are.

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:57.540
There will be a survey telescope

00:01:57.564 --> 00:02:00.884
that will be scanning the sky
every few nights.
