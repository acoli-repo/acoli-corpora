Now, for thousands of years,
we have been studying the cosmos,

00:04:34.322 --> 00:04:36.976
we've been wondering
about our place in the universe.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.665

00:04:44.845 --> 00:04:47.636
and put the Sun
at the heart of the cosmos.

00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:50.839

00:04:50.863 --> 00:04:53.581

the Italian scientist,

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:58.855
first turned, in that time, a two-inch,
very small telescope, to the sky,

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.894
every time we have built
larger telescopes,
