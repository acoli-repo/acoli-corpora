00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:30.145
and each one of those galaxies
has 100 billion stars within it.

00:05:31.234 --> 00:05:34.096
So we're looking now
at the deepest image of the cosmos

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.619
that's ever been taken.

00:05:36.015 --> 00:05:38.833
It was taken using
the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:05:38.857 --> 00:05:43.747
and by pointing the telescope at what
was previously a blank region of sky,

00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:45.370
before the launch of Hubble.

00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:47.657
And if you can imagine this tiny area,

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:51.011
it's only one-fiftieth
of the size of the full moon.

00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:53.075
So, if you can imagine the full moon.

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:57.237
And there are now 10,000 galaxies
visible within that image.

00:05:57.782 --> 00:06:02.460
And the faintness of those images
and the tiny size is only a result
