WEBVTT

00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:31.770
And it's going to be housed
in an enclosure that's 22 stories --

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:33.693
60 meters high.

00:03:33.717 --> 00:03:36.719
But it's an unusual building
to protect this telescope.

00:03:36.743 --> 00:03:38.529
It will have open windows to the sky,

00:03:38.553 --> 00:03:40.901
be able to point and look at the sky,

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:43.553
and it will actually rotate on a base --

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:47.052
2,000 tons of rotating building.

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.552
The Giant Magellan Telescope
will have 10 times the resolution

00:03:52.576 --> 00:03:54.315
of the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:58.994
It will be 20 million times
more sensitive than the human eye.

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:05.729
And it may, for the first time ever,
be capable of finding life on planets
