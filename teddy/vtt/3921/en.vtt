00:00:00.944 --> 00:00:05.315
When I was 14 years old,
I was interested in science --

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.824
fascinated by it,
excited to learn about it.

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.538
And I had a high school science teacher
who would say to the class,

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:15.751
"The girls don't have to listen to this."

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.205
Encouraging, yes.

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:19.316
(Laughter)

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.372
I chose not to listen --
but to that statement alone.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.417
So let me take you
to the Andes mountains in Chile,

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:32.970
500 kilometers, 300 miles
northeast of Santiago.
