00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:32.348
the more light we can see,
and the farther back we can view.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.881
So, we've learned in the last century

00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:38.839
that there are exotic objects
in the universe -- black holes.

00:06:38.863 --> 00:06:41.640
We've even learned
that there's dark matter and dark energy

00:06:41.664 --> 00:06:42.875
that we can't see.

00:06:43.218 --> 00:06:46.776
So you're looking now
at an actual image of dark matter.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.950
(Laughter)

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:50.617
You got it. Not all audiences get that.

00:06:50.641 --> 00:06:52.406
(Laughter)

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.154
So the way we infer
the presence of dark matter --

00:06:55.178 --> 00:06:59.873
we can't see it -- but there's
an unmistakable tug, due to gravity.
