00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:31.262
and the amazing thing
is that within the next decade,

00:09:31.286 --> 00:09:36.516
the GMT may be able to take spectra
of the atmospheres of those planets,

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.052
and determine whether or not
they have the potential for life.

00:09:41.702 --> 00:09:43.482
So, what is the GMT project?

00:09:43.506 --> 00:09:45.380
It's an international project.

00:09:45.404 --> 00:09:51.253
It includes Australia, South Korea,
and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio,

00:09:51.277 --> 00:09:54.312
that the newest partner
in our telescope is Brazil.

00:09:54.825 --> 00:09:59.284
(Applause)

00:09:59.308 --> 00:10:04.098
It also includes a number of institutions
across the United States,
