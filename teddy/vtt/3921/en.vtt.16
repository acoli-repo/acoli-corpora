other than going around our own sun.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.781
But now, there are almost 2,000
other planets orbiting other stars

00:08:08.805 --> 00:08:11.365
that we can now detect,
measure masses for.

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:15.061
There are 500 of those
that are multiple-planet systems.

00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:19.045
And there are 4,000 --
and still counting -- other candidates

00:08:19.069 --> 00:08:21.283
for planets orbiting other stars.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.763
They come in a bewildering variety
of different kinds.

00:08:25.134 --> 00:08:28.420
There are Jupiter-like
planets that are hot,

00:08:28.444 --> 00:08:32.702
there are other planets that are icy,
there are water worlds
