00:08:28.444 --> 00:08:32.702
there are other planets that are icy,
there are water worlds

00:08:32.726 --> 00:08:35.980
and there are rocky planets
like the Earth, so-called "super-Earths,"

00:08:36.004 --> 00:08:40.691
and there have even been planets
that have been speculated diamond worlds.

00:08:41.794 --> 00:08:46.749
So we know there's at least one planet,
our own Earth, in which there is life.

00:08:46.773 --> 00:08:50.933
We've even found planets
that are orbiting two stars.

00:08:50.957 --> 00:08:54.138
That's no longer the province
of science fiction.

00:08:55.211 --> 00:08:57.425
So around our own planet,
we know there's life,

00:08:57.449 --> 00:09:03.165
we've developed a complex life,
we now can question our own origins.
