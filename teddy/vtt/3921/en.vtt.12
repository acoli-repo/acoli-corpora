00:05:57.782 --> 00:06:02.460
And the faintness of those images
and the tiny size is only a result

00:06:02.484 --> 00:06:06.891
of the fact that those galaxies
are so far away, the vast distances.

00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:09.848
And each of those galaxies
may contain within it

00:06:09.872 --> 00:06:14.881
a few billion or even hundreds
of billions of individual stars.

00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.610
Telescopes are like time machines.

00:06:17.634 --> 00:06:22.097
So the farther back we look in space,
the further back we see in time.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.656
And they're like light buckets --
literally, they collect light.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.914
So larger the bucket,
the larger the mirror we have,

00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:32.348
the more light we can see,
and the farther back we can view.
