00:07:01.302 --> 00:07:04.680
We now can look out,
we see this sea of galaxies

00:07:04.704 --> 00:07:06.481
in a universe that's expanding.

00:07:06.862 --> 00:07:10.165
What I do myself is to measure
the expansion of the universe,

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:13.330
and one of the projects
that I carried out in the 1990s

00:07:13.354 --> 00:07:18.470
used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure
how fast the universe is expanding.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:23.322
We can now trace back to 14 billion years.

00:07:23.731 --> 00:07:28.067
We've learned over time
that stars have individual histories;

00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:31.020
that is, they have birth,
they have middle ages
