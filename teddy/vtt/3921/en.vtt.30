00:14:57.364 --> 00:15:00.307
telescopes even that are similar,
but different instruments --

00:15:00.331 --> 00:15:04.077
they will all look at different parts
of the questions that we're asking.

00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:07.728
So when we discover other planets,
we'll be able to test those observations,

00:15:07.752 --> 00:15:09.840
we'll be able to measure the atmospheres,

00:15:09.864 --> 00:15:12.739
be able to look in space
with very high resolution.

00:15:12.763 --> 00:15:14.240
So, they're very complementary.

00:15:14.264 --> 00:15:16.501
You're right about
the funding, we compete;

00:15:16.525 --> 00:15:19.190
but scientifically,
it's very complementary.

00:15:19.214 --> 00:15:21.867
BG: Wendy, thank you very much
for coming to TEDGlobal.

00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:23.042
WF: Thank you.

00:15:23.066 --> 00:15:24.754
