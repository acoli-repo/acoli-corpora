00:11:26.606 --> 00:11:31.055
if I were to hold up a coin,
which I just happen to have,

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:36.070
and I look at the face of that coin,
I can see from here

00:11:36.094 --> 00:11:40.079
the writing on the coin;
I can see the face on that coin.

00:11:40.103 --> 00:11:43.217
My guess that even in the front row,
you can't see that.

00:11:43.645 --> 00:11:46.507
But if we were to turn
the Giant Magellan Telescope,

00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:49.904
all 80-feet diameter
that we see in this auditorium,

00:11:49.928 --> 00:11:52.997
and point it 200 miles away,

00:11:53.021 --> 00:11:58.889
if I were standing in São Paulo,
we could resolve the face of this coin.

00:11:58.913 --> 00:12:02.520
That's the extraordinary resolution
and power of this telescope.
