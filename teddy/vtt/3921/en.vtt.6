00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:02.634
Together, the seven mirrors
in this telescope will comprise

00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:04.699
80 feet in diameter.

00:03:04.723 --> 00:03:07.681
So, essentially the size
of this entire auditorium.

00:03:08.448 --> 00:03:12.094
The whole telescope will stand
about 43 meters high,

00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:14.808
and again, being in Rio,

00:03:14.832 --> 00:03:18.451
some of you have been to see
the statue of the giant Christ.

00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:20.304
The scale is comparable in height;

00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:23.565
in fact, it's smaller
than this telescope will be.

00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:27.280
It's comparable to the size
of the Statue of Liberty.

00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:31.770
And it's going to be housed
in an enclosure that's 22 stories --
