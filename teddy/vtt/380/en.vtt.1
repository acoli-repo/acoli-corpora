00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.121
about what's called
the e-Patient movement.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:33.794
I'll explain what that term means.

00:00:33.818 --> 00:00:36.586
I had been blogging
under the name "Patient Dave,"

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.984
and when I discovered this,

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:40.306
I just renamed myself e-Patient Dave.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.382
Regarding the word "patient":

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:46.342
When I first started a few years ago
getting involved in health care

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.726
and attending meetings
as just a casual observer,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.989
I noticed that people
would talk about patients

00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:53.588
as if it was somebody
who's not in the room here --

00:00:53.612 --> 00:00:55.006
somebody out there.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.543
Some of our talks today,
we still act like that.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:59.479
But I'm here to tell you:

00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:02.225
"patient" is not a third-person word.
