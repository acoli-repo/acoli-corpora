00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:30.647
"I wish Dad could have been here."

00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:34.551
And this is what we're doing
when we make health care better.

00:10:34.575 --> 00:10:37.478
Now, I want to talk briefly
about a couple of other patients

00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:40.511
who are doing everything
in their power to improve health care.

00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:42.174
This is Regina Holliday,

00:10:42.198 --> 00:10:46.397
a painter in Washington DC,
whose husband died of kidney cancer

00:10:46.421 --> 00:10:47.921
a year after my disease.

00:10:47.945 --> 00:10:49.726
She's painting, here, a mural

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.726
of his horrible
final weeks in the hospital.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.197
One of the things that she discovered

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:59.505
was that her husband's medical record
in this paper folder

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:01.055
was just disorganized.
