00:00:01.055 --> 00:00:02.206
It's an amazing thing

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.212
that we're here to talk
about the year of patients rising.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.726
You heard stories earlier today

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.778
about patients who are taking
control of their cases,

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:12.957
patients who are saying,

00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:14.955
"You know what, I know what the odds are,

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.129
but I'm going to look
for more information.

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:20.913
I'm going to define
what the terms of my success are."

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:24.726
I'm going to be sharing with you
how, four years ago, I almost died --

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.633
found out I was, in fact,
already almost dead --

00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:29.895
and what I then found out

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.121
about what's called
the e-Patient movement.
