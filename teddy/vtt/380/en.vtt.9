00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.726
To make a long story short,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.905
I said, "So you need me
to get back in there?"

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:37.180
He said, "Yeah, we're going to need
to do a CT scan of your chest."

00:04:37.204 --> 00:04:39.845
In parting, I said,
"Is there anything I should do?"

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:41.726
He said -- think about this one,

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.726
this is the advice your doctor gives you:

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.750
"Just go home and have a glass
of wine with your wife."

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:50.849
I went in for the CAT scan.

00:04:52.218 --> 00:04:55.445
It turns out there were
five of these things in both my lungs.

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.631
So at that point we knew
that it was cancer.

00:04:57.655 --> 00:04:59.259
We knew it wasn't lung cancer.

00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:02.235
That meant it was metastasized
from somewhere.
