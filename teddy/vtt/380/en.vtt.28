RA patients, as they call themselves --
her blog is "RA Warrior" --

00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:01.466
have a big problem,

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.268
because 40 percent of them
have no visible symptoms.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.808
And that makes it really hard
to tell how the disease is going,

00:14:07.832 --> 00:14:10.989
and some doctors think,
"Yeah right, you're really in pain."

00:14:11.013 --> 00:14:13.726
Well, she found,
through her online research,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.138
a nuclear bone scan
that's usually used for cancer,

00:14:17.162 --> 00:14:19.951
but it can also reveal inflammation.

00:14:19.975 --> 00:14:23.885
And she saw that
if there is no inflammation,

00:14:23.909 --> 00:14:26.369
then the scan is a uniform gray.

00:14:26.393 --> 00:14:27.588
So she took it.

00:14:27.612 --> 00:14:31.893
And the radiologist's report
said, "No cancer found."
