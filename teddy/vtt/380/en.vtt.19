00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:32.457
because I started a patient support
community of my own on a website,

00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:35.515
and one of my friends --
one of my relatives, actually -- said,

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:37.289
"Look, Dave, who grew this thing?

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:42.917
Are you going to set yourself up
as mentally attacking yourself?"

00:09:42.941 --> 00:09:44.545
So we went into it.

00:09:44.569 --> 00:09:47.286
The story of how all that
happened is in the book.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.734
Anyway, this is the way
the numbers unfolded.

00:09:49.758 --> 00:09:52.889
Me being me, I put the numbers
from my hospital's website,

00:09:52.913 --> 00:09:54.072
for my tumor sizes,

00:09:54.096 --> 00:09:55.247
into a spreadsheet.

00:09:55.271 --> 00:09:56.726
Don't worry about the numbers.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.502
You see, that's the immune system.

00:09:58.526 --> 00:10:00.503
Amazing thing, those two yellow lines
