00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.781
We think of hippies
of being just hedonists,

00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:36.006
but there's a very strong component --
I was in that movement --

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.374
a very strong component
of being responsible for yourself.

00:02:39.398 --> 00:02:43.295
This book's title's subtitle
is "Access to Tools."

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.615
It talked about how to build
your own house,

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.044
how to grow your own food,
all kinds of things.

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:49.472
In the 1980s,

00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:51.630
this young doctor, Tom Ferguson,

00:02:51.654 --> 00:02:54.281
was the medical editor
of the Whole Earth Catalog.

00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:59.076
He saw that the great majority
of what we do in medicine and health care

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.575
is taking care of ourselves.
