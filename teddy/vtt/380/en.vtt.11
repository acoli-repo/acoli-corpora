00:05:28.108 --> 00:05:30.009
What we saw in that kidney

00:05:30.882 --> 00:05:32.393
was that big blob there.

00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:35.457
There were actually two of these:
one was growing out the front

00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:37.904
and had already erupted
and latched onto the bowel.

00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:41.147
One was growing out the back
and it attached to the psoas muscle,

00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:43.956
which is a big muscle in the back
that I'd never heard of,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.813
but all of a sudden I cared about it.

00:05:45.837 --> 00:05:46.836
(Laughter)

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.023
I went home.

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:49.321
Now, I've been Googling --

00:05:49.345 --> 00:05:51.735
I've been online since 1989,
on CompuServe.

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.389
I went home, and I know
you can't read the details here;

00:05:54.413 --> 00:05:55.579
that's not important.

00:05:55.603 --> 00:05:59.807
My point is, I went to a respected
medical website, WebMD,

00:05:59.831 --> 00:06:02.089
because I know how to filter out junk.
