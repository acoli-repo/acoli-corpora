WEBVTT

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.575
is taking care of ourselves.

00:03:01.011 --> 00:03:03.362
In fact, he said it was 70 to 80 percent

00:03:03.386 --> 00:03:05.655
of how we actually
take care of our bodies.

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:10.357
Well, he also saw that when health care
turns to medical care

00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:12.291
because of a more serious disease,

00:03:12.315 --> 00:03:15.639
the key thing that holds us back
is access to information.

00:03:15.663 --> 00:03:18.929
And when the Web came along,
that changed everything,

00:03:18.953 --> 00:03:21.546
because not only
could we find information,

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.286
we could find other people like ourselves

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.901
who could gather,
who could bring us information.

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:29.440
And he coined this term "e-Patients" --

00:03:29.464 --> 00:03:31.795
equipped, engaged, empowered, enabled.
