Where does medical ability end and start?

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.344
Well, so what I read on WebMD:

00:06:33.915 --> 00:06:38.901
"The prognosis is poor
for progressing renal cell cancer.

00:06:38.925 --> 00:06:41.139
Almost all patients are incurable."

00:06:42.307 --> 00:06:46.022
I've been online long enough to know
if I don't like the first results I get,

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:47.199
I go look for more.

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.885
And what I found on other websites was,

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.273
even by the third page of Google results:

00:06:52.297 --> 00:06:53.731
"Outlook is bleak."

00:06:54.352 --> 00:06:56.328
"Prognosis is grim."

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:59.035
And I'm thinking, "What the heck?"

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:00.791
I didn't feel sick at all.
