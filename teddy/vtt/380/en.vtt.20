Amazing thing, those two yellow lines

00:10:00.527 --> 00:10:04.726
are where I got the two doses
of interleukin two months apart.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.880
And look at how the tumor sizes
plummeted in between.

00:10:07.904 --> 00:10:09.363
Just incredible.

00:10:09.387 --> 00:10:12.817
Who knows what we'll be able to do
when we learn to make more use of it?

00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:15.157
The punch line is that a year
and a half later,

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:19.481
I was there when this magnificent
young woman, my daughter,

00:10:19.505 --> 00:10:20.668
got married.

00:10:20.692 --> 00:10:22.503
And when she came down those steps,

00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:25.321
and it was just her and me
for that moment,

00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:28.567
I was so glad that she didn't have
to say to her mother,

00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:30.647
"I wish Dad could have been here."
