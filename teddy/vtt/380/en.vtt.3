One of the senior doctors at my hospital,

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:34.530
Charlie Safran,
and his colleague, Warner Slack,

00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:36.072
have been saying for decades

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:39.856
that the most underutilized
resource in all of health care

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.055
is the patient.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.265
They have been saying that
since the 1970s.

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.245
Now, I'm going to step back in history.

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:48.155
This is from July, 1969.

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.841
I was a freshman in college,

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:52.468
and this was when we first
landed on the Moon.

00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:54.284
And it was the first time

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:57.071
we had ever seen from another surface --

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:59.339
that's the place
where you and I are right now,

00:01:59.363 --> 00:02:00.521
where we live.
