equipped, engaged, empowered, enabled.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.520
Obviously, at this stage of life

00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:37.511
he was in a somewhat more dignified
form than he was back then.

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:41.489
Now, I was an engaged patient
long before I ever heard of the term.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:44.489
In 2006, I went to my doctor
for a regular physical,

00:03:44.513 --> 00:03:46.812
and I had said, "I have a sore shoulder."

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:48.409
Well, I got an X-ray,

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:50.081
and the next morning --

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:53.630

who have been through a medical crisis

00:03:53.654 --> 00:03:54.854
will understand this.

00:03:54.878 --> 00:03:59.340
This morning, some of the speakers
named the date when they found out

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.635
about their condition.
