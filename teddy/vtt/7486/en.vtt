00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.087
We've always thought of mentoring

00:00:02.111 --> 00:00:04.785
as the older generation
passing down wisdom to the young,

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:07.206
but there's a huge benefit
to flipping that around

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.334
and allowing the novice
to teach the master.

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:11.359

00:00:14.188 --> 00:00:16.940
The workforce currently consists
of up to five generations

00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:18.394
and it's becoming more diverse

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:21.236
across all spectrums
of underrepresented groups.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.556
But that change
is not arriving nearly as fast

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.276
in C-suites and in boardrooms.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.886
Which means there's a growing gap

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.449
between leaders and their people

00:00:28.473 --> 00:00:30.896
in regards to their
perspectives and experiences.
