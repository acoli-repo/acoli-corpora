As last recorded
by the US Federal Government,

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:09.226
the median wealth for a white family
in the United States was 171,000 dollars

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.684
and the median wealth for a Black family
was just 17,000 dollars,

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:18.893
a 10x different over 150 years
after the end of slavery.

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:25.059
Well, wealth is all of your assets,
all of the things that you own,

00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:26.601
minus all of your liabilities.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:29.934
Assets are things like your car,
your house, your savings account,

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.625
your checking account, your investments,
if you own other properties,
