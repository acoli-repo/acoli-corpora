00:00:00.495 --> 00:00:04.053
There is an ancient proverb that says

00:00:04.053 --> 00:00:08.115
it's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room,

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:10.903
especially when there is no cat.

00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:14.232
I find this a particularly apt description of science

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:16.368
and how science works --

00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:19.688
bumbling around in a dark room, bumping into things,

00:00:19.688 --> 00:00:21.990
trying to figure out what shape this might be,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.434
what that might be,

00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:25.923
there are reports of a cat somewhere around,

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:27.716
they may not be reliable, they may be,

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:29.236
and so forth and so on.

00:00:29.236 --> 00:00:31.212
Now I know this is different than the way most people
