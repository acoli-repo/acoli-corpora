00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:02.676
When it comes to climate,

00:00:02.676 --> 00:00:04.636
how do we stop preaching to the choir?

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:07.316
What can we do to grab the attention

00:00:07.356 --> 00:00:09.716
of those individuals who are disengaged?

00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:14.436
I ask these questions
as an artist, as an educator

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:16.996
and as a lifelong resident
of Miami, Florida,

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:20.076
one of the most climate-vulnerable
cities in the United States.

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:22.676
In Miami, we're already
seeing storm drains

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:24.916
that erupt with water
after heavy rainfalls,

00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:27.516
and cars and properties that are damaged

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:29.396
due to flooding from high tide.
