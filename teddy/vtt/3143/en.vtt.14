00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:04.923
the technologist struggling to communicate
with the business and the end user,

00:07:04.947 --> 00:07:09.133
and the business failing
to articulate their needs.

00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:11.739
I see it every day.

00:07:13.448 --> 00:07:15.370
We are scratching the surface

00:07:15.394 --> 00:07:20.203
in our ability as humans
to communicate and invent together,

00:07:20.227 --> 00:07:24.807
and while the sciences teach us
how to build things,

00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:30.241
it's the humanities that teach us
what to build and why to build them.
