And while we still sought after computer
engineers and computer science majors,

00:03:05.774 --> 00:03:10.750
we sprinkled in artists,
musicians, writers ...

00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:17.192
and Jeff's story started to multiply
itself throughout our company.

00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:20.549
Our chief technology officer
is an English major,

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:24.382
and he was a bike messenger in Manhattan.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.626
And today, we're a thousand people,

00:03:29.935 --> 00:03:35.387
yet still less than a hundred have degrees
in computer science or engineering.
