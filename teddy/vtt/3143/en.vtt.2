00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:01.515
"Why don't you send me in there?

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.046
I can figure it out."

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:06.666
So the next morning,
we're hanging out in our team meeting,

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.456
and we're all a little hazy ...

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.630
(Laughter)

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:14.624
and I half-jokingly throw it out there.

00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:17.232
I say, "Hey, I mean,
we're about to be fired."

00:01:17.256 --> 00:01:18.558
So I say,

00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:20.664
"Why don't we send in
Jeff, the bartender?"

00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:23.765
(Laughter)

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.850
And there's some silence,
some quizzical looks.

00:01:27.874 --> 00:01:31.416
Finally, my chief of staff says,
"That is a great idea."
