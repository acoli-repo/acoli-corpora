WEBVTT

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:30.892
to help this client deploy
a cutting-edge cloud system.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.219
We have a bunch of engineers,

00:00:33.243 --> 00:00:35.837
but none of them could please this client.

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:38.931
And we were about to be fired.

00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:42.223
So we go out to the bar,

00:00:42.247 --> 00:00:46.294
and we're hanging out
with our bartender friend Jeff,

00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:48.319
and he's doing
what all good bartenders do:

00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:51.365
he's commiserating with us,
making us feel better,

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:53.681
relating to our pain,

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.753
saying, "Hey, these guys
are overblowing it.

00:00:55.777 --> 00:00:56.960
Don't worry about it."

00:00:56.984 --> 00:00:59.198
And finally, he deadpans us and says,

00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:01.515
"Why don't you send me in there?
