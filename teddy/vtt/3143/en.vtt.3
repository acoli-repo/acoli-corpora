00:01:27.874 --> 00:01:31.416
Finally, my chief of staff says,
"That is a great idea."

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.177
(Laughter)

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:35.295
"Jeff is wicked smart. He's brilliant.

00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:37.318
He'll figure it out.

00:01:38.328 --> 00:01:39.741
Let's send him in there."

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.715
Now, Jeff was not a programmer.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.628
In fact, he had dropped out of Penn
as a philosophy major.

00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:49.485
But he was brilliant,

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.136
and he could go deep on topics,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.192
and we were about to be fired.

00:01:54.216 --> 00:01:55.366
So we sent him in.

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:59.825
After a couple days of suspense,

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:02.006
Jeff was still there.
