00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:00.470
are technology firms --

00:05:01.662 --> 00:05:03.638
these things create an assumption

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:09.019
that the path of our future workforce
will be dominated by STEM.

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:13.733
I get it.

00:05:14.692 --> 00:05:16.313
On paper, it makes sense.

00:05:17.498 --> 00:05:18.710
It's tempting.

00:05:21.597 --> 00:05:23.530
But it's totally overblown.

00:05:23.554 --> 00:05:29.605
It's like, the entire soccer team
chases the ball into the corner,

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.407
because that's where the ball is.
