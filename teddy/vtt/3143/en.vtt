You've all been in a bar, right?

00:00:02.913 --> 00:00:04.404
(Laughter)

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.453
But have you ever gone to a bar

00:00:07.477 --> 00:00:10.429
and come out with a $200 million business?

00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:14.556
That's what happened to us
about 10 years ago.

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:17.150
We'd had a terrible day.

00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:22.076
We had this huge client
that was killing us.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.704
We're a software consulting firm,

00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:27.710
and we couldn't find
a very specific programming skill

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:30.892
to help this client deploy
a cutting-edge cloud system.
