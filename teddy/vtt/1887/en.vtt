00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:02.276
I think it's safe to say

00:00:02.276 --> 00:00:06.260
that all humans will be intimate with death

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.100
at least once in their lives.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.117
But what if that intimacy began

00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:13.406
long before you faced your own transition

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:16.200
from life into death?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.129
What would life be like

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:21.725
if the dead literally lived alongside you?

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:23.651
In my husband's homeland

00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:26.331
in the highlands of Sulawesi island

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:28.358
in eastern Indonesia,

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:30.827
there is a community of people that experience death
