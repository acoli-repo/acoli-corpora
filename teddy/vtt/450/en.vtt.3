00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:31.351
such as muscle and skin.

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:33.726
We need a new generation of robot bodies

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.851
that is inspired by the elegance,
efficiency and by the soft materials

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:39.417
of the designs found in nature.

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:44.518
And indeed, this has become
the key idea of a new field of research

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:46.476
called soft robotics.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.393
My research group
and collaborators around the world

00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:53.059
are using soft components
inspired by muscle and skin

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:55.893
to build robots with agility and dexterity

00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:57.559
that comes closer and closer

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:00.875
to the astonishing capabilities
of the organisms found in nature.
