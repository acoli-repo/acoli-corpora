00:09:27.542 --> 00:09:31.417
One day, we may even merge
our bodies with robotic parts.

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:35.250
I know that sounds very scary at first.

00:09:36.917 --> 00:09:38.768
But when I think about my grandparents

00:09:38.792 --> 00:09:41.726
and the way they become
more dependent on others

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.851
to perform simple everyday tasks
such as using the restroom alone,

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:48.083
they often feel like
they're becoming a burden.

00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.226
With soft robotics, we will be able
to enhance and restore

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.851
agility and dexterity,

00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:56.768
and thereby help older people
maintain autonomy

00:09:56.792 --> 00:09:59.059
for longer parts of their lives.

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:01.583
Maybe we can call that
"robotics for antiaging"
