00:06:56.917 --> 00:07:00.101
Here you see a geometry
called Peano-HASEL actuators,

00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:02.417
one of many possible designs.

00:07:03.083 --> 00:07:06.684
Again, you take a flexible polymer
such as our Ziploc bag,

00:07:06.708 --> 00:07:09.643
you fill it with an insulating liquid,
such as olive oil,

00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:11.434
and now, instead of the glass plate,

00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:14.250
you place an electrical conductor
on one side of the pouch.

00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.601
To create something
that looks more like a muscle fiber,

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:19.601
you can connect a few pouches together

00:07:19.625 --> 00:07:21.768
and attached a weight on one side.

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:23.167
Next, we apply voltage.

00:07:24.083 --> 00:07:27.393
Now, the electric field
starts acting on the liquid.

00:07:27.417 --> 00:07:29.101
It displaces the liquid,

00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:31.125
and it forces the muscle to contract.
