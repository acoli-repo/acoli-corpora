00:08:57.375 --> 00:09:00.143
we are now able to build
soft continuum actuators

00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:03.292
that come closer and closer
to the capabilities of the real thing.

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:08.726
I am most excited
about the practical applications

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.559
of HASEL artificial muscles.

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.976
They'll enable soft robotic devices

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.351
that can improve the quality of life.

00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:19.184
Soft robotics will enable a new generation
of more lifelike prosthetics

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:21.434
for people who have lost
parts of their bodies.

00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:23.268
Here you see some HASELs in my lab,

00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:25.875
early testing,
driving a prosthetic finger.

00:09:27.542 --> 00:09:31.417
One day, we may even merge
our bodies with robotic parts.
