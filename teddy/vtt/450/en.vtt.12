HASEL artificial muscles
can be made invisible.

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:09.792
So how do HASEL artificial muscles work?

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:12.226
You might be surprised.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.434
They're based on very inexpensive,
easily available materials.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.726
You can even try, and I recommend it,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.083
the main principle at home.

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:22.643
Take a few Ziploc bags
and fill them with olive oil.

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:24.875
Try to push out air bubbles
as much as you can.

00:06:25.583 --> 00:06:28.684
Now take a glass plate
and place it on one side of the bag.

00:06:28.708 --> 00:06:30.917
When you press down,
you see the bag contract.
