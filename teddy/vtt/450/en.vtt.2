00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.309
to be low-cost, safe near people

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.184
and adaptable to unpredictable challenges.

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:06.976
We've made good progress
with the brains of robots,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.792
but their bodies are still primitive.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:12.643
This is my daughter Nadia.

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.393
She's only five years old

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:16.893
and she can get out of the car
way faster than HUBO.

00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:18.684
(Laughter)

00:01:18.708 --> 00:01:21.101
She can also swing around
on monkey bars with ease,

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:24.268
much better than any current
human-like robot could do.

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:25.643
In contrast to HUBO,

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:29.393
the human body makes extensive use
of soft and deformable materials

00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:31.351
such as muscle and skin.
