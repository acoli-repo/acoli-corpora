00:06:28.708 --> 00:06:30.917
When you press down,
you see the bag contract.

00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:34.458
Now the amount of contraction
is easy to control.

00:06:35.167 --> 00:06:37.976
When you take a small weight,
you get a small contraction.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.125
With a medium weight,
we get a medium contraction.

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:45.018
And with a large weight,
you get a large contraction.

00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:48.476
Now for HASELs, the only change
is to replace the force of your hand

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.518
or the weight with an electrical force.

00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:56.893
HASEL stands for "hydraulically amplified
self-healing electrostatic actuators."

00:06:56.917 --> 00:07:00.101
Here you see a geometry
called Peano-HASEL actuators,
