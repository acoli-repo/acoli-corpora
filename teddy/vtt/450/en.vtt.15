00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:31.125
and it forces the muscle to contract.

00:07:32.708 --> 00:07:35.184
Here you see a completed
Peano-HASEL actuator

00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:39.101
and how it expands and contracts
when voltage is applied.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.434
Viewed from the side,

00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:43.684
you can really see those pouches
take a more cylindrical shape,

00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:45.500
such as we saw with the Ziploc bags.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.726
We can also place a few
such muscle fibers next to each other

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.309
to create something that looks
even more like a muscle

00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:54.768
that also contracts and expands
in cross section.

00:07:54.792 --> 00:07:58.143
These HASELs here are lifting a weight
that's about 200 times heavier

00:07:58.167 --> 00:07:59.458
than their own weight.
