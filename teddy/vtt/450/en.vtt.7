WEBVTT

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:32.809
published by German physicist
Wilhelm Röntgen.

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:35.875
Most of you know him
as the discoverer of the X-ray.

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:39.851
Following his instructions,
we used a pair of needles.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.829
We connected it to a high-voltage source,

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:44.309
and we placed it near
a transparent piece of rubber

00:03:44.313 --> 00:03:46.397
that was prestretched
onto a plastic frame.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.018
When we switched on the voltage,

00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:50.351
the rubber deformed,

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:53.559
and just like our biceps flexes our arm,

00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:56.226
the rubber flexed the plastic frame.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.559
It looks like magic.

00:03:57.583 --> 00:03:59.934
The needles don't even touch the rubber.

00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.476
Now, having two such needles
is not a practical way
