00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:00.768
we could build almost any type of robot

00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:02.167
for almost any type of use.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:06.351
Not surprisingly,
people have tried for many decades

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:09.268
to replicate the astonishing
capabilities of muscle,

00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:10.625
but it's been really hard.

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:14.059
About 10 years ago,

00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:16.809
when I did my PhD back in Austria,

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:18.934
my colleagues and I rediscovered

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:23.101
what is likely one of the very first
publications on artificial muscle,

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:24.976
published in 1880.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.143
"On the shape and volume changes
of dielectric bodies

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:29.684
caused by electricity,"

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:32.809
published by German physicist
Wilhelm Röntgen.
