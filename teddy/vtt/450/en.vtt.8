00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.476
Now, having two such needles
is not a practical way

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.643
of operating artificial muscles,

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:07.809
but this amazing experiment
got me hooked on the topic.

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:10.851
I wanted to create new ways
to build artificial muscles

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.684
that would work well
for real-world applications.

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:17.434
For the next years, I worked
on a number of different technologies

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:18.767
that all showed promise,

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.833
but they all had remaining challenges
that are hard to overcome.

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.434
In 2015,

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:26.851
when I started my own lab at CU Boulder,

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:29.101
I wanted to try an entirely new idea.

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:32.018
I wanted to combine
the high speed and efficiency
