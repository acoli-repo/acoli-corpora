00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:31.976
it can grow strong enough
to move an elephant;

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.559
and it's adaptable enough
to be used in the extremely versatile arms

00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:36.893
of an octopus,

00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:40.250
an animal that can squeeze
its entire body through tiny holes.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.143
Actuators are for robots
what muscles are for animals:

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:47.018
key components of the body

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.583
that enable movement
and interaction with the world.

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:53.143
So if we could build soft actuators,

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:54.601
or artificial muscles,

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:56.226
that are as versatile, adaptable

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.809
and could have the same performance
as the real thing,

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:00.768
we could build almost any type of robot
