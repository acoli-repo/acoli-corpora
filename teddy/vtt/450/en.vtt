In 2015, 25 teams from around the world

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:07.768
competed to build robots
for disaster response

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:09.643
that could perform a number of tasks,

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:11.309
such as using a power tool,

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.018
working on uneven terrain

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:14.292
and driving a car.

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:17.333
That all sounds impressive, and it is,

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:21.250
but look at the body
of the winning robot, HUBO.

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:24.518
Here, HUBO is trying to get out of a car,

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:26.268
and keep in mind,

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.059
the video is sped up three times.

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:31.708
