00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:32.018
I wanted to combine
the high speed and efficiency

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.018
of electrically driven actuators

00:04:34.042 --> 00:04:36.792
with the versatility
of soft, fluidic actuators.

00:04:37.458 --> 00:04:38.768
Therefore, I thought,

00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:42.143
maybe I can try using
really old science in a new way.

00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:43.934
The diagram you see here

00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.518
shows an effect called Maxwell stress.

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:48.018
When you take two metal plates

00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:50.226
and place them in a container
filled with oil,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.893
and then switch on a voltage,

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:55.851
the Maxwell stress forces the oil
up in between the two plates,

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:57.351
and that's what you see here.

00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:58.726
So the key idea was,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.684
can we use this effect to push around oil
