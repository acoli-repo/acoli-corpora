(Laughter)

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.726
HUBO, from team KAIST out of Korea,
is a state-of-the-art robot

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.518
with impressive capabilities,

00:00:37.542 --> 00:00:39.684
but this body doesn't look
all that different

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:41.661
from robots we've seen a few decades ago.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.042
If you look at the other robots
in the competition,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.101
their movements also still look,
well, very robotic.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.351
Their bodies are complex
mechanical structures

00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:52.976
using rigid materials

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.601
such as metal and traditional
rigid electric motors.

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:58.226
They certainly weren't designed

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.309
to be low-cost, safe near people
