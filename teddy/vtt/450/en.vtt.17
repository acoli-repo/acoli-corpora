00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:30.309
This is also a very young technology.
We are just getting started.

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:33.101
We have many ideas how to
drastically improve performance,

00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:36.976
using new materials and new designs
to reach a level of performance

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.332
beyond biological muscle and also beyond
traditional rigid electric motors.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.643
Moving towards more complex designs
of HASEL for bio-inspired robotics,

00:08:45.667 --> 00:08:47.434
here you see our artificial scorpion

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:49.184
that can use its tail to hunt prey,

00:08:49.208 --> 00:08:50.726
in this case, a rubber balloon.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.393
(Laughter)

00:08:52.417 --> 00:08:54.518
Going back to our initial inspiration,

00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:57.351
the versatility of octopus arms
and elephant trunks,

00:08:57.375 --> 00:09:00.143
we are now able to build
soft continuum actuators
