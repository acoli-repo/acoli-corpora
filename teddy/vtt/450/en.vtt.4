to the astonishing capabilities
of the organisms found in nature.

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:06.143
I've always been particularly inspired
by biological muscle.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.309
Now, that's not surprising.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:11.934

(Laughter)

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.976
Biological muscle
is a true masterpiece of evolution.

for feedback on motion
and the environment.

It can contract fast enough
to power the high-speed wings

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.268
of a hummingbird;

00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:31.976
it can grow strong enough
to move an elephant;
