00:02:57.753 --> 00:03:01.217
If you run water into the right ventricle from a tap

00:03:01.217 --> 00:03:04.099
(the left also works, but less spectacularly),

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.992
you'll see that the ventricular valve

00:03:05.992 --> 00:03:09.061
tries to close against the incoming stream.

00:03:09.061 --> 00:03:11.480
And then ventricle inflates with water.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.891
Squeeze the ventricle and a stream of water

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:16.245
squirts out of the pulmonary artery.

00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:19.744
The ventricular valves, called the tricuspid in the right ventricle

00:03:19.744 --> 00:03:21.677
and the mitral in the left,

00:03:21.677 --> 00:03:23.369
can be seen through the clear water

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.798
opening and closing like parachutes

00:03:25.798 --> 00:03:28.542
as the ventricle is rhythmically squeezed.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:32.262
This flow of water mimics the flow of blood in life.
