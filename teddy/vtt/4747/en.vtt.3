00:01:29.012 --> 00:01:31.110
and another to the body and back.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.555
In reality, mammals have a figure-eight circulation.

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:37.213
Blood goes from one heart pump to the lungs,

00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:40.496
back to the second heart pump, which sends it to the body,

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:42.463
and then back to the first pump.

00:01:42.463 --> 00:01:43.967
That's an important difference

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:47.640
because it marks two completely different morphologies.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.520
This confusion makes many students

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.258
wary of the heart in biology lessons,

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:54.873
thinking it signals an intimidating subject

00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:57.773
full of complicated names and diagrams.

00:01:57.773 --> 00:02:00.066
Only those who end up studying medicine
