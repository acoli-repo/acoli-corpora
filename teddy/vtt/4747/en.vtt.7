00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:32.262
This flow of water mimics the flow of blood in life.

00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:34.290
The valves are completely efficient.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.081
You'll notice they don't leak at all when the ventricles are squeezed.

00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.868
Over time, they also close against each other

00:03:40.868 --> 00:03:42.769
with very little wear and tear,

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.009
which explains how this mechanism continues to work seamlessly

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:50.321
for more than 2 billion beats a heart gives in its lifetime.

00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:54.000
Now, anyone studying the heart can hold one in their hands,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.519
make it pump for real

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.446
and watch the action unfold.

00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:59.617
So place your hand above your own

00:03:59.617 --> 00:04:01.909
and feel its rhymic beat.
