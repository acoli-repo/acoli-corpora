00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:31.537
We can solve this problem in an extraordinarly simple way.

00:02:31.537 --> 00:02:35.119
Simply identify the two atria and cut them off,

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.099
trimming them down to the tops of the ventricles.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.362
This makes the heart look less complicated

00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:43.989
because the atria have several incoming veins attached.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.824
So without them there, the only vessels remaining

00:02:46.824 --> 00:02:48.943
are the two major heart arteries:

00:02:48.943 --> 00:02:51.326
the aorta and pulmonary artery,

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:54.834
which rise like white columns from between the ventricles.

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.753
It looks -- and really is -- very simple.

00:02:57.753 --> 00:03:01.217
If you run water into the right ventricle from a tap
