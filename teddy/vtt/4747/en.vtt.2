00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.227
It's as if there has been a centuries old conspiracy

00:01:02.227 --> 00:01:04.015
amongst teachers and students

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:07.376
to accept that heart function cannot be demonstrated.

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:09.039
Meaning that the next best thing

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.268
is simply to cut it open and label the parts.

00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:15.343
That way students might not fully grasp the way it works,

00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:18.075
but can superficially understand it,

00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:19.863
learning such concepts as

00:01:19.863 --> 00:01:22.132
the heart is a four-chambered organ,

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:24.350
or potentially misleading statements like,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.623
mammals have a dual-circulation:

00:01:26.623 --> 00:01:29.012
one with blood going to the lungs and back,

00:01:29.012 --> 00:01:31.110
and another to the body and back.
