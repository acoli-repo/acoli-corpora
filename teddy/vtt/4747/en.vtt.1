00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:30.916
But that fact wasn't always obvious,

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:33.287
because if a heart was exposed or taken out,

00:00:33.287 --> 00:00:35.138
the body would perish quickly.

00:00:35.138 --> 00:00:38.249
It's also impossible to see through the blood vessels,

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:39.952
and even if that were possible,

00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:41.749
the blood itself is opaque,

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:44.900
making it difficult to see the heart valves working.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.930
Even in the 21st century,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.227
only a few people in surgery teams

00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:52.034
have actually seen a working heart.

00:00:52.034 --> 00:00:54.012
Internet searches for heart function,

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.122
point to crude models, diagrams

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:59.674
or animations that don't really show how it works.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.227
It's as if there has been a centuries old conspiracy
