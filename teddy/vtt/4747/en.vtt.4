Only those who end up studying medicine

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:03.335
compeltely understand how it all actually works.

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:05.403
That's when its functions become apparent

00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:08.980
as medics get to observe the motion of the heart's valves.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.843
So, let's imagine you're a medic for a day.

00:02:11.843 --> 00:02:15.039
What you'll need to get started is a whole fresh heart,

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.468
like one from a sheep or pig.

00:02:17.468 --> 00:02:19.166
Immerse this heart in water

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:22.462
and you'll see that it doesn't pump when squeezed by hand.

00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:25.426
That's because water doesn't enter the heart cleanly enough

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:27.693
for the pumping mechanism to work.

00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:31.537
We can solve this problem in an extraordinarly simple way.
