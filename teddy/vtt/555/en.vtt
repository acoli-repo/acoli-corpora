00:00:01.714 --> 00:00:02.944
I'm a journalist.

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:05.223
And I know how frustrating it gets

00:00:05.247 --> 00:00:07.190
when most of your stories go unnoticed.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.577
I felt it when I worked
as a local reporter

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:12.507
in my hometown Belgaum, in India.

00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:16.725
I thought maybe joining
a national newspaper would help.

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:19.284
So I went through professional training

00:00:19.308 --> 00:00:22.150
and worked with India's
three national newspapers.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.953
During my five-year stint,
I used to travel for my stories.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:28.303
It was in early 2012

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:32.040
I traveled 1,000 miles from Mumbai
to a coastal village in south India.
