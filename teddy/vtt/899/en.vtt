00:00:00.635 --> 00:00:04.882
It is a dream of mankind
to fly like a bird.

00:00:04.906 --> 00:00:06.976
Birds are very agile.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.334
They fly, not with rotating components,

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:13.414
so they fly only by flapping their wings.

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.976
So we looked at the birds,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.343
and we tried to make a model
that is powerful, ultralight,

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:26.381
and it must have excellent
aerodynamic qualities

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:30.513
that would fly by its own
and only by flapping its wings.
