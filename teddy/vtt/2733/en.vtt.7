00:03:29.054 --> 00:03:32.140
and the more often people are helping
and sharing their knowledge

00:03:32.164 --> 00:03:33.317
and providing mentoring,

00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:36.118
the better organizations do
on every metric we can measure:

00:03:36.142 --> 00:03:38.973
higher profits, customer satisfaction,
employee retention --

00:03:38.997 --> 00:03:40.842
even lower operating expenses.

00:03:41.407 --> 00:03:44.275
So givers spend a lot of time
trying to help other people

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.506
and improve the team,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.006
and then, unfortunately,
they suffer along the way.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.698
I want to talk about what it takes

00:03:49.722 --> 00:03:53.043
to build cultures where givers
actually get to succeed.

00:03:53.564 --> 00:03:56.584
So I wondered, then, if givers
are the worst performers,

00:03:56.608 --> 00:03:58.436
who are the best performers?

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:02.088
Let me start with the good news:
it's not the takers.
