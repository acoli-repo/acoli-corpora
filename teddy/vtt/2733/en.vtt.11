00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:31.233
And I learned a great lesson about this
from Fortune's best networker.

00:05:32.993 --> 00:05:34.343
It's the guy, not the cat.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:35.527
(Laughter)

00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:37.307
His name is Adam Rifkin.

00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:39.543
He's a very successful serial entrepreneur

00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:42.361
who spends a huge amount
of his time helping other people.

00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:44.721
And his secret weapon
is the five-minute favor.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.920
Adam said, "You don't have to be
Mother Teresa or Gandhi

00:05:47.944 --> 00:05:49.127
to be a giver.

00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:51.654
You just have to find small ways
to add large value

00:05:51.678 --> 00:05:53.035
to other people's lives."

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:55.402
That could be as simple
as making an introduction

00:05:55.426 --> 00:05:58.357
between two people who could
benefit from knowing each other.

00:05:58.381 --> 00:06:01.718
It could be sharing your knowledge
or giving a little bit of feedback.
