00:00:00.837 --> 00:00:03.104
I want you to look
around the room for a minute

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:05.847
and try to find the most
paranoid person here --

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:06.935
(Laughter)

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:09.411

(Laughter)

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:11.853

Paranoia is caused by people
that I call "takers."

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:24.148
Takers are self-serving
in their interactions.

00:00:24.172 --> 00:00:26.433
It's all about what can you do for me.

00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:28.233
The opposite is a giver.

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:31.017
It's somebody who approaches
most interactions by asking,
