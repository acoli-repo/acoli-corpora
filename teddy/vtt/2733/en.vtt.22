00:11:00.006 --> 00:11:01.292
(Laughter)

00:11:01.316 --> 00:11:02.687
If that helps you.

00:11:02.711 --> 00:11:03.861
(Laughter)

00:11:04.424 --> 00:11:07.927
Disagreeable givers are the most
undervalued people in our organizations,

00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:10.543
because they're the ones
who give the critical feedback

00:11:10.567 --> 00:11:13.173
that no one wants to hear
but everyone needs to hear.

00:11:13.197 --> 00:11:15.685
We need to do a much better job
valuing these people

00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:17.497
as opposed to writing them off early,

00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:19.265
and saying, "Eh, kind of prickly,

00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:20.786
must be a selfish taker."

00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:24.608
The other combination we forget about
is the deadly one --

00:11:24.632 --> 00:11:27.314
the agreeable taker,
also known as the faker.

00:11:28.444 --> 00:11:30.509
This is the person
who's nice to your face,
