00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:30.146
And I found that most people
are right in the middle

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.636
between giving and taking.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.005
They choose this third style
called "matching."

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:37.374
If you're a matcher, you try to keep
an even balance of give and take:

00:01:37.398 --> 00:01:40.716
quid pro quo -- I'll do something
for you if you do something for me.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.121
And that seems like a safe way
to live your life.

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.329
But is it the most effective
and productive way to live your life?

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:48.817
The answer to that question
is a very definitive ...

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:49.999
maybe.

00:01:50.023 --> 00:01:51.249
(Laughter)

00:01:51.273 --> 00:01:53.452
I studied dozens of organizations,

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:54.651
thousands of people.

00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:58.227
I had engineers measuring
their productivity.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.606
(Laughter)
