00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:33.122
I believe that the most
meaningful way to succeed

00:12:33.146 --> 00:12:35.016
is to help other people succeed.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.711
And if we can spread that belief,

00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:39.386
we can actually turn paranoia upside down.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.573
There's a name for that.

00:12:40.597 --> 00:12:42.033
It's called "pronoia."

00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:44.722
Pronoia is the delusional belief

00:12:44.746 --> 00:12:47.346
that other people
are plotting your well-being.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.893
(Laughter)

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:53.461
That they're going around behind your back

00:12:53.485 --> 00:12:56.401
and saying exceptionally
glowing things about you.

00:12:57.647 --> 00:13:01.456
The great thing about a culture of givers
is that's not a delusion --
