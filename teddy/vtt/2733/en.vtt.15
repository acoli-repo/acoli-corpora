00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:30.699
you have a lot of frustrated givers
in your organization

00:07:30.723 --> 00:07:32.706
who would love to step up and contribute,

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.896
if they only knew
who could benefit and how.

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.211
But I think the most important thing,

00:07:37.235 --> 00:07:39.711
if you want to build a culture
of successful givers,

00:07:39.735 --> 00:07:42.537
is to be thoughtful about who
you let onto your team.

00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:45.577

00:07:45.601 --> 00:07:47.573
you should hire a bunch of givers.

But I was surprised to discover, actually,
that that was not right --

00:07:51.715 --> 00:07:54.190
that the negative impact
of a taker on a culture

00:07:54.214 --> 00:07:57.083
is usually double to triple
the positive impact of a giver.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.680
Think about it this way:

00:07:58.704 --> 00:08:00.368
one bad apple can spoil a barrel,
