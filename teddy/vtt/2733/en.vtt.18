Agreeable people are warm and friendly,
they're nice, they're polite.

00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:05.112
You find a lot of them in Canada --

00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:06.739
(Laughter)

00:09:06.763 --> 00:09:10.260
Where there was actually
a national contest

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:13.314
to come up with a new Canadian slogan
and fill in the blank,

00:09:13.338 --> 00:09:14.913
"As Canadian as ..."

00:09:14.937 --> 00:09:17.021
I thought the winning entry
was going to be,

00:09:17.045 --> 00:09:19.516
"As Canadian as maple syrup,"
or, "... ice hockey."

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.525
But no, Canadians voted
for their new national slogan to be --

00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:23.710
I kid you not --

00:09:23.734 --> 00:09:26.165
"As Canadian as possible
under the circumstances."

00:09:26.189 --> 00:09:29.402
(Laughter)
