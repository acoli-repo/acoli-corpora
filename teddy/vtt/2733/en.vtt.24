00:11:59.723 --> 00:12:02.897
And let's face it, you all know
you can learn a lot about character

00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:05.476
by watching how someone
treats their restaurant server

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.663
or their Uber driver.

00:12:07.319 --> 00:12:08.585
So if we do all this well,

00:12:08.609 --> 00:12:10.693
if we can weed takers
out of organizations,

00:12:10.717 --> 00:12:12.629
if we can make it safe to ask for help,

00:12:12.653 --> 00:12:14.667
if we can protect givers from burnout

00:12:14.691 --> 00:12:17.918
and make it OK for them to be ambitious
in pursuing their own goals

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:20.098
as well as trying to help other people,

00:12:20.122 --> 00:12:23.029
we can actually change the way
that people define success.

00:12:23.053 --> 00:12:26.405
Instead of saying it's all about
winning a competition,

00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:29.969
people will realize success
is really more about contribution.
