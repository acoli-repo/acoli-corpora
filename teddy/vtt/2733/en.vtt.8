00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:02.088
Let me start with the good news:
it's not the takers.

00:04:02.112 --> 00:04:05.767
Takers tend to rise quickly
but also fall quickly in most jobs.

00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:07.888
And they fall at the hands of matchers.

00:04:07.912 --> 00:04:11.332
If you're a matcher, you believe
in "An eye for an eye" -- a just world.

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:12.776
And so when you meet a taker,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.669
you feel like it's your mission in life

00:04:14.693 --> 00:04:16.735
to just punish the hell
out of that person.

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:17.773
(Laughter)

00:04:17.797 --> 00:04:19.422
And that way justice gets served.

00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:22.078
Well, most people are matchers.

00:04:22.102 --> 00:04:23.686
And that means if you're a taker,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.690
it tends to catch up with you eventually;

00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:27.352
what goes around will come around.

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:28.982
And so the logical conclusion is:

00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:31.871
it must be the matchers
who are the best performers.
