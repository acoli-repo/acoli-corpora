by a slightly different name.

00:10:41.828 --> 00:10:43.900
We forget about the other
two combinations.

00:10:43.924 --> 00:10:47.259
There are disagreeable givers
in our organizations.

00:10:47.283 --> 00:10:49.924

00:10:54.476 --> 00:10:56.082
"Oh, disagreeable givers --

00:10:56.106 --> 00:10:59.982
like somebody with a bad user interface
but a great operating system."
