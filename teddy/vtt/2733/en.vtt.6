00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:00.724
(Laughter)

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:01.976
So just out of curiosity,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.284
how many of you self-identify more
as givers than takers or matchers?

00:03:05.308 --> 00:03:06.458
Raise your hands.

00:03:06.962 --> 00:03:09.911
OK, it would have been more
before we talked about these data.

00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:14.152
But actually, it turns out
there's a twist here,

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:17.472
because givers are often
sacrificing themselves,

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:19.675
but they make their organizations better.

00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.112
We have a huge body of evidence --

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:26.869
many, many studies looking
at the frequency of giving behavior

00:03:26.893 --> 00:03:29.030
that exists in a team
or an organization --

00:03:29.054 --> 00:03:32.140
and the more often people are helping
and sharing their knowledge
