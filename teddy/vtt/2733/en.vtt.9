00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:31.871
it must be the matchers
who are the best performers.

00:04:31.895 --> 00:04:33.413
But they're not.

00:04:33.437 --> 00:04:36.287
In every job, in every organization
I've ever studied,

00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:38.473
the best results belong
to the givers again.

00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:42.809
Take a look at some data I gathered
from hundreds of salespeople,

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:43.986
tracking their revenue.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.665
What you can see is that the givers
go to both extremes.

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.907
They make up the majority of people
who bring in the lowest revenue,

00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:51.397
but also the highest revenue.

00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:54.025
The same patterns were true
for engineers' productivity

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:55.440
and medical students' grades.

00:04:55.464 --> 00:04:58.071
Givers are overrepresented
at the bottom and at the top

00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:00.177
of every success metric that I can track.
