00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.606
(Laughter)

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.599
I looked at medical students' grades --

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.598
even salespeople's revenue.

00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:07.068
(Laughter)

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:08.744
And, unexpectedly,

00:02:08.768 --> 00:02:12.437
the worst performers in each
of these jobs were the givers.

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:14.793
The engineers who got the least work done

00:02:14.817 --> 00:02:17.323
were the ones who did more favors
than they got back.

00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:19.483
They were so busy doing
other people's jobs,

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:23.057
they literally ran out of time and energy
to get their own work completed.

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:25.886
In medical school, the lowest grades
belong to the students

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.017
who agree most strongly
with statements like,

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.249
"I love helping others,"
