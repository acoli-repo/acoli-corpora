[So in all your relationships,
you always have to be the giver?]

00:06:30.292 --> 00:06:31.316
(Laughter)

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.071
What you see with successful givers

00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:36.215
is they recognize that it's OK
to be a receiver, too.

00:06:36.754 --> 00:06:39.617
If you run an organization,
we can actually make this easier.

00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:41.938

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:54.080
where it was the norm,

00:06:54.104 --> 00:06:56.479
was there was just one nurse
whose sole job it was

00:06:56.503 --> 00:06:58.534
to help other nurses on the unit.

00:06:58.558 --> 00:06:59.939
When that role was available,

00:06:59.963 --> 00:07:03.620
