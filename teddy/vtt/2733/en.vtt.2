00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:01.915
This is the only thing I will say today
that has no data behind it,

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:05.371
but I am convinced the longer it takes
for you to laugh at this cartoon,

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:07.822
the more worried we should be
that you're a taker.

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:08.911
(Laughter)

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.967
Of course, not all takers are narcissists.

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:13.879
Some are just givers who got burned
one too many times.

00:01:13.903 --> 00:01:17.227
Then there's another kind of taker
that we won't be addressing today,

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.104
and that's called a psychopath.

00:01:19.128 --> 00:01:20.279
(Laughter)

00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:23.175
I was curious, though, about how
common these extremes are,

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:26.008
and so I surveyed over 30,000
people across industries

00:01:26.032 --> 00:01:27.644
around the world's cultures.

00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:30.146
And I found that most people
are right in the middle
