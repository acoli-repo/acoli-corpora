one bad apple can spoil a barrel,

00:08:00.392 --> 00:08:03.218
but one good egg
just does not make a dozen.

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.494
I don't know what that means --

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:06.637
(Laughter)

00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:08.034
But I hope you do.

00:08:08.058 --> 00:08:11.380
No -- let even one taker into a team,

00:08:11.404 --> 00:08:14.258
and you will see that the givers
will stop helping.

00:08:14.648 --> 00:08:17.578
They'll say, "I'm surrounded
by a bunch of snakes and sharks.

00:08:17.602 --> 00:08:18.968
Why should I contribute?"

00:08:18.992 --> 00:08:20.968
Whereas if you let one giver into a team,

00:08:20.992 --> 00:08:23.114
you don't get an explosion of generosity.

00:08:23.138 --> 00:08:24.559
More often, people are like,

00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:26.721
"Great! That person can do all our work."

00:08:27.077 --> 00:08:29.823
So, effective hiring and screening
and team building

00:08:29.847 --> 00:08:31.983
is not about bringing in the givers;
