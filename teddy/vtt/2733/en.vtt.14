nurses said, "It's not embarrassing,
it's not vulnerable to ask for help --

00:07:03.644 --> 00:07:05.024
it's actually encouraged."

00:07:06.263 --> 00:07:09.089
Help-seeking isn't important
just for protecting the success

00:07:09.113 --> 00:07:10.512
and the well-being of givers.

00:07:10.536 --> 00:07:13.468
It's also critical to getting
more people to act like givers,

00:07:13.492 --> 00:07:14.681
because the data say

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:18.105
that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent
of all giving in organizations

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:19.407
starts with a request.

00:07:19.996 --> 00:07:21.444
But a lot of people don't ask.

00:07:21.468 --> 00:07:23.216
They don't want to look incompetent,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.267
they don't know where to turn,
they don't want to burden others.

00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:28.000
Yet if nobody ever asks for help,

00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:30.699
you have a lot of frustrated givers
in your organization
