00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.391
Now for those of you
who are highly agreeable,

00:09:32.415 --> 00:09:33.808
or maybe slightly Canadian,

00:09:33.832 --> 00:09:35.205
you get this right away.

00:09:35.229 --> 00:09:37.046
How could I ever say I'm any one thing

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.896
when I'm constantly adapting
to try to please other people?

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.223
Disagreeable people do less of it.

00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:45.184
They're more critical,
skeptical, challenging,

00:09:45.208 --> 00:09:48.262
and far more likely than their peers
to go to law school.

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:49.429
(Laughter)

00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:52.108
That's not a joke,
that's actually an empirical fact.

00:09:52.132 --> 00:09:53.191
(Laughter)

00:09:53.215 --> 00:09:55.764
So I always assumed
that agreeable people were givers

00:09:55.788 --> 00:09:57.735
and disagreeable people were takers.

00:09:57.759 --> 00:09:59.189
But then I gathered the data,

00:09:59.213 --> 00:10:02.326
and I was stunned to find
no correlation between those traits,
