It could be sharing your knowledge
or giving a little bit of feedback.

00:06:01.742 --> 00:06:04.054
Or It might be even something
as basic as saying,

00:06:04.078 --> 00:06:05.307
"You know,

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.831
I'm going to try and figure out

00:06:06.855 --> 00:06:09.884
if I can recognize somebody
whose work has gone unnoticed."

00:06:10.462 --> 00:06:12.756
And those five-minute favors
are really critical

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.502
to helping givers set boundaries
and protect themselves.

00:06:15.962 --> 00:06:17.407
The second thing that matters

00:06:17.431 --> 00:06:19.899
if you want to build a culture
where givers succeed,

00:06:19.923 --> 00:06:22.848
is you actually need a culture
where help-seeking is the norm;

00:06:22.872 --> 00:06:24.052
where people ask a lot.

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:27.205
This may hit a little too close
to home for some of you.

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.268
[So in all your relationships,
you always have to be the giver?]
