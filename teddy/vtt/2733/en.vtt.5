00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.249
"I love helping others,"

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:33.292
which suggests the doctor
you ought to trust

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:36.395
is the one who came to med school
with no desire to help anybody.

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:37.446
(Laughter)

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.828
And then in sales, too,
the lowest revenue accrued

00:02:39.852 --> 00:02:41.547
in the most generous salespeople.

00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:44.001
I actually reached out
to one of those salespeople

00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:45.632
who had a very high giver score.

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:48.214
And I asked him, "Why do
you suck at your job --"

00:02:48.238 --> 00:02:49.779
I didn't ask it that way, but --

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:50.847
(Laughter)

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:53.223
"What's the cost of generosity in sales?"

00:02:53.247 --> 00:02:56.513
And he said, "Well, I just care
so deeply about my customers

00:02:56.537 --> 00:02:59.299
that I would never sell them
one of our crappy products."

00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:00.724
(Laughter)
