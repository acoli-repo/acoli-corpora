00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:00.177
of every success metric that I can track.

00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:01.503
Which raises the question:

00:05:01.527 --> 00:05:04.936
How do we create a world
where more of these givers get to excel?

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.783
I want to talk about how to do that,
not just in businesses,

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.638
but also in nonprofits, schools --

00:05:09.662 --> 00:05:10.955
even governments.

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.185
Are you ready?

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:13.395
(Cheers)

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.411
I was going to do it anyway,
but I appreciate the enthusiasm.

00:05:16.435 --> 00:05:17.458
(Laughter)

00:05:17.482 --> 00:05:19.326
The first thing that's really critical

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.097
is to recognize that givers
are your most valuable people,

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.555
but if they're not careful, they burn out.

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:27.069
So you have to protect
the givers in your midst.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:31.233
And I learned a great lesson about this
from Fortune's best networker.
