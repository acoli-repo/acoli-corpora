Some of us don't even know
that we are intersex.

00:02:01.072 --> 00:02:02.914
Like the X-Men,

00:02:02.938 --> 00:02:06.591
some of our traits are obvious at birth

00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:12.023
and others turn up around the time
when puberty is supposed to kick in.

00:02:13.957 --> 00:02:15.676
When we find out we are intersex,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.389
some of us believe
we are the only ones in the world.

00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:27.041
Me, specifically, I have XY chromosomes,

00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:30.663
which you may have understood
to be typically male.
