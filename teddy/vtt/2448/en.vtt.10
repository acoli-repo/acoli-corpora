00:05:00.314 --> 00:05:04.157
Secrecy is enforced
and shame is a close shadow.

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:07.204
In the law,

00:05:07.228 --> 00:05:11.711
intersex people fall
outside of categorization,

00:05:11.735 --> 00:05:14.131
and more importantly, protection.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.632
This concerns the banal tasks --

00:05:17.656 --> 00:05:20.277
if you can imagine the number
of forms you've filled out

00:05:20.301 --> 00:05:22.847
that you had to check "M" of "F" on --

00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:27.297
to lacking protection under any law,

00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:30.893
specifically, the Gender
Recognition or Equality Act.
