Intersex people are thought to make up

00:03:01.788 --> 00:03:04.476
That means more, depending
on where you are in the world,

00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:08.983
We are in front of you, getting coffee;

00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:10.965
we are sitting next to you on the train;

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.854
we are swiping you left and right
on dating apps --

00:03:13.878 --> 00:03:16.784

So why haven't you heard of us?

00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:25.699
If we are so common, why don't you see us?

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.436
How has the world responded to us?
