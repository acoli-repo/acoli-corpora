The instinct to protect children
is instinctive and it's admirable,

00:12:30.849 --> 00:12:35.096
but the truth is that love, acceptance

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.219
and refusing to bathe that child in shame

00:12:38.243 --> 00:12:43.323
will protect them more than trying
to fix something that isn't broken.

00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:49.442
This is why it is in our interest
to protect intersex people

00:12:49.466 --> 00:12:51.385
and make them visible.

00:12:52.302 --> 00:12:57.358
For as long as societies reinforce
one form of acceptable,

00:12:57.382 --> 00:12:59.436
of "normal,"

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.333
everyone will face insecurity
for being different in any way.
