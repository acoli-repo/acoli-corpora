00:01:26.923 --> 00:01:30.487
what we're taught in schools
that sex is binary,

00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:33.326
just male and female --

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.755
is not correct.

00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:37.421
Like most things in this world,

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:40.124
it is much more complicated than that.

00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:46.444
Intersex people who fall
outside of this false sex binary

00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:49.871
have always existed,
throughout human history.

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.761
Like the wizards of "Harry Potter,"

00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:56.374
we are pretty much invisible.

00:01:57.406 --> 00:02:00.016
Some of us don't even know
that we are intersex.
