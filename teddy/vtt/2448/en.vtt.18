The current approach to intersex people
stems from a now-debunked academic study

00:09:00.828 --> 00:09:02.924
from a man who, over 50 years ago,

00:09:02.948 --> 00:09:07.345
believed that you could
raise a child in any gender

00:09:07.369 --> 00:09:10.377
by changing their genitals,
never telling them

00:09:10.401 --> 00:09:14.095
and reinforcing that gender
over and over again.

00:09:15.603 --> 00:09:22.166
It also stems from referring to healthy
intersex variations as abnormal

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.650
or disordered.

00:09:24.578 --> 00:09:26.038
This makes sense.

00:09:26.062 --> 00:09:29.923
If you refer to something as a disorder,
it suggests there's a fix.
