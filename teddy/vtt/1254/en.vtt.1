00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But the amazing thing about cities

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is they're worth so much more

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
than it costs to build them.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So we could easily supply the world

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
with dozens, maybe hundreds,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
of new cities.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now this might sound preposterous to you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
if you've never thought about new cities.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But just substitute apartment building for cities.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the other half aren't there yet.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You could try and expand the capacity

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
by doing additions on all the existing apartments.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But you know what you'd run into
