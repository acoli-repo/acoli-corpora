In 2007,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I decided that we needed to reconceptualize

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
how we thought about economic development.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Our new goal should be

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
they should be able to choose between

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
at least a handful

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of different cities

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that were all competing to attract new residents.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There are billions of people in developing countries

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But the amazing thing about cities
