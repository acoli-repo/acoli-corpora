You might think that working remotely
is an introvert's dream:

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:06.494
you're in your own home
hidden behind a computer,

00:00:06.518 --> 00:00:08.203
possibly in your pajamas.

00:00:08.227 --> 00:00:09.396
But the truth is,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.365
for many introverts,
remote work is kind of a nightmare.

Now that the pandemic
has chased many of us out of our offices,

00:00:21.444 --> 00:00:24.194
we're chafing under the new
remote rules of work:

00:00:24.218 --> 00:00:25.615
too much screen time;

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:28.702
a lack of boundaries
between work and home;

00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:30.146
endless video calls.
