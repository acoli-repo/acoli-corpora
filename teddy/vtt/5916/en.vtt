You’ve filled up your cart and made 
it to the front of the grocery line

00:00:10.938 --> 00:00:13.878
when you’re confronted 
with yet another choice:

00:00:13.878 --> 00:00:16.568
what kind of bag should you use?

00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:19.958
If you’ve seen the images of plastic bags
strewn across the ocean,

00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.348

is bad for the environment.

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:27.118
Surely a paper bag or a cotton tote
would be the better option.

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:28.968
But is that really true?

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:32.548
Each of these three materials 
has a unique environmental impact
