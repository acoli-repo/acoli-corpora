00:10:29.606 --> 00:10:32.109
Therefore, protecting the high seas

00:10:32.133 --> 00:10:35.666
would have ecological, economic
and social benefits.

00:10:36.395 --> 00:10:38.704
But the truth is that most
fishing companies

00:10:38.728 --> 00:10:40.593
don't care about the environment.

00:10:40.617 --> 00:10:44.283
But they would make more money
by not fishing in the high seas.

00:10:44.307 --> 00:10:49.776
And this would not affect our ability
to feed our growing population,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.909
because the high seas provide only
five percent of the global marine catch,

00:10:56.184 --> 00:10:59.644
because the high seas are not
as productive as near-shore waters.
