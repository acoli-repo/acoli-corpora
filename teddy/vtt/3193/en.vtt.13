My colleague, Juan Mayorga,

00:06:31.597 --> 00:06:33.823
at the University of California,
Santa Barbara,

00:06:33.847 --> 00:06:36.037
has produced detailed
maps of fishing effort,

00:06:36.061 --> 00:06:39.040
which means how much time
and fuel is spent fishing

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:40.997
in every pixel in the ocean.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.814
We have a map for every country.

00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:48.109
China, Taiwan, Japan,
Korea and Spain alone

00:06:48.133 --> 00:06:51.957
account for almost 80 percent
of the fishing in the high seas.

00:06:52.768 --> 00:06:55.403
When we put all of the countries together,

00:06:55.427 --> 00:06:56.760
this is what we get.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:03.363
Because we know the identity
of every boat in the database,
