00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:30.321
These are places
where you jump in the water

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:33.012
and are immediately surrounded by sharks.

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:34.480
(Laughter)

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:36.137
And this is good,

00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:40.053
because the sharks are a good indicator
of the health of the ecosystem.

00:02:40.998 --> 00:02:43.450
These places are time machines

00:02:43.474 --> 00:02:45.958
that take us to the ocean
of 1,000 years ago.

00:02:46.553 --> 00:02:50.164
But they also show us
what the future ocean could be like.

00:02:51.097 --> 00:02:55.161
Because the ocean has extraordinary
regenerative power,

00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:57.986
we have seen great recovery
in just a few years.

00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:02.112
We just need to protect
many more places at risk
