00:01:57.053 --> 00:02:01.688
In the last 10 years, our team
at National Geographic Pristine Seas

00:02:01.712 --> 00:02:04.950
has explored, surveyed and documented

00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:07.815
some of the wildest places
left in the ocean

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:10.299
and worked with governments
to protect them.

00:02:10.704 --> 00:02:15.085
These are all now protected, covering
a total area half the size of Canada.

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:20.934
(Applause)

00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:26.605
These places are the Yellowstones
and the Serengetis of the sea.

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:30.321
These are places
where you jump in the water
