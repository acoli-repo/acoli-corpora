like tuna sashimi or shark fin soup.

00:11:09.895 --> 00:11:14.306
The high seas catch does not contribute
to global food security.

00:11:16.117 --> 00:11:17.537
So how are we going to do it?

00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:19.998
How are we going to protect the high seas?

00:11:20.022 --> 00:11:22.625
As we speak, negotiators
at the United Nations

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:26.314
are beginning discussions
on a new agreement to do just that.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.662
But this cannot happen
behind closed doors.
