Red colors mean we are losing money
by fishing in that part of the ocean.

00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.841
Blue colors mean it's profitable.

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:08.769
Here it is.

00:08:09.707 --> 00:08:11.746
It seems mostly profitable.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:16.107
But there are two more factors
we have to take into account.

00:08:16.635 --> 00:08:20.206
First, recent investigations reveal

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.712
the use of forced labor, or slave labor,

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:25.045
in high seas fishing.

00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:29.180
Companies use it to cut costs,
to generate profits.
