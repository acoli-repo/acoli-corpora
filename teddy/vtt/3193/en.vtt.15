00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:31.926
we know how much every country
is actually fishing.

00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:35.513
And we know the price of the fish
as it comes off the vessel.

00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:38.403
Combined with the data on effort,

00:07:38.427 --> 00:07:42.137
we have been able to map
the revenue of fishing the high seas.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.315
The darker the blue,
the higher the revenue.

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:48.249
We have costs, and we have revenue.

00:07:48.887 --> 00:07:50.506
So for the first time,

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.658
we have been able to map the profitability
of fishing in the high seas.

00:07:56.863 --> 00:07:58.394
Now I'm going to show you a map.

00:07:58.712 --> 00:08:03.906
Red colors mean we are losing money
by fishing in that part of the ocean.
