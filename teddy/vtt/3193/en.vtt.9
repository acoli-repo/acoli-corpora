00:04:26.623 --> 00:04:33.062
have nets so large
that they can hold a dozen 747 jets.

00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:39.211
These huge nets destroy
everything in their paths --

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:42.568
including deep corals
that grow on sea mounds,

00:04:42.592 --> 00:04:45.260
which can be thousands of years old.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:48.593
And fishing near the surface
targets mostly species

00:04:48.617 --> 00:04:51.656
that migrate between
the high seas and country's waters,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.080
like tuna and sharks.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.077
And many of these species are threatened
because of too much fishing

00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:58.368
and bad management.

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:01.333
Now, who fishes in the high seas?
