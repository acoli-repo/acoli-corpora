00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:02.112
We just need to protect
many more places at risk

00:03:02.136 --> 00:03:05.336
so they can become wild
and full of life again.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.997
But today, only two percent of the ocean

00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:13.621
is fully protected from fishing
and other activities.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.496
And that's not enough.

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.219
Studies suggest that we need at least
30 percent of the ocean under protection

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:24.260
not just to save marine life,
but to save us, too.

00:03:24.284 --> 00:03:29.683
Because the ocean gives us more than half
of the oxygen we breathe, food,

00:03:29.707 --> 00:03:32.204
it absorbs much of the carbon pollution
