00:03:29.707 --> 00:03:32.204
it absorbs much of the carbon pollution

00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:34.115
that we throw in the atmosphere.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.433
We need a healthy ocean to survive.

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.767
Now, is there a way
to accelerate ocean protection?

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.640
I think so.

00:03:45.077 --> 00:03:48.799
And it involves us looking
at the high seas.

00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:50.776
Now, what are the high seas?

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.315
Now coastal countries have authority
over 200 nautical miles from shore.

00:03:57.187 --> 00:04:01.141
Everything beyond those areas
are called the high seas.
