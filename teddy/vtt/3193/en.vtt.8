00:03:57.187 --> 00:04:01.141
Everything beyond those areas
are called the high seas.

00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:02.831
In dark blue on this map.

00:04:03.363 --> 00:04:05.791
No country owns the high seas,

00:04:05.815 --> 00:04:08.125
no country is responsible for them,

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.315
but they all are, so it's a little
like the Wild West.

00:04:11.923 --> 00:04:14.621
And there are two main types
of fishing in the high seas.

00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:17.026
At the bottom and near the surface.

00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:22.431
Bottom trawling is the most
destructive practice in the world.

00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:26.599
Super trawlers, the largest
fishing vessels in the ocean,

00:04:26.623 --> 00:04:33.062
have nets so large
that they can hold a dozen 747 jets.
