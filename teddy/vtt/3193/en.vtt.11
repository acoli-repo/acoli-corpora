00:05:27.854 --> 00:05:30.188
over the course of a year,

00:05:30.212 --> 00:05:33.612
using a satellite automated
identification system.

00:05:34.386 --> 00:05:38.637
This is a long-liner, fishing
around the southern coast of Africa.

00:05:39.457 --> 00:05:44.101
After a few months fishing there,
the boat goes to Japan to resupply,

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:47.609
and shortly after, here it is,
fishing around Madagascar.

00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:53.696
This is a Russian trawler
fishing, probably, for cod,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.934
in Russian waters,

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.025
and then across the high seas
of the north Atlantic.

00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:01.006
