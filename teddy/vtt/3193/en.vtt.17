00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:35.467
And second, every year,
governments subsidize high seas fishing

00:08:35.491 --> 00:08:37.892
with more than four billion dollars.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.008
Let's go back to the map of profits.

00:08:41.032 --> 00:08:43.308
If we assume fair wages,

00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:45.849
which means not slave labor,

00:08:45.873 --> 00:08:50.166
and we remove the subsidies
from our calculation,

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.243
the map turns into this.

00:08:53.807 --> 00:08:59.838
Fishing is truly profitable in only half
of the high seas fishing grounds.
