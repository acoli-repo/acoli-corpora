00:09:00.992 --> 00:09:03.261
In fact, on aggregate,

00:09:03.285 --> 00:09:07.317
subsidies are four times
larger than the profits.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.032
So we have five countries doing
most of the fishing in the high seas

00:09:12.056 --> 00:09:15.572
and the economics are dependent
on huge government subsidies,

00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:19.063
and for some countries,
on human rights violations.

00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:22.354
What this economic analysis reveals,

00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:26.107
is that practically the entire high seas
fishing proposition is misguided.

00:09:26.647 --> 00:09:30.418
What sane government
would subsidize an industry
