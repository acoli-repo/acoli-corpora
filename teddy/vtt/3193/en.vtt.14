00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:03.363
Because we know the identity
of every boat in the database,

00:07:03.387 --> 00:07:07.728
we know its size, its tonnage,
the power of its engines,

00:07:07.752 --> 00:07:09.485
how many crew are on board.

00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:14.547
With this information, we can calculate
fuel costs, labor costs, etc.

00:07:15.157 --> 00:07:17.087
So for the first time,

00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:21.361
we have been able to map
the costs of fishing in the high seas.

00:07:22.315 --> 00:07:25.049
The darker the red, the higher the costs.

00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:28.847
Thanks to our colleagues
at the University of British Columbia,

00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:31.926
we know how much every country
is actually fishing.
