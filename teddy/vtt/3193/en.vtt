If you were to jump
into any random spot in the ocean,

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:08.134
you would probably see
something like this.

00:00:08.897 --> 00:00:11.134
Empty of large animals.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.236
Because we have taken them
out of the water

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.577
faster than they can reproduce.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.141
Today I want to propose a strategy
to save ocean life,

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:23.625
and the solution has
a lot to do with economics.

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:28.410
In 1999, a little place
called Cabo Pulmo in Mexico

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:30.101
was an underwater desert.
