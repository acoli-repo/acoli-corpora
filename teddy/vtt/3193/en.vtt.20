A modeling study from colleagues
at UC Santa Barbara,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.879
suggests that such reserve
would help migratory species like tuna

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.553
recover in the high seas.

00:10:05.577 --> 00:10:09.858
And part of that increased abundance would
spill over into the countries' waters,

00:10:09.882 --> 00:10:11.636
helping to replenish them.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.731
That would also increase
the catch in these waters,

00:10:14.755 --> 00:10:16.072
and so would the profits,

00:10:16.096 --> 00:10:18.351
because the cost of fishing
would be lowered.

00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:21.372
And the ecological benefits would be huge,

00:10:22.463 --> 00:10:25.755
because these species of large predators,
like tuna and sharks,

00:10:25.779 --> 00:10:28.741
are key to the health
of the entire ecosystem.

00:10:29.606 --> 00:10:32.109
Therefore, protecting the high seas
