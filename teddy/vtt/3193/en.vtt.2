00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.592
What had been an underwater barren

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:05.116
was now a kaleidoscope of life and color.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.680
We saw it back to pristine
in only 10 years.

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:10.918
Including the return
of the large predators,

00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:14.204
like the groupers, the sharks, the jacks.

00:01:14.823 --> 00:01:17.220
And those visionary fishermen

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.728
are making much more money
now, from tourism.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:25.901
Now, when we can align
economic needs with conservation,

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:27.258
miracles can happen.

00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:31.274
And we have seen similar recoveries
all over the world.
