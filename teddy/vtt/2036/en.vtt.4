00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:01.726
Go space, space.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.631
It is totally amazing.

00:02:03.938 --> 00:02:06.952
Also when it comes
to cell phones, on all phones,

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:10.562
if you want to redial
somebody that you've dialed before,

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:13.107
all you have to do is hit the call button,

00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:16.702
and it puts the last phone number
into the box for you,

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:19.857
and at that point you can hit
call again to actually dial it.

00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:23.405
No need to go to the recent calls list
if you're trying to call somebody

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:24.920
just hit the call button again.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.427
Something that drives me crazy:

00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:29.046
When I call you and leave a message
on your voice mail,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.840
I hear you saying, "Leave a message,"
