WEBVTT

00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:01.285
for the person you're calling.

00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:04.107
I didn't say these were going
to be perfect.

00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:06.306
So most of you think of Google

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.582
as something that lets you
look up a web page,

00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:09.976
but it is also a dictionary.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.592
Type the word "define"
and the word you want to know.

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:14.441
You don't even have to click anything.

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:16.521
There's the definition as you type.

00:03:16.545 --> 00:03:18.576
It's also a complete FAA database.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.684
Type the name of the airline
and the flight.

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.407
It shows you where the flight is,
the gate, the terminal,

00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:24.717
how long until it lands.

00:03:24.741 --> 00:03:26.152
You don't need an app.

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:28.143
It's also unit and currency conversion.

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:30.790
Again, you don't have to click
one of the results.
