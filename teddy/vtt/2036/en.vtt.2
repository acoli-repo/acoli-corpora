00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:00.979
in every kind of computer.

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:04.725
Also on the web, when you're filling in
one of these forms like your addresses,

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:06.958
I assume you know
that you can hit the Tab key

00:01:06.982 --> 00:01:08.561
to jump from box to box to box.

But what about the pop-up menu
where you put in your state?

00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:13.660

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:24.830
If you want Texas, go T, T,
and you jump right to that thing

00:01:24.854 --> 00:01:26.918
without even opening the pop-up menu.

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:30.162
Also on the web,
when the text is too small,
