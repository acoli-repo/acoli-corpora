00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:30.124
Just by osmosis.

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:33.040
Nobody ever sits down and tells you,
"This is how it works."

00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:36.017
So today I'm going to tell you ten things

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:39.407
that you thought everybody knew,
but it turns out they don't.

00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:42.217
First of all, on the web,
if you want to scroll down,

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.482
don't pick up the mouse
and use the scroll bar.

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:46.033
That's a terrible waste of time.

00:00:46.057 --> 00:00:48.097
Do that only if you're paid by the hour.

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:49.998
Instead, hit the space bar.

00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:53.861
The space bar scrolls down one page.

00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:56.766
Hold down the Shift key
to scroll back up again.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.702
So, space bar to scroll down one page;
works in every browser,

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:00.979
in every kind of computer.
