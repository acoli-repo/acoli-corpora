I've noticed something interesting
about society and culture.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.868
Everything risky requires a license.

00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:10.848
So, learning to drive,
owning a gun, getting married.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.511
There's a certain --

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:14.835

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:28.873

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:30.124
Just by osmosis.
