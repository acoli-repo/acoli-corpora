Again, you don't have to click

Just type it into the box,
and there's your answer.

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.134
While we're talking about text --

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:37.959
When you want to highlight --

00:03:38.712 --> 00:03:40.078
this is just an example --

00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:41.966
(Laughter)

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.249
When you want to highlight a word,

please don't waste your life
dragging across it

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:48.677

00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:50.335

Watch "200" -- I go double-click,

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:53.753

00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:56.494
Also, don't delete
what you've highlighted.

00:03:56.518 --> 00:03:57.891
You can just type over it.

00:03:57.915 --> 00:03:59.445
This is in every program.

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.460
Also, you can go double-click, drag,
