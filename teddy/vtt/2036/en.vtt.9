00:04:26.383 --> 00:04:30.357
So, that's because the camera needs time
to calculate the focus and exposure,

00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:33.242
but if you pre-focus with a half-press,

00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:35.032
leave your finger down --

00:04:35.056 --> 00:04:36.300
no shutter lag!

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.414
You get it every time.

00:04:39.438 --> 00:04:43.622
I've just turned your $50 camera
into a $1,000 camera with that trick.

And finally, it often happens
that you're giving a talk,

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.011
and for some reason,
the audience is looking at the slide

00:04:50.035 --> 00:04:51.293
instead of at you!

00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:53.691
(Laughter)

00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:56.618
So when that happens --
this works in Keynote, PowerPoint,

00:04:56.642 --> 00:04:59.653
it works in every program
-- all you do is hit the letter B key,

00:04:59.677 --> 00:05:03.230
B for blackout, to black out the slide,
make everybody look at you,
