B for blackout, to black out the slide,
make everybody look at you,

00:05:03.254 --> 00:05:05.733
and then when you're ready
to go on, you hit B again,

00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:10.220
and if you're really on a roll,
you can hit the W key for "whiteout,"

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:11.955
and you white out the slide,

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.620
and then you can hit W again
to un-blank it.

00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:16.254
So I know I went super fast.

00:05:16.278 --> 00:05:19.722
If you missed anything, I'll be happy
to send you the list of these tips.

00:05:19.746 --> 00:05:21.321
In the meantime, congratulations.

00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:23.778
You all get your California
Technology License.

00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:25.014
Have a great day.

00:05:25.038 --> 00:05:27.772
