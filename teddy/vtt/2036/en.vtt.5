00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.840
I hear you saying, "Leave a message,"

00:02:30.864 --> 00:02:34.221
and then I get these 15 seconds
of freaking instructions,

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:37.909
like we haven't had
answering machines for 45 years!

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:41.597
(Laughter)

00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:43.074
I'm not bitter.

00:02:43.098 --> 00:02:44.105
(Laughter)

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.341
So it turns out
there's a keyboard shortcut

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.723
that lets you jump directly
to the beep like this.

00:02:48.747 --> 00:02:50.334
Phone: At the tone, please...

00:02:50.358 --> 00:02:51.359
(Beep)

00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:53.873
David Pogue: Unfortunately,
the carriers didn't adopt

00:02:53.897 --> 00:02:56.338
the same keystroke,
so it's different by carrier,

00:02:56.362 --> 00:02:59.403
so it devolves upon you
to learn the keystroke

00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:01.285
for the person you're calling.
