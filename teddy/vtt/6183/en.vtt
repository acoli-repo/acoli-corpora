Jenni Chang: When I told
my parents I was gay,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.056
the first thing they said to me was,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.296
"We're bringing you back to Taiwan."

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.000
(Laughter)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.856
In their minds, my sexual orientation
was America's fault.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.816
The West had corrupted me
with divergent ideas,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.816
and if only my parents
had never left Taiwan,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.296
this would not have happened
to their only daughter.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.416
In truth, I wondered if they were right.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.496
Of course, there are gay people in Asia,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.736
just as there are gay people
in every part of the world.
