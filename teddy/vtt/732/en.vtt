00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There's actually a major health crisis today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in terms of the shortage of organs.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The fact is that we're living longer.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Medicine has done a much better job

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of making us live longer,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and the problem is, as we age,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
our organs tend to fail more,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and so currently

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
there are not enough organs to go around.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In fact, in the last 10 years,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
while in the same time,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the actual number of transplants has barely gone up.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So this is now a public health crisis.
