Today, I am going to talk about anger.


00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:11.130
When I was 11,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.462
seeing some of my friends 
leaving the school

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:18.684
because their parents 
could not afford textbooks

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:21.186
made me angry.

00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:26.068
When I was 27,

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:31.280
hearing the plight
