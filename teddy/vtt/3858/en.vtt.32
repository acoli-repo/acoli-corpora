00:15:53.241 --> 00:16:00.795
that if we are confined in 
the narrow shells of egos,

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:05.225
and the circles of selfishness,

00:16:05.225 --> 00:16:12.709
then the anger will turn out to be
hatred, violence, revenge, destruction.

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:16.595
But if we are able to break the circles,

00:16:16.595 --> 00:16:22.481
then the same anger could turn 
into a great power.

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:26.828
We can break the circles 
by using our inherent compassion

00:16:26.828 --> 00:16:30.678
and connect with the world through 
compassion to make this world better.
