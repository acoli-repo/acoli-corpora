Dear friends, for centuries
we were taught anger is bad.

00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:03.486
Our parents, teachers, priests --

00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:09.371
everyone taught us how to control 
and suppress our anger.

00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:14.146
But I ask why?

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:20.513
Why can't we convert our anger
for the larger good of society?

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.109
Why can't we use our anger

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.615
to challenge and change
the evils of the world?

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:32.176
That I tried to do.
