(Laughter)

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.416
I know that the skepticism
coming from my brothers

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.495
is out of care and concern for me.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.936
They were worried.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.496
They thought it would be difficult
to make it as an artist,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.016
that it will be a challenge.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.280
And you know what? They were right.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.976
It is such a challenge
to be a full-time artist.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.376
I have so many friends
who need to have a second job

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.616
as a plan B in order to pay for the bills,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.440
except that plan B
sometimes becomes their plan A.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.216
And it's not just my friends and I
who experience this.
