the US budget for the military

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.480
is almost twice as much as the entire NEA.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.096
Another striking image comes from
Brendan McMahon for the "Huffington Post,"

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.216
saying that out of
the one trillion dollar budget

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.056
for military and defense-related spending,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.456
if only 0.05 percent
were allocated to the arts,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.776
we would be able to pay
for 20 full-time symphony orchestras

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.816
at 20 million dollars apiece,
