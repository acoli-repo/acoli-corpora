I read an article in the "Huffington Post"

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.976
saying that four years ago,
the European Union

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.496
began the world's largest ever
arts funding initiative.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.136
Creative Europe
will give 2.4 billion dollars

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.840
to over 300,000 artists.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.976
In contrast, the US budget
for our National Endowment for the Arts,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.936
the largest single funder
for the arts across the United States,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.776
is merely 146 million dollars.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.936
To put things into perspective,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.096
the US budget for the military
marching bands alone
