And it's not just my friends and I
who experience this.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.176
The US Census Bureau states that only
10 percent of art school graduates

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.296
end up working as full-time artists.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.776
The other 90 percent, they change careers,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.520
they work in marketing,
sales, education and other fields.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.616
But this is not news, right?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.040
We almost expect the artist
to be a struggling artist.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.800
But why should we expect that?
