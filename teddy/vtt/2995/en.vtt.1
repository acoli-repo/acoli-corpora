He was encouraging but a bit skeptical.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.696
He said, "I wish you the best of luck.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.056
You're going to need it."

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.456

Brother number two
was a little bit more skeptical.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.776
He said, "Don't do it!

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.856
(Laughter)

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.696
Well, the rest of my brothers
were so enthusiastic about my decision,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.456
they didn't even respond.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.216
(Laughter)
