On the other side
you have artists seeking funding,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.216
but the artists don't know
about the people with the money,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.696
and the people with the money
don't necessarily know

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.096
about the artists out there.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.816
This is why I am very excited
to share "Grantpa,"

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.776
an online platform that uses technology

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.376
to match artists with grants
and funding opportunities

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.016
in a way that is easy, fast
and less intimidating.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.536
Grantpa is only one step
towards solving an existing problem

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.040
of funding inequality,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.456
but we need to work collectively
on multiple fronts
