I don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Industrial designers want to make novel things.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Novelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The industrial design magazine, I believe, is called "Innovation."

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work.
