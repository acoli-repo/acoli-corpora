00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:07.000
In my shop where I studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
of master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and I worked as the apprentice.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
The work as an apprentice was very primitive.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:37.000
That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.
