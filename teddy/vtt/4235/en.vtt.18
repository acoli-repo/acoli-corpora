00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and my working conditions, and I still have that workbook.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
First I set up a shop in my own garden,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And there I was sitting, and my then-boyfriend --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots.
