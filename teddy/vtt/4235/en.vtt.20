Then the director asked me, why do you ask all these questions?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I said, I also have a pottery.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So he asked me, could he please visit me, and then finally he did,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that the industrial revolution had broken out,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and that I rather should join the factory.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months.
