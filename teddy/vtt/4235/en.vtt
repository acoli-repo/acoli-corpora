00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I understand that this meeting was planned,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the slogan was From Was to Still.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I am illustrating Still.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Which, of course, I am not agreeing with because,


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
although I am 94, I am not still working.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And anybody who asks me, "Are you still doing this or that?"

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.
