00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.142
Now the last option was the longest, and the most difficult:

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:05.766
to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:07.655
a certain band of winds that could eventually

00:04:07.655 --> 00:04:09.919
push them toward the coast of South America.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.640
But they knew that the sheer length of this journey

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.151
would stretch their supplies of food and water.

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:19.557
To be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms,

00:04:19.557 --> 00:04:22.918
to starve to death before reaching land.

00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:26.310
These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.209
and as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen to

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:31.863
would govern whether they lived or died.
