00:06:29.094 --> 00:06:31.215
these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:33.452
as a child frightened in the night.

00:06:33.452 --> 00:06:35.983
If an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry,

00:06:35.983 --> 00:06:39.849
what will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.549
And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:47.052
So if we think of our fears as more than just fears

00:06:47.052 --> 00:06:49.979
but as stories, we should think of ourselves

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.210
as the authors of those stories.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.172
But just as importantly, we need to think of ourselves

00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:56.676
as the readers of our fears, and how we choose

00:06:56.676 --> 00:07:01.011
to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.
