00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:30.752
We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed,

00:02:30.752 --> 00:02:33.732
and not every earthquake brings buildings down.

00:02:33.732 --> 00:02:37.140
But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.251
fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.

00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:44.112
The same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species,"

00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:46.969
"Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past,"

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.308
also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives

00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:54.764
of Charles Darwin, Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust.

00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:57.693
So the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear

00:02:57.693 --> 00:03:00.997
from visionaries and young children?
