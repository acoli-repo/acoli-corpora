00:02:57.693 --> 00:03:00.997
from visionaries and young children?

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:03.857
Well let's return to the year 1819 for a moment,

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:07.544
to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.

00:03:07.544 --> 00:03:09.663
Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations

00:03:09.663 --> 00:03:13.419
were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.968
Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:19.671
The time had come for the men to make a plan,

00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:22.397
but they had very few options.

00:03:22.397 --> 00:03:24.828
In his fascinating account of the disaster,

00:03:24.828 --> 00:03:27.568
Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:31.968
as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.
