00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:31.907
In their small boats, they carried only

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:33.473
rudimentary navigational equipment

00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:37.121
and limited supplies of food and water.

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:39.325
These were the men of the whaleship Essex,

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:41.980
whose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick."

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.929
Even in today's world, their situation would be really dire,

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:46.855
but think about how much worse it would have been then.

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:50.080
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.992
No search party was coming to look for these men.

00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:55.854
So most of us have never experienced a situation

00:00:55.854 --> 00:00:59.357
as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves,

00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:01.224
but we all know what it's like to be afraid.
