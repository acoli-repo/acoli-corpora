00:04:57.913 --> 00:05:02.215
Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.

00:05:02.215 --> 00:05:06.331
You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails.

00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:08.899
Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:12.248
every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.

00:05:12.248 --> 00:05:15.204
Picture a cannibal, human teeth

00:05:15.204 --> 00:05:17.411
sinking into human skin,

00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:20.465
human flesh roasting over a fire.

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:23.201
Fears also have suspense.

00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.491
If I've done my job as a storyteller today,

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:26.999
you should be wondering what happened

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:29.100
to the men of the whaleship Essex.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.345
Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.
