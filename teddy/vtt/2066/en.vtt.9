would govern whether they lived or died.

00:04:31.863 --> 00:04:36.073
Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.

00:04:36.073 --> 00:04:38.351
What if instead of calling them fears,

00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:39.962
we called them stories?

00:04:39.962 --> 00:04:42.195
Because that's really what fear is, if you think about it.

00:04:42.195 --> 00:04:45.255
It's a kind of unintentional storytelling

00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:48.185
that we are all born knowing how to do.

00:04:48.185 --> 00:04:50.948
And fears and storytelling have the same components.

00:04:50.948 --> 00:04:52.813
They have the same architecture.

00:04:52.813 --> 00:04:55.490
Like all stories, fears have characters.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.913
In our fears, the characters are us.

00:04:57.913 --> 00:05:02.215
Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.
