As a writer, I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction

00:06:01.404 --> 00:06:03.287
is learning to predict how one event in a story

00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:05.031
will affect all the other events,

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.080
and fear works in that same way.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.257
In fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another.

00:06:12.257 --> 00:06:14.903
When I was writing my first novel, "The Age Of Miracles,"

00:06:14.903 --> 00:06:17.864
I spent months trying to figure out what would happen

00:06:17.864 --> 00:06:21.053
if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.

00:06:21.053 --> 00:06:23.945
What would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?

00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:25.988
What would happen to our minds?

00:06:25.988 --> 00:06:29.094
And then it was only later that I realized how very similar

00:06:29.094 --> 00:06:31.215
these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself
