to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.

00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:04.012
Now, some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.

00:07:04.012 --> 00:07:06.933
I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs,

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:09.559
and the author found that these people shared a habit

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:12.918
that he called "productive paranoia," which meant that

00:07:12.918 --> 00:07:15.439
these people, instead of dismissing their fears,

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:18.102
these people read them closely, they studied them,

00:07:18.102 --> 00:07:21.702
and then they translated that fear into preparation and action.

00:07:21.702 --> 00:07:23.619
So that way, if their worst fears came true,

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:25.697
their businesses were ready.

00:07:25.697 --> 00:07:30.048
And sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.
