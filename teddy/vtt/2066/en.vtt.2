00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:01.224
but we all know what it's like to be afraid.

00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:03.518
We know how fear feels,

00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:05.622
but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about

00:01:05.622 --> 00:01:07.267
what our fears mean.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.104
As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear

00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:13.017
as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard

00:01:13.017 --> 00:01:15.835
like baby teeth or roller skates.

00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:18.330
And I think it's no accident that we think this way.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.937
Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings

00:01:20.937 --> 00:01:23.676
are hard-wired to be optimists.

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:26.459
So maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.437
as a danger in and of itself.

00:01:28.437 --> 00:01:31.434
"Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."
