00:08:58.864 --> 00:09:00.731
Why were they swayed by one story

00:09:00.731 --> 00:09:03.370
so much more than the other?

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.892
Looked at from this angle,

00:09:04.892 --> 00:09:08.191
theirs becomes a story about reading.

00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.847
The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader

00:09:10.847 --> 00:09:13.646
has a combination of two very different temperaments,

00:09:13.646 --> 00:09:16.496
the artistic and the scientific.

00:09:16.496 --> 00:09:19.000
A good reader has an artist's passion,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.423
a willingness to get caught up in the story,

00:09:21.423 --> 00:09:23.534
but just as importantly, the readers also needs

00:09:23.534 --> 00:09:26.745
the coolness of judgment of a scientist,

00:09:26.745 --> 00:09:28.236
which acts to temper and complicate

00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:31.634
the reader's intuitive reactions to the story.
