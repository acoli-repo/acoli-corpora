00:07:56.486 --> 00:08:01.213
After much deliberation, the men finally made a decision.

00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:05.086
Terrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islands

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:07.413
and instead embarked on the longer

00:08:07.413 --> 00:08:10.540
and much more difficult route to South America.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.010
After more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.089
as they knew they might,

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:17.784
and they were still quite far from land.

00:08:17.784 --> 00:08:20.671
When the last of the survivors were finally picked up

00:08:20.671 --> 00:08:25.157
by two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive,

00:08:25.157 --> 00:08:30.060
and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.
