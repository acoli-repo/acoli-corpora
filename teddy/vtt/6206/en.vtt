00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.216
When I was in the fifth grade,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.616
I bought an issue
of "DC Comics Presents #57"

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.376
off of a spinner rack
at my local bookstore,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.096
and that comic book changed my life.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.496
The combination of words and pictures
did something inside my head

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.056
that had never been done before,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.776
and I immediately fell in love
with the medium of comics.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.976
I became a voracious comic book reader,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.696
but I never brought them to school.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.536
Instinctively, I knew that comic books
didn't belong in the classroom.
