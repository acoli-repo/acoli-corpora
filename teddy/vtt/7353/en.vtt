If you have credit card debt,
you are far from alone.

00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:06.246
More than half of Americans
are currently carrying around

00:00:06.288 --> 00:00:07.746
some form of credit card debt.

00:00:07.746 --> 00:00:09.454
And if you're part of that majority

00:00:09.496 --> 00:00:12.163
or just want to put some
preventative measures in place,

00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:14.079
I have four simple changes

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:16.496
that can help you work towards
becoming debt free.

[Your Money and Your Mind
with Wendy De La Rosa]

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:23.454
Number one: prioritize your payments

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:26.038
and prioritize them in the right way.

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:27.829
So let's say you have two cards,

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.663
one with a 200 dollar balance

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:31.788
and the other with a 1,000 dollar balance.
