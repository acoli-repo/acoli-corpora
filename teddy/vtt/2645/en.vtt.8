WEBVTT

00:03:59.884 --> 00:04:02.259
and he changed the location each day.

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:05.827
He'd write a different menu
on the side in a whiteboard marker

00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:07.763
to figure out what people wanted.

00:04:08.218 --> 00:04:10.637
He now has a chain of restaurants.

00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:12.692
So it can be incredibly efficient

00:04:12.716 --> 00:04:15.481
to launch something
to spot the desire paths.

00:04:16.232 --> 00:04:19.314
The third and final desire path
I wanted to share with you

00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:20.961
is the UNIH.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.883
It reminds me that the world's in flux,

00:04:23.907 --> 00:04:26.207
and we have to respond to those changes.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.837
So as you'll guess, this is a hospital.

00:04:29.337 --> 00:04:32.378
I've marked for you on the left
the Oncology Department.
