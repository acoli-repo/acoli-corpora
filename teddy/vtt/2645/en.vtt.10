00:04:57.616 --> 00:05:00.133
The patients even called it
"The Chemo Trail."

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.999
Now, when the hospital
saw this originally,

00:05:03.023 --> 00:05:05.917
they tried to lay turf
back over it, ignore it.

00:05:06.744 --> 00:05:09.860
But after a while, they realized
it was an important need

00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:11.661
they were meeting for their patients,

00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:12.993
so they paved it.

00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:16.866
And I think our job is often
to pave these emerging desire paths.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.016
If we look back at the one
in North London again,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.410
that desire path hasn't always been there.

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.372
The reason it sprung up

00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:28.494
is people were traveling to the mighty
Arsenal Football Club stadium

00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:29.669
on game days,

00:05:29.693 --> 00:05:32.470
from the Underground station
you see on the bottom right.
