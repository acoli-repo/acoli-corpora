00:04:29.337 --> 00:04:32.378
I've marked for you on the left
the Oncology Department.

00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:37.083
The patients would usually stay
in the hotels down on the bottom right.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.243
This was a patient-centered organization,

00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:42.895
so they laid on cars for their patients.

00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:47.263
But what they realized when they started
offering chemotherapy

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.064
is the patients rarely
wanted to get in cars.

00:04:50.088 --> 00:04:53.990
They were too nauseous,
so they'd walk back to their hotels.

00:04:54.014 --> 00:04:56.953
This desire path that you see
diagonally, formed.

00:04:57.616 --> 00:05:00.133
The patients even called it
"The Chemo Trail."
