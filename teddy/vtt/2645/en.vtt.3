00:01:27.663 --> 00:01:31.411
he put most of the important
government buildings in the cockpit.

00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:33.882
But if you zoom in,
in the very center of Brasilia,

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.068
just where the point is there,

00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:38.492
you see it's littered with desire paths.

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.046
They're absolutely everywhere.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.940
Now, they thought that they
had future-proofed this design.

00:01:43.964 --> 00:01:46.979
They thought in the future
we wouldn't need to walk anywhere --

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:48.551
we'd be able to drive --

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.532
so there was little need
for walkways or pavements.

00:01:52.358 --> 00:01:54.691
But as you can see, there's a real need.

00:01:55.564 --> 00:01:57.386
These are very dangerous desire paths.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.447
If we just pick one, in the middle,

00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:02.878
you can see it crosses
15 lanes of traffic.
