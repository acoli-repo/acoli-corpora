00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:08.222
that Brasilia has five times
the pedestrian accident rate

00:02:08.246 --> 00:02:10.124
of your average US city.

00:02:10.968 --> 00:02:12.455
People are resourceful.

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.513
They'll always find the low-friction route

00:02:15.537 --> 00:02:17.932

when we're confronted

00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:29.130
with the obligatory walk
through duty-free.
