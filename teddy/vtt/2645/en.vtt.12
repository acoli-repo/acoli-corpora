00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:00.122
(Laughter)

00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:02.534
But I think this is a wonderful
reminder as well,

00:06:02.558 --> 00:06:04.410
that, actually, the world is in flux.

00:06:04.434 --> 00:06:05.656
It's constantly changing,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.912
because if you look
at the top of this image,

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:09.928
there's another desire path forming.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.943
So these three desire paths remind me

00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:17.114
we need to design for real human needs.

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:20.062
I think empathy for what
your customers want

00:06:20.086 --> 00:06:23.820
is probably the biggest leading indicator
of business success.

00:06:24.315 --> 00:06:25.989
Design for real needs

00:06:26.013 --> 00:06:28.417
and design them in low friction,

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:31.790
because if you don't offer them
in low friction,
