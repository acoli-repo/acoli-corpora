People clearly don't want to walk
all the way around the edge.

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:35.332
Instead, they want to take the shortcut,

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:37.812
and that shortcut is self-reinforcing.

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:42.162
Now, this shortcut
is called a desire path,

00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:44.686
and it's often the path
of least resistance.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.043
I find them fascinating,

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:51.532
because they're often the point
where design and user experience diverge.

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:54.017
Now at this point, I should apologize,

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:56.913
because you guys are going to start
seeing these everywhere.

00:00:56.937 --> 00:00:59.599
But today, I'm going to pick
three I find interesting

00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:01.734
and share what actually it reminds me
