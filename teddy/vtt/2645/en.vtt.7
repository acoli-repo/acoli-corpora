00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:32.506
And the designers here knew that.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.503
So they built the buildings

00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:37.441
and then they waited a few months
for the paths to form.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.354
They then paved them.

00:03:39.378 --> 00:03:40.417
(Laughter)

00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:42.346
Incredibly smart approach.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.842
In fact, often, just launching
the straw man of a service

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:48.007
can teach you what people really want.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:52.861
For example, Ayr Muir in Boston
knew he wanted to open a restaurant.

00:03:52.885 --> 00:03:54.293
But where should it be?

00:03:54.675 --> 00:03:56.236
What should the menu be?

00:03:56.661 --> 00:03:58.150
He launched a service,

00:03:58.174 --> 00:03:59.860
in this case a food truck,

00:03:59.884 --> 00:04:02.259
and he changed the location each day.
