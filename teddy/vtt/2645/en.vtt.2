00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:01.734
and share what actually it reminds me

00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:04.566
about launching new products and services.

00:01:05.137 --> 00:01:08.800
The first is in the capital city
of Brazil -- Brasilia.

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:11.341
And it reminds me that sometimes,

00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:14.493
you have to just focus
on designing for a real need

00:01:14.517 --> 00:01:15.786
at low friction.

00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:17.764
Now, Brasilia is fascinating.

00:01:17.788 --> 00:01:20.930
It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s.

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:23.162
It was the golden age of flying,

00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:26.450
so he laid it out like a plane,
as you can see there.

00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:27.639
Slightly worryingly,

00:01:27.663 --> 00:01:31.411
he put most of the important
government buildings in the cockpit.
