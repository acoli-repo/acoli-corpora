00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.466
So our job is to design
for real needs at low friction,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.386
because if you don't,
the customer will, anyway.

00:03:07.238 --> 00:03:09.458
The second desire path I wanted to share

00:03:09.482 --> 00:03:11.734
is at the University of California.

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:12.910
And it reminds me

00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:16.092
that sometimes the best way
to come up with a great design

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:17.800
is just to launch it.

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:22.738
Now, university campuses are fantastic
for spotting desire paths.

00:03:22.762 --> 00:03:26.100
I think it's because students
are always late and they're pretty smart.

00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:27.606
So they're dashing to lectures.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.723
They'll always find the shortcut.
