When we're designing new products,

00:00:03.042 --> 00:00:05.032
services or businesses,

00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:07.574
the only time you'll know
if they're any good,

00:00:07.598 --> 00:00:09.296
if the designs are good,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.055
is to see how they're used
in the real world, in context.

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.695
I'm reminded of that every time
I walk past Highbury Fields

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.159
in north London.

00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:21.501
It's absolutely beautiful.

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:23.222
There's a big open green space.

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:25.814
There's Georgian buildings
around the side.

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:28.736
But then there's this mud trap
that cuts across the middle.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.844
People clearly don't want to walk
all the way around the edge.
