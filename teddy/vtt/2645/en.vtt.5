It was amazing to me

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.334
how many people refused to take
the long, meandering path to the left,

00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:38.435
and just cut through to the right,

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.180
cut through the desire path.

00:02:40.813 --> 00:02:42.521
The question that's interesting is:

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:45.735
What do designers think
when they see our behavior here?

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:47.989
Do they think we're stupid?

00:02:48.013 --> 00:02:49.809
Do they think we're lazy?

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:52.957
Or do they accept
that this is the only truth?

00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:54.739
This is their product.

00:02:55.134 --> 00:02:57.667
We're effectively
co-designing their product.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.466
So our job is to design
for real needs at low friction,
