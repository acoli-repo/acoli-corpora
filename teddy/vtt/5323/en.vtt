00:00:00.714 --> 00:00:03.532
Here's a question we should all be asking:

00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:05.325
What went wrong?

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:07.207
Not just with the pandemic

00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:09.231
but with our civic life.

00:00:09.544 --> 00:00:14.226
What brought us to this polarized,
rancorous political moment?

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:16.601
In recent decades,

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:20.895
the divide between winners and losers
has been deepening,

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.910
poisoning our politics,

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:25.133
setting us apart.

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:29.042
This divide is partly about inequality.

00:00:29.577 --> 00:00:34.224
But it's also about the attitudes
toward winning and losing
