00:06:58.856 --> 00:07:00.385
We sign with a major label.

00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:03.925
And our music is a cross
between punk and cabaret.

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.331
It's not for everybody.

00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:07.782
Well, maybe it's for you.

00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:09.890
(Laughter)

00:07:09.914 --> 00:07:13.710
We sign, and there's all this hype
leading up to our next record.

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:17.403
And it comes out and it sells
about 25,000 copies

00:07:17.427 --> 00:07:18.716
in the first few weeks,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.620
and the label considers this a failure.

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:24.597
I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"

00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:26.589
They said, "No, the sales are going down.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.629
It's a failure."

00:07:27.653 --> 00:07:28.668
And they walk off.

00:07:29.578 --> 00:07:32.938
Right at this same time,
I'm signing and hugging after a gig,
