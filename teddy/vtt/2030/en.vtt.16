00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.952
but I have to physically stand there
and take the help from people,

00:08:01.976 --> 00:08:04.161
and unlike the guy in the opening band,

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:06.979
I've actually had a lot
of practice standing there.

00:08:08.773 --> 00:08:09.852
Thank you.

00:08:10.331 --> 00:08:12.458
And this is the moment I decide

00:08:12.482 --> 00:08:15.350
I'm just going to give away
my music for free

00:08:15.374 --> 00:08:17.082
online whenever possible,

00:08:17.106 --> 00:08:20.568
so it's like Metallica
over here, Napster, bad;

00:08:20.592 --> 00:08:22.258
Amanda Palmer over here,

00:08:22.282 --> 00:08:25.557
and I'm going to encourage
torrenting, downloading, sharing,

00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:27.679
but I'm going to ask for help,

00:08:27.703 --> 00:08:30.406
because I saw it work on the street.
