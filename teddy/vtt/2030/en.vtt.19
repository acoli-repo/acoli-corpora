It's kind of counterintuitive
for a lot of artists.

00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:36.431
They don't want to ask for things.

00:09:36.455 --> 00:09:40.108
But it's not easy.

00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:41.599
It's not easy to ask.

00:09:42.116 --> 00:09:44.298
And a lot of artists have
a problem with this.

00:09:44.322 --> 00:09:46.021
Asking makes you vulnerable.

00:09:46.613 --> 00:09:51.137
And I got a lot of criticism online,

00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:52.758
after my Kickstarter went big,

00:09:52.782 --> 00:09:55.717
for continuing my crazy
crowdsourcing practices,

00:09:55.741 --> 00:09:58.598
specifically for asking musicians

00:09:58.622 --> 00:10:00.971
who are fans if they wanted
to join us on stage
