00:06:29.717 --> 00:06:32.384
if they wanted to go out
into the crowd and pass the hat

00:06:32.408 --> 00:06:35.098
to get some extra money,
something that I did a lot.

00:06:35.122 --> 00:06:36.910
And as usual, the band was psyched,

00:06:36.934 --> 00:06:39.108
but there was this one guy in the band

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:42.990
who told me he just couldn't
bring himself to go out there.

00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:46.704
It felt too much like begging
to stand there with the hat.

00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:50.828
And I recognized his fear

00:06:50.852 --> 00:06:52.941
of "Is this fair?"

00:06:52.965 --> 00:06:54.303
and "Get a job."

00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:58.832
And meanwhile, my band
is becoming bigger and bigger.

00:06:58.856 --> 00:07:00.385
We sign with a major label.
