00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:30.076
So I would need a piano to practice on,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.369
and an hour later I would be
at a fan's house.

00:03:32.393 --> 00:03:33.430
This is in London.

00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:35.914
People would bring home-cooked food to us

00:03:35.938 --> 00:03:38.653
all over the world backstage
and feed us and eat with us.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.059
This is in Seattle.

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:43.686
Fans who worked in museums and stores

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.893
and any kind of public space
would wave their hands

00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:50.157
if I would decide to do
a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.

00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:52.793
This is a library in Auckland.

00:03:53.604 --> 00:03:58.057
On Saturday I tweeted
for this crate and hat,

00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:00.840
because I did not want to schlep them
from the East Coast,
