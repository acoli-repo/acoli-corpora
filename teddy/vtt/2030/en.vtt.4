00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:03.750
But it hurt, because it made me fear

00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:08.008
that I was somehow doing
something un-joblike

00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:09.940
and unfair, shameful.

00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:15.995
I had no idea how perfect
a real education I was getting

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.131
for the music business on this box.

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:20.327
And for the economists out there,

00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:23.932
you may be interested to know I actually
made a pretty predictable income,

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:28.147
which was shocking to me,
given I had no regular customers,

00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:31.435
but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday,
90 bucks on a Friday.
