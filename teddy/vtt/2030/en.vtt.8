00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:00.840
because I did not want to schlep them
from the East Coast,

00:04:00.864 --> 00:04:03.887
and they showed up care of this dude,
Chris, from Newport Beach,

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.042
who says hello.

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:09.326
I once tweeted, "Where in Melbourne
can I buy a neti pot?"

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.856
And a nurse from a hospital drove one

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.127
right at that moment to the cafe I was in,

00:04:14.151 --> 00:04:15.595
and I bought her a smoothie

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.159
and we sat there talking
about nursing and death.

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:21.214
And I love this kind of random closeness,

00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:24.595
which is lucky, because I do
a lot of couchsurfing.

00:04:25.928 --> 00:04:29.018
In mansions where everyone
in my crew gets their own room

00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:30.295
but there's no wireless,
