00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:06.357
and we made an art out
of asking people to help us and join us,

00:03:06.381 --> 00:03:09.503
and I would track down
local musicians and artists

00:03:09.527 --> 00:03:12.695
and they would set up
outside of our shows,

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.183
and they would pass the hat,

00:03:14.207 --> 00:03:16.683
and then they would come in
and join us onstage,

00:03:16.707 --> 00:03:20.092

of weird, random circus guests.

00:03:20.715 --> 00:03:23.196
And then Twitter came along,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.252
and made things even more magic,

00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:28.011
because I could ask instantly
for anything anywhere.

00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:30.076
So I would need a piano to practice on,
