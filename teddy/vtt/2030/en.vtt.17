00:08:27.703 --> 00:08:30.406
because I saw it work on the street.

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:33.903
So I fought my way off my label,
and for my next project

00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:36.607
with my new band,
the Grand Theft Orchestra,

00:08:36.631 --> 00:08:38.341
I turned to crowdfunding.

00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:43.503
And I fell into those thousands
of connections that I'd made,

00:08:43.527 --> 00:08:45.634
and I asked my crowd to catch me.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:49.634
And the goal was 100,000 dollars.

00:08:49.658 --> 00:08:53.173
My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,

00:08:53.197 --> 00:08:56.079
which was the biggest music
crowdfunding project to date.

00:08:56.103 --> 00:09:00.167
