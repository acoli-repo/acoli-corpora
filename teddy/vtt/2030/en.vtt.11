00:05:30.584 --> 00:05:33.220
Thank you for staying here.
We're all so grateful."

00:05:33.894 --> 00:05:37.448
And I thought, this is fair.

00:05:38.178 --> 00:05:40.307
This is this.

00:05:41.305 --> 00:05:44.225
A couple of months later,
I was in Manhattan,

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:46.513
and I tweeted for a crash pad,
and at midnight,

00:05:46.537 --> 00:05:48.315
I'm on the Lower East Side,

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:51.108
and it occurs to me I've never
actually done this alone.

00:05:51.132 --> 00:05:53.085
I've always been with my band or my crew.

00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:54.947
Is this what stupid people do?

00:05:55.414 --> 00:05:56.414
(Laughter)

00:05:56.945 --> 00:05:58.881
Is this how stupid people die?

00:05:59.344 --> 00:06:01.869
And before I can change my mind,
the door busts open.
