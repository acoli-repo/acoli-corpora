00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:30.288
and we would get this beautiful moment
of prolonged eye contact

00:01:30.312 --> 00:01:32.605
being allowed in a city street,

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:35.250
and we would sort of fall
in love a little bit.

00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:37.560
And my eyes would say --

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:39.433
"Thank you.

00:01:40.028 --> 00:01:41.028
I see you."

00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:43.280
And their eyes would say --

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.828
"Nobody ever sees me.

00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:48.901
Thank you."

00:01:50.908 --> 00:01:52.393
I would get harassed sometimes.

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:54.481
People would yell at me from their cars.

00:01:54.505 --> 00:01:55.567
"Get a job!"

00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:58.187
(Laughing) And I'd be, like,

00:01:58.211 --> 00:01:59.344
"This is my job."
