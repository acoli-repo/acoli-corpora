00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:31.435
but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday,
90 bucks on a Friday.

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.720
It was consistent.

00:02:32.744 --> 00:02:36.204
And meanwhile, I was touring locally
and playing in nightclubs

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:38.066
with my band, the Dresden Dolls.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.164
This was me on piano, a genius drummer.

00:02:40.188 --> 00:02:42.077
I wrote the songs, and eventually

00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:46.463
we started making enough money
that I could quit being a statue,

00:02:46.487 --> 00:02:48.724
and as we started touring,

00:02:48.748 --> 00:02:51.098
I really didn't want to lose this sense

00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:53.798
of direct connection with people,
because I loved it.

00:02:53.822 --> 00:02:57.753
So after all of our shows,
we would sign autographs

00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.665
and hug fans and hang out
and talk to people,
