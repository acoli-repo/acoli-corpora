00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:31.209
and they couldn't see the exchange

00:10:31.233 --> 00:10:33.281
that was happening
between me and my crowd,

00:10:33.305 --> 00:10:37.638
an exchange that was very fair
to us but alien to them.

00:10:38.948 --> 00:10:40.971
So this is slightly not safe for work.

00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:43.558
This is my Kickstarter
backer party in Berlin.

00:10:43.582 --> 00:10:46.615
At the end of the night, I stripped
and let everyone draw on me.

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:49.632
Now let me tell you,
if you want to experience

00:10:49.656 --> 00:10:52.127
the visceral feeling
of trusting strangers --

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.598
(Laughter)

00:10:53.622 --> 00:10:54.813
I recommend this,

00:10:54.837 --> 00:10:58.180
especially if those strangers
are drunk German people.

00:10:58.204 --> 00:11:00.115
(Laughter)
