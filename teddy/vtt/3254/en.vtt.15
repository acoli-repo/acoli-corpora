00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:32.546
and I accepted the help,

00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:37.333
but I had to do major self-inquiry

00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:40.594
about my family's money history

00:07:40.618 --> 00:07:42.484
and my money beliefs.

00:07:44.777 --> 00:07:48.746
We have to start having this conversation.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.451
Money can no longer be a taboo topic.

00:07:52.202 --> 00:07:58.306
We have to get honest with each other
that we're suffering with money issues,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.758
and let's get real -- we have to stop
numbing out our pain.
