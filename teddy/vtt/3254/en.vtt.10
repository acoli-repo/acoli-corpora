of believing that we are flawed,

00:05:00.602 --> 00:05:04.181
and therefore unworthy
of love and belonging."

Based on this definition,
here's how I'm defining money shame:

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.182
"the intensely painful
feeling or experience

00:05:14.206 --> 00:05:17.002
of believing that we are flawed,

00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:20.191
and therefore unworthy
of love and belonging,

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:22.437
based on our bank account balances,

00:05:23.546 --> 00:05:28.094
our debts, our homes, our cars

00:05:28.118 --> 00:05:29.569
and our job titles."
