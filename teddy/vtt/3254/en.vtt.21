And she numbed the pain
with sugar and shopping.

00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:35.873
So what did we do?

00:10:36.941 --> 00:10:38.973
Keith played out my mother's life.

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:43.505
He was an underearner,
longed to be financially rescued,

00:10:43.529 --> 00:10:45.854
and he numbed out the pain with alcohol.

00:10:47.058 --> 00:10:48.386
I did the opposite.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.513
I became a high earner,

00:10:51.537 --> 00:10:54.871
rescuer,

00:10:54.895 --> 00:10:58.378
and I numbed the pain out
with self-help books.

00:10:59.699 --> 00:11:02.525
But what we had in common
was our money belief.
