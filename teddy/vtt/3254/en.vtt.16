00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.758
and let's get real -- we have to stop
numbing out our pain.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.533
In order to uncover the painful parts

00:08:07.557 --> 00:08:10.298
of your money story
and your money history,

00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:12.774
you can't be numb.

00:08:13.998 --> 00:08:19.180
We have to let go of our past
in order to be free.

00:08:20.823 --> 00:08:24.514
Letting go of the past
happens through surrender,

00:08:24.538 --> 00:08:26.521
faith and forgiveness.

00:08:27.334 --> 00:08:32.183
Debt is the tangible manifestation
of not forgiving.
