Shortly after my brother's death,
the Recession hit.

00:06:31.976 --> 00:06:35.033
I lost my business and faced bankruptcy.

00:06:36.447 --> 00:06:40.208
Secretly, I was terrified.

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:47.076
I stayed in my home for a year,
thinking I did something wrong,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.607
told myself, "What did you do?
What happened?"

00:06:51.852 --> 00:06:57.137
I stayed silent, while all along,
I went outside and smiled.

00:06:57.767 --> 00:06:58.917
Nobody knew.

00:06:59.692 --> 00:07:01.013
That's money shame.
