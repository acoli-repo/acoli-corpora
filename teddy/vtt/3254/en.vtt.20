00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:03.363
And what did you hear your parents say,

00:10:03.387 --> 00:10:06.466
and what did you see
your parents do with the money?

00:10:07.548 --> 00:10:09.768
My brother and I heard,

00:10:09.792 --> 00:10:11.649
"More money will make us happy."

00:10:12.506 --> 00:10:13.697
Every day.

00:10:13.721 --> 00:10:15.930
"More money will make us happy."

00:10:15.954 --> 00:10:19.381
And we internalized that
into the money belief

00:10:19.405 --> 00:10:23.193
that our self worth was equal
to our net worth

00:10:23.217 --> 00:10:28.514
as we watched our mom live in a state
of chronic not-enoughness.

00:10:29.064 --> 00:10:33.206
And she numbed the pain
with sugar and shopping.
