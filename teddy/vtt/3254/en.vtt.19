How did you get all these
money beliefs to begin with?

00:09:34.623 --> 00:09:37.383
I call this your money autobiography,

00:09:37.407 --> 00:09:41.684
and as a money coach, this is
the first step I take with my clients.

00:09:42.773 --> 00:09:45.963
Think back to your earliest
childhood money memory.

00:09:46.685 --> 00:09:48.788
What did it feel like when you got money?

00:09:49.235 --> 00:09:53.038
Were you excited, proud or confused?

00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:56.148
And what did you do with the money?

00:09:56.172 --> 00:09:59.870
Did you run with the candy store,
or did you run to the bank?
