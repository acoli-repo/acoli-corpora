Debt is the tangible manifestation
of not forgiving.

00:08:32.893 --> 00:08:37.100
If you have debt, you've not
completely forgiven your past,

00:08:37.124 --> 00:08:40.884
so it's our work
to forgive ourselves and others

00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:42.670
so that we can live freely.

00:08:42.694 --> 00:08:45.923
Otherwise, our history
will continue to repeat.

00:08:47.648 --> 00:08:51.712
This is not a quick fix,
and I know we all want one,

00:08:51.736 --> 00:08:53.664
but it's a slow wake-up.

00:08:53.688 --> 00:08:56.053
This is another level of work.

00:08:56.413 --> 00:08:59.704
We have to go higher to get it,

00:08:59.728 --> 00:09:00.997
to get at it.
