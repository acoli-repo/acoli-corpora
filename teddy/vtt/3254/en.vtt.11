00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:34.421
Let me give you a couple
of examples of what I mean.

00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:38.383
I believe that we all have money shame,

00:05:38.407 --> 00:05:42.302
whether you earn
10,000 dollars a year or 10 million,

00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:45.637
and it's because we give money
all of our power.

00:05:47.737 --> 00:05:51.928
Here's what it would look like
if someone that you love, or you,

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:54.076
might have money shame.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.430
They play the big shot,
always picking up the check,

00:05:57.454 --> 00:06:00.303
financially rescuing family and friends.
