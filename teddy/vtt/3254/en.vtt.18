00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:04.760
So try this: follow your dollars.

00:09:05.302 --> 00:09:08.530
Your money will show you
right away what you value.

00:09:09.491 --> 00:09:10.968
Where's it going?

00:09:10.992 --> 00:09:15.494
And then ask yourself:
Do I really value all this stuff?

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.409
And get curious about
what you're feeling when you're spending.

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:21.030
Are you lonely?

00:09:21.054 --> 00:09:22.386
Are you bored?

00:09:22.868 --> 00:09:25.479
Or are you just excited?

00:09:27.424 --> 00:09:29.733
But there's deeper work
that needs to happen.
