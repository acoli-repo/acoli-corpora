00:00:00.686 --> 00:00:04.584
Do you ever wonder why we're surrounded
with things that help us do everything

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:07.611
faster and faster and faster?

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:09.535
Communicate faster,

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.505
but also work faster, bank faster,

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.463
travel faster, find a date faster,

00:00:15.487 --> 00:00:20.319
cook faster, clean faster
and do all of it all at the same time?

00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:25.317
How do you feel about cramming
even more into every waking hour?

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.903
Well, to my generation of Americans,

00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:31.176
speed feels like a birthright.
