00:06:28.487 --> 00:06:31.287
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project

00:06:31.287 --> 00:06:34.997
is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.

00:06:34.997 --> 00:06:37.281
And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,

00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:40.818
and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,

00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:44.202
jumping from one building to another.

00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:46.561
These two examples,

00:06:46.561 --> 00:06:49.945
they have a common approach in the design process.

00:06:49.945 --> 00:06:52.524
And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see

00:06:52.524 --> 00:06:54.670
the cities literally growing.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.411
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow

00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:04.552
changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.
