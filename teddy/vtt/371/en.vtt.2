00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.882
we realized that they have three very big points.

00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:02.978
First, these buildings, they are almost empty

00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:04.759
because they have very large shops

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.730
where people cannot afford to buy things.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.570
Second, they need tons of energy to perform

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.738
because of the skin treatment with glass

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:14.706
that creates heat in the inside,

00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:16.346
and then you need a lot of cooling.

00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:18.307
In a city where this shouldn't happen

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:20.202
because they have really mild weather

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:23.951
that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:27.141
And third is that their image has nothing to do

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:29.296
with Africa and with Ethiopia.

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:34.898
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.
