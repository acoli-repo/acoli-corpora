you have all these connections for the pedestrians.

00:06:00.634 --> 00:06:03.741
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish

00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:07.404
a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.

00:06:07.404 --> 00:06:10.950
And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.842
The volume has this connecting shape

00:06:12.842 --> 00:06:16.144
that shades itself with three different types of apartments

00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:19.787
and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood

00:06:19.787 --> 00:06:22.687
And in the courtyards there are the different facilities,

00:06:22.687 --> 00:06:24.417
such as a gym and a kindergarten

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:28.487
and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.

00:06:28.487 --> 00:06:31.287
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project
