00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.728
as an essential part of the master plan.

00:05:31.728 --> 00:05:34.901
And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.200
in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.963
And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house

00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:44.826
and then a natural ventilation.

00:05:44.826 --> 00:05:48.412
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments

00:05:48.412 --> 00:05:50.552
are perfectly oriented in that direction.

00:05:50.552 --> 00:05:52.012
And this is the result

00:05:52.012 --> 00:05:55.777
that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.

00:05:55.777 --> 00:05:57.375
It has these blocks with courtyards,

00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:58.498
and then on the ground floor

00:05:58.498 --> 00:06:00.634
you have all these connections for the pedestrians.
