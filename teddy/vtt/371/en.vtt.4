00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:00.251
But the question was how we could do a multistory,

00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:03.140
contemporary building with these principles.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.596
The next challenge was when we looked at the site,

00:02:05.596 --> 00:02:08.144
that is, in a really growing area of the city,

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:10.628
where most of these buildings that you see in the image,

00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:12.230
they were not there.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.902
And it's also between two parallel streets

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:17.269
that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.663
So the first thing we did was to create a connection

00:02:20.663 --> 00:02:22.399
between these two streets,

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:24.598
putting all the entrances of the building.

00:02:24.598 --> 00:02:27.383
And this extends with an inclined atrium

00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:29.711
that creates an open-air space in the building

00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:32.440
that self-protects itself with its own shape
