00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.301
Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.

00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:36.356
The second example is a master plan

00:04:36.356 --> 00:04:39.635
of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.

00:04:39.635 --> 00:04:43.569
And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.834
I really needed to understand the city of Tunis,

00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:49.956
but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:53.064
During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina

00:04:53.064 --> 00:04:57.041
that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,

00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:01.490
opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.
