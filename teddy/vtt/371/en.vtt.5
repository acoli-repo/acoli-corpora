00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:32.440
that self-protects itself with its own shape

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.242
from the sun and the rain.

00:02:34.242 --> 00:02:35.898
And around this void

00:02:35.898 --> 00:02:39.201
we placed this idea of the market with small shops,

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:42.971
that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.

00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:45.242
I also thought, how to close the building?

00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:47.152
And I really wanted to find a solution

00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:50.615
that would respond to the local climate conditions.

00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:52.723
And I started thinking about the textile

00:02:52.723 --> 00:02:54.604
like a shell made of concrete

00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:58.175
with perforations that would let the air in,

00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:00.799
and also the light, but in a filtered way.
