00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:32.068
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers

00:03:32.068 --> 00:03:33.224
because they were like,

00:03:33.224 --> 00:03:35.912
"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."

00:03:35.912 --> 00:03:41.721
But then we all realized that this idea of the market

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.495
happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:47.215
because basically they had more shops to sell.

00:03:47.215 --> 00:03:51.289
And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:53.517
not only because of the material compared with the glass,

00:03:53.517 --> 00:03:56.205
but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:58.362
So we created some budget savings

00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:00.259
that we used to implement the project.
