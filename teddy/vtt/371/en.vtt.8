00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:00.259
that we used to implement the project.

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.191
And the first implementation was to think

00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:05.431
about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy

00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:08.765
in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.

00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:12.982
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.

00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:15.063
And then under those panels

00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:18.799
we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.613
that would create this urban oasis.

00:04:21.613 --> 00:04:23.403
And these porches on the roof,

00:04:23.403 --> 00:04:28.139
all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.301
Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.
