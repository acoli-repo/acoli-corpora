and also the light, but in a filtered way.

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.603
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful 
patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.778
That they have fractal geometry properties

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:10.909
and this helped me to shape the whole facade.

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.514
And we are building that

00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:14.655
with these small prefabricated pieces

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:18.093
that are the windows that let the air and the light

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:20.075
in a controlled way inside the building.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.457
And this is complemented by these small colored glasses

00:03:22.457 --> 00:03:25.060
that use the light from the inside of the building

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.946
to light up the building at night.

00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:32.068
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers
