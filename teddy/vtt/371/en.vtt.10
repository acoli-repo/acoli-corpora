00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:01.490
opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.859
When I went to the site, the first design operation we did

00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:09.879
was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.063
similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:16.054
and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.

00:05:16.054 --> 00:05:18.839
On top of that, we selected some strategic points

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.040
reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.810
and this modified this initial pattern.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.260
And the last operation was to think about the cell,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.950
the small cell of the project, like the apartment,

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.728
as an essential part of the master plan.
