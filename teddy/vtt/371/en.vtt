00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:03.054
My work focuses on the connection of

00:00:03.054 --> 00:00:06.561
both thinking about our community life

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:08.221
being part of the environment

00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:10.509
where architecture grows from the natural

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.981
local conditions and traditions.

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.130
Today I brought two recent projects

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.403
as an example of this.

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.479
Both projects are in emerging countries,

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:23.518
one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.

00:00:23.518 --> 00:00:25.277
And also they have in common

00:00:25.277 --> 00:00:28.309
that the different analyses from different perspectives

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.892
becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
