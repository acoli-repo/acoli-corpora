00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.892
becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.

00:00:32.892 --> 00:00:35.634
The first example started with an invitation

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.657
to design a multistory shopping mall

00:00:37.657 --> 00:00:39.962
in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:42.257
And this is the type of building

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:45.082
we were shown as an example, to my team and myself,

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:47.246
of what we had to design.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.321
At first, the first thing I thought was,

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:51.271
I want to run away.

00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:53.332
(Laughter)

00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:55.640
After seeing a few of these buildings --

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.440
there are many in the city --

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.882
we realized that they have three very big points.
