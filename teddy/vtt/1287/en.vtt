00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'll try to spin a story about energy,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and oil's a convenient starting place.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The talk will be broadly about energy,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but oil's a good place to start.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You take about eight or so carbon atoms,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
about 20 hydrogen atoms,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you put them together in exactly the right way

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and you get this marvelous liquid:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
very energy-dense and very easy to refine

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
into a number of very useful products and fuels.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's great stuff.
