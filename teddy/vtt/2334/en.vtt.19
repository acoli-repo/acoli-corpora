from one of my teacher friends.

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:52.212
You're about to have
a meeting with a parent,

00:09:52.236 --> 00:09:55.811
and prior to it, you and a coworker,
you kind of discuss it,

00:09:55.835 --> 00:09:59.020
and the coworker tells you,
"It's alright, I got your back.

00:09:59.044 --> 00:10:01.477
I'm going to agree
with your recommendations."
