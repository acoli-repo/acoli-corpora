00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:30.775
So you guys ever think about problems
before you get to work?

00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:32.631
Oh -- it's just me?

00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:34.141
(Laughter)

00:02:34.165 --> 00:02:36.246
Well, I'm guilty of it.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.532
I think about all of these
situations in my head,

00:02:39.556 --> 00:02:42.367
and then I get mad just thinking about it.

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:46.092
So I'm telling myself,
"No, you're just being prepared, Stacy."

00:02:46.116 --> 00:02:47.132
(Laughter)

00:02:47.156 --> 00:02:49.262
"You are just making sure
that you can handle

00:02:49.286 --> 00:02:51.421
whatever they're about to throw at you."

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.458
But you're not.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.345
What you're really doing
is setting yourself up

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.178
and creating this anxiety in your head

00:02:59.202 --> 00:03:01.294
that doesn't exist.
