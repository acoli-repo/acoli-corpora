00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:30.021
And that's the time for that. Get mad.

00:05:30.045 --> 00:05:31.196
Get angry.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.371
Curse, scream,

00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:35.316
do whatever you need to do
to get it out.

00:05:35.973 --> 00:05:37.564
Now here's the hard part:

00:05:38.413 --> 00:05:42.070
you then have to switch
that tone to positivity.

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.383
I truly believe in positive
and negative energy,

00:05:46.407 --> 00:05:50.098
and it has a way of controlling
our moods throughout the day.

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:55.342
You've got to think of things like,
"OK, where do I go from here?

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:57.169
What can I do differently?"

00:05:57.723 --> 00:05:59.462
And then, if you're the vent buddy,

00:05:59.486 --> 00:06:03.629
it's your responsibility
to lead your friend back to the positive.
