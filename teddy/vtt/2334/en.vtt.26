00:13:00.108 --> 00:13:03.220
there seem to be more
opportunities waiting for me.

00:13:03.845 --> 00:13:07.468
I have like-minded people
who want to connect with me,

00:13:07.492 --> 00:13:10.340
projects that people want me on,

00:13:10.364 --> 00:13:11.637
leaders reaching out

00:13:11.661 --> 00:13:14.690
because they heard about me
through someone else.

00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:18.284
And the best part?

00:13:18.878 --> 00:13:21.809
The need to even look at the easy road

00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:23.256
is no longer there.

00:13:24.552 --> 00:13:28.053
Guys, we're not going to change
the way adults act in the workplace.

00:13:28.077 --> 00:13:29.436
We are not.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.881
And for that reason,
there will always be workplace drama.
