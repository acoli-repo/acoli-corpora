I want you guys to all replay
your most recent workplace drama situation

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.895
in your head like a movie.

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:05.445
Ignore all of the emotion
and just focus on you.

00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:08.628
But for now, let's just
think about this hypothetical:

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:11.359
say you're on a group project,

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:14.288
you each have your own
individual assignments

00:01:14.312 --> 00:01:16.875
and then you all divide up the work.

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:20.291
But then someone
becomes unresponsive --

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:23.287
not answering calls, they go ghost.

00:01:23.823 --> 00:01:28.386
Then you or someone else has to now
pick up that additional slack.

00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:34.660
So in a brief, small,
very tiny lapse in judgment,
