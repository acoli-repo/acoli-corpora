So again, it's when people
get on your nerves,

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.712
not the job itself.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.326
So as we're going through these stories,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.130
I'm realizing there has to be a better way
for us to coexist with our coworkers

00:00:39.154 --> 00:00:41.343
without this much drama.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.544
So I created a few steps
that have been working for me,

00:00:45.568 --> 00:00:47.872
and I'm happy to share them
with you guys today.

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:49.960
Step 1: rewind and reflect,

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:54.760
also known as, "What did I do?"

00:00:55.926 --> 00:01:00.125
I want you guys to all replay
your most recent workplace drama situation
