00:03:27.727 --> 00:03:30.223
what they feel is wrong
with that person.

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:32.156
They're saying things like,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.722
"Oh, they're just mad
they didn't get the job."

00:03:35.307 --> 00:03:37.092
Or they're saying, "Oh, no, no, no --

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:39.476
during this season,
they're just always upset."

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.154
And you're sitting here
like, yep, that must be it.

00:03:44.178 --> 00:03:46.647
You're listening to this
as if this is facts.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.030
Meanwhile, this coworker
can be in deep thought

00:03:51.054 --> 00:03:53.444
about literally anything.

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:56.303
They could have just opened
a pack of Starburst,

00:03:56.327 --> 00:03:57.773
got four yellows back-to-back,

00:03:57.797 --> 00:04:00.257
and they're just trying
to figure out what happened.
