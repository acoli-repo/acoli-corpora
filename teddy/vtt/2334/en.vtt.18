00:08:59.765 --> 00:09:03.323
And we all have our own
communication styles.

00:09:03.987 --> 00:09:06.766
As the new generations
are entering the workforce,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.465
we're also adapting to it.

00:09:08.927 --> 00:09:10.847
Meetings are now emails.

00:09:10.871 --> 00:09:12.880
Emails are now texts.

00:09:12.904 --> 00:09:14.702
Off-sites are now Skype.

00:09:15.647 --> 00:09:17.271
So as we're adjusting to that,

00:09:17.295 --> 00:09:20.103
we need to at least try to understand

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:23.072
what type of style
of communication they use.

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:26.135
The goal in that step

00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:29.418
is to really understand
their work language

00:09:29.442 --> 00:09:33.761
and accept the fact
that it may be different than yours.
