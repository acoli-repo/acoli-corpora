"Let's turn our vent session

Step 4:

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.533
learn a new language,

00:06:39.557 --> 00:06:41.878
also known as, "We need to talk."

00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:47.637
Guys, I personally don't like
to pick up the phone at work.

00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:48.883
I just don't.

00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:52.162
I feel like whatever you need to say to me
can be an instant message

00:06:52.186 --> 00:06:53.340
or an email.

00:06:53.364 --> 00:06:55.101
That is my work language.

00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:56.288
(Laughter)

00:06:56.312 --> 00:06:58.281
The only problem with that,

00:06:58.305 --> 00:07:00.736
you can't hear tone through an email.
