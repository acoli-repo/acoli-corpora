They don't owe me their discretion.

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:03.948
I just assumed it was there.

00:02:04.486 --> 00:02:06.548
So we're not going to go
down a rabbit hole,

00:02:06.572 --> 00:02:08.472
trying to figure out why they did that.

00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:10.051
It doesn't matter. They did it.

00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:13.762
But the goal in this step
is self-reflection.

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:16.428
We need to focus on what did we do

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:18.353
so we can avoid it in the future.

00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:22.545
Step 2: come back to reality,

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.983
also known as, "It needs to stop."

00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:26.022
(Laughter)

00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:30.775
So you guys ever think about problems
before you get to work?
