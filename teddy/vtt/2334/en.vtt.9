00:04:28.783 --> 00:04:31.079
Alright. Step 3:

00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:34.606
vent and release.

00:04:35.537 --> 00:04:37.091
It's good to have a vent buddy.

00:04:37.774 --> 00:04:40.815
This is your coach, your cheerleader,

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.031
your therapist,

00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:45.046
whatever you need them
to be in the moment.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.771
This is not like that person in Step 1
that just happened to be in earshot.

00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:52.263
You have an established relationship
with your vent buddy.

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:54.600
Now, here's another scenario.

00:04:56.022 --> 00:04:58.827
You're getting ready to tell
a customer or a client

00:04:58.851 --> 00:05:00.946
something that they
just don't want to hear.
