00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:34.660
So in a brief, small,
very tiny lapse in judgment,

00:01:34.684 --> 00:01:36.639
you vent to the nearby coworker.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.026
Then all of a sudden,
your ghost comes back,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.961
and they surprisingly know
everything you just said.

00:01:42.985 --> 00:01:44.431
(Laughter)

00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:46.531
Now, what did I do in this situation?

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:50.191
I vented to someone
who was not my confidant.

00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:52.403
Why would I do that?

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:56.440
Sometimes we create
this unspoken bond with people

00:01:56.464 --> 00:01:58.895
that only exists in our heads.

00:01:59.483 --> 00:02:01.912
They don't owe me their discretion.
