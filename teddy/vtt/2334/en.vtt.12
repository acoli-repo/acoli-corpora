00:05:59.486 --> 00:06:03.629
it's your responsibility
to lead your friend back to the positive.

00:06:04.957 --> 00:06:07.186
Now, the other hard part:

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.045
you have to then apply
those learnings to the situation.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.561
You can't carry that resentment around.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.655
If you do, that one-off situation
now becomes a pattern.

00:06:20.251 --> 00:06:25.051
Pattern behavior is harder to ignore
than a one-off situation.

00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:27.661
The goal in this step is,

00:06:27.685 --> 00:06:34.317
"Let's turn our vent session
into a productive conversation."
