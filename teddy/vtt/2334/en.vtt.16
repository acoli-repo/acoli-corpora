00:07:56.778 --> 00:08:00.365
that if you hear
or if you see in an email,

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:04.152
it is safe to assume
they typed it with their middle fingers.

00:08:04.176 --> 00:08:07.590
(Laughter)

00:08:07.614 --> 00:08:10.381
I didn't know it then. I know it now.

00:08:10.405 --> 00:08:12.557
(Laughter)

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.543
I think I messed up some people's emails.
They're correcting them.

00:08:16.567 --> 00:08:17.632
(Laughter)

00:08:17.656 --> 00:08:19.271
With all of that said,

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:22.793

to pick up the phone.

00:08:22.817 --> 00:08:25.947
You have to know when it is time
to have a face-to-face.

00:08:26.446 --> 00:08:29.328
And these face-to-face
conversations are not easy.

00:08:29.352 --> 00:08:32.153
They are difficult,
but they are necessary.
