00:09:59.044 --> 00:10:01.477
I'm going to agree
with your recommendations."

00:10:02.154 --> 00:10:06.814
So you're kind of side-eyeing them

Again, we can't make a scene
in front of people, right?

00:10:24.815 --> 00:10:26.203
So you've got to hold it in.

00:10:26.227 --> 00:10:28.758
And then, after the meeting,

00:10:28.782 --> 00:10:32.143
that same coworker has all the audacity,
