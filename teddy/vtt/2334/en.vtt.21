00:10:28.782 --> 00:10:32.143
that same coworker has all the audacity,

00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:35.100
comes up to you and says,
"Crazy meeting, right?"

00:10:35.124 --> 00:10:37.492
(Laughter)

00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:38.693
Yeah.

00:10:38.717 --> 00:10:41.350
They're testing you now.
It's a test. (Laughs)

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:43.661
So that's the perfect time
to just go off, right?

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.208
This is a repeat offender.

00:10:45.232 --> 00:10:46.234
(Laughter)

00:10:46.258 --> 00:10:48.530
You walked away,
and they came back with it.

00:10:49.604 --> 00:10:55.723
But we're trying to avoid workplace drama,
not take a cannonball leap into it,

00:10:55.747 --> 00:10:57.549
so we have to walk away.

00:10:58.198 --> 00:11:02.107
You lead that conversation
by taking the first available exit.
