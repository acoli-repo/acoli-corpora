Alright. I have a close,
tight-knit circle of friends.

00:00:04.468 --> 00:00:08.004
We're all in different cities
and we're all in different areas,

00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:11.824
from local news to city government

00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:15.476
to law, financial services ...

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:17.885
And despite those different areas,

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.553
we seem to share similar stories
of workplace drama.

00:00:22.232 --> 00:00:24.479
Now, I define workplace drama as

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:27.539
an annoyance that adds
additional stress to the job.

00:00:27.868 --> 00:00:30.055
So again, it's when people
get on your nerves,
