00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:34.653
We typically try to set expectations --
our expectations --

00:11:34.677 --> 00:11:36.193
on other people,

00:11:36.217 --> 00:11:39.151
and then get disappointed
when they don't follow through.

00:11:39.881 --> 00:11:45.620
We have to learn
to accept people where they are

00:11:45.644 --> 00:11:49.764
and adjust ourselves
to handle those situations.

00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:52.668
The goal in this step

00:11:52.692 --> 00:11:58.312
is to recognize when it is time
to professionally walk away from someone.
