They are difficult,
but they are necessary.

00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:36.543
The goal is to try to understand
the other person's perspective.

00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:39.647
So you'll start the conversation
with things like,

00:08:39.671 --> 00:08:41.827
"OK, you got upset when I ..."

00:08:41.851 --> 00:08:43.431
Or you'll say things like,

00:08:43.455 --> 00:08:46.074
"OK, you already had
the situation handled,

00:08:46.098 --> 00:08:47.707
and then I ..."

00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:51.213
So that way, you can see
exactly where they're coming from.

00:08:52.258 --> 00:08:55.524
Also, don't try to make people like you.

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:59.741
We all have our own upbringings.
We all have our experiences.

00:08:59.765 --> 00:09:03.323
And we all have our own
communication styles.
