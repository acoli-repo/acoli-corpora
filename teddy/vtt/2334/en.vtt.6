00:02:59.202 --> 00:03:01.294
that doesn't exist.

00:03:02.104 --> 00:03:03.952
Then we also have to be careful about

00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:06.589
listening to other people's
made-up scenarios.

00:03:06.613 --> 00:03:08.006
Here's what I mean.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.713
Let's say you're in the break room,

00:03:09.737 --> 00:03:12.132
and you're talking to some coworkers.

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.706
Then, all of a sudden,
another coworker comes in.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.358
Now, they seem to just be
in deep thought --

00:03:18.382 --> 00:03:20.933
not overly cheerful, but they're not rude.

00:03:21.463 --> 00:03:23.579
They come in, they walk out.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.703
Then the coworkers over here
begin to diagnose

00:03:27.727 --> 00:03:30.223
what they feel is wrong
with that person.
