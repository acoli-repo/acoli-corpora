00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.416
to try to spare ourselves
just a little pain

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.000
somewhere further down the road.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.216
We pushed past that self-preservation

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.160
because Joel was worth loving
even if that love could crush us.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.640
And that lesson of intense
vulnerability has changed me ...

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.000
more than any award ever could.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.736
We started living like Joel could live,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.000
and we began developing a video game
called "That Dragon, Cancer."

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.040
It was the story of Joel.
