00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.496
what we as designers
were trying to express and why,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.880
the richer the experience becomes.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.416
We took that vulnerability
that Joel taught us,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.000
and we encoded the game with it.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.096
Players expect their video games
to offer them branching narrative

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.656
so that every decision
that they make feels important

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.376
and can change the outcome of the game.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.176
We subverted that principle
of game design,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.576
collapsing the choices in on the player

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.376
so that they discover for themselves

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.600
that there is nothing that they can do
that will change the outcome for Joel.
