They tell me that they miss Joel,
even though they never met him.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.000
They describe the tears
that they've shed for my son,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.736
and it makes my burden of grief
just a little bit lighter

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.856
knowing that it's shared
with a 10-year-old

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.896
watching a YouTube playthrough,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.136
or a doctor playing on his airplane
with a smartphone,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.600
or a professor introducing Joel
to her first-year philosophy students.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.400
We made a video game that's hard to play.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.216
But that feels just right to me,
