00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.856
Our video game was our attempt
to share that world

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.096
with people who hadn't
experienced it before,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.920
because we never could imagine
that world until it became ours.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.240
We made a video game that's hard to play.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.616
It will never be a blockbuster.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.376
People have to prepare themselves
to invest emotionally

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.920
in a story that they know
will break their hearts.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.216
But when our hearts break,

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.560
they heal a little differently.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.895
My broken heart has been healing
with a new and a deeper compassion --
