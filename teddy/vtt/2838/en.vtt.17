00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.895
My broken heart has been healing
with a new and a deeper compassion --

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.856
a desire to sit with people in their pain,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.895
to hear their stories
and try to help tell them

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.880
so that they know that they're seen.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.936
On the night when "That Dragon, Cancer"
won the Game for Impact Award,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.376
we cheered,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.576
we smiled and we talked about Joel

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.856
and the impact he had on our life --

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.976
on all of those hard and hopeful nights
that we shared with him

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.456
when he changed our hearts
