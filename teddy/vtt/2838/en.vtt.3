00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.376
so I started telling them a bedtime story.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.256
I told them about this
very brave knight named Joel

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.920
and his adventure fighting
a terrible dragon called cancer.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.776
Every night, I told them
more of the story,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.816
but I never let the story end.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.976
I was just building up a context
that they could understand

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.256
and hoping that our prayers
would be answered

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.776
and I would never
have to tell them that that knight,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.096
who had fought so bravely,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.656
was done fighting

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.960
and could rest now, forever.
