Two months ago, my kids and I
huddled around a cell phone

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.456
watching the live stream
of the Game Awards,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.376
one of the video game
industry's biggest nights.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.056
They announced the nominees
for the Game for Impact,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.136
an award that's given
to a thought-provoking video game

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.936
with a profound prosocial
message or meaning.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.656
They opened the envelope

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.896
and they read the title of our video game.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.296
An award ...

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.136
for impact.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.856
It was almost funny, actually,
