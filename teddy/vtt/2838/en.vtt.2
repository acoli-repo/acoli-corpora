00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.416
And before that year was finished,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.976
doctors sat my husband and I down

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.256
and let us know
that his tumor had returned

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.000
despite the most aggressive chemotherapy
and radiation that they could offer him.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.976
On that terrible night,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.096
after learning that Joel
had perhaps four months to live,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.976
I cuddled up with
my two older sons in bed --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.536
they were five and three at the time --

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.656
and I never really knew
how much they understood,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.376
so I started telling them a bedtime story.
