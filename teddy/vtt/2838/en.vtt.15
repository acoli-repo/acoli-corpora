00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.456
If you're listening to me
and you're trying to imagine this family

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.696
that revolves entirely
around a dying child,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.736
and you can't imagine joy
as part of that picture,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.816
then we were right
to share our story with you,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.496
because that season of our life was hard.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.296
Unspeakably hard at times,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.400
but it was also pure hope,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.616
deep love

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.520
and joy like I have never
experienced since.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.856
Our video game was our attempt
to share that world
