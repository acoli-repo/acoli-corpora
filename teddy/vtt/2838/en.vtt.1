00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.856
It was almost funny, actually,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.536
because I always thought
that winning an award like that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.216
would have this huge impact on my life,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.000
but I found that the opposite is true.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.256
The big nights,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.376
the accomplishments --

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.976
they fade.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.416
But the hardest nights of my life
have stuck with me,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.936
impacting who I am

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.680
and what I do.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.560
In 2010, my third son, Joel, was diagnosed
with a rare and aggressive brain tumor.
