00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.056
I sat in on our team's design meetings,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.176
I added more ideas
and I helped direct scenes.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.096
And I discovered that creating
a video game is telling a story,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.856
but with an entirely new vocabulary.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.416
All the same elements of imagination
and symbolism are there,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.056
but they're just partnered
with player agency

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.080
and system responsiveness.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.736
It's challenging work.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.776
I have to think
in a totally new way to do it,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.456
but I love it.
