Iâ€™m Aicha Evans,

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:04.167
I am from Senegal, West Africa,

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:08.880
and I fell in love with technology,
science and engineering

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.048
at a very young age.

00:00:10.173 --> 00:00:11.299
Three things happened.

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:14.010
I was studying in Paris,

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.763
and starting
at seven years old,

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:20.475
flying back and forth
between Dakar, Senegal and Paris

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:21.934
as an unaccompanied minor.

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.312
So it wasn't just about the travel.

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:27.148
It was really about a portal to knowledge,

00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:28.232
different environments

00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:29.358
and adapting.
