00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.299
After five years, it went away on its own.

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.998
It's a mystery.

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:08.347
In New Zealand, Dr. Lianne Parkin

00:03:08.347 --> 00:03:13.909
and her team tested an old 
tradition in her city.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.636
They live in a city that has huge hills,

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:18.255
San Francisco-grade hills.

00:03:18.255 --> 00:03:20.372
And in the winter there,
it gets very cold

00:03:20.372 --> 00:03:21.556
and very icy.

00:03:21.556 --> 00:03:23.150
There are lots of injuries.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.415
The tradition that they tested,

00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:27.047
they tested by asking people

00:03:27.047 --> 00:03:29.446
who were on their way to 
work in the morning,

00:03:29.446 --> 00:03:31.389
to stop and try something out.
