00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:32.456
true, have our brains packaged.

00:01:32.456 --> 00:01:34.839
They, the woodpeckers, typically

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:37.027
will peck, they will bang their head

00:01:37.027 --> 00:01:42.318
on a piece of wood thousands 
of times every day. Every day!

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:44.231
And as far as anyone knows,

00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:45.437
that doesn't bother them in the slightest.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.703
How does this happen?

00:01:47.703 --> 00:01:50.629
Their brain does not slosh around like ours does.

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:53.341
Their brain is packed in very tightly,

00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.197
at least for blows coming 
right from the front.

00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:58.140
Not too many people paid attention

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.224
to this research until
the last few years
