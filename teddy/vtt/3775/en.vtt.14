00:06:59.156 --> 00:07:01.929
won an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics.

00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:03.681
The other thing you win is an invitation

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.184
to come to the ceremony,

00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:06.926
which happens at Harvard University.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.061
And when you get there,

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:10.778

meeting place and classroom.

00:07:10.778 --> 00:07:12.063
It fits 1,100 people,

00:07:12.063 --> 00:07:13.189

waiting to hand you your Ig Nobel prize,

00:07:18.086 --> 00:07:20.735
are a bunch of Nobel prize winners.

00:07:20.735 --> 00:07:22.034
That's the heart of the ceremony.

00:07:22.034 --> 00:07:24.184
The winners are kept secret until that moment,

00:07:24.184 --> 00:07:26.611
even the Nobel laureates 
who will shake their hand

00:07:26.611 --> 00:07:29.854
don't know who they are
until they're announced.

00:07:29.854 --> 00:07:32.974
