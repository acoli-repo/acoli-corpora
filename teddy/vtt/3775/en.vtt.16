When he got there, he went to work
in a hospital, and he was curious

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.195
what kinds of things happen to people
that bring them to the hospital.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.493
He looked through the 
records, and he discovered

00:08:08.493 --> 00:08:11.283
that a surprisingly large number of people

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:12.449

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.782

00:08:17.782 --> 00:08:21.581

00:08:23.829 --> 00:08:25.289
where there are lots.

00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:26.679

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:29.348
is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down.

00:08:29.348 --> 00:08:31.955
A coconut tree that is 90 feet tall,
