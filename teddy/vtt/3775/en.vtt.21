00:10:29.867 --> 00:10:31.425
that in an emergency

00:10:31.425 --> 00:10:32.618
can be quickly separated 


00:10:32.618 --> 00:10:36.137
into a pair of protective face masks.

00:10:36.137 --> 00:10:37.904
One to save your life,

00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:43.228
one to save the life of some 
lucky bystander. (Laughter)

00:10:43.228 --> 00:10:46.255
Why would someone do this, you might wonder.

00:10:46.255 --> 00:10:48.387
Dr. Bodnar came to the ceremony

00:10:48.387 --> 00:10:51.348
and she explained that 
she grew up in Ukraine.

00:10:51.348 --> 00:10:53.064
She was one of the doctors who treated victims

00:10:53.064 --> 00:10:55.108
of the Chernobyl power plant meltdown.

00:10:55.108 --> 00:10:57.692
And they later discovered that

00:10:57.692 --> 00:10:59.617
a lot of the worst medical problems

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.739
came from the particles people breathed in.
