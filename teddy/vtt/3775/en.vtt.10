00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.250
Every year, we get in the neighborhood

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.692
of 9,000 new nominations 
for the Ig Nobel prize.

00:05:05.692 --> 00:05:08.521
Of those, consistently between 10 percent

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:11.004
and 20 percent of those nominations

00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:14.914
are people who nominate themselves.

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:18.881
Those self-nominees almost never win.

00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:23.200
It's very difficult, numerically, 
to win a prize if you want to.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.045
Even if you don't want to,

00:05:25.045 --> 00:05:27.761
it's very difficult numerically.

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:31.411
You should know that when 
we choose somebody
