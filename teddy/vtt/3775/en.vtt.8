00:03:56.516 --> 00:04:01.894
Now, I hope you will agree
with me that these things

00:04:01.894 --> 00:04:04.109
I've just described to you,

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:10.289
each of them, deserves some kind of prize.
(Laughter)

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:11.924
And that's what they got,

00:04:11.924 --> 00:04:15.199
each of them got an Ig Nobel prize.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.191
In 1991, I, together with bunch of other people,

00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:22.094
started the Ig Nobel prize ceremony.

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:25.026
Every year we give out 10 prizes.

00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:32.009
The prizes are based on just 
one criteria. It's very simple.
