00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:33.810
received this patient and didn't 
really know what to do about it.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.670
The man had cut his finger,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.143
he worked processing chickens,

00:02:39.143 --> 00:02:41.579
and then he started to
smell really, really bad.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:42.798
So bad that when 
he got in a room

00:02:42.798 --> 00:02:44.115
with the doctors and the nurses,

00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:46.874
they couldn't stand being 
in the room with him.

00:02:46.874 --> 00:02:48.675
It was intolerable.

00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:50.174
They tried every drug,

00:02:50.174 --> 00:02:51.992
every other treatment
they could think of.

00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:54.223
After a year, he still 
smelled putrid.

00:02:54.223 --> 00:02:56.032
After two years, still smelled putrid.

00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:59.262
Three years, four years,
still smelled putrid.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.299
After five years, it went away on its own.
