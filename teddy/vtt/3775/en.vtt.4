00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.224
to this research until
the last few years

00:02:01.224 --> 00:02:03.839
when, in this country especially,

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:05.227
people are becoming curious about

00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:07.422
what happens to the brains
of football players

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:10.150
who bang their heads repeatedly.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.218
And the woodpecker maybe relates to that.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.311
There was a paper published

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:19.056
in the medical journal The Lancet

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:20.486
in England a few years ago called

00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:27.903
" A man who pricked his finger
and smelled putrid for 5 years."

00:02:27.903 --> 00:02:29.711
Dr. Caroline Mills and her team

00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:33.810
received this patient and didn't 
really know what to do about it.
