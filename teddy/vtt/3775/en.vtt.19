00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.471
The basic problem, I'm sure you're familiar with,

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:36.800
that you're looking inside a 
long, narrow, dark place.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.355
And so, you want to have a larger space.

00:09:40.355 --> 00:09:42.486
You add some gas to inflate it

00:09:42.486 --> 00:09:44.400
so you have room to look around.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.127
Now, that's added to the 
gas, the methane gas,

00:09:47.127 --> 00:09:48.635
that's already inside.

00:09:48.635 --> 00:09:51.635
The gas that they used at first,
in many cases, was oxygen.

00:09:51.635 --> 00:09:54.084
So they added oxygen to methane gas.

00:09:54.084 --> 00:09:55.799
And then they wanted to be able to see,

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:57.047
they needed light,

00:09:57.047 --> 00:09:58.452
so they'd put in a light source,

00:09:58.452 --> 00:10:00.228
which in the 1950s was very hot.
