Doctor Ivan Schwab in California

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.984
is one of the people, 
one of the main people,

00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:12.570
who helped answer the question,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.281
"Why don't woodpeckers get headaches?"

00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:19.498
And it turns out the answer to that

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:21.722
is because their brains

00:01:21.722 --> 00:01:23.493
are packaged inside their skulls

00:01:23.493 --> 00:01:25.993
in a way different from the way

00:01:25.993 --> 00:01:28.497
our brains, we being human beings,

00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:32.456
true, have our brains packaged.
