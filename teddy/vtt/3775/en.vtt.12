These are always handmade
from extremely cheap materials.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.881
You're looking at a picture

00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:09.910
of the prize we gave last year, 2013.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.946
Most prizes in the world also give

00:06:11.946 --> 00:06:16.644
their winners some cash, some money.

00:06:16.644 --> 00:06:17.707
We don't have any money,

00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:19.218
so we can't give them.

00:06:19.218 --> 00:06:22.094
In fact, the winners have to
pay their own way

00:06:22.094 --> 00:06:24.898
to come to the Ig Nobel ceremony,

00:06:24.898 --> 00:06:26.761
which most of them do.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:29.754
Last year, though, we did manage
to scrape up some money.

00:06:29.754 --> 00:06:34.265
Last year, each of the 10
Ig Nobel prize winners
