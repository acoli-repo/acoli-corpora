00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:31.411
You should know that when 
we choose somebody

00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:32.683
to win an Ig Nobel prize,

00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:36.259
We get in touch with that person, very quietly.

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.820
We offer them the chance to decline

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.202
this great honor if they want to.

00:05:42.202 --> 00:05:45.526
Happily for us, almost everyone 
who's offered a prize

00:05:45.526 --> 00:05:49.035
decides to accept.

00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:51.976
What do you get if you
win an Ig Nobel prize?

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.553
Well, you get several things.

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:57.083
You get an Ig Nobel prize.

00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:59.414
The design is different every year.

00:05:59.414 --> 00:06:04.220
These are always handmade
from extremely cheap materials.
