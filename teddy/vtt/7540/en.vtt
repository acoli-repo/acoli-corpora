00:00:01.497 --> 00:00:03.875
Director: TED, Best Buy,
Tim Dunn, take one.

00:00:05.168 --> 00:00:09.630
Tim Dunn: The climate crisis that we're in
can be so daunting to think about,

00:00:09.672 --> 00:00:11.549
it's so systemic.

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.843
How do I, as an individual,

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:16.471
step into this space
and make a difference?

00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:20.183
Just think of your house or your apartment
where you have everything on.

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:23.102
Plugging your refrigerator in:
big energy draw in your house;

00:00:23.102 --> 00:00:25.438
plugging your TV in,
full family entertainment,

00:00:25.438 --> 00:00:26.856
there's another energy draw.

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:28.816
You take your stove, your dishwasher,

00:00:28.858 --> 00:00:30.902
your clothes washer, your clothes dryer.
