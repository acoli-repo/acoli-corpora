00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:30.592
For the first time, I came to understand

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:34.031
that something valuable
can be best understood

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:37.053
not by its presence,

00:00:37.077 --> 00:00:38.664
but by its absence.

00:00:40.387 --> 00:00:42.122
It was impossible to know then

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:46.807
just how powerful the absence
of those things we love

00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:50.948
would have an impact far into my future.

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:55.559
For 23 years, my working life
was with Yvon Chouinard.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.821
I started when he was designing
and manufacturing

00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:00.815
technical rock and ice climbing equipment
