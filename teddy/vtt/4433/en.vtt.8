00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.006
But from where we sat,

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.830
we saw the dark side of industrial growth.

00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:08.014
And when industrial worldviews
are applied to natural systems

00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:10.593
that support all life,

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:13.204
we begin to treat the Earth

00:04:13.228 --> 00:04:17.695
as a factory that produces all the things
that we think we need.

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.077
As we're all painfully aware,

00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:27.394
the consequences of that worldview
are destructive to human welfare,

00:04:27.418 --> 00:04:30.033
our climate systems and to wildlife.
