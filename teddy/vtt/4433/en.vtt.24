The local mountain lions and foxes
had been persecuted for decades,

00:12:00.104 --> 00:12:02.184
leaving their numbers very low.

00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:07.655
Today, those lands are the 763,000-acre
Patagonian National Park,

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:09.289
and it looks like this.

00:12:09.313 --> 00:12:11.592
And Arcelio, the former gaucho,

00:12:11.616 --> 00:12:17.839
whose job was to first find and kill
mountain lions in the years past,

00:12:17.863 --> 00:12:22.863
today is the head tracker
for the park's wildlife team,

00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:27.832
and his story captures the imagination
of people around the world.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.500
What is possible.
