and joined Doug as he started

00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:35.742
There we were, refugees
from the corporate world,

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:38.718
holed up in a cabin on the coast
in southern Chile,

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:41.067
surrounded by primaeval rainforest

00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:44.440
where alerce trees
can live for thousands of years.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.993

00:02:51.224 --> 00:02:54.152
between Fairbanks, Alaska, and Cape Horn.

00:02:54.176 --> 00:02:56.466
A radical change to our daily lives

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.268
spurred on as we had begun to recognize

00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:02.371
how beauty and diversity
were being destroyed
