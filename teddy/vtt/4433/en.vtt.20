00:09:57.673 --> 00:10:00.776
for the first time in over half a century

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.434
into Iberá wetlands,

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:08.291
and now, the 1.7-million-acre Iberá Park
will provide enough space

00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:12.783
for recovering jaguar populations
with low risk of conflict

00:10:12.807 --> 00:10:15.077
with neighboring ranchers.

00:10:15.101 --> 00:10:17.680
Our rewilding projects in Chile

00:10:17.704 --> 00:10:21.256
are gaining ground on low numbers
of several key species

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.844
in the Patagonia region.

00:10:22.868 --> 00:10:26.606
The huemul deer
that is truly nearly extinct,

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.060
the lesser rheas

00:10:28.084 --> 00:10:33.401
and building the puma
and fox populations back up.
