Doug called it the price of progress.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.119
That's how we saw things,

00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:39.011
and we wanted to be a part
of the resistance,

00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:41.819
pushing up against all of those trends.

00:04:41.843 --> 00:04:44.732
The idea of buying private land
and then donating it

00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:46.748
to create national parks

00:04:46.772 --> 00:04:48.231
isn't really new.

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:53.593
Anyone who has ever enjoyed the views
of Teton National Park in Wyoming

00:04:53.617 --> 00:04:56.823
or camped in Acadia National Park in Maine

00:04:56.847 --> 00:04:59.804
has benefited from this big idea.
