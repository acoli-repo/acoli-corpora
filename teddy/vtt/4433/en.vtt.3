00:01:29.174 --> 00:01:33.014
was an old friend and climbing
companion of Yvon's

00:01:33.038 --> 00:01:35.323
and also an entrepreneur.

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:39.252
He cofounded The North Face
and Esprit company.

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:41.331
All three of these businesses

00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:44.887
were created by people
who had grown up through the '60s,

00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:49.783
shaped by the civil rights, antiwar,
feminist and peace movements.

00:01:49.807 --> 00:01:53.998
And those values
were picked up in those years

00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:57.895
and carried throughout
the values of these companies.

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:59.506
By the end of the 1980s,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.387
