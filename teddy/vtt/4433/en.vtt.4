00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.387
Doug decided to leave business altogether

00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:05.950
and commit the last third of his life
to what he called

00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:08.355
"paying his rent
for living on the planet."

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.926
At nearly the same time, when I hit 40,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.366
I was ready to do something
completely new with my life.

00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:19.343
The day after retiring
from the Patagonia company,

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:24.454
I flew 6,000 miles to Patagonia the place

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:30.276
and joined Doug as he started
what was the first conservation project
