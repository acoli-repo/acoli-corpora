completely.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.878
Unless all the members of the community
are present and flourishing,

00:09:05.902 --> 00:09:10.767
it's impossible for us to leave behind
fully functioning ecosystems.

00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:15.690
Since then, we've successfully
reintroduced several native species

00:09:15.714 --> 00:09:17.587
to the Iberá Wetlands:

00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:19.365
giant anteaters,

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:20.770
pampas deer,

00:09:20.794 --> 00:09:22.063
peccaries

00:09:22.087 --> 00:09:28.053
and finally, one of the most difficult,
the green-winged macaws,

00:09:28.077 --> 00:09:32.736
who've gone missing
for over 100 years in that ecosystem.
