00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:31.467
In 2019, we finalized
the largest private land gift in history,

00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:35.364
when our last million acres
of conservation land in Chile

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:37.133
passed to the government.

00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:39.839
A public-private partnership

00:07:39.863 --> 00:07:44.085
that created five new national parks
and expanded three others.

00:07:44.109 --> 00:07:48.371
This ended up being
an area larger than Switzerland.

00:07:48.395 --> 00:07:52.220
All of our projects
are the results of partnerships.

00:07:52.244 --> 00:07:56.370
First and foremost with the governments
of Chile and Argentina.

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.942
And this requires leadership

00:07:58.966 --> 00:08:03.101
who understands the value of protecting
the jewels of their countries,
