00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:02.371
how beauty and diversity
were being destroyed

00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:03.879
pretty much everywhere.

00:03:03.903 --> 00:03:07.371
The last wild protected places on earth

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:08.594
were still wild

00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:12.712
mostly because the relentless
front lines of development

00:03:12.736 --> 00:03:14.973
simply hadn't arrived there yet.

00:03:14.997 --> 00:03:18.236
Doug and I were in one
of the most remote parts on earth,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.418
and still around the edges
of Pumalín Park,

00:03:21.442 --> 00:03:23.696
our first conservation effort,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.573
industrial aquaculture
was growing like a malignancy.

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:31.942
Before too long, other threats
arrived to the Patagonia region.
