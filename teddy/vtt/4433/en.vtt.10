00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:01.926
Through our family foundation,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.347
we began to acquire wildlife habitat
in Chile and Argentina.

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:09.673
Being believers in conservation biology,

00:05:09.697 --> 00:05:13.309
we were going for big, wild and connected.

00:05:14.085 --> 00:05:16.760
Areas that were pristine, in some cases,

00:05:16.784 --> 00:05:19.498
and others that would need time to heal,

00:05:19.522 --> 00:05:21.903

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:26.720
from willing sellers,

00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:31.140
assembling them into privately
managed protected areas,
