00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of what it was like in a courtyard then.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I think we may have lost something in our culture.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So I'm gonna take you through

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
what I think is a remarkable sequence.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
North of Churchill, Manitoba, in October and November,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
there's no ice on Hudson Bay.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And this polar bear that you see, this 1200-pound male,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
he's wild and fairly hungry.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And Norbert Rosing, a German photographer,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is there on scene, making a series of photos of these huskies, who are tethered.
