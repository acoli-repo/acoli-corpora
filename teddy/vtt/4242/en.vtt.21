So it's -- for me, its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play, and to bring together people

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And this is one of the ways you can study play --

is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility,
