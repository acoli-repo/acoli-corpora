00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So what happens?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
They both hide out.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
The non-players never come out --

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
they die.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
The players slowly explore the environment,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and begin again to test things out.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
That says to me, at least in rats --

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and a similar cortical architecture --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
that play may be pretty important for our survival.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And, and, and -- there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about.
