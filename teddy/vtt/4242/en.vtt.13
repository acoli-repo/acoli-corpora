00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
They have located two consultants,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
who are -- Frank Wilson is a neurologist, Nate Johnson is a mechanic.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
He taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion, quite on his own,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that the students who could no longer solve problems, such as fixing cars,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
hadn't worked with their hands.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Frank Wilson had written a book called "The Hand."

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
They got together -- JPL hired them.
