Now, the program says that the opposite of play is not work,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
it's depression.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And I think if you think about life without play --

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
no humor, no flirtation, no movies,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
no games, no fantasy and, and, and.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Try and imagine a culture or a life, adult or otherwise

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
without play.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And the thing that's so unique about our species

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And we all have capacity to play signal.
