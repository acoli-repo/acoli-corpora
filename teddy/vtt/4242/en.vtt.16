00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
no claws, flat fur, soft eyes,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
open mouth with no fangs, balletic movements,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
curvilinear movements -- all specific to play.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Preschool kids, for example, should be allowed to dive, hit, whistle,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000
scream, be chaotic, and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive, emotional and physical --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that come as a part of rough and tumble play.
