00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And something very unusual happens.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereotyped

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and ends up with a meal -- changes.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And this polar bear

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
stands over the husky,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
no claws extended, no fangs taking a look.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And they begin an incredible ballet.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
A play ballet.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous nature

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death.
