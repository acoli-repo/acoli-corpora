00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and you suppress play -- they squeak, they wrestle,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
they pin each other, that's part of their play.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and then you present those rats

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
with a cat odor-saturated collar,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
they're hardwired to flee and hide.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Pretty smart -- they don't want to get killed by a cat.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So what happens?
