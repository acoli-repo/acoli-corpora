that come as a part of rough and tumble play.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Spectator play, ritual play -- we're involved in some of that.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment -- rare --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
where the Red Sox won the World Series.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
in this fuzzy picture, and you can get a sense that they're all at play.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Imaginative play.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I love this picture because my daughter, who's now almost 40, is in this picture,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
her ability to spin yarns at this age -- preschool.
