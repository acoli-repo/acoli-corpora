00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous nature

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and look a little more closely, they're in an altered state.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
They're in a state of play.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And it's that state

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that allows these two creatures to explore the possible.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They are beginning to do something that neither would have done

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
without the play signals.
