00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
builds on this base for us humans.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
but it's never just singularly one thing.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
We're going to look at body play,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity.
