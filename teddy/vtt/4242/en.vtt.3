00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is there on scene, making a series of photos of these huskies, who are tethered.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And from out of stage left comes this wild, male polar bear,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
with a predatory gaze.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that you know you're in trouble.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But on the other side of that predatory gaze

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
is a female husky in a play bow, wagging her tail.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And something very unusual happens.
