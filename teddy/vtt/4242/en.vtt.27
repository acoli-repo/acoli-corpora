00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And we all have capacity to play signal.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
What's going to follow from that behavior

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
is play.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And you can trust it.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
The basis of human trust is established through play signals.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And we begin to lose those signals, culturally and otherwise, as adults.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
That's a shame.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I think we've got a lot of learning to do.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Now, Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps.
