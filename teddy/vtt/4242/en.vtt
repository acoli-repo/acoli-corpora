00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, here we go: a flyby of play.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's got to be serious if the New York Times

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
puts a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
At the bottom of this, it says, "It's deeper than gender.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Seriously, but dangerously fun.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Not bad, except if you look at that cover, what's missing?
