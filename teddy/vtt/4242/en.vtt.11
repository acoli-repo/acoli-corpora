00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
This is a mountain goat.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
If you're having a bad day, try this:

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
jump up and down, wiggle around -- you're going to feel better.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And you may feel like this character,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
who is also just doing it for its own sake.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It doesn't have a particular purpose, and that's what's great about play.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
If its purpose is more important

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
than the act of doing it, it's probably not play.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And there's a whole other type of play, which is object play.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and he or she's going to roll down a hill.
