which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So what I would encourage on an individual level to do,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
is to explore backwards as far as you can go

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
to the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
whether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
into how that connects with your life now.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And you'll find, you may change jobs --
