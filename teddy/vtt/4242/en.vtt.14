They got together -- JPL hired them.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Now JPL, NASA and Boeing,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
before they will hire a research and development problem solver --

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech --

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
if they haven't fixed cars, haven't done stuff with their hands early in life,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
played with their hands, they can't problem-solve as well.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So play is practical, and it's very important.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration. (Laughter)

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But it has to be safe exploration.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
This happens to be OK -- he's an anatomically interested little boy
