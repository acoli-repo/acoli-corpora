00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And other studies of populations at risk

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
sensitized me to the importance of play,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
but I didn't really understand what it was.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
before I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it, by any means.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But there are ways of looking at it

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that I think can give you -- give us all a taxonomy, a way of thinking about it.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And this image is, for humans, the beginning point of play.
