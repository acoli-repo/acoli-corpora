00:00:00.693 --> 00:00:02.948
I'm going to ask and try to answer,

00:00:02.948 --> 00:00:07.846
in some ways, kind of an uncomfortable question.

00:00:07.846 --> 00:00:10.200
Both civilians, obviously, and soldiers

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.286
suffer in war;

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:14.750
I don't think any civilian has ever missed

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.112
the war that they were subjected to.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:20.130
I've been covering wars for almost 20 years,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.458
and one of the remarkable things for me

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:27.342
is how many soldiers find themselves missing it.

00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:29.647
How is it someone can go through

00:00:29.647 --> 00:00:31.984
the worst experience imaginable,
