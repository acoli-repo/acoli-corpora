00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:30.398
in the bottom two buckets,

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:32.659
the bottom 40 percent?

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.351
Take a second. Think about it
and have a number.

00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:37.255
Usually we don't think.

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:39.740
Think for a second,
have a real number in your mind.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.365
You have it?

00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:44.430
Okay, here's what lots
of Americans tell us.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.357
They think that the bottom 20 percent

00:02:46.357 --> 00:02:48.679
has about 2.9 percent of the wealth,

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:50.862
the next group has 6.4,

00:02:50.862 --> 00:02:53.369
so together it's slightly more than nine.

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.782
The next group, they say, has 12 percent,

00:02:56.782 --> 00:02:58.431
20 percent,

00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:03.075
and the richest 20 percent, people think
has 58 percent of the wealth.
