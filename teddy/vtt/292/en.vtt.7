00:03:24.651 --> 00:03:30.392
and the richest group
has 84-85 percent of the wealth.

00:03:30.392 --> 00:03:33.358
So what we actually have
and what we think we have

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:35.331
are very different.

00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:37.421
What about what we want?

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:39.418
How do we even figure this out?

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:40.829
So to look at this,

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.407
to look at what we really want,

00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:45.472
we thought about
the philosopher John Rawls.

00:03:45.472 --> 00:03:47.307
If you remember John Rawls,

00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:50.557
he had this notion
of what's a just society.

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:52.039
He said a just society

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:54.754
is a society that if
you knew everything about it,

00:03:54.754 --> 00:03:57.187
you would be willing
to enter it in a random place.

00:03:57.187 --> 00:03:58.711
And it's a beautiful definition,

00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:01.189
because if you're wealthy,
you might want the wealthy
