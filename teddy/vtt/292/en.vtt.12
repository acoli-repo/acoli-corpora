00:05:56.774 --> 00:06:00.120
We also asked this question
about something else.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.089
We asked, what about the ratio
of CEO pay to unskilled workers?

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:08.246
So you can see what
people think is the ratio,

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:12.147
and then we can ask the question,
what do they think should be the ratio?

00:06:12.147 --> 00:06:14.774
And then we can ask, what is reality?

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:18.052
What is reality? And you could say,
well, it's not that bad, right?

00:06:18.052 --> 00:06:20.205
The red and the yellow
are not that different.

00:06:20.205 --> 00:06:24.125
But the fact is, it's because
I didn't draw them on the same scale.

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:30.015
It's hard to see, there's yellow
and blue in there.
