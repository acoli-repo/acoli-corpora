What are the characteristics of a country
that would make you want to join it,

00:04:32.648 --> 00:04:35.806
knowing that you could end
randomly at any place?

00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:37.285
And here is what we got.

00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:39.544
What did people want to give
to the first group,

00:04:39.544 --> 00:04:41.727
the bottom 20 percent?

00:04:41.727 --> 00:04:44.421
They wanted to give them
about 10 percent of the wealth.

00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:47.021
The next group, 14 percent of the wealth,

00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:52.384
21, 22 and 32.

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:55.890
Now, nobody in our sample
wanted full equality.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.323
Nobody thought that socialism
is a fantastic idea in our sample.
