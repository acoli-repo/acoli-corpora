00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:31.217
We asked rich and poor,
they gave us the same answer,

00:05:31.217 --> 00:05:32.518
men and women,

00:05:32.518 --> 00:05:35.211
NPR listeners and Forbes readers.

00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:38.440
We asked people in England,
Australia, the U.S. --

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.157
very similar answers.

00:05:40.157 --> 00:05:42.928
We even asked different
departments of a university.

00:05:42.928 --> 00:05:45.686
We went to Harvard and we checked
almost every department,

00:05:45.686 --> 00:05:47.698
and in fact, from Harvard Business School,

00:05:47.698 --> 00:05:51.410
where a few people wanted the wealthy
to have more and the [poor] to have less,

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.950
the similarity was astonishing.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.774
I know some of you went
to Harvard Business School.

00:05:56.774 --> 00:06:00.120
We also asked this question
about something else.
