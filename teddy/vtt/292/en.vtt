It would be nice to be
objective in life,

00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:05.593
in many ways.

00:00:05.593 --> 00:00:08.971
The problem is that we have
these color-tinted glasses

00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:13.650
as we look at all kinds of situations.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.366
For example, think about
something as simple as beer.

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.548
If I gave you a few beers to taste

00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:23.356
and I asked you to rate them
on intensity and bitterness,

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:27.053
different beers would occupy
different space.

00:00:27.053 --> 00:00:29.810
But what if we tried
to be objective about it?

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.970
In the case of beer,
it would be very simple.
