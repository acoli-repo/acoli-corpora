00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:30.157
and our expectations color our world.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:33.559
But what happened
in more important questions?

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:37.111
What happened with questions
that had to do with social justice?

00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:40.516
So we wanted to think about
what is the blind tasting version

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:43.581
for thinking about inequality?

00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:45.880
So we started looking at inequality,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.830
and we did some large-scale surveys

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.384
around the U.S. and other countries.

00:01:50.384 --> 00:01:52.335
So we asked two questions:

00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:55.701
Do people know what kind of
level of inequality we have?

00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:59.812
And then, what level of inequality
do we want to have?

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:02.226
So let's think about the first question.
