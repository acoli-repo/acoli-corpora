00:07:28.088 --> 00:07:30.710
And the knowledge gap
is something that we think about,

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.080
how do we educate people?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.796
How do we get people to think
differently about inequality

00:07:34.796 --> 00:07:38.558
and the consequences of inequality
in terms of health, education,

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:40.949
jealousy, crime rate, and so on?

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:42.830
Then we have the desirability gap.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.653
How do we get people to think differently
about what we really want?

00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:50.028
You see, the Rawls definition,
the Rawls way of looking at the world,

00:07:50.028 --> 00:07:51.770
the blind tasting approach,

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.695
takes our selfish motivation
out of the picture.

00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:57.272
How do we implement that
to a higher degree

00:07:57.272 --> 00:07:59.896
on a more extensive scale?

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.752
And finally, we also have an action gap.
