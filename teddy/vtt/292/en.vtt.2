00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:01.876
Some people, we told them
the medications were expensive.

00:01:01.876 --> 00:01:03.757
Some people, we told them it was cheap.

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:06.729
And the expensive
pain medication worked better.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.283
It relieved more pain from people,

00:01:09.283 --> 00:01:12.787
because expectations
do change our physiology.

00:01:12.787 --> 00:01:14.849
And of course, we all know that in sports,

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:16.667
if you are a fan of a particular team,

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.036
you can't help but see the game

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:22.541
develop from the perspective of your team.

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:26.717
So all of those are cases in which
our preconceived notions

00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:30.157
and our expectations color our world.
