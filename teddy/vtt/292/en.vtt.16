And finally, we also have an action gap.

00:08:02.752 --> 00:08:05.701
How do we take these things
and actually do something about it?

00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:08.603
I think part of the answer
is to think about people

00:08:08.603 --> 00:08:11.715
like young kids and babies
that don't have much agency,

00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:15.523
because people seem to be
more willing to do this.

00:08:15.523 --> 00:08:20.793
To summarize, I would say,
next time you go to drink beer or wine,

00:08:20.793 --> 00:08:24.880
first of all, think about, what is it
in your experience that is real,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.154
and what is it in your experience
that is a placebo effect

00:08:28.154 --> 00:08:29.758
coming from expectations?

00:08:29.758 --> 00:08:33.287
And then think about what it also means
for other decisions in your life,
