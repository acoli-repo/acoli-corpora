00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:02.226
So let's think about the first question.

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:04.339
Imagine I took all the people in the U.S.

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:07.264
and I sorted them from
the poorest on the right

00:02:07.264 --> 00:02:09.656
to the richest on the left,

00:02:09.656 --> 00:02:12.318
and then I divided them into five buckets:

00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:14.616
the poorest 20 percent,
the next 20 percent,

00:02:14.616 --> 00:02:17.472
the next, the next,
and the richest 20 percent.

00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:20.468
And then I asked you to tell me
how much wealth do you think

00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:23.417
is concentrated in each of those buckets.

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:25.878
So to make it simpler,
imagine I ask you to tell me,

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:28.138
how much wealth do you think
is concentrated

00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:30.398
in the bottom two buckets,
