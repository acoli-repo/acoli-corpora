00:06:58.412 --> 00:07:01.918
but there's other things where inequality,
which is an outcome of wealth,

00:07:01.918 --> 00:07:03.961
is even more aversive to them:

00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:07.932
for example, inequality
in health or education.

00:07:07.932 --> 00:07:10.393
We also learned that people
are particularly open

00:07:10.393 --> 00:07:12.947
to changes in equality
when it comes to people

00:07:12.947 --> 00:07:14.991
who have less agency --

00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:17.336
basically, young kids and babies,

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:22.003
because we don't think of them
as responsible for their situation.

00:07:22.003 --> 00:07:24.348
So what are some lessons from this?

00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:25.508
We have two gaps:

00:07:25.508 --> 00:07:28.088
We have a knowledge gap
and we have a desirability gap

00:07:28.088 --> 00:07:30.710
And the knowledge gap
is something that we think about,
