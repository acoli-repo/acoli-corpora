00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.970
In the case of beer,
it would be very simple.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.122
What if we did a blind taste?

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:36.846
Well, if we did the same thing,
you tasted the same beer,

00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:40.817
now in the blind taste,
things would look slightly different.

00:00:40.817 --> 00:00:43.039
Most of the beers will go into one place.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.484
You will basically not
be able to distinguish them,

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:48.573
and the exception, of course,
will be Guinness.

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:50.801
(Laughter)

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:53.587
Similarly, we can think about physiology.

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:56.629
What happens when people expect
something from their physiology?

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.137
For example, we sold people
pain medications.

00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:01.876
Some people, we told them
the medications were expensive.
