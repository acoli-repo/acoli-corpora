00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:06.522
War in my homeland forced me
to flee to Uganda in 2008,

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:08.354
nine years ago.

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:15.276
My family joined
a steady exodus of refugees

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.052
who settled in Uganda's capital, Kampala.

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:21.593
In my country,

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:24.815
I lived already in the city,

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:30.592
and we felt Kampala was much better
than a refugee camp.
