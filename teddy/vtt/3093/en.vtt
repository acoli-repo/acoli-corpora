00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:05.905
Currently, most refugees
live in the cities

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:08.129
rather than in the refugee camps.

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.958
We represent over 60 percent

00:00:13.982 --> 00:00:17.074
of the number of refugees globally.

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:23.233
With the majority of refugees
living in urban areas,

00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:28.982
there is a strong need
for a paradigm shift and new thinking.
