Rather than wasting money
on building walls,

00:00:37.668 --> 00:00:41.688

00:00:41.712 --> 00:00:43.970
to help refugees to help themselves.

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:49.997

00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:55.759
We always have to leave behind
all our possessions.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.073
But not our skills and knowledge.
