00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:31.368
These can place powerful evolutionary
pressures on animals to adapt,

00:01:31.368 --> 00:01:36.158
which in turn makes the aging process
different across species.

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:39.959
Consider the cold depths of the Atlantic
and Arctic Seas,

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.328
where Greenland sharks can live
to over 400 years,

00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:48.488
and the Arctic clam known as the quahog
can live up to 500.

00:01:48.488 --> 00:01:51.429
Perhaps the most impressive of these
ocean-dwelling ancients

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.047
is the Antarctic glass sponge,

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:58.388
which can survive over 10,000 years
in frigid waters.

00:01:58.388 --> 00:02:03.828
In cold environments like these,
heartbeats and metabolic rates slow down.
