00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:31.639
death can come after 200.

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:33.190
Like most living things,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.420
the vast majority of animals gradually
degenerate after reaching sexual maturity

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.327
in the process known as aging.

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:44.176
But what does it really mean to age?

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:48.036
The drivers behind this process are varied
and complicated,

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:52.930
but aging is ultimately 
caused by cell death and dysfunction.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.707
When we're young, 
we constantly regenerate cells

00:00:55.707 --> 00:00:59.067
in order to replace dead and dying ones.

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:01.835
But as we age, this process slows down.
