00:03:59.703 --> 00:04:03.772
Humans currently have 
an average life expectancy of 71 years,

00:04:03.772 --> 00:04:08.862
meaning that we're not even close to being
the longest living inhabitants on Earth.

00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:13.041
But we are very good at increasing
our life expectancy.

00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:17.898
In the early 1900s, humans only lived
an average of 50 years.

00:04:17.898 --> 00:04:21.712
Since then, we've learned to adapt
by managing many of the factors

00:04:21.712 --> 00:04:23.072
that cause deaths,

00:04:23.072 --> 00:04:26.403
like environmental exposure
and nutrition.

00:04:26.403 --> 00:04:29.053
This, and other increases 
in life expectancy

00:04:29.053 --> 00:04:32.033
make us possibly the only species
on Earth
