00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:01.835
But as we age, this process slows down.

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:07.277
In addition, older cells don't perform
their functions as well as young ones.

00:01:07.277 --> 00:01:09.666
That makes our bodies go into a decline,

00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.967
which eventually results 
in disease and death.

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:15.637
But if that's consistently true,

00:01:15.637 --> 00:01:21.288
why the huge variance in aging patterns
and lifespan within the animal kingdom?

00:01:21.288 --> 00:01:23.607
The answer lies in several factors,

00:01:23.607 --> 00:01:24.937
including environment

00:01:24.937 --> 00:01:27.187
and body size.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:31.368
These can place powerful evolutionary
pressures on animals to adapt,
