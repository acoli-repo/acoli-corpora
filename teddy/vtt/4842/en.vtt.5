00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:31.430
which in turn have years on flies
and worms.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.820
Some small animals, like worms and flies,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.650
are also limited by the mechanics 
of their cell division.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.061
They're mostly made up of cells that can't
divide and be replaced when damaged,

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.090
so their bodies expire more quickly.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.180
And size is a powerful evolutionary driver
in animals.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.020
Smaller creatures are more prone
to predators.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.961
A mouse, for instance, can hardly expect
to survive more than a year in the wild.

00:02:56.961 --> 00:03:00.810
So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce
more rapidly,
