For the microscopic lab worm, C. elegans

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:15.185
life equates to just 
a few short weeks on Earth.

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:20.051
Compare that with the tortoise,
which can age to more than 100 years.

00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:24.415
Mice and rats reach the end of their lives
after just four years,

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:28.141
while for the bowhead whale,
Earth's longest-lived mammal,

00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:31.639
death can come after 200.
