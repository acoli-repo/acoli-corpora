00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.771
But there are still cases where animals
with similar defining features,

00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:34.791
like size and habitat,

00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:37.791
age at completely different rates.

00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:39.891
In these cases, genetic differences,

00:03:39.891 --> 00:03:43.261
like how each organism's cells
respond to threats,

00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:47.553
often account for the discrepancies
in longevity.

00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:49.902
So it's the combination 
of all these factors

00:03:49.902 --> 00:03:52.912
playing out to differing degrees
in different animals

00:03:52.912 --> 00:03:57.733
that explains the variability we see
in the animal kingdom.

00:03:57.733 --> 00:03:59.703
So what about us?

00:03:59.703 --> 00:04:03.772
Humans currently have 
an average life expectancy of 71 years,
