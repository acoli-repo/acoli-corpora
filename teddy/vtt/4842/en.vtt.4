00:01:58.388 --> 00:02:03.828
In cold environments like these,
heartbeats and metabolic rates slow down.

00:02:03.828 --> 00:02:08.769
Researchers theorize that this also
causes a slowing of the aging process.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.159
In this way, the environment 
shapes longevity.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.799
When it comes to size, 
it's often, but not always,

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.159
the case that larger species have a longer
lifespan than smaller ones.

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.199
For instance, an elephant or whale
will live much longer

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.498
than a mouse, rat, or vole,

00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:31.430
which in turn have years on flies
and worms.
