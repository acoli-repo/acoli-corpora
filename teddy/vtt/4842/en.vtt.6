00:02:56.961 --> 00:03:00.810
So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce
more rapidly,

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.551
like an evolutionary defense mechanism
against its shorter lifespan.

00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:09.520
Larger animals, by contrast, are better
at fending off predators,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.901
and so they have the luxury of time
to grow to large sizes

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:16.232
and reproduce multiple times
during their lives.

00:03:16.232 --> 00:03:22.672
Exceptions to the size rule include bats,
birds, moles, and turtles,

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:25.537
but in each case, these animals have other
adaptations

00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:29.231
that allow them to escape predators.

00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.771
But there are still cases where animals
with similar defining features,
