I did enjoy Bono's comment

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Being from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
although we hung around Harvard Square.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and I'm going to talk about those issues, if we have the will.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That's been a strong interest of mine,
