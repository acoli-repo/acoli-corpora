00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
the evolution of DNA -- actually it was RNA came first --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
took billions of years,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
but then evolution used that information-processing backbone

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
to bring on the next stage.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
took only 10 million years. It was 200 times faster.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And then evolution used those body plans

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to evolve higher cognitive functions,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and biological evolution kept accelerating.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
the species that combined a cognitive function

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
with an opposable appendage --

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb --
