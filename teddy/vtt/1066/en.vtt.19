00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
of getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Supercomputers -- same thing.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Processor performance on Intel chips,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
the average price of a transistor --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
You could buy 10 million in 2002.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
It's pretty remarkable how smooth

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
an exponential process that is.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I mean, you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment,
