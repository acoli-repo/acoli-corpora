00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
different engineers, different companies, same exponential process.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
in these information terms.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
We're understanding the software programs

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
that make our body run.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
These were evolved in very different times --

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
we'd like to actually change those programs.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
One little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
basically says, "Hold onto every calorie,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
because the next hunting season may not work out so well."

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
We'd like to actually turn that program off.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
They tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously
