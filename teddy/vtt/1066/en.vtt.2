00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and capable and safe from disruption.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Bono spoke very eloquently,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that we have the tools, for the first time,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to address age-old problems of disease and poverty.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Most regions of the world are moving in that direction.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
there were 500 million people living in poverty --

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that number now is under 200 million.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which is a reduction of 95 percent.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I did enjoy Bono's comment
