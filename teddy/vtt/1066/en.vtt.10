00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
on this logarithmic graph,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
television, radio, telephone

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
were adopted in decades.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Recent technologies -- like the PC, the web, cell phones --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
were under a decade.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Now this is an interesting chart,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and this really gets at the fundamental reason why

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
an evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
accelerate.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
They work through interaction -- they create a capability,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So the first step in biological evolution,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
the evolution of DNA -- actually it was RNA came first --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
took billions of years,
