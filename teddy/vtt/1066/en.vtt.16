00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
a property of the evolutionary process of technology.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph --

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
that's another exponential.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
two years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And that's exponential growth through five different paradigms.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Moore's Law was just the last part of that,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
but we had electro-mechanical calculators,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
relay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code,
