00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and track where technology would be at different points in time,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and began to build the mathematical models of that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's kind of taken on a life of its own.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
on key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And if you ask me,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that's very hard to say.
