00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that show the potential to be very lightweight,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
very inexpensive, very efficient,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Nano-engineered fuel cells

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
could provide the energy where it's needed.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That's a key trend, which is decentralization,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
moving from centralized nuclear power plants and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
liquid natural gas tankers

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a lot more efficient

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and capable and safe from disruption.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Bono spoke very eloquently,
