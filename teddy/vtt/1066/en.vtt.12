00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
with an opposable appendage --

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb --

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and fine motor coordination,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and use our mental models to actually change the world

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and bring on technology.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
But anyway, the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and then working through interaction,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
evolution used, essentially,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the technology-creating species to bring on the next stage,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
which were the first steps in technological evolution.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And the first step took tens of thousands of years --

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
stone tools, fire, the wheel -- kept accelerating.
