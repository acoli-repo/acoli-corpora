00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
basically this shows that smooth exponential growth

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
doubled every year,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
enabling the genome project to be completed.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Another major revolution: the communications revolution.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
The price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways;

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
wired, wireless is growing exponentially.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
measured many different ways.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
This is based on the number of hosts.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Miniaturization -- we're shrinking the size of technology

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
at an exponential rate,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
both wired and wireless.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
These are some designs from Eric Drexler's book --
