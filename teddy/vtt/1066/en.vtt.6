00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that's very hard to say.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Will WiMax CDMA G3

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
be the wireless standard three years from now? That's hard to say.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
But if you ask me, what will it cost

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
for one MIPS of computing in 2010,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in 2012,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
it turns out that those are very predictable.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
There are remarkably smooth exponential curves

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And I'm going to show you a small sample of this,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
but there's really a theoretical reason
