00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
but there's really a theoretical reason

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
why technology develops in an exponential fashion.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
They think they're going to continue

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to develop a problem

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
or address a problem using today's tools,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
at today's pace of progress,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
The Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
We had our best Ph.D. students,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
our most advanced equipment around the world,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
we got 1/10,000th of the project done,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
so how're we going to get this done in 15 years?
