00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
There are exciting new forms of gene therapy

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
in the right place on the chromosome.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
There's actually a -- for the first time now,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
something going to human trials, that actually cures pulmonary hypertension --

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
a fatal disease -- using gene therapy.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And this technology is also accelerating.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
It cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
then a penny in 2000.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
It's now under a 10th of a cent.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
The amount of genetic data --

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
basically this shows that smooth exponential growth
