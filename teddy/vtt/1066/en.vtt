00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Well, it's great to be here.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've heard a lot about the promise of technology, and the peril.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've been quite interested in both.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If we could convert 0.03 percent

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
expensive and very inefficient.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There are nano-engineered designs,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which at least have been analyzed theoretically,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that show the potential to be very lightweight,
