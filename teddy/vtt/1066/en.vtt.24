30, 40 percent, but they won't keep up with it."

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But what we're actually seeing is that

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
we actually more than keep up with it.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
We've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
in information technology over the last 50 years.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
As the price performance makes new applications feasible,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
new applications come to the market.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And this is a very widespread phenomena.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Magnetic data storage --

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
that's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
different engineers, different companies, same exponential process.
