00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That's been a strong interest of mine,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and a theme that I've developed for some 30 years.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
That invariably, the world was a different place

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
when I would introduce a technology.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And, I noticed that most inventions fail,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
not because the R&amp;D department can't get it to work --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
if you look at most business plans, they will actually succeed

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
if given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail, because the timing is wrong --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed.
