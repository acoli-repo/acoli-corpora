There's a basic, profound acceleration of this evolutionary process.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Information technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
every year.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
A personal experience, when I was at MIT --

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
computer taking up about the size of this room,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
less powerful than the computer in your cell phone.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
is just one example of many, because it's basically

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
a property of the evolutionary process of technology.
