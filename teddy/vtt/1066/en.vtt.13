00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
stone tools, fire, the wheel -- kept accelerating.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
We always used then the latest generation of technology

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
to create the next generation.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Printing press took a century to be adopted;

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
the first computers were designed pen-on-paper -- now we use computers.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And we've had a continual acceleration of this process.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Now by the way, if you look at this on a linear graph, it looks like everything has just happened,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
but some observer says, "Well, Kurzweil just put points on this graph

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that fall on that straight line."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So, I took 15 different lists from key thinkers,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
like the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar
