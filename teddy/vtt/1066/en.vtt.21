00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
It's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
but the result of this whole worldwide,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
chaotic, unpredictable activity of competition

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And we can predict these trends far into the future.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
As we make them smaller and less expensive,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the electrons have less distance to travel.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
so the cost of a cycle of one transistor
