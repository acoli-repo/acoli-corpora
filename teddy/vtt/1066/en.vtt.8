00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
we got 1/10,000th of the project done,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
so how're we going to get this done in 15 years?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And 10 years into the project,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
the skeptics were still going strong -- says, "You're two-thirds through this project,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and you've managed to only sequence

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
a very tiny percentage of the whole genome."

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But it's the nature of exponential growth

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
that once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Most of the project was done in the last

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
few years of the project.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It took us 15 years to sequence HIV --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
we sequenced SARS in 31 days.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I'm going to show you just a few examples
