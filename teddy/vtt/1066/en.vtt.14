00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
like the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
on the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point;

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
these were just lists in reference works,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and I think that's what they thought the key events were

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
in biological evolution and technological evolution.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And again, it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
because people do have disagreements, what the key points are,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
there's differences of opinion when agriculture started,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
or how long the Cambrian Explosion took.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But you see a very clear trend.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
There's a basic, profound acceleration of this evolutionary process.
