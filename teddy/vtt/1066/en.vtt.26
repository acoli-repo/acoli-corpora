We'd like to actually turn that program off.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
They tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
They didn't get diabetes; they didn't get heart disease;

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
they lived 20 percent longer; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
without the restriction.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
felt that would be

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
interesting drug for the human market,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and that's just one of the 30,000 genes

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that affect our biochemistry.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
We were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
at the age of most people at this conference, like myself,
