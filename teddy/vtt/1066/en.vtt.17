00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
relay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
discreet transistors used in the first space flights

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and then Moore's Law.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Every time one paradigm ran out of steam,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
They were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Whole different paradigm -- transistors came out of the woodwork.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
In fact, when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law
