00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I'm going to show you just a few examples

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
of how pervasive this phenomena is.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is doubling every decade, according to our models.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
These are all logarithmic graphs,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
so as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It took us half a century to adopt the telephone,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
the first virtual-reality technology.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Cell phones were adopted in about eight years.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
If you put different communication technologies

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
on this logarithmic graph,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
television, radio, telephone
