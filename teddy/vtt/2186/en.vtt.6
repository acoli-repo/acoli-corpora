00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:00.622
Money is complicated,

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:02.204
it makes everyone squeamish,

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:04.347
it makes everyone act kind of weird.

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:07.586
Anyone who's ever had to split
the check after dinner with friends

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.815
can tell you this.

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.101
Imagine what it was like before Venmo.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:12.807
(Laughter)

00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:15.149
To help people learn how to raise money,

00:03:15.173 --> 00:03:17.799
you have to help them understand
their deal with money,

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:19.323
because everybody has baggage.

00:03:19.347 --> 00:03:20.990
Grew up poor? Baggage.

00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:22.480
Grew up rich? Baggage.

00:03:23.094 --> 00:03:26.483
Mad or envious that other people
have more money than you?

00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:27.657
Baggage.

00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:30.233
Think people with money
are smarter than you?
