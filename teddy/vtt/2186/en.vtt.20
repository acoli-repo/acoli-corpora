00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.917
and I was hired to teach him
how to talk to human people,

00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:03.393
like a human person.

00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:04.418
(Laughter)

00:10:04.442 --> 00:10:06.639
It was a very difficult job.

00:10:06.663 --> 00:10:09.711
So, he kept getting great donor meetings,

00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:11.482

00:10:21.982 --> 00:10:24.117
that their eyes were glazing over,

00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:27.680
and then after he was done

00:10:27.704 --> 00:10:29.038
they literally would say --

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:31.506

three times in a row --
