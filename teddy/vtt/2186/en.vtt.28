Don't say, "Whatever you can do to help."

00:14:01.402 --> 00:14:05.251
That is hands down the fastest way
to get the smallest possible gift

00:14:05.275 --> 00:14:07.704
someone thinks they can give you
and get away with.

00:14:07.728 --> 00:14:08.886
Not kidding.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.093
And don't take it back.

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:12.455
Once you've made the ask --

00:14:12.479 --> 00:14:15.641
"Would you consider supporting us
at the 10,000-dollar level?

00:14:15.665 --> 00:14:17.483
Or the five? Or the two? Or one?

00:14:17.507 --> 00:14:19.109
You know what? Take the year off.

00:14:19.133 --> 00:14:20.379
You're the best, thanks!"

00:14:20.403 --> 00:14:21.664
Don't do that!

00:14:22.593 --> 00:14:24.260
Ask the question,

00:14:24.284 --> 00:14:27.380
wait till 10, count to 10
before you speak again,

00:14:27.404 --> 00:14:29.071
keep your face like this.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.680
