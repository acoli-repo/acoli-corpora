00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.269
Why should I feel bad about that?

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.959
If you want to be good at raising money,

00:05:02.983 --> 00:05:04.902
you have to be able to reframe the ask,

00:05:04.926 --> 00:05:06.990
both for yourself and for other people,

00:05:07.014 --> 00:05:08.315
as an opportunity.

00:05:09.784 --> 00:05:12.645
Next, you have to get prepared
to build some relationships.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.963
People give to people,
they don't just give to ideas.

00:05:15.987 --> 00:05:18.726
And if they don't believe
in the person running the place,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.368
you're already dead in the water.

00:05:20.392 --> 00:05:24.416
This is true whether
you're in stocks or venture capital,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.376
politics or nonprofits.

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:29.498
Building a relationship
with people takes work.
