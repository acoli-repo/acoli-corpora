00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:01.466
I literally go through
all of these things, right.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.641
And you know why?

00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:04.172
Because guess what I know now.

00:07:04.196 --> 00:07:07.712
I know they're out of 120 grand a year
in schooling for the next 12 years.

00:07:07.736 --> 00:07:08.902
Right?

00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:10.966

They told me they live
on the Upper East Side --

00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:23.180
I can look up their apartment online
and find out what their mortgage is.

00:07:23.204 --> 00:07:25.259
And I know they own
a second home in Mexico.

00:07:25.283 --> 00:07:26.928
Oh, and they own a boat.

00:07:26.952 --> 00:07:29.071

00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:31.659
So what I now understand --
