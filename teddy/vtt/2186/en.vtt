00:00:01.532 --> 00:00:04.206
I'm here today to talk about fundraising,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.809
or as you probably think of it,
"the other F-word."

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:08.055
(Laughter)

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:10.008
Because if you want to change the world,

00:00:10.032 --> 00:00:11.732
you have to know how to pay for it.

00:00:11.756 --> 00:00:13.804
I'm not talking
about being a good person --

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.192
you can do that for free.

00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:17.978
I'm talking about if you want
to create something,

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:19.303
start something,

00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:20.692
galvanize a community,

00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:23.192
improve the lives of others,
run for office.

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:25.971
Every day, great ideas die on the vine,

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.574
because they don't have capital
to get off the ground.

00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:30.058
And all of the work,
