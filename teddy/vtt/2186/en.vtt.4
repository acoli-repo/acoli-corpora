00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:00.702
I teach development directors
in all sorts of teams

00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:02.641
and nonprofit newbies,

00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:05.244
social change agents and candidates.

00:02:05.268 --> 00:02:07.879
I teach anyone that wants to do
something extraordinary

00:02:07.903 --> 00:02:09.696
how to fund their dream.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.069
My dream is that there will be
more people like me

00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:13.466
doing this work well

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.769
and that development will be
an undergraduate course at universities,

00:02:16.793 --> 00:02:21.118
so that fundraising animals like me
will find this job out of the gate,

00:02:21.142 --> 00:02:24.000
instead of discovering it
years later, accidentally.

00:02:24.024 --> 00:02:25.833
I even have the curriculum developed,

00:02:25.857 --> 00:02:29.345
but short of overhauling undergraduate
course requirements,

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.488
I think tonight's probably
a good first step
