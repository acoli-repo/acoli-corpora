You have to care about more
than just what you want or need,

00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:36.043
you have to also value
what someone else wants or needs.

00:05:36.415 --> 00:05:38.597
I know, it's a shocking, terrible idea.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.867
But oftentimes, closing gifts
is understanding the person,

00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:45.037
more than it's important
to know the product.

00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:48.585
And if you think building a relationship
with people takes work,

00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:51.927
building a relationship with someone
you're asking for money from

00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:54.786
takes work, and it takes homework.

00:05:55.347 --> 00:05:57.442
Have you done any research?

00:05:57.466 --> 00:05:59.767
Do you have any idea what they care about?

00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:02.045
Do you know why
they should invest in your work?
