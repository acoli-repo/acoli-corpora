00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:32.576
Be yourself, authenticity matters,
nobody likes a phony.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.838
Just be yourself.

00:13:33.862 --> 00:13:35.361
And please,

00:13:35.385 --> 00:13:37.652
please don't torpedo your own ask.

00:13:38.092 --> 00:13:39.290
What I mean by this

00:13:39.314 --> 00:13:43.585
is don't walk into the meeting and say --
I had an ED that did this all the time,

00:13:43.609 --> 00:13:45.276
I stopped inviting him.

00:13:45.688 --> 00:13:48.235
He'd say, "We're not here today
to ask you for money."

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:50.537
(Laughter)

00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:51.718
Yes, we are!

00:13:51.742 --> 00:13:52.743
(Laughter)

00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:56.751
That's exactly, literally,
why we're here today.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.330
Don't do that.

00:13:58.728 --> 00:14:01.009
Don't say, "Whatever you can do to help."
