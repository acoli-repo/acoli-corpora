They come with their own baggage.

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:05.522
When you think about how to do this work,

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:08.589
it's important to remember
that money makes the world go round.

00:04:08.613 --> 00:04:10.641
You hear that all the time, but it's true.

00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:13.990
Whether you're a nonprofit, for-profit,
or you pay your own bills.

00:04:14.014 --> 00:04:18.422
We often feel like talking about it
is this icky, embarrassing, ugly thing,

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:19.875
but it's just money.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.564
And it's a fact of life.

00:04:21.588 --> 00:04:24.962
So how you feel about it
directly affects how you approach it.

00:04:25.367 --> 00:04:28.262
Like everyone else
when I started out in this work,

00:04:28.286 --> 00:04:32.786
I had to examine and understand
my own feelings about wealth and money.
