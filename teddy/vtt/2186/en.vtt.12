Do you know why
they should invest in your work?

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.752
Can you answer that question
in less than 30 seconds?

00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:07.728
If you can't, the meeting
is going to be pretty rough.

00:06:07.752 --> 00:06:10.195
And the answer can't be
"Because they're super rich

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:11.770
and they live in your zip code."

00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:17.239
When you talk to people
and understand what they care about,

00:06:17.263 --> 00:06:18.850

it's not transactional.

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:24.516
And you have to ask them questions.

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:28.108
When I sit down with a donor,
it goes something like this.

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:30.704
"Hi, thanks so much for seeing me.
