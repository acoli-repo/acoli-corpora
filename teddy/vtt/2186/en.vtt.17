And once you get past
the get-to-know-you part,

00:08:31.702 --> 00:08:33.052
you get into the fun stuff,

00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:35.623
like, "Why are you philanthropic at all?"

00:08:35.647 --> 00:08:36.797
Right?

00:08:37.133 --> 00:08:39.529
"Why do you invest in new ideas?

00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:42.918
Do you want giving back to be a value
you pass on to your children?

00:08:42.942 --> 00:08:44.609
Can we help you do that?"

00:08:45.276 --> 00:08:47.078
It's really awesome, it's meaningful,

00:08:47.102 --> 00:08:48.792
and remember, it's a conversation,

00:08:48.816 --> 00:08:50.387
it's not a cross examination,

00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:51.877
it's not an interview.

00:08:52.744 --> 00:08:56.180
Don't walk in there and tell them
everything you already know about them,

00:08:56.204 --> 00:08:57.728
because you did your research.

00:08:57.752 --> 00:09:00.482
You don't get extra points
for knowing how to use Google.
