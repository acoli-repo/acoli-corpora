00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:01.125
That's where I come in.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.546
I get essential resources

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.911

and visionaries on the front lines,

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:07.085

to be one of these people

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:24.674
who spearheads social change
from the ground up,

00:01:24.698 --> 00:01:27.712
the thing I realized early on
in my nonprofit career

00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:29.420
is that the thing I'm good at,

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:31.285
the thing I'm really good at,
