00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:30.058
And all of the work,

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:32.558
the thought, the vision
that goes into the idea,

00:00:32.582 --> 00:00:34.744
isn't worth much
if you can't pay your bills.

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:38.280
And while most of the greatest
social movements in history

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.254
were powered purely by an idea

00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:42.556
and people's belief in that idea,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.611
real change and impact require resources.

00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:49.727
Real people do this work,

00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:53.013
they need real change,
real impact and resources

00:00:53.037 --> 00:00:54.806
to actually make it happen.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.688
The people that believe in this work

00:00:56.712 --> 00:00:59.895
have to have the support
and the resources to do it.

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:01.125
That's where I come in.
