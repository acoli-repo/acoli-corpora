00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:31.506
this happened, like,
three times in a row --

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.950
"God, that sounds great. Congratulations.

00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:35.871
Keep up the good work."

00:10:35.895 --> 00:10:37.093
And that was the meeting,

00:10:37.117 --> 00:10:39.783
which was obviously not
the outcome we were looking for.

00:10:39.807 --> 00:10:42.593
So, he couldn't understand
what I was trying to say to him,

00:10:42.617 --> 00:10:45.474
that I finally, in an act
of sheer desperation, was like ...

00:10:46.998 --> 00:10:48.398
"You know what I love?

00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:50.283
I love NASA.

00:10:51.046 --> 00:10:52.696
I love NASA.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.445
I think it is unbelievably amazing
we have figured out

00:10:56.469 --> 00:10:58.236
how to get a person to the Moon.

00:10:58.641 --> 00:10:59.974
I think it's awesome.
