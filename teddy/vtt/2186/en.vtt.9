00:04:28.286 --> 00:04:32.786
I had to examine and understand
my own feelings about wealth and money.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.675
And I had to learn how to separate them

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.762
from how I feel about raising money
for important causes.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:41.990
How I feel about asking for money
to help people do good work in the world

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:45.323
is not the same as how I feel about
asking for money for myself.

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:48.054
This is an important distinction.

00:04:48.078 --> 00:04:49.682
When I go and talk to someone,

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.522
I'm not asking them to pay my mortgage.

00:04:52.546 --> 00:04:55.693
I'm giving them an opportunity
to invest in an idea

00:04:55.717 --> 00:04:58.045
that's going to change
the world for the better.

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.269
Why should I feel bad about that?
