00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:31.659
So what I now understand --

00:07:31.683 --> 00:07:32.715
(Laughter)

00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:34.033
It's true.

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:35.537
What I now understand

00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:39.591
is that their 1,000-dollar gift
is probably more of a starter gift.

00:07:39.615 --> 00:07:44.210
And I should be thinking about ways
to help them partner with us

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:46.634
and invest in a more meaningful way.

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:49.568
I know this sounds a tad mercenary.

00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:52.426
I'm not confused about how it sounds.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.482
But here's what I want to tell you,

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:57.654
because this is the part
that all my clients always want to skip,

00:07:57.678 --> 00:08:00.394
because they think it's the fluff
and it's not important.
