00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:31.285
the thing I'm really good at,

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:32.527
is raising money.

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:34.585
And I love it.

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:36.109
I think it is a privilege

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.817
to work alongside bold,
ambitious, optimistic leaders

00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:42.086
and the organizations they serve.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.849
So I teach people
how to do the thing I'm good at,

00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:48.387
because the more people that learn
how to be good at my end of this work,

00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:50.298
the more work will get done.

00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:51.759
And I teach everyone.

00:01:51.783 --> 00:01:54.355
I teach CEOs and presidents,

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:57.521
and boards of directors and EDs.

00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:00.702
I teach development directors
in all sorts of teams
