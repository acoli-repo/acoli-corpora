00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.680
(Laughter)

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:33.389
They are grown-ups.

00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:36.871
They have all the power in this situation.

00:14:36.895 --> 00:14:38.625
They can answer the question.

00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:39.915
Don't take it back.

00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:42.085
Which brings me to my favorite.

00:14:42.109 --> 00:14:43.958
Don't ask, don't get.

00:14:43.982 --> 00:14:45.887
If you don't make an actual ask,

00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:47.814
no one will give you actual money.

00:14:47.838 --> 00:14:49.601
And if no one gives you actual money,

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:51.593
you actually can't do anything with it.

00:14:51.617 --> 00:14:54.217
It's very simple -- don't ask, don't get.

00:14:55.784 --> 00:14:57.657
Listen, I would love to live in a world

00:14:57.681 --> 00:14:59.800
where we didn't have
to ask people for money

00:14:59.824 --> 00:15:03.125
to do important work
that will change people's lives.
