"Hi, thanks so much for seeing me.

00:06:30.728 --> 00:06:31.917
How have you been?

00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:33.958
Did you guys go anywhere fun over holiday?

00:06:33.982 --> 00:06:35.141
Nice, I love Mexico.

00:06:35.165 --> 00:06:36.855
Do you always go to the same place?

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:38.061
Oh, that's awesome!

00:06:38.085 --> 00:06:39.887
Are those your kids? They're so cute.

00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:41.061
How old are they?

00:06:41.085 --> 00:06:42.308
Where are they in school?

00:06:42.332 --> 00:06:45.180
Oh, that's a great school,
are you guys very involved there?

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.141
Your spouse in on the board? How's that?

00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:48.356
How did you guys meet?

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.117
Oh, at Santa Clara, that's awesome.

00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:52.268
Are you super involved
in the alumni network?

00:06:52.292 --> 00:06:53.503
So interesting.

00:06:53.527 --> 00:06:54.979
Where do you guys live, again?

00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:56.577
That's great. Is that your boat?"

00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:57.855
(Laughter)

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:01.466
I literally go through
all of these things, right.
