00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:30.233
Think people with money
are smarter than you?

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.070
Baggage.

00:03:32.094 --> 00:03:33.094
(Laughter)

00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:36.236
Feel guilty that you have
more money than other people?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.116
That's some first-class baggage.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.022
(Laughter)

00:03:40.046 --> 00:03:42.621
It's still baggage, people,
it's still baggage.

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:45.402
So whatever your deal is
with your baggage,

00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:46.645
you have to reconcile it

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.732
if you're going to be able
to ask for money.

00:03:48.756 --> 00:03:51.295
And here's a little tip
about asking people for money.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.899
The only difference
about really wealthy people and us

00:03:53.923 --> 00:03:56.336
is that they have more money than us.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.558
That's it.

00:03:57.582 --> 00:03:59.182
Don't overcomplicate it.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.447
They come with their own baggage.
