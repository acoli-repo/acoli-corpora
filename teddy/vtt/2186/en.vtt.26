Like, they can say "no"
without it being "yes-no."

00:13:00.927 --> 00:13:02.958
And two, it gives you a second ask.

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:04.545
"Well, what would you consider?"

00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:06.618
(Laughter)

00:13:06.642 --> 00:13:07.793
It's good, right?

00:13:07.817 --> 00:13:08.967
(Laughter)

00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:12.823
When you do this, remember,
you're not asking for yourself.

00:13:12.847 --> 00:13:15.610
You're asking on behalf
of all of the people you serve

00:13:15.634 --> 00:13:17.884
or are touched by your genius.

00:13:17.908 --> 00:13:20.154
This isn't a personal favor, right?

00:13:20.178 --> 00:13:23.945
Feel proud of the ask --
it's incredible that you do this work.

00:13:24.836 --> 00:13:26.527
Don't try to be someone you're not,

00:13:26.551 --> 00:13:29.893
you're going to go to these meetings
and think you need to big-shot it.

00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:32.576
Be yourself, authenticity matters,
nobody likes a phony.
