You don't get extra points
for knowing how to use Google.

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:02.522
It's 75 percent them talking,

00:09:02.546 --> 00:09:04.314
25 percent you listening.

00:09:04.338 --> 00:09:07.029
It's better to be a good listener
than a good showman.

00:09:07.053 --> 00:09:09.942
And once you understand
what they care about,

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.180
you can talk to them
about what you care about.

00:09:12.204 --> 00:09:13.713
You can tell them about you.

00:09:13.737 --> 00:09:15.593
Now, when you do this,

00:09:15.617 --> 00:09:18.250
don't get too deep into the weeds,
or you'll lose them.

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:21.386
It's a lot like when I sit down
with guys in finance, right,

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.560
and I say,

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.022
you know, "How's work?"

00:09:25.046 --> 00:09:27.704
I'm looking for, like,
a thumbs up, thumbs down.

00:09:27.728 --> 00:09:30.683
But what I get sometimes
