00:00:01.506 --> 00:00:03.708
I feel so fortunate that my first job

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:06.140
was working at the Museum of Modern Art

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.594
on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray.

00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:11.980
I learned so much from her.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.748
After the curator Robert Storr

00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:15.267
selected all the paintings

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:18.019
from her lifetime body of work,

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.661
I loved looking at the paintings from the 1970s.

00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:24.217
There were some motifs and elements

00:00:24.217 --> 00:00:27.723
that would come up again later in her life.

00:00:27.723 --> 00:00:29.362
I remember asking her

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.920
what she thought of those early works.
