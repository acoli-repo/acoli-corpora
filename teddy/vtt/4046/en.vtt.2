00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.401
So I was compelled
to do something more to help.

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:05.922
I fund-raised in Australia and returned
to Cambodia the following year

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:08.423
to volunteer at the orphanage
for a few months.

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:12.524
I taught English and bought
water filters and food

00:01:12.548 --> 00:01:16.487
and took all of the kids to the dentist
for the first time in their lives.

00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:19.400
But over the course of the next year,

00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:23.008
I came to discover that this orphanage
that I had been supporting

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:24.465
was terribly corrupt.

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:29.871
The director had been embezzling
every cent donated to the orphanage,

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:34.245
and in my absence, the children
were suffering such gross neglect
