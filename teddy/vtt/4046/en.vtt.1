00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.122
and wanted to do something to give back.

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:35.593
So I visited some orphanages
and donated some clothes and books

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:36.911
and some money

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:38.714
to help the kids that I met.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:43.867
But one of the orphanages I visited
was desperately poor.

00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:47.627
I had never encountered poverty
like that before in my life.

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:50.575
They didn't have funds for enough food,

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:51.909
clean water

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.259
or medical treatment,

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.847
and the sad little faces on those kids

00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:58.073
were heartbreaking.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.401
So I was compelled
to do something more to help.
