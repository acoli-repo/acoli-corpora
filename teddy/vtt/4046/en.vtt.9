Over 60 years of international
research has shown us

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:35.275
that children who grow up in institutions,

00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:38.243
even the very best institutions,

00:04:38.267 --> 00:04:41.771
are at serious risk
of developing mental illnesses,

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:43.578
attachment disorders,

00:04:43.602 --> 00:04:45.833
growth and speech delays,

00:04:45.857 --> 00:04:48.821
and many will struggle
with an inability to reintegrate

00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:51.057
back into society later in life

00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:53.748
and form healthy relationships as adults.

00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:58.014
These kids grow up
without any model of family

00:04:58.038 --> 00:05:00.485
or of what good parenting looks like,
