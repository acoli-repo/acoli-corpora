and help Cambodian
families escape poverty.

00:10:02.775 --> 00:10:06.933
Our primary focus is on preventing
some of the most vulnerable families

00:10:06.957 --> 00:10:08.118
in our community

00:10:08.142 --> 00:10:10.529
from being separated in the first place.

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:13.527
But in cases where it's not possible

00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:16.805
for a child to live
with its biological family,

00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:18.971
we support them in foster care.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.837
Family-based care is always better

00:10:23.861 --> 00:10:26.955
than placing a child in an institution.

00:10:28.473 --> 00:10:31.250
Do you remember that first photo
that I showed you before?
