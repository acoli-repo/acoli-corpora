WEBVTT

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.826
is by giving these eight million
children a voice

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.742
and become an advocate
for family-based care.

00:12:04.538 --> 00:12:07.640
If we work together to raise awareness,

00:12:07.664 --> 00:12:10.500
we can make sure the world knows

00:12:10.524 --> 00:12:15.632
that we need to put an end
to the unnecessary institutionalization

00:12:15.656 --> 00:12:17.316
of vulnerable children.

00:12:18.153 --> 00:12:19.721
How do we achieve that?

00:12:20.194 --> 00:12:24.021
By redirecting our support
and our donations

00:12:24.045 --> 00:12:28.371
away from orphanages
and residential care institutions

00:12:28.395 --> 00:12:34.473
towards organizations that are committed
to keeping children in families.
