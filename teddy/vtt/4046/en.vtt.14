00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:00.950
the most shocking thing of all to realize

00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:04.157
is what's contributing to this boom

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:09.206
in the unnecessary institutionalization
of so many children:

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:12.608
it's us --

00:07:13.756 --> 00:07:16.900
the tourists, the volunteers

00:07:17.514 --> 00:07:18.869
and the donors.

00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:25.434
It's the well-meaning support
from people like me back in 2006,

00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:29.327
who visit these children
and volunteer and donate,

00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:34.450
who are unwittingly fueling an industry
that exploits children
