00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:04.913
These are some photos of me
volunteering in a Cambodian orphanage

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:06.129
in 2006.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.743
When these photos were taken,

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:11.069
I thought I was doing a really good thing

00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:13.601
and that I was really helping those kids.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.425
I had a lot to learn.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.015
It all started for me
when I was 19 years old

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.401
and went backpacking
through Southeast Asia.

00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:24.718
When I reached Cambodia,

00:00:24.742 --> 00:00:29.016
I felt uncomfortable being on holiday
surrounded by so much poverty

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.122
and wanted to do something to give back.
