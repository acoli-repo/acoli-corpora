00:02:57.277 --> 00:03:00.511
Since 2005, the number
of orphanages in Cambodia

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:02.958
has risen by 75 percent,

00:03:03.776 --> 00:03:06.871
and the number of children
living in Cambodian orphanages

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.041
has nearly doubled,

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:10.577
despite the fact

00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.724
that the vast majority of children
living in these orphanages

00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:16.730
are not orphans in the traditional sense.

00:03:17.277 --> 00:03:19.536
They're children from poor families.

00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:23.821
So if the vast majority of children
living in orphanages

00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:25.268
are not orphans,

00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:27.154
then the term "orphanage"

00:03:27.178 --> 00:03:31.837
is really just a euphemistic name
for a residential care institution.
