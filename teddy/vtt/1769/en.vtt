00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I am passionate about the American landscape

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and how the physical form of the land,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
from the great Central Valley of California

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to the bedrock of Manhattan,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
has really shaped our history and our character.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But one thing is clear.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In the last 100 years alone,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
our country -- and this is a sprawl map of America --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
our country has systematically

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
flattened and homogenized the landscape

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to the point where we've forgotten

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
our relationship with the plants and animals

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that live alongside us
