00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:30.680
or it could be a very loud ovation.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.642
So to us, I think we're really looking

00:05:32.642 --> 00:05:34.939
at an audience as its own object

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:36.655
or its own organism

00:05:36.655 --> 00:05:40.405
that's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it,

00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:41.785
an instrument.

00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:43.541
So the viewer can play it

00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:45.977
by eliciting quite complex and varied,

00:05:45.977 --> 00:05:48.673
nuanced musical or sound patterns,

00:05:48.673 --> 00:05:50.949
but cannot really provoke the audience

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.337
into any particular kind of response.

00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:56.081
So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness

00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:58.322
and uneasiness involved.

00:05:58.322 --> 00:06:02.431
It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it.
