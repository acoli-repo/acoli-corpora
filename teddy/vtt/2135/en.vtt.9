00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:31.701
but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help.

00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:33.897
The next work is an object,

00:04:33.897 --> 00:04:36.321
that's also a kind of sound instrument.

00:04:36.321 --> 00:04:38.108
In the shape of an amphitheater

00:04:38.108 --> 00:04:40.048
that's scaled to the size of an audience

00:04:40.048 --> 00:04:42.114
as perceived from somebody from the stage.

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:43.728
So from where I'm standing,

00:04:43.728 --> 00:04:45.390
each of you appears to be this big,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.443
and the audience sort of takes the entire

00:04:47.443 --> 00:04:49.456
field of my vision.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:53.418
Seated in this audience are 996 small figures.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.604
They're mechanically enabled to clap

00:04:55.604 --> 00:04:57.374
of their own free will.

00:04:57.374 --> 00:04:59.407
This means that each of them can decide

00:04:59.407 --> 00:05:00.987
if and when they want to clap,
