00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:31.698
of images seen through a handheld camera.

00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:34.386
So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:35.806
One is through a still camera

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:37.884
and the other is through a handheld camera.

00:02:37.884 --> 00:02:40.485
And you immediately see how the unsteady nature

00:02:40.485 --> 00:02:43.529
of the video suggests the presence

00:02:43.544 --> 00:02:46.031

So we've just removed the camera

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.141
and transferred that movement onto the panel.

00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:51.658
So here's a video.

00:02:51.674 --> 00:02:54.113
You have to imagine the other hand.
It's not there yet.

00:02:54.113 --> 00:02:56.860
But to us, we're sort of trying to evoke

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.399
a self-effacing gesture, as if there's a little person
