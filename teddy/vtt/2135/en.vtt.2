00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:01.287
So I'm just going to take you to a video.

00:01:01.287 --> 00:01:02.660
To give you a sense of scale,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.875
the largest panel is about two meters high.

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:07.693
That's about this much. 
And the smallest one is an A4.

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:09.905
So a viewer enters the space,

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:12.001
and they snap to attention.

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.989
And after a while, if the viewer continues

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:15.717
to remain in the space,

00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:17.705
the panels will sort of become immune

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:19.418
to the presence of the viewer

00:01:19.418 --> 00:01:22.453
and become lax and autonomous again,

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:25.828
until they sort of sense a presence
in the room or a movement,

00:01:25.828 --> 00:01:28.527
when they will again snap to attention.

00:01:28.527 --> 00:01:30.006
(Laughter)
