00:01:28.527 --> 00:01:30.006
(Laughter)

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.405
So here it appears as if it's the viewer

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:35.650
that's sort of instigating the sense
of order among the panels,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.675
but it could also be the other way around,

00:01:37.675 --> 00:01:40.019
that the panels are so stuck within

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:42.013
their preconditioned behaviors

00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:47.541
that they sort of thrust the
viewer with the role of a tyrant.

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.039
So this brings me to a quieter, small work

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.608
called Handheld.

00:01:51.608 --> 00:01:53.342
The viewer sees a piece of paper

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:55.812
that's mounted on the far end of the wall,

00:01:55.812 --> 00:01:58.440
but when you go closer, you see that it's a blank

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.712
A4, or a letter-sized piece of paper,
