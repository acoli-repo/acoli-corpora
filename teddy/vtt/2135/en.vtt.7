00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:31.029
So when a viewer passes by,

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.844
it sort of tilts from side to side,

00:03:33.844 --> 00:03:36.017
and moves its arms more and more frantically

00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:39.384
as the person gets closer.

00:03:39.384 --> 00:03:41.908
So here is the first test scenario.

00:03:41.908 --> 00:03:43.797
You see the two movements integrated,

00:03:43.797 --> 00:03:45.786
and the object seems to be employing

00:03:45.786 --> 00:03:50.858
its entire being in this expression of desperation.

00:03:50.858 --> 00:03:53.522
But the idea is that once it's
got the person's attention,

00:03:53.522 --> 00:03:57.594
it's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get.

00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:00.708
(Laughter)
