00:06:58.112 --> 00:07:00.557
Each of these figures can also run backward

00:07:00.557 --> 00:07:02.122
and forward in the track

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:05.679
and hide behind two adjacent tracks.

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:07.789
So in contrast to this very tight grid,

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:10.210
we wanted to give these figures a very comical

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.299
and slapstick-like quality,

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:14.138
as if a puppeteer has taken them

00:07:14.138 --> 00:07:16.879
and physically animated them down the path.

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.159
So we like the idea of these figures

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:20.695
sort of skipping along

00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:22.783
like they're oblivious and carefree

00:07:22.783 --> 00:07:25.331
and happy-go-lucky and content,

00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:28.531
until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:32.799
and they will hide behind the fastest wall.
