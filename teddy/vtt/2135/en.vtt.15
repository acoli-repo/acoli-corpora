00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:32.799
and they will hide behind the fastest wall.

00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:36.633
So to us, this work also presents
its own contradiction.

00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:38.457
These figures are sort of entrapped

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:40.604
within this very strong grid,

00:07:40.604 --> 00:07:43.360
which is like a prison, but also a fortress,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.294
because it allows them to be oblivious

00:07:45.294 --> 00:07:47.999
and naive and carefree and quite oblivious

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:50.568
of the external world.

00:07:50.568 --> 00:07:53.373
So all these real life qualities that I talk about

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:55.655
are sort of translated to a very specific

00:07:55.655 --> 00:07:57.416
technical configuration,

00:07:57.416 --> 00:07:59.459
and we were very lucky to collaborate

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:02.627
with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype.
