00:04:59.407 --> 00:05:00.987
if and when they want to clap,

00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:02.619
how hard, for how long,

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:06.306
how they want to be influenced by
those around them or influence others,

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:10.286
and if they want to contribute to innovation.

00:05:10.286 --> 00:05:12.803
So when the viewer steps in front of the audience,

00:05:12.803 --> 00:05:14.487
there will be a response.

00:05:14.487 --> 00:05:17.085
It could be a few claps or a strong applause,

00:05:17.085 --> 00:05:19.269
and then nothing happens until the viewer

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:22.345
leaves the stage, and again
the audience will respond.

00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:24.670
It could be anything from a few feeble claps

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.352
from members in the audience,

00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:30.680
or it could be a very loud ovation.
