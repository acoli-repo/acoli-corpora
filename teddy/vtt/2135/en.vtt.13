00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:32.070
It comes out of the idea of a window.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.381
This is an actual window in our studio,

00:06:34.381 --> 00:06:36.299
and as you can see, it's made up of three

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:38.581
different thicknesses of wooden sections.

00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:40.854
So we used the same window vocabulary

00:06:40.854 --> 00:06:43.681
to construct our own frame or grid

00:06:43.681 --> 00:06:45.623
that's suspended in the room and that can

00:06:45.623 --> 00:06:47.436
be viewed from two sides.

00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:50.410
This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.975
They're also made up of three different sizes,

00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:55.401
as if to suggest a kind of perspective

00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:58.112
or landscape on the single plain.

00:06:58.112 --> 00:07:00.557
Each of these figures can also run backward
