A4, or a letter-sized piece of paper,

00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:02.029
that's held on either side

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:03.970
by two small hands

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.237
that appear to be carved with a great deal

00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:09.710
of attention and care from a small block of wood.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.706
The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture

00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:15.168
is sort of moving very slightly,

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.029
as if these two hands are trying

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:18.531
to hold the paper very still

00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.710
for a long period of time,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.645
and somehow are not managing to.

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:25.618
So this instability in the movement

00:02:25.618 --> 00:02:29.136
very closely resembles the unsteady nature

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:31.698
of images seen through a handheld camera.
