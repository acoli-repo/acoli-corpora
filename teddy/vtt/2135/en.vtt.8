00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:00.708
(Laughter)

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:03.740
So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.857
It appears to be mass-manufactured

00:04:05.857 --> 00:04:07.559
like it came out of a factory

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:09.836
like vacuum cleaners and washing machines.

00:04:09.836 --> 00:04:11.339
Because we are always working

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:12.747
from a very personal space,

00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:15.174
we like how this consumer aesthetic

00:04:15.174 --> 00:04:17.246
sort of depersonalizes the object

00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:18.977
and gives us a bit of distance

00:04:18.977 --> 00:04:20.897
in its appearance, at least.

00:04:20.897 --> 00:04:23.237
And so to us this is a kind of sinister being

00:04:23.237 --> 00:04:25.356
which is trying to distract you from the things

00:04:25.356 --> 00:04:26.951
that actually need your attention,

00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:31.701
but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help.
