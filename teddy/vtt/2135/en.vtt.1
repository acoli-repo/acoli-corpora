00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.684
the presence of the viewer,

00:00:30.684 --> 00:00:33.728
they appear to panic and sort of get into

00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:35.242
a strict symmetry.

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:36.985
(Laughter)

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:39.133
So this is the sketch of the two states.

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.791
One is total chaos. The other is absolute order.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.142
And we were interested in seeing how little change

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:47.798
it takes to move from one state to the other state.

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:51.528
This also reminded us of two
very different pictorial traditions.

00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:54.081
One is the altar tablets of the 15th century,

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.315
and the other is about 100 years ago,

00:00:56.315 --> 00:00:59.271
Malevich's abstract compositions.

00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:01.287
So I'm just going to take you to a video.
