00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:04.551
So here if you see we're quite excited about

00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:08.373
the image of the head splitting
to form the two hands.

00:06:08.373 --> 00:06:10.284
So here's a small visual animation,

00:06:10.284 --> 00:06:14.616
as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:16.643
against each other to kind of make sense

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:19.178
of the duality and the tension.

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:21.746

00:06:21.746 --> 00:06:26.548
So we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them.

00:06:26.548 --> 00:06:29.551
Okay, this is the last work.
It's called the Framerunners.

00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:32.070
It comes out of the idea of a window.
