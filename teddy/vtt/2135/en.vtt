Hi. So today, I'd like to share
some works in progress.

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:06.170
Since we are still realizing these works,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.921
we are largely working within the realm

00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:10.026
of intuition and mystery, still.

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:11.789
So I'm going to try and describe

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.916
some of the experiences that we're looking for

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:15.639
through each of the works.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.945
So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes.

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.940
A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.332
and catches a glimpse of these panels

00:00:24.332 --> 00:00:26.507
in a messy composition on the wall.

00:00:26.507 --> 00:00:29.059
Within seconds, as if the panels have noticed

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.684
the presence of the viewer,
