00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Who are we?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That is the big question.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
super-intelligent ape.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This could be us.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We belong to the family called the Hominidae.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and it's important to remember that,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in terms of our place in the world today

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and our future on planet Earth.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We are one species
