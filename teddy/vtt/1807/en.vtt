Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:02.247 --> 00:00:04.374
I present to you the human genome.

00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:08.277
(Applause)

00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:12.234
Chromosome one -- top left,
bottom right -- are the sex chromosomes.

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:14.986
Women have two copies
of that big X chromosome;

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.175
men have the X and, of course,
that small copy of the Y.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.890
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny
little thing that makes you different.

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:24.906
So if you zoom in on this genome,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.548
then what you see, of course,
is this double-helix structure --

00:00:28.572 --> 00:00:31.706
the code of life spelled out
with these four biochemical letters,
