00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:31.052
and it was the longest
nine months of my life.

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:32.750
But I went as a cook,

00:03:32.774 --> 00:03:34.483
I managed to survive until the end,

00:03:34.507 --> 00:03:36.238

00:03:51.412 --> 00:03:56.983
"No man is ever going to allow me
to be a navigator on their boat, ever."

00:03:57.393 --> 00:03:59.292
And that is still the case today.

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:01.073
In 35 years of the Whitbread,
