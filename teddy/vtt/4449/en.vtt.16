00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:02.495
It's a jolly, go-for-it,
heave-ho type of --

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:04.248
have-fun type of ocean.

00:08:04.272 --> 00:08:07.979
The Southern Ocean
is a deadly serious ocean.

00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:12.199
And you know the moment
when you cross into the Southern Ocean --

00:08:12.223 --> 00:08:13.887
the latitude and longitude --

00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:15.491
you know when you're there,

00:08:15.515 --> 00:08:17.086
the waves have been building,

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.641
they start getting
big whitecaps on the top,

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.118
it becomes really gray,

00:08:21.142 --> 00:08:23.193
you start to get sensory deprivation.

00:08:23.556 --> 00:08:28.437
It is very focused
on who you are and what you are

00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:31.738
with this massive wilderness around you.
