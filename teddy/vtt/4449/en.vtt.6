00:02:59.594 --> 00:03:01.508
Stop being a bystander in your own life,

00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:03.425
stop looking at what you're doing

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.171
and start taking part."

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.379
This day, for me, was the day
that my whole life started.

00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:11.420
I learned to navigate in two days --

00:03:11.444 --> 00:03:13.523
and this is someone who hates numbers

00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:15.165
and sees them as hieroglyphics.

00:03:15.872 --> 00:03:20.116
It opened up avenues and opportunities
to me that I could never have imagined.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.865
I actually managed to get a ride
on a Whitbread Round the World Race boat.

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.974
It was with 17 South African men and me.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.883
I was 21 years old,

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:31.052
and it was the longest
nine months of my life.
