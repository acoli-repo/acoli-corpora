00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:33.370
and I discovered my second passion,

00:04:33.394 --> 00:04:35.625
which was equality.

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:37.967
I couldn't let this one lie.

00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:41.538
And it became not just about me
wanting to navigate on a boat

00:04:41.562 --> 00:04:43.764
and having to put my own crew together

00:04:43.788 --> 00:04:45.163
and my own team,

00:04:45.187 --> 00:04:47.304
raise my own money, find my own boat,

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.239
so that I could be navigator.

00:04:49.263 --> 00:04:50.828
This was about women everywhere.

00:04:50.852 --> 00:04:53.018
And this was when I realized

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:56.894
that this was probably what I was going
to spend the rest of my life doing.

00:04:56.918 --> 00:04:58.763
It took ages for us to find the money

00:04:58.787 --> 00:05:01.419
to do the 1989 Whitbread
Round the World Race.
