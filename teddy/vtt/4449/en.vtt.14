00:06:57.948 --> 00:07:00.568
In the end, King Hussein of Jordan
sponsored Maiden,

00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:03.031
and that was an amazing thing --

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:05.586
way ahead of his time, all about equality.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.680
We sailed around the world
with a message of peace and equality.

00:07:08.704 --> 00:07:12.212
We were the only boat in the race
with a message of any kind.

00:07:12.236 --> 00:07:14.594
We won two legs of the Whitbread --

00:07:14.618 --> 00:07:16.261
two of the most difficult legs --

00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:17.920
and we came second overall.

00:07:17.944 --> 00:07:22.419
And that is still the best result
for a British boat since 1977.

00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:24.152
It annoyed a lot of people.

00:07:24.176 --> 00:07:26.028
And I think what it did at the time --

00:07:26.052 --> 00:07:27.296
we didn't realize.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.509
You know, we crossed the finishing line,
this incredible finish --
