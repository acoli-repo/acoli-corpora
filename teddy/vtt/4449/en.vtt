00:00:01.254 --> 00:00:04.979
Being able to navigate
is an extraordinary gift,

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:07.096
and there is nothing like it in the world.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.802
I get no more sense of satisfaction
greater than leaving a port

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:18.223
and knowing that I can get
my team and my boat

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:20.712
safely from that port to another port,

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:24.336
maybe three, four, five,
six thousand miles away.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.297
Being at sea, for me, is ...

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:28.859
it's total freedom,

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:34.007
and it is the ultimate
opportunity to be you,
