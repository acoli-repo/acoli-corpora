00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.374
So the question I get asked
the most when I go and do talks

00:01:30.398 --> 00:01:34.262
is "How do you become
an ocean-racing sailor?"

00:01:34.286 --> 00:01:36.016
And that's a really good question.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.453
And I've always wanted
to say "I had a vision,

00:01:39.477 --> 00:01:40.682
which became a dream,

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:43.165
which became an obsession,"

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.205
but, of course, life's not like that,

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.805
and one thing I'm really anxious
for people to know about me

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.560
is that my life hasn't gone from A to B --

00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:54.743
because how many people can say
their lives just go from A to B;

00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:58.044
they think, "I'm going to do this,"
and they go and do it?

00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:00.509
So I tell the truth.
