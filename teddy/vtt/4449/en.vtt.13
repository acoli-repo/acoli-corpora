men, anyone who'd ever been told,

00:06:31.693 --> 00:06:34.492
"You can't do something
because you're not good enough" --

00:06:34.516 --> 00:06:37.519
the right gender or right race

00:06:37.543 --> 00:06:40.366
Maiden became a passion.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.553

00:06:43.577 --> 00:06:45.659
hundreds of companies wouldn't sponsor us.

00:06:45.683 --> 00:06:48.016

00:06:53.096 --> 00:06:54.296
"You're going to die."

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.600
I'd think, "Well, OK,
that's my business, it's not yours."

00:06:57.948 --> 00:07:00.568
In the end, King Hussein of Jordan
sponsored Maiden,
