00:04:58.787 --> 00:05:01.419
to do the 1989 Whitbread
Round the World Race.

00:05:01.443 --> 00:05:03.452
And as we looked at all the big,

00:05:03.476 --> 00:05:07.226
multimillion pound,
all-male projects around us,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.085
with their brand-new shiny boats
designed for the race,

00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:14.201
we realized this was not going to be us.

00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:16.154
We had to make this up as we went along.

00:05:16.178 --> 00:05:19.135
No one had enough faith in us
to give us this kind of money.

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:20.511
So I mortgaged my house,

00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:24.137
and we found an old wreck with a pedigree,

00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:25.315
an old Whitbread boat --

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:27.455
it had already been
around the world twice --

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:28.751
in South Africa.

00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:31.371
We somehow persuaded
some guy to put it on a ship
