00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:00.303
(Gasps)

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:03.834
adventure and no turning back,

00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:08.175
and just you and the boat
and the elements.

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:11.936
I wish everyone could experience

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.016
The further you get away from land,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.794
the more you kind of fit into yourself.

00:01:16.818 --> 00:01:18.048

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.144
how do we stay alive,

00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:23.770
how do we look after each other

00:01:23.794 --> 00:01:26.214
and what do we do
to get to the other side.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.374
So the question I get asked
the most when I go and do talks
