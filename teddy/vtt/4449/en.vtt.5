She said, "Every single one of us
is good at something,

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.403
you just have to go and find
what that is."

00:02:33.427 --> 00:02:37.155
And at the age of 16, she let me
go backpacking off to Greece.

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:40.716
I ended up working on boats,
which was OK --

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.058
17 years old, didn't really know
what I wanted to do,

00:02:44.082 --> 00:02:45.902
kind of going with the flow.

00:02:45.926 --> 00:02:48.637
And then on my second transatlantic,

00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:51.065
my skipper said to me, "Can you navigate?"

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.022
And I said, "Of course I can't navigate,

00:02:53.046 --> 00:02:54.809
I was expelled before long division."

00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:57.750
And he said, "Don't you think
you should be able to navigate?

00:02:57.774 --> 00:02:59.570
What happens if I fall over the side?

00:02:59.594 --> 00:03:01.508
