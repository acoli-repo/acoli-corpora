00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.509
You know, we crossed the finishing line,
this incredible finish --

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:33.378
600 boats sailing up the Solent with us;

00:07:33.402 --> 00:07:40.354
50,000 people in Ocean Village
chanting "Maiden, Maiden" as we sailed in.

00:07:40.378 --> 00:07:43.179
And so we knew we'd done something
that we wanted to do

00:07:43.203 --> 00:07:45.966
and we hoped we'd achieved something good,

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:51.290
but we had no idea at the time
how many women's lives we changed.

00:07:52.018 --> 00:07:53.923
The Southern Ocean is my favorite ocean.

00:07:53.947 --> 00:07:55.574
Each ocean has a character.

00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:58.454
So the North Atlantic is a yomping ocean.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:02.495
It's a jolly, go-for-it,
heave-ho type of --
