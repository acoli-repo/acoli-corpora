00:09:29.972 --> 00:09:32.059
Again, we rescued her --

00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:33.256
we did a Crowdfunder --

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.302
we rescued her from the Seychelles.

00:09:35.326 --> 00:09:37.634
Princess Haya, King Hussein's daughter,

00:09:37.658 --> 00:09:41.263
funded the shipping back to the UK
and then the restoration.

00:09:41.287 --> 00:09:43.102
All the original crew were involved.

00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:45.074
We put the original team back together.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.438
And then we decided,
what are we going to do with Maiden?

00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:51.216
And this, for me,
really was the moment of my life

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.336
where I looked back
on every single thing that I'd done --

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.502
every project, every feeling,

00:09:56.526 --> 00:09:59.550
every passion,
every battle, every fight --

00:09:59.574 --> 00:10:02.686
and I decided that I wanted Maiden
to continue that fight
