building infrastructure
to get water to our cities.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.056
In terms of economic development,
it was a great investment.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.056
But in the last decade,
we've seen the combined effects

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.856
of climate change, population growth
and competition for water resources

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.536
threaten these vital lifelines
and water resources.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.696
This figure shows you the change
in the lake level of Lake Mead

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.976
that happened in the last 15 years.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.336
You can see starting around the year 2000,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.256
the lake level started to drop.
