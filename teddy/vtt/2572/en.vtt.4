00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.536
We like to complain
about the navy showers we have to take.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.936
We like our neighbors to see
our dirty cars and our brown lawns.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.496
But we've never really faced
the prospect of turning on the tap

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.040
and having nothing come out.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.736
And that's because when things
have gotten bad in the past,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.816
it's always been possible
to expand a reservoir

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.040
or dig a few more groundwater wells.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.936
Well, in a time when all
of the water resources are spoken for,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.336
it's not going to be possible
to rely on this tried and true way

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.696
of providing ourselves with water.
