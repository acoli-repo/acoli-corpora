00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.976
as being a nonstarter
is hopelessly out of date.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.776
We've made tremendous progress
in seawater desalination

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.040
in the past two decades.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.576
This picture shows you

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.576
the largest seawater desalination plant
in the Western hemisphere

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.416
that's currently being built
north of San Diego.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.696
Compared to the seawater
desalination plant

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.016
that was built in
Santa Barbara 25 years ago,

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.696
this treatment plant
will use about half the energy

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.240
to produce a gallon of water.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.576
But just because seawater desalination
has become less energy-intensive,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.839
doesn't mean we should start building
desalination plants everywhere.
