00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.056
will flow with the rainwater
that falls in our cities.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.496
One of the great tragedies
of urban development

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.496
is that as our cities grew,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.176
we started covering all the surfaces
with concrete and asphalt.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.616
And when we did that,
we had to build storm sewers

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.736
to get the water
that fell on the cities out

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.696
before it could cause flooding,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.560
and that's a waste
of a vital water resource.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.976
Let me give you an example.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.216
This figure here shows you
the volume of water

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.856
that could be collected
in the city of San Jose

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.656
if they could harvest the stormwater
that fell within the city limits.
