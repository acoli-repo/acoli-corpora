00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.776
into two parts that are called
hydroxyl radicals,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.895
and these hydroxyl radicals
are very potent forms of oxygen

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.320
that break down most organic chemicals.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.176
After the water's been
through this two-stage process,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.816
it's safe to drink.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.096
I know,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.696
I've been studying recycled water

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.136
using every measurement technique
known to modern science

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.600
for the past 15 years.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.736
We've detected some chemicals

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.336
that can make it through
the first step in the process,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.360
but by the time we get to the second step,

00:08:58.384 --> 00:09:00.296
the advanced oxidation process,
