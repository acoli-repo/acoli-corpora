the advanced oxidation process,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.736
we rarely see any chemicals present.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.936
And that's in stark contrast
to the taken-for-granted water supplies

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.840
that we regularly drink all the time.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.416
There's another way we can recycle water.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.536
This is an engineered treatment wetland
that we recently built

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.336
on the Santa Ana River
in Southern California.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.456
The treatment wetland receives water
from a part of the Santa Ana River

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.096
that in the summertime consists
almost entirely of wastewater effluent

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.136
from cities like Riverside
and San Bernardino.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.216
The water comes
into our treatment wetland,
