WEBVTT

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.296
is slowly passed
through a man-made wetland,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.936
and then it goes
into that ball field there

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.896
and percolates into the ground,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.280
recharging the drinking water
aquifer of the city.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.976
And in the process
of passing through the wetland

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.776
and percolating through the ground,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.296
the water encounters microbes
that live on the surfaces of the plants

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.896
and the surfaces of the soil,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.400
and that purifies the water.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.536
And if the water's
still not clean enough to drink

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.256
after it's been through
this natural treatment process,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.616
the city can treat it again

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.216
when they pump if back out
of the groundwater aquifers

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.320
before they deliver it to people to drink.
