00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.176
In the year 2007, the third largest
city in Australia, Brisbane,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.136
came within 6 months
of running out of water.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.416
A similar drama is playing out today
in São Paulo, Brazil,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.256
where the main reservoir for the city

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.176
has gone from being
completely full in 2010,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.376
to being nearly empty today

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.880
as the city approaches
the 2016 Summer Olympics.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.536
For those of us who are fortunate enough

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.616
to live in one
of the world's great cities,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.776
we've never truly experienced
the effects of a catastrophic drought.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.536
We like to complain
about the navy showers we have to take.
