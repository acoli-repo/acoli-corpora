00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.976
that a modern city could exist
without a supply of imported water,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.640
I probably would have dismissed you
as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.016
But my own experiences

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.416
working with some of the world's most
water-starved cities in the last decades

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.376
have shown me that we have
the technologies and the management skills

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.296
to actually transition away
from imported water,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.640
and that's what I want
to tell you about tonight.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.616
The first source of local water
supply that we need to develop

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.776
to solve our urban water problem

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.056
will flow with the rainwater
that falls in our cities.
