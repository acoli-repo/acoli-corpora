00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.216
In the first step in this process
we pressurize the water

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.976
and pass it through
a reverse osmosis membrane:

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.416
a thin, permeable plastic membrane

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.976
that allows water molecules
to pass through

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.776
but traps and retains the salts,
the viruses and the organic chemicals

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.720
that might be present in the wastewater.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.456
In the second step in the process,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.976
we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.696
and shine ultraviolet light on the water.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.616
The ultraviolet light
cleaves the hydrogen peroxide

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.776
into two parts that are called
hydroxyl radicals,
