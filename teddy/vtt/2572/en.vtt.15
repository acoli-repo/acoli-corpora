00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.376
But what we're learning
from our experience

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.496
is that this approach is much more
expensive that we expected it to be.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.616
Because once we build
the first few water recycling systems

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.416
close to the sewage treatment plant,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.679
we have to build longer
and longer pipe networks

00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:44.863
to get that water to where it needs to go.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.400
And that becomes prohibitive
in terms of cost.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.216
What we're finding is

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.256
that a much more cost-effective
and practical way of recycling wastewater

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.856
is to turn treated wastewater
into drinking water

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.400
through a two-step process.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.216
In the first step in this process
we pressurize the water
