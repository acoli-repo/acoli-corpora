00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.056
and smart irrigation controllers

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.520
and have beautiful
green landscapes in our cities.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.776
The fourth and final water tap
that we need to open up

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.696
to solve our urban water problem

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.760
will flow with desalinated seawater.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.336
Now, I know what you probably heard
people say about seawater desalination.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.536
"It's a great thing to do if you have
lots of oil, not a lot of water

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.936
and you don't care about climate change."

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.296
Seawater desalination is energy-intensive
no matter how you slice it.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.936
But that characterization
of seawater desalination

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.976
as being a nonstarter
is hopelessly out of date.
