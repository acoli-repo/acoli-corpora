00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.576
Our grandparents' generation
created an amazing system

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.176
of canals and reservoirs
that made it possible

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.616
for people to live in places
where there wasn't a lot of water.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.176
For example, during the Great Depression,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.816
they created the Hoover Dam,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.256
which in turn, created Lake Mead

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.896
and made it possible for the cities
of Las Vegas and Phoenix

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.656
and Los Angeles to provide water

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.880
for people who lived
in a really dry place.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.656
In the 20th century,
we literally spent trillions of dollars

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.096
building infrastructure
to get water to our cities.
