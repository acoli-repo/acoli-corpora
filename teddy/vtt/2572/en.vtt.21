00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.736
And the place where we need to think
about water conservation is outdoors

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.376
because in California
and other modern American cities,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.800
about half of our water use
happens outdoors.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.216
In the current drought,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.816
we've seen that it's possible

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.816
to have our lawns survive
and our plants survive

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.736
with about half as much water.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.776
So there's no need
to start painting concrete green

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.896
and putting in Astroturf
and buying cactuses.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.136
We can have California-friendly
landscaping with soil moisture detectors

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.056
and smart irrigation controllers
