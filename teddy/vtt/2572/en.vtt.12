00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.656
And so the challenge that we face
in urban water harvesting

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.416
is to capture the water, clean the water

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.680
and get it underground.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.536
And that's exactly
what the city of Los Angeles is doing

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.656
with a new project that they're building
in Burbank, California.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.776
This figure here shows
the stormwater park that they're building

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.976
by hooking a series of stormwater
collection systems, or storm sewers,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.576
and routing that water
into an abandoned gravel quarry.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.496
The water that's captured in the quarry

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.296
is slowly passed
through a man-made wetland,
