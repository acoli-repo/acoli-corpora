00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.856
But if you live in a place
where it mainly rains in the winter time

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.296
and most of the water demand
is in the summertime,

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.056
it's not a very cost-effective way
to solve a water problem.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.096
And if you experience the effects
of a multiyear drought,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.296
like California's currently experiencing,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.536
you just can't build a rainwater tank
that's big enough to solve your problem.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.576
I think there's a lot more practical way

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.096
to harvest the stormwater and
the rainwater that falls in our cities,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.896
and that's to capture it
and let it percolate into the ground.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.096
After all, many of our cities are sitting
on top of a natural water storage system
