00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.696
of providing ourselves with water.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.496
Some people think that we're going
to solve the urban water problem

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520
by taking water from our rural neighbors.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.656
But that's an approach that's fraught
with political, legal and social dangers.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.216
And even if we succeed in grabbing
the water from our rural neighbors,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.736
we're just transferring
the problem to someone else

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.376
and there's a good chance
it will come back and bite us

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.296
in the form of higher food prices

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.280
and damage to the aquatic ecosystems
that already rely upon that water.
