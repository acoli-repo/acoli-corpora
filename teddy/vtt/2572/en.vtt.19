The water comes
into our treatment wetland,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.576
it's exposed to sunlight and algae

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.096
and those break down

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.656
remove the nutrients
and inactivate the waterborne pathogens.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.136
The water gets put back

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.056

gets taken out at Anaheim
and percolated into the ground,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.016

of the city of Anaheim,

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.976

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.280
to the drinking water supply
of Orange County.

Now, you might think
that this idea of drinking wastewater
