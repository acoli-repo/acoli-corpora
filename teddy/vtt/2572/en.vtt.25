00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.776
thereby increasing 
the water supply by 25 percent.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.324
We can recycle the water
that makes it into the sewer,

00:12:33.348 --> 00:12:36.428
thereby increasing
our water supply by 40 percent.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.496
And we can make up the difference
through a combination

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.000
of stormwater harvesting
and seawater desalination.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.096
So, let's create a water supply

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.776
that will be able
to withstand any of the challenges

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.376
that climate change throws at us
in the coming years.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.736
Let's create a water supply
that uses local sources

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.800
and leaves more water
in the environment for fish and for food.
