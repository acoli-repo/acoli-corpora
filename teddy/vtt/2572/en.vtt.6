00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.576
I think that there's a better way
to solve our urban water crisis

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.016
and I think that's to open up
four new local sources of water

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.776
that I liken to faucets.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.896
If we can make smart investments
in these new sources of water

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.216
in the coming years,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.576
we can solve our urban water problem

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.936
and decrease the likelihood
that we'll ever run across

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.200
the effects of a catastrophic drought.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.336
Now, if you told me 20 years ago

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.976
that a modern city could exist
without a supply of imported water,
