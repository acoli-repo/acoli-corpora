Now, you might think
that this idea of drinking wastewater

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.856
is some sort of futuristic fantasy
or not commonly done.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.256
Well, in California, we already recycle
about 40 billion gallons a year

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.376
of wastewater through the two-stage
advanced treatment process

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.696
I was telling you about.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.456
That's enough water to be
the supply of about a million people

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.240
if it were their sole water supply.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.496
The third tap that we need to open up
will not be a tap at all,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.136
it will be a kind of virtual tap,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.256
it will be the water conservation
that we manage to do.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.736
And the place where we need to think
about water conservation is outdoors
