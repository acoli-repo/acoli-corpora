WEBVTT

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.696
is called positive
and negative reinforcement,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.280
and basically goes like this.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.896
We see some food that looks good,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.616
our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.136
We eat the food, we taste it --

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.376
it tastes good.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.936
And especially with sugar,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.216
our bodies send a signal
to our brain that says,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.720
"Remember what you're eating
and where you found it."

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.016
We lay down this context-dependent memory

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.496
and learn to repeat the process next time.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.736
See food,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.456
eat food, feel good,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.936
repeat.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.576
Trigger, behavior, reward.
