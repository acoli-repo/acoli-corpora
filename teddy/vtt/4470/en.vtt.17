00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.135
maybe the next time you feel this urge
to check your email when you're bored,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.399
or you're trying to distract
yourself from work,

00:08:34.423 --> 00:08:38.222
or maybe to compulsively respond
to that text message when you're driving,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.936
see if you can tap into
this natural capacity,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.216
just be curiously aware

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.176
of what's happening in your body
and mind in that moment.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.656
It will just be another chance

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.336
to perpetuate one of our endless
and exhaustive habit loops ...

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.600
or step out of it.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.976
Instead of see text message,
compulsively text back,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.736
feel a little bit better --

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.216
notice the urge,
