00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.096
and, ironically, use the same technology
that's driving us to distraction

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.656
to help us step out
of our unhealthy habit patterns

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.696
of smoking, of stress eating
and other addictive behaviors.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.296
Now, remember that bit
about context-dependent memory?

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.216
We can deliver these tools
to peoples' fingertips

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.496
in the contexts that matter most.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.736
So we can help them

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.736
tap into their inherent capacity
to be curiously aware

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.680
right when that urge to smoke
or stress eat or whatever arises.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.456
So if you don't smoke or stress eat,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.135
maybe the next time you feel this urge
to check your email when you're bored,
