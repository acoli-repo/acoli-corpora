00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.896
Instead of this hunger signal
coming from our stomach,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.896
this emotional signal -- feeling sad --

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.200
triggers that urge to eat.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.560
Maybe in our teenage years,

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.600
we were a nerd at school,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.296
and we see those rebel kids
outside smoking and we think,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.576
"Hey, I want to be cool."

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.800
So we start smoking.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.536
The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,
and that was no accident.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.776
See cool,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.096
smoke to be cool,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.936
feel good. Repeat.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.960
Trigger, behavior, reward.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.896
And each time we do this,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.936
we learn to repeat the process
