00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.576
Trigger, behavior, reward.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.800
Simple, right?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.056
Well, after a while,
our creative brains say,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.296
"You know what?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.936
You can use this for more
than just remembering where food is.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.136
You know, next time you feel bad,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.600

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.336
try this and quickly learn

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.656
that if we eat chocolate or ice cream
when we're mad or sad,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.880
we feel better.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.016
Same process,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.776
just a different trigger.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.896
Instead of this hunger signal
coming from our stomach,
