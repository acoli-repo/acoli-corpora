00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.616
When I was first learning to meditate,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.696
the instruction was to simply
pay attention to my breath,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.800
and when my mind wandered,
to bring it back.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.000
Sounded simple enough.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.896
Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.256
sweating through T-shirts
in the middle of winter.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.616
I'd take naps every chance I got
because it was really hard work.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.640
Actually, it was exhausting.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.136
The instruction was simple enough

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.280
but I was missing something
really important.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.560
So why is it so hard to pay attention?
