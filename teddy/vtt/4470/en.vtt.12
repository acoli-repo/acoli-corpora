00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.456
The paradox here

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.296
is that mindfulness is just
about being really interested

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.736
in getting close and personal

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.336

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.976

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.216
is supported by curiosity,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.976
which is naturally rewarding.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.736
What does curiosity feel like?

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.960
It feels good.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.346
And what happens when we get curious?

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.816
We start to notice that cravings
are simply made up of body sensations --
