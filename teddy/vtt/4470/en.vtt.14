00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.896
We become this inner scientist

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.136
where we're eagerly awaiting
that next data point.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.696
Now, this might sound
too simplistic to affect behavior.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.176
But in one study,
we found that mindfulness training

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.096
was twice as good as gold standard therapy
at helping people quit smoking.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.560
So it actually works.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.616
And when we studied
the brains of experienced meditators,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.456
we found that parts of a neural network
of self-referential processing

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.056
called the default mode network

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.296
were at play.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.256
Now, one current hypothesis
is that a region of this network,
