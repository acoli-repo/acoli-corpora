00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.056
Now, she knew, cognitively
that smoking was bad for her,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.960
that's why she joined our program.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.216
What she discovered just by being
curiously aware when she smoked

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.376
was that smoking tastes like shit.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.080
(Laughter)

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.375
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.495
She moved from knowing in her head
that smoking was bad for her

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.976
to knowing it in her bones,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.296
and the spell of smoking was broken.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.680
She started to become
disenchanted with her behavior.
