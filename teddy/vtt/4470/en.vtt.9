00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.056
Now, the prefrontal cortex,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.616
that youngest part of our brain
from an evolutionary perspective,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.696
it understands on an intellectual level
that we shouldn't smoke.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.536
And it tries its hardest
to help us change our behavior,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.896
to help us stop smoking,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.040
to help us stop eating that second,
that third, that fourth cookie.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.456
We call this cognitive control.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.280
We're using cognition
to control our behavior.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.176
Unfortunately,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.136
this is also the first part of our brain

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.176
that goes offline
when we get stressed out,
