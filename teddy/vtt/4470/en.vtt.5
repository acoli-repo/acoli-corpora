00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.936
we learn to repeat the process

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.200
and it becomes a habit.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.216
So later,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.856
feeling stressed out triggers
that urge to smoke a cigarette

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.280
or to eat something sweet.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.136
Now, with these same brain processes,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.056
we've gone from learning to survive

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.936
to literally killing ourselves
with these habits.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.216
Obesity and smoking

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.520
are among the leading preventable causes
of morbidity and mortality in the world.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.880
So back to my breath.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.096
What if instead of fighting our brains,
