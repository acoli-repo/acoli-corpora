00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.560
So why is it so hard to pay attention?

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.536
Well, studies show

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.736
that even when we're really
trying to pay attention to something --

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.336
like maybe this talk --

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.576
at some point,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.936
about half of us
will drift off into a daydream,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.040
or have this urge
to check our Twitter feed.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.880
So what's going on here?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.456
It turns out that we're fighting one
of the most evolutionarily-conserved

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.336
learning processes
currently known in science,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.576
one that's conserved

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.040
back to the most basic
nervous systems known to man.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.496
This reward-based learning process

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.696
is called positive
and negative reinforcement,
