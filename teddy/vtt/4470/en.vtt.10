00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.176
that goes offline
when we get stressed out,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.456
which isn't that helpful.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.957
Now, we can all relate to this
in our own experience.

00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:08.136
We're much more likely to do things
like yell at our spouse or kids

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.776
when we're stressed out or tired,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.136
even though we know
it's not going to be helpful.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.680
We just can't help ourselves.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.296
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.536
we fall back into our old habits,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.416
which is why this disenchantment
is so important.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.096
Seeing what we get from our habits

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.296
helps us understand them
at a deeper level --

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.576
to know it in our bones

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.856
so we don't have to force
ourselves to hold back

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.616
or restrain ourselves from behavior.
