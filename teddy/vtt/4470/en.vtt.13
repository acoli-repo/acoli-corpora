00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.816
We start to notice that cravings
are simply made up of body sensations --

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.096
oh, there's tightness, there's tension,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.776
there's restlessness --

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.240
and that these body
sensations come and go.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.856
These are bite-size pieces of experiences

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.896
that we can manage from moment to moment

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.056
rather than getting clobbered
by this huge, scary craving

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.456
that we choke on.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.976
In other words, when we get curious,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.736
we step out of our old,
fear-based, reactive habit patterns,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.976
and we step into being.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.896
We become this inner scientist
