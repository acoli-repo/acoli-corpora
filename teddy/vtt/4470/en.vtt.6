00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.096
What if instead of fighting our brains,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.656
or trying to force ourselves
to pay attention,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.696
we instead tapped into this natural,
reward-based learning process ...

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.920
but added a twist?

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.576
What if instead we just got really curious

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.096
about what was happening
in our momentary experience?

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.656
I'll give you an example.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.896
In my lab,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.256
we studied whether mindfulness training
could help people quit smoking.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.936
Now, just like trying to force myself
to pay attention to my breath,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.216
they could try to force
themselves to quit smoking.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.176
And the majority of them
had tried this before and failed --

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.120
on average, six times.
