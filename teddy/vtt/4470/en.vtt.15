00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.256
Now, one current hypothesis
is that a region of this network,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.496
called the posterior cingulate cortex,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.256
is activated not necessarily
by craving itself

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.896
but when we get caught up in it,
when we get sucked in,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.616
and it takes us for a ride.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.736
In contrast, when we let go --

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.136
step out of the process

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.656
just by being curiously aware
of what's happening --

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.800
this same brain region quiets down.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.416
Now we're testing app and online-based
mindfulness training programs

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.576
that target these core mechanisms

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.096
and, ironically, use the same technology
that's driving us to distraction
