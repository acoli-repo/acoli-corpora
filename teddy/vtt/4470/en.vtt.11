or restrain ourselves from behavior.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.416
We're just less interested
in doing it in the first place.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.976
And this is what mindfulness is all about:

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.680
Seeing really clearly what we get
when we get caught up in our behaviors,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.136
becoming disenchanted on a visceral level

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.280
and from this disenchanted stance,
naturally letting go.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.416
This isn't to say that, poof,
magically we quit smoking.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.056
But over time, as we learn
to see more and more clearly

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.416
the results of our actions,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.080
we let go of old habits and form new ones.
