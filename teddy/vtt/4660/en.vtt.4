00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:02.798
and "genetic" refers to the fact
that these fruit flies have been modified

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:06.647
to contain a special gene that makes
only certain neurons respond to light.

00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:10.365
In our case, we've added the special gene
to the sweet taste receptors.

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:11.916
Now here's the fun part.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.994
Optogenetics means that we
can control these special neurons

00:02:15.018 --> 00:02:17.627
whenever they're exposed
to a bright-colored light,

00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:19.840
causing them to send
messages to the brain.

00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:23.003
In this experiment, we're going to have
these modified fruit flies

00:02:23.027 --> 00:02:25.042
choose between banana and broccoli again,

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:27.907
only this time, every time
the fruit fly eats the broccoli,

00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.122
we're going to trigger
a big bright red light.
