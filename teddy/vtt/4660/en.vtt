Greg Gage: It's an age-old
pursuit of all parents,

00:00:02.806 --> 00:00:04.808
getting their kids
to eat their vegetables.

00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:06.881
But getting them to eat
cookies or ice cream

00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:08.056
is relatively easy,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.321
and that's because our brains
prefer sweetness.

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:12.760
Now, there's a new technology
called optogenetics

00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:14.806
which may be able to trick our taste buds,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.443
for instance preferring
vegetables over sweets.

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:20.084
We're going to try this today
using fruit flies.

00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:22.752

00:00:23.086 --> 00:00:25.196
The reason why we experiment
with fruit flies

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.231
is they have a small enough nervous system

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:30.497
that gives us a fighting chance
to really understand what's going on.
