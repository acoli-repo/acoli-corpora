00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.511
When we eat something
that triggers a particular taste,

00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:34.034
those taste neurons will fire
a signal to the brain.

00:01:34.058 --> 00:01:36.978
This allows our brain to know
what's sweet and what's bitter.

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.338
So when a fruit fly eats a banana,
its sweet taste neurons will fire.

00:01:40.362 --> 00:01:43.843
But when it eats broccoli,
those same neurons stay pretty quiet.

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:46.841
But what if we could force
those sweet-tasting neurons to fire

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:48.731
every time the fruit fly eats broccoli?

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:50.473
We may be able to get the fruit fly

00:01:50.497 --> 00:01:52.244
to like broccoli as much as banana.

00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:53.505
Enter optogenetics.

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:56.901
This is the revolutionary new tool
that's taking neuroscience by storm,

00:01:56.925 --> 00:01:59.243
and in this case, "opto" means light

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:02.798
and "genetic" refers to the fact
that these fruit flies have been modified
