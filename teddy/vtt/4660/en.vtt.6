00:02:58.432 --> 00:03:00.082
GG: There we go. You got all four.

00:03:00.106 --> 00:03:01.257
OK, perfect.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.701
So you're going to turn on
your OptoStimmers here.

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:06.859
You're going to park the light
right on top of the chambers.

00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:09.708

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:21.244
GG: Oh, he's back. All right!

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:24.562

that some of these flies

00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:27.411
are switching over from
the banana to the broccoli.

00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:28.601
SB: Exactly, yeah.
