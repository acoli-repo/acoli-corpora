GG: Every time this light goes off,

00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:33.119
that means that they think
they're tasting something sweet.

00:03:33.143 --> 00:03:35.314
SB: Yeah. So this guy's
really going after it.

00:03:35.338 --> 00:03:37.512
GG: So we saw that we were able
to rescue broccoli

00:03:37.536 --> 00:03:40.409
and make it just as appealing
as banana to our fruit flies.

00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:42.687
And we're able to replicate
these same results

00:03:42.711 --> 00:03:44.044
in all of our experiments.

00:03:44.068 --> 00:03:46.668
So the question is: Can we
do the same thing in humans?

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:48.597
Well, that depends on a number of items.

00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:52.083
First, do optogenetic tools
even work in humans?

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:54.110
And that looks like the answer is yes,

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:56.716
and in fact, clinical trials
are already being planned

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.270
that will treat chronic pain
and blindness using optogenetics.
