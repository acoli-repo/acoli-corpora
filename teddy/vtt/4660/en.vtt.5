00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.122
we're going to trigger
a big bright red light.

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:33.296
And when the channels see that red light,
they're going to open up,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.460
and they're going to cause
that neuron to fire,

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:38.008
and the sweet taste message
will be sent to the brain.

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:39.276
How do you get them out?

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.674
SB: So we're going to be using
a mouth aspirator,

00:02:41.698 --> 00:02:43.539
so it's just two straws put together.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.372
GG: So it's a fancy name for a straw.

00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:46.547
SB: Basically.

00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:48.399
GG: So you're going to suck those out.

00:02:49.822 --> 00:02:51.654
Have you ever sucked up a fly before?

00:02:51.678 --> 00:02:53.597
SB: Once or twice.

00:02:58.432 --> 00:03:00.082
GG: There we go. You got all four.
