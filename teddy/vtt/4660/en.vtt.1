00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:30.497
that gives us a fighting chance
to really understand what's going on.

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:33.600
And believe it or not, their taste buds
are very similar to ours.

00:00:33.624 --> 00:00:36.283
But before we try to manipulate
their taste preferences,

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:39.161
we need to establish:
What is the baseline of the fruit fly?

00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:40.336
What does it prefer?

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.248
We call this a control experiment.

00:00:42.272 --> 00:00:44.475
Spencer's been hard at work doing this.

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.563
OK, Spencer, let's do
our first experiment.

00:00:46.587 --> 00:00:49.881
We want to test to see if fruit flies
prefer bananas or broccoli.

00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:51.452
So what do we need?

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:55.073
Spencer Brown: So we need the fly pad,
which is basically an iPad for flies.

00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:56.280
It measures the touch.

00:00:56.304 --> 00:00:57.940
GG: You put a fly in each chamber?

00:00:58.288 --> 00:01:01.187
SB: Yeah. Inside, we'll offer them
banana and broccoli
