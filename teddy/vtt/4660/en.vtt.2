00:00:58.288 --> 00:01:01.187
SB: Yeah. Inside, we'll offer them
banana and broccoli

00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:02.597
to see which one they prefer.

00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:04.400
GG: In order to count how many times

00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:06.902
the fruit fly eats a banana
versus the broccoli,

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:09.638
these chambers have been outfitted
with a small electrode

00:01:09.662 --> 00:01:11.252
that sends data to a computer.

00:01:11.276 --> 00:01:14.418
And so what were your findings
on banana versus broccoli?

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:16.979
SB: I found that the flies
visited banana the most.

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:18.927
GG: Both were there, but like most kids,

00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:23.234
they choose not to eat the broccoli,
and they go switch to something sweeter.

00:01:23.258 --> 00:01:25.440
GG: Now a quick background
on how taste works.

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:27.645
Taste buds are made up
of specialized neurons

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:28.837
called taste receptors.

00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.511
When we eat something
that triggers a particular taste,
