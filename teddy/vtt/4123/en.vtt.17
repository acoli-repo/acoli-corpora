00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:31.960
is right here in the house today,

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.742
and thanks to him,

00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:36.460
I can say, thanks to his invention, I can say

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.437
that I am a cobbler too,

00:08:38.437 --> 00:08:40.891
and by standing in these shoes

00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:43.225
I am honoring my past

00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:45.377
while manufacturing the future.

00:08:45.377 --> 00:08:46.900
Thank you.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.390
