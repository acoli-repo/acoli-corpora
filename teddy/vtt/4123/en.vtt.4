But the implications of 3D printing

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.477
go well beyond the tips of our noses.

00:02:04.477 --> 00:02:06.805
When I met Amanda for the first time,

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:09.400
she could already stand up and walk a little bit

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.355
even though she was paralyzed from the waist down,

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:15.070
but she complained to me that her suit

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.995

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:20.134
made by Ekso Bionics,

00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:23.902
but it wasn't inspired by her body.

00:02:23.902 --> 00:02:26.219

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.942
So she challenged me to make her something

00:02:28.942 --> 00:02:32.103
that was a little bit more feminine,
