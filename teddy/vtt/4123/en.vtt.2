00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.448
who invented 3D printing.

00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:03.631
But the thing that I want to talk to you about today,

00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:05.561
the big idea that I want to discuss with you,

00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:07.464
is not that 3D printing

00:01:07.464 --> 00:01:10.724
is going to catapult us into the future,

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:13.120
but rather that it's actually going

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.213
to connect us with our heritage,

00:01:16.213 --> 00:01:19.237
and it's going to usher in a new era

00:01:19.237 --> 00:01:23.121
of localized, distributed manufacturing

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:24.853
that is actually based

00:01:24.853 --> 00:01:27.312
on digital fabrication.

00:01:27.312 --> 00:01:33.110
So think about useful things.
