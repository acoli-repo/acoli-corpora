00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.669
it costs a fraction of its cost,

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.360
and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.039
and it's going to be out in space later this year.

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.402
Google is taking on this very audacious project

00:05:11.402 --> 00:05:14.104
of making the block phone, the Ara.

00:05:14.104 --> 00:05:16.617
It's only possible because of the development

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:19.166
of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:23.526
will make functional, usable modules

00:05:23.526 --> 00:05:24.922
that will go into it.

00:05:24.922 --> 00:05:28.220
A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.768
How about food?
