00:05:58.868 --> 00:06:02.309
and colors and flavors in every taste,

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:05.107
which means not only delicious foods

00:06:05.107 --> 00:06:08.924
but the promise of personalized nutrition

00:06:08.924 --> 00:06:10.278
around the corner?

00:06:10.278 --> 00:06:13.423
And that gets me to one of the
biggest deals about 3D printing.

00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:16.284
With 3D printing, complexity is free.

00:06:16.284 --> 00:06:19.146
The printer doesn't care

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:21.790
if it makes the most rudimentary shape

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.990
or the most complex shape,

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.148
and that is completely turning design

00:06:27.148 --> 00:06:30.694
and manufacturing on its head as we know it.
