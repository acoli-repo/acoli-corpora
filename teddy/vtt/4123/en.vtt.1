00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.437
and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it.

00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:40.740
But all of that is about to change with 3D printing,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.818
and it all started with this,

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:47.650
the very first part

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.910
that was ever printed.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.473
It's a little older than TED.

00:00:52.473 --> 00:00:55.120
It was printed in 1983

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.840
by Chuck Hull,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.448
who invented 3D printing.
