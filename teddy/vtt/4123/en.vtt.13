and manufacturing on its head as we know it.

00:06:30.694 --> 00:06:33.021
Many people think that 3D printing will be

00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:36.759

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.272
I think that it's the opportunity to put

00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:42.933
tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters

00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:45.536
that will create endless abundance

00:06:45.536 --> 00:06:47.456
