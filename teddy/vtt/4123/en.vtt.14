00:06:59.037 --> 00:07:01.080
so we're developing haptics,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.019
perceptual devices

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:04.920
that will allow you to touch

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.685
and feel your designs

00:07:06.685 --> 00:07:09.563
as if you play with digital clay.

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:11.260
When you do things like that,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.263
and we also developed things that take

00:07:13.263 --> 00:07:15.817
physical photographs that are instantly printable,

00:07:15.817 --> 00:07:18.467
it will make it easier to create content,

00:07:18.467 --> 00:07:21.498
but with all of the unimagined,

00:07:21.498 --> 00:07:23.890
we will also have the unintended,

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:29.166
like democratized counterfeiting

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:32.150
and ubiquitous illegal possession.
