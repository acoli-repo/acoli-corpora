00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:32.150
and ubiquitous illegal possession.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.633
So many people ask me,

00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:36.141
will we have a 3D printer in every home?

00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:38.394
I think it's the wrong question to ask.

00:07:38.394 --> 00:07:39.775
The right question to ask is,

00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:43.540
how will 3D printing change my life?

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.730
Or, in other words, what room in my house

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.894
will 3D printing fit in?

00:07:47.894 --> 00:07:49.890
So everything that you see here

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.001
has been 3D printed,

00:07:52.001 --> 00:07:55.080
including these shoes

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.322
at the Amsterdam fashion show.

00:07:57.322 --> 00:08:01.018
Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes.
