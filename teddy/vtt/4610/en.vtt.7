00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:31.587
that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles.

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.976
Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.433
which is within one percent
of the actual diameter of the Earth.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:40.976
He did this 2,200 years ago.

00:03:42.302 --> 00:03:43.976
Now, we live in an age where

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.703
multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery
are looking for the Higgs boson.

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:50.039
We're discovering particles

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.341
that may travel faster
than the speed of light,

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:55.111
and all of these discoveries
are made possible

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:58.744
by technology that's been developed
in the last few decades.

00:03:58.768 --> 00:04:01.248
But for most of human history,
