But for most of human history,

00:04:01.272 --> 00:04:05.608
we had to discover these things using
our eyes and our ears and our minds.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.976
Armand Fizeau was
an experimental physicist in Paris.

00:04:10.803 --> 00:04:15.007
His specialty was actually refining
and confirming other people's results,

00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:17.372
and this might sound
like a bit of an also-ran,

00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:19.497
but in fact, this is the soul of science,

00:04:19.521 --> 00:04:23.426
because there is no such thing as a fact
that cannot be independently corroborated.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.286
And he was familiar
with Galileo's experiments

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.497
in trying to determine
whether or not light had a speed.

00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:32.727
Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment
