00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:00.724
It's not true at all.

00:02:00.748 --> 00:02:04.269
In fact, everyone who was educated
understood that the world was spherical

00:02:04.293 --> 00:02:05.429
since Aristotle's time.

00:02:05.453 --> 00:02:07.888
Aristotle had proved it
with a simple observation.

00:02:07.912 --> 00:02:11.092
He noticed that every time you saw
the Earth's shadow on the Moon,

00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:12.147
it was circular,

00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:15.061
and the only shape that constantly
creates a circular shadow

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:17.993
is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round.

00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:19.807
But nobody knew how big it was

00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:23.183
until Eratosthenes got
this letter with this fact.

00:02:23.207 --> 00:02:26.736
So he understood that the sun
was directly above the city of Swenet,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.866
because looking down a well,
it was a straight line

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.212
all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun.
