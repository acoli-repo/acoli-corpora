00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.212
all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun.

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.950
Eratosthenes knew another fact.

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:37.668
He knew that a stick stuck
in the ground in Alexandria

00:02:37.692 --> 00:02:40.747
at the same time
and the same day, at noon,

00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:42.607
the sun's zenith, on the solstice,

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:48.442
the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis.

00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:53.571
If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it,

00:02:53.595 --> 00:02:56.563
all you need to know is the distance
between those two points,

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:58.642
and you can extrapolate the circumference.

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:02.131
360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50.
