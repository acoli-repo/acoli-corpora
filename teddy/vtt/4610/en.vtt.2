00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:02.153
Feynman went on to earn degrees

00:01:02.177 --> 00:01:05.177
at MIT, Princeton, he solved
the Challenger disaster,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.035
he ended up winning
the Nobel Prize in Physics

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:11.547
for his Feynman diagrams, describing
the movement of subatomic particles.

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:16.514
And he credits that conversation
with his father as giving him a sense

00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:21.073
that the simplest questions could carry
you out to the edge of human knowledge,

00:01:21.097 --> 00:01:23.002
and that that's where he wanted to play.

00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:24.399
And play he did.

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:29.673
Eratosthenes was the third librarian
at the great Library of Alexandria,

00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:32.215
and he made many contributions to science.
