00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:02.131
360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50.

00:03:02.155 --> 00:03:04.248
I know it's a little bit
of a round number,

00:03:04.272 --> 00:03:06.383
and it makes me suspicious
of this story too,

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:08.795
but it's a good story,
so we'll continue with it.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.813
He needed to know the distance
between Swenet and Alexandria,

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:15.120
which is good because Eratosthenes
was good at geography.

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.842
In fact, he invented the word geography.

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:19.088
(Laughter)

00:03:19.112 --> 00:03:22.355
The road between Swenet and Alexandria
was a road of commerce,

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.341
and commerce needed to know
how long it took to get there.

00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:28.608
It needed to know the exact distance,
so he knew very precisely

00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:31.587
that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles.
