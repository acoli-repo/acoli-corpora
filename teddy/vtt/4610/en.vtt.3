WEBVTT

00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:32.215
and he made many contributions to science.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:34.001
But the one he is most remembered for

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:37.528
began in a letter that he received
as the librarian,

00:01:37.552 --> 00:01:41.139
from the town of Swenet,
which was south of Alexandria.

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:44.116
The letter included this fact
that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.748
and the fact was that the writer said,

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:49.637
at noon on the solstice,
when he looked down this deep well,

00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:51.715
he could see his reflection at the bottom,

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:54.479
and he could also see
that his head was blocking the sun.

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:57.112
I should tell you -- the idea
that Christopher Columbus

00:01:57.136 --> 00:01:59.699
discovered that the world
is spherical is total bull.

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:00.724
It's not true at all.
