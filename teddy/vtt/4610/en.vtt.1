00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:30.297
before you understand their import to you.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.590
Here's three of mine.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:34.957
When Richard Feynman
was a young boy in Queens,

00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:38.306
he went for a walk with his dad
and his wagon and a ball.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.187
He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,
the ball went to the back of the wagon.

00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:45.336
He asked his dad, "Why does
the ball go to the back of the wagon?"

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.031
And his dad said, "That's inertia."

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:49.356
He said, "What's inertia?"
And his dad said, "Ah.

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:51.976
Inertia is the name that scientists give

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.576
to the phenomenon of the ball
going to the back of the wagon."

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.254
(Laughter)

00:00:57.278 --> 00:00:59.709
"But in truth, nobody really knows."
