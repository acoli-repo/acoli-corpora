00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:01.976
that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound.

00:05:02.873 --> 00:05:04.753
Fizeau was aware of this experiment.

00:05:04.777 --> 00:05:09.080
He lived in Paris, and he set up
two experimental stations,

00:05:09.104 --> 00:05:12.162
roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris.

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:14.621
And he solved this problem of Galileo's,

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:17.741
and he did it with a really relatively
trivial piece of equipment.

00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:21.555
He did it with one of these.

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:23.722
I'm going to put away
the clicker for a second

00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:25.874
because I want to engage
your brains in this.

00:05:25.898 --> 00:05:27.308
So this is a toothed wheel.

00:05:27.332 --> 00:05:30.262
It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth.
