00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:32.727
Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment

00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:36.289
where he and his assistant had a lamp,
each one of them was holding a lamp.

00:04:36.313 --> 00:04:39.250
Galileo would open his lamp,
and his assistant would open his.

00:04:39.274 --> 00:04:41.076
They got the timing down really good.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.571
They just knew their timing.

00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:44.657
And then they stood at two hilltops,

00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:47.104
two miles distant,
and they did the same thing,

00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:50.477
on the assumption from Galileo
that if light had a discernible speed,

00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:53.835
he'd notice a delay in the light
coming back from his assistant's lamp.

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.019
But light was too fast for Galileo.

00:04:56.043 --> 00:04:58.912
He was off by several orders
of magnitude when he assumed

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:01.976
that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound.
