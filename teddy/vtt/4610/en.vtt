One of the funny things
about owning a brain

00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:18.585
is that you have
no control over the things

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.346
that it gathers and holds onto,
the facts and the stories.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.416
And as you get older, it only gets worse.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.637
Things stick around for years sometimes

00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:28.188
before you understand
why you're interested in them,

00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:30.297
before you understand their import to you.
