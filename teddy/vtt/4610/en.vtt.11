00:05:27.332 --> 00:05:30.262
It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth.

00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:33.345
This was Fizeau's solution
to sending discrete pulses of light.

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:35.875
He put a beam behind one of these notches.

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:39.078
If I point a beam
through this notch at a mirror,

00:05:39.102 --> 00:05:41.881
five miles away, that beam
is bouncing off the mirror

00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:44.025
and coming back to me through this notch.

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:47.206
But something interesting happens
as he spins the wheel faster.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.565
He notices that it seems
like a door is starting to close

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:52.976
on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye.

00:05:53.968 --> 00:05:54.968
Why is that?

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.933
It's because the pulse
of light is not coming back

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:59.244
through the same notch.

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:00.751
It's actually hitting a tooth.
