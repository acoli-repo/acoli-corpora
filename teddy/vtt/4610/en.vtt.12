It's actually hitting a tooth.

00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:05.057
And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light.

00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:07.976
And then, based on the distance
between the two stations

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.143
and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel,

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:15.414
he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value.

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:19.363
And he does this in 1849.

00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:23.614
This is what really gets me
going about science.

00:06:23.638 --> 00:06:26.067
Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept,

00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:29.187
I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept.

00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.944
I look at the story of how
they came to understand it.
