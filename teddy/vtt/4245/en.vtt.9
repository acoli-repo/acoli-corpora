00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
once out of childhood you'd never again know

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
not until mores at last had evolved,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
then even kiss (your fathers bristles

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
white and stiff now).

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
What release finally, the embrace:

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious --

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
how much unspoken joy there was

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
in that affirmation of equality and communion,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
no matter how much misunderstanding
