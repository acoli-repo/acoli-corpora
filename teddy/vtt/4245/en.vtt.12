00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
you could find tracts with hills and trees

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
you could pretend were mountains and forests.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Or you could go out by yourself

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
even to a half-block-long empty lot,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
into the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
crouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone;

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
already there was wanting to be simpler,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
wanting, when they called you,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
never to go back.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:41.000
(Applause)
