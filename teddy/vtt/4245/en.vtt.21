00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
rising in bloody splendor, "Behold me."

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Her making her way

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
down the littered vestibule stairs,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
one agonized step at a time.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
My holding the door.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Her crossing the fragmented tiles,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
faltering at the step to the street,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
droning, not looking at me,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
"Can you help me?"

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Taking my arm, leaning lightly against me.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Her wavering step into the world.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Her whispering, "Thanks love." Lightly, lightly against me.
