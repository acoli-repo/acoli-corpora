00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
as the most elusive memory now,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
would be a storm of birdsong,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
then the soft clop of the hooves

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the last sound at night as likely as not

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
would be your father pulling up in his car,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
having worked late again, always late,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to shake out the ashes and damp the draft

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
before he came upstairs to fall into bed --
