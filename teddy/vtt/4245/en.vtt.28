00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I was frightened of her. I felt like a child.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I was afraid some repressed part of myself

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
would go out of control, and I'd be forever entrapped

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
in the shocking seethe of her stench.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Not excrement merely, not merely surface

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and orifice going unwashed,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
rediffusion of rum,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
there was will in it,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
and intention, power and purpose --

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
a social, ethical rage and rebellion --

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
despair too, though, grief, loss.
