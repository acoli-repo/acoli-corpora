00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
These invisible links that allure,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
these transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
The girl, my old love,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
the last lost time I saw her

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
when she came to find me at a party,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
her drunkenly stumbling, falling,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
sprawling, skirt hiked, eyes veined red,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
swollen with tears, her shame,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
her dishonor.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
My ignorant, arrogant coarseness,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
my secret pride, my turning away.
