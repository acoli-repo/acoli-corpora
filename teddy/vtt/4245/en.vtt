00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of youth and age.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The first one is dedicated to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Spencer, and his grandmother, who was shocked by his work.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My poem is called "Dirt."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
half a long century gone

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and still she comes at me

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with that thick cruel yellow bar.
