00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
the clash, pulling each other through

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
our perceptual punctures,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
then holocaust, holocaust,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
host on host of ill, injured presences,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
squandered, consumed.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Her vigil somewhere I know continues.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Her occupancy, her absolute, faithful attendance.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
The dance of our glances, challenge, abdication,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000
effacement, the perfume of our consternation.
