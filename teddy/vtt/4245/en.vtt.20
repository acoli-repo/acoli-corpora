00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
my secret pride, my turning away.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Still life on a rooftop,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
dead trees in barrels, a bench broken,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
dogs, excrement, sky.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
What pathways through pain,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
what junctures of vulnerability,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
what crossings and counterings?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Too many lives in our lives already,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
too many chances for sorrow,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
too many unaccounted-for pasts.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
"Behold me," the god of frenzied,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
inexhaustible love says,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
rising in bloody splendor, "Behold me."
