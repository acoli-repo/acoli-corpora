00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But oh, her soap!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Might its bitter burning have been

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
what made me a poet?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The street she lived on was unpaved,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
her flat, two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
where she stalked and caught me.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Dare I admit that after she did it

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I never really loved her again?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
She lived to a hundred,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
even then. All along it was the sadness, the squalor,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but I never, until now

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
loved her again.
