00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trap

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
in the Village, that my neighbor was her.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
My thinking we'd meet, recognize one another,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
become friends, that I'd accomplish a penance.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
My seeing her, it wasn't her, at the mailbox.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Gray-yellow hair, army pants under a nightgown,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
her turning away, hiding her ravaged face

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
in her hands, muttering an inappropriate "Hi."

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell.
