The act of speaking up against injustices

00:03:04.257 --> 00:03:08.141
because the problems require
more than just rhetoric.

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:14.822

farms in Africa continue to be owned

00:03:14.846 --> 00:03:16.594
by foreign investors

00:03:16.618 --> 00:03:20.164

are shipped to the West,

00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:24.910
the stream of African migrants
