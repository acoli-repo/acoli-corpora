00:00:05.154 --> 00:00:09.059
I am an immigrant from Uganda
living in the United States

00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:11.744
while waiting for my asylum application

00:00:11.768 --> 00:00:12.954
to go through.

00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:16.991
Migrants do not enjoy
much freedom of movement

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:18.439
in our world today.

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:21.973
This certainly applies to those
who are desperate enough

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:25.015
to navigate choppy
and stormy seas in boats.

00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:30.124
These are the risks my cousins
from West Africa and North Africa face
