WEBVTT

00:01:56.268 --> 00:02:00.938
led to me being forced out of my career
as a journalist in the Middle East.

00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:03.250
I was deported to Uganda,

00:02:03.274 --> 00:02:07.931
where economic deprivation
puts everyone at the risk of starvation.

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:10.622
I fled Uganda to come to the United States

00:02:10.646 --> 00:02:14.756
in the hope of sustaining a voice
for my brothers and sisters

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.153
who experience a more
serious plight as migrants.

00:02:18.707 --> 00:02:22.365
My father told me he was not happy
about me writing a book

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:26.117
that risked deportation and unemployment.

00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:29.615
He had been diabetic for many years
when I still worked in Dubai,

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.218
and my salary was always sufficient
to pay for his treatments.
