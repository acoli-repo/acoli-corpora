00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:30.124
These are the risks my cousins
from West Africa and North Africa face

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:32.450
while trying to cross over to Europe.

00:00:32.474 --> 00:00:36.301
Indeed, it is a rare
but fortunate opportunity

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:39.482
for a migrant to address
a gathering like this.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:43.406
But this also signifies
what often is missing

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.104
in the global debate over refugees,

00:00:46.128 --> 00:00:48.486
migrants and immigrants,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.479
voices of the disenfranchised.

00:00:51.503 --> 00:00:53.466
Citizens of many host countries,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.405
even those that previously
welcomed newcomers,

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.711
are uneasy about the rising
numbers of individuals

00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:01.953
coming into their countries.
