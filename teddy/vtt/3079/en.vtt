00:00:01.056 --> 00:00:05.041
For as long as I remember,
I've loved mathematics.

00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:08.311
Actually, it's not 100 percent true.

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:12.263
I've loved mathematics for all
but a two-week period

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:13.445
in senior high school.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.783
(Laughter)

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:15.981
I was top of my class,

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.787
and we were about to start
the Extension Maths course.

00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:22.073
I was really excited
about this brand new topic coming up,

00:00:22.097 --> 00:00:23.247
complex numbers.

00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:25.214
I like complex.

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:28.120
My teacher was priming us for the concepts

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:30.217
with some questions about square roots.
