00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:01.148
Behavioral economists
call this hyperbolic discounting.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.863
And Levitt goes as far as to say

00:09:03.887 --> 00:09:06.958
that all motivating power vanishes

00:09:06.982 --> 00:09:09.156
when rewards are handed out with a delay.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.490
So, from a purely economic point of view:

00:09:14.514 --> 00:09:17.942
if we don't use immediate incentives,

00:09:17.966 --> 00:09:20.480
we are underinvesting in student outcomes.

00:09:21.474 --> 00:09:24.315
I took heart from that,
and came to see that as a society,

00:09:24.339 --> 00:09:26.879
we're actually quite used
to financial incentives.

00:09:26.903 --> 00:09:30.069
Whether it be by the government,
by employers or at home.
