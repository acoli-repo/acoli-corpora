00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:00.757
(Laughter)

00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:03.561
Secondly, how would we fund this thing?

00:08:03.585 --> 00:08:04.736
(Laughter)

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.934
And finally,

00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.180
would the results be sustained
if the students were no longer paid?

00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:11.950
Now, let's look at the ethical part first.

00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:13.840
I'm a bit of a mathematical purist.

00:08:13.864 --> 00:08:17.600
So I'd be one of the first people to say
that we should study mathematics

00:08:17.624 --> 00:08:19.491
for the sake of mathematics.

00:08:19.861 --> 00:08:24.057
Remember -- for play, for beauty,
for truth, for justice and for love!

00:08:24.781 --> 00:08:25.940
Not for money!

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.178
(Laughter)

00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:29.307
As I struggled with this,
I came to see that,

00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:31.401
while it's a way I look
at mathematics now,
