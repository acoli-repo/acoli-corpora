00:06:30.244 --> 00:06:32.395
We tinkered with gamification elements

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.267
like points, badges and avatars,

00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:38.133
and we'd see a temporary
spike in engagement

00:06:38.157 --> 00:06:41.374
but things would go back to normal
as soon as the novelty wore off.

00:06:42.466 --> 00:06:44.387
Then one day, my cofounder, Alvin,

00:06:44.411 --> 00:06:47.029
came across a study of students in Chicago

00:06:47.053 --> 00:06:49.831
led by the behavioral
economist, Steven Levitt,

00:06:49.855 --> 00:06:52.831
where they paid students
who improved on their test scores.

00:06:54.474 --> 00:06:57.569
He started telling me
about some of the things they tested for

00:06:57.593 --> 00:06:59.407
and the interesting findings they had.
