You can see a lot more
completing their homework than not.

00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:03.934
In fact, as our user base has grown,

00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.585
we found the percentage
to be pretty steady, at around 75 percent.

00:12:07.609 --> 00:12:11.069
So on average, we receive
our weekly subscription fee

00:12:11.093 --> 00:12:13.291
once every four weeks,

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:16.323
and the other three weeks,
we're rewarding the students.

00:12:17.386 --> 00:12:20.070
Now of course we're leaving
some money on the table here,

00:12:20.094 --> 00:12:21.245
but guess what?

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:23.196
It turns out these students

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:28.484
are 70 percent more engaged
than students not on the reward program.

00:12:29.109 --> 00:12:30.259
Check.
