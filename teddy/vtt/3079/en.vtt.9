00:04:27.673 --> 00:04:30.712
Can everyone see what I've done there
to stress my point?

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:33.847
If you can't, let me show you now,

00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:36.751
with the vertical axis
starting at zero, where it should be.

00:04:37.323 --> 00:04:38.926

It's the exact same data

00:04:40.862 --> 00:04:44.523

unless we do something

00:04:51.072 --> 00:04:54.696
to drastically improve
student engagement with mathematics,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.989
we'll not only have
a huge skills shortage crisis

00:04:58.013 --> 00:05:00.292
but a fickle population,
