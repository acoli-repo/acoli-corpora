(Laughter)

00:01:00.657 --> 00:01:01.836
That day,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.863
my entire mathematical world
came crashing down on me.

00:01:04.887 --> 00:01:06.235
(Laughter)

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:07.632
"Imaginary numbers?

00:01:07.974 --> 00:01:09.124
Seriously?

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.475
But mathematics is a source of truth,

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:13.276
please don't go abstract on me.

00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:15.679
I would have studied art

00:01:15.703 --> 00:01:17.974
if I wanted to play
with imaginary numbers."

00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:19.641
(Laughter)

00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:22.494
"This is Extension Maths,
let's get back with our program!"

00:01:22.998 --> 00:01:24.156
She didn't,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.958
and over the next couple of weeks,

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:29.229
I reluctantly performed
meaningless calculations,

00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:30.254
(Laughter)
