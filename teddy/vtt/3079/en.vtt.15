00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:30.688
they found that the rewards
had to be instant

00:07:30.712 --> 00:07:32.743
rather than promised at a later date.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:36.379
They went as far as to give
the students 20 dollars and say,

00:07:36.403 --> 00:07:38.410
"Touch it, feel it, smell it --"

00:07:38.434 --> 00:07:39.680
(Sniffing)

00:07:39.704 --> 00:07:40.854
"It's all yours.

00:07:41.442 --> 00:07:43.664
But if you fail,
I'm going to take it back."

00:07:43.688 --> 00:07:45.555
And that worked really well.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.603
I immediately got excited

00:07:48.627 --> 00:07:51.862
about the possibilities
of implementing this in our program.

00:07:51.886 --> 00:07:53.879
But once the excitement settled down,

00:07:53.903 --> 00:07:56.633
there were a few concerns
that crept in our minds.

00:07:56.657 --> 00:07:58.045
Firstly,

00:07:58.069 --> 00:07:59.299
was this ethical?

00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:00.757
(Laughter)
