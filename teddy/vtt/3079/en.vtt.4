with applications in the real world,

00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:03.703
in fields like electrical engineering.

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:05.593
Wow!

00:02:05.617 --> 00:02:09.258
I gained a whole new level
of appreciation for mathematics.

00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:12.088
And after my brief mistrust,

00:02:12.112 --> 00:02:15.512
I was now in love

Francis Su, the mathematician,
sums it up beautifully when he says,

00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:25.053
"We study mathematics
for play, for beauty,

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:26.339

00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:28.530
