If she had any doubt left
that I've gone completely mad,

00:10:30.736 --> 00:10:33.269
that pretty much confirmed it for her.

00:10:33.703 --> 00:10:35.212
She said to me, "Mo ...

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:39.006
you realize that if everybody
does their homework, which you want,

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.029
you're not going to make any revenue,
which you don't want.

00:10:42.053 --> 00:10:43.513
Great business model."

00:10:43.537 --> 00:10:44.742
(Laughter)

00:10:44.766 --> 00:10:47.146
I say it's more like
an antibusiness model,

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.949
it's free if you use it,
but you pay if you don't.

00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:52.704
Now, I knew from experience

00:10:52.728 --> 00:10:55.260
that not everybody in the country
was going to jump on

00:10:55.284 --> 00:10:57.164
and do their maths homework every week.

00:10:57.188 --> 00:10:59.760
And if they did,
sure we'd go bust pretty quickly,

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:03.496
but hey, we would have solved
the country's maths skills crisis.
