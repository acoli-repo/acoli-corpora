From a business perspective,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.172
they are less likely to churn

00:12:36.196 --> 00:12:38.180
and more likely to refer friends,

00:12:38.204 --> 00:12:41.839
so we're hoping to trade off
a lower revenue per user

00:12:41.863 --> 00:12:44.530
for a bigger and more engaged user base.

00:12:44.895 --> 00:12:46.307
Check and check.

00:12:47.484 --> 00:12:49.286
Now for that final question.

Mathematics is so much more
than just a subject you study at school.

00:12:56.897 --> 00:12:58.364
It's a human endeavor.

00:12:58.823 --> 00:13:01.767
It's what helps us to understand
the world around us.
