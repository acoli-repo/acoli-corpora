00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:30.217
with some questions about square roots.

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:32.074
Square of nine -- three;

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:34.114
square of 256 -- sixteen.

00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:36.002
Too easy.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.448
Then she asked the trick question:

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:41.092
What about the square root
of negative one?

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.452
Of course, we were all over it --

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:44.627
"Come on, Miss!

00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:47.380
We all know you can't take
the square root of a negative."

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:49.856
"That's true in the real world," she said.

00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:52.077
"But in the complex world,

00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:56.333
the square root of negative one
is the imaginary number i."

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.633
(Laughter)
