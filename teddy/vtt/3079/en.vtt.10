00:04:58.013 --> 00:05:00.292
but a fickle population,

00:05:00.316 --> 00:05:03.894
easily manipulated
by whoever can get the most air time.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.076
So what's the solution?

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.860
There are a lot of things we have to do.

00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:11.844
We need curriculum reform.

00:05:11.868 --> 00:05:15.448
We need our best and brightest
encouraged to become teachers.

00:05:15.764 --> 00:05:18.315
We need to put an end to high-stakes tests

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:21.126
and instead follow a mastery-based
learning approach.

00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:24.230
But all these things take time.

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:27.140
And I'm impatient.

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:31.077
See, I've been thinking about this
for eight years now.
