00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.323
For instance, they found
that incentivizing students for inputs,

00:07:05.347 --> 00:07:06.625
like effort,

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:10.022
worked a lot better
than incentivizing for outputs,

00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:11.196
like test scores.

00:07:12.188 --> 00:07:15.720
They found that for younger students,
you could win them over with a trophy

00:07:15.744 --> 00:07:17.276
but for older students,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.879
you really needed cash.

00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:20.252
(Laughter)

00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:22.990
And the amount of cash mattered --
10 dollars was good,

00:07:23.014 --> 00:07:24.747
20 dollars -- even better.

00:07:26.077 --> 00:07:28.109
But perhaps most importantly,

00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:30.688
they found that the rewards
had to be instant
