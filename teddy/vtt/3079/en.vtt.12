00:05:57.212 --> 00:06:01.180
So after years of developing
and refining the application,

00:06:01.204 --> 00:06:04.299
our biggest challenge
was not so much product related,

00:06:04.323 --> 00:06:06.959
our biggest challenge
was motivating students

00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:10.640
to want to work
on their gaps in understanding.

00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:13.870
You can imagine
in today's attention economy,

00:06:13.894 --> 00:06:17.053
we're competing against Facebook,
Snapchat and PlayStation

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:19.081
to try and get these students' time.

00:06:19.982 --> 00:06:21.704
So we went back to the drawing board

00:06:21.728 --> 00:06:24.521
and started to think about
how we could make it worthwhile

00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:28.045
for students to spend
some of their "attention budget"

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:29.336
on their education.
