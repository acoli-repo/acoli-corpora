00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:30.254
(Laughter)

00:01:30.278 --> 00:01:33.221
finding imaginary solutions
to quadratic equations.

00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:34.857
(Laughter)

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:36.897
But then something amazing happened.

00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:39.732
We began finding elegant solutions

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:43.661
to real-world problems
we previously had no answers to,

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:46.799
starting with the complex world
of imaginary numbers.

00:01:47.758 --> 00:01:50.514
So some mathematician 500 years ago

00:01:50.538 --> 00:01:54.641
decides to have some fun
and make up these imaginary numbers,

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:59.649
and because of that we can now
derive these amazing identities

00:01:59.673 --> 00:02:01.457
with applications in the real world,
