00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:31.515
many of the jobs we see today
will either not exist

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.910
or be transformed
to require less routine work

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:37.793
and more analysis
and application of expertise.

00:03:38.474 --> 00:03:40.998
But we're not producing
the extra mathematics students

00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:42.276
to fill these new roles.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.291
This graph shows the number of students

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:46.926
taking Standard Mathematics

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.204
and Advanced Mathematics

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:51.815
over a period of 20 years in Australia.

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:57.252
It's clear that while we have demand
for mathematics skills rapidly increasing,

00:03:57.276 --> 00:04:00.065
supply is in steady decline.
