00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:30.672
around helping students reach
their weekly maths goal,

00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:33.529
effectively ensuring that they get paid

00:11:33.553 --> 00:11:34.703
and not us.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.575
Now you must be wondering:
How is this crazy business model going?

00:11:39.934 --> 00:11:42.426
You'll be glad to know
we're still in business.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.029
We've been testing this now
for the last five months

00:11:45.053 --> 00:11:47.426
on just our personal
home users in Australia

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.117
before we think about
rolling it out to schools.

00:11:50.141 --> 00:11:51.942
And here are the early results.

00:11:52.776 --> 00:11:56.410
The green represents students
who are completing their weekly maths goal

00:11:56.434 --> 00:11:57.863
and the red those who aren't.

00:11:58.315 --> 00:12:01.497
You can see a lot more
completing their homework than not.
