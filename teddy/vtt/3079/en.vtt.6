00:02:57.522 --> 00:03:00.640
Much like I did for that brief
couple of weeks in high school.

00:03:02.768 --> 00:03:05.293
Unfortunately, our school systems --

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.418
we move students through mathematics
in a lockstep process.

00:03:09.442 --> 00:03:11.085
So those who fall a little behind

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.772
find it near impossible to ever catch up
and appreciate that beauty.

00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:17.363
But why is this a problem?

00:03:17.387 --> 00:03:18.632
Why should we care?

00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:20.855
Well today, more than ever,

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.450
our world needs every citizen
to be skilled in mathematics.

00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:28.514
With the advent of artificial
intelligence and automation,

00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:31.515
many of the jobs we see today
will either not exist
