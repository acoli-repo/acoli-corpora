00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:31.401
while it's a way I look
at mathematics now,

00:08:31.425 --> 00:08:34.322
it's only because I studied it
long enough to appreciate it.

00:08:35.038 --> 00:08:38.649
It's very difficult to tell a student
struggling with mathematics today

00:08:38.673 --> 00:08:41.719
to work hard for a payoff
in the distant future.

00:08:42.306 --> 00:08:44.677
And it's not so much bribery
that's at work here,

00:08:44.701 --> 00:08:46.242
because I could bribe students

00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:50.403
by telling them about my big bonuses
in my derivative trading days

00:08:50.427 --> 00:08:52.291
as a reward for doing well at maths.

00:08:52.831 --> 00:08:55.259
But it doesn't pay off
for a very long time.

00:08:55.592 --> 00:08:57.224
So it's practically naught.

00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:01.148
Behavioral economists
call this hyperbolic discounting.
