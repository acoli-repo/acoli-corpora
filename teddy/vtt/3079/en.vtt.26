00:12:58.823 --> 00:13:01.767
It's what helps us to understand
the world around us.

00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:05.045
And the more you know,
the more you want to know.

00:13:05.632 --> 00:13:08.657
So yes, we've triggered initial engagement

00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:10.054
with a financial reward.

00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:12.085
But in the long run,

00:13:12.109 --> 00:13:14.010
the money won't matter anymore.

00:13:14.034 --> 00:13:15.685
Because in the long run,

00:13:15.709 --> 00:13:18.820
the wonder of mathematics
will be the incentive

00:13:18.844 --> 00:13:20.463
and understanding it

00:13:20.487 --> 00:13:21.753
will be the reward.

00:13:22.342 --> 00:13:23.517
Thank you.

00:13:23.541 --> 00:13:28.333
