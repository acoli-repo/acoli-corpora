Whether it be by the government,
by employers or at home.

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:33.365
For instance, many parents
would pay their children

00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:36.190
an allowance or pocket money
for doing chores in the house.

00:09:36.557 --> 00:09:39.041
So it wasn't really
all that controversial.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.129
As I thought about that,

00:09:41.153 --> 00:09:44.875
it started to answer that second question
of how we were going to fund this.

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:48.394
Naturally, parents are the most invested
in their children's education.

00:09:49.075 --> 00:09:52.601
So, let's charge them
a weekly subscription fee

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:54.323
to use our program,

00:09:54.347 --> 00:09:55.641
but --

00:09:55.665 --> 00:09:58.641
if the students complete
their weekly maths goal,

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:03.542
we'll refund the subscription amount
directly into the child's bank account.
