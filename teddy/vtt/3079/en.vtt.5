00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:31.355
But if you ask a student today,

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.323
you'll probably hear a different story.

00:02:33.828 --> 00:02:35.748
You might hear "difficult" and "boring."

00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:38.780
And they might be right about difficult.

00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:41.367
But it's certainly not boring.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.560
In fact, I'd say being difficult to master

00:02:44.584 --> 00:02:46.641
is part of what makes it beautiful.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.358
Because nothing worth doing is easy.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.196
So we need students to stick around
long enough through the difficult parts

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.071
to appreciate the beauty
when it all ties together.

00:02:57.522 --> 00:03:00.640
Much like I did for that brief
couple of weeks in high school.
