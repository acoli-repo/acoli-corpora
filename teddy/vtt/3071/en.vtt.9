00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.280
or even where you live.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.760
And I ask, how might these places
be better designed with you in mind?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.736
It's a really simple question

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.600
and it can somehow, sometimes
be very difficult to answer.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.296
Because we are conditioned
to feel like we don't have much agency

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.416
over the spaces and places
that we live, work and play.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.280
And in many cases we don't.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.160
But we all should.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.160
Now, here's a potentially dumb question
for any women watching:

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.216
Have you ever stood

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.936
in a disproportionately long
bathroom line?

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.456
