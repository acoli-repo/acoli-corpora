to receive that care

People like these are invaluable
ambassadors for design

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.280
and yet they are roundly absent
from architectural discourse.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.256
Similarly, the people who can
most benefit from good design

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.600
often have the least access to it.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.496
Your cousin, a homeless veteran;

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.096
your grandma or grandpa

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.616
who live in a house with a kitchen
that's no longer accessible to them;

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.336
your wheelchair-bound sister

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.160
in a suburban area
planned without sidewalks.
