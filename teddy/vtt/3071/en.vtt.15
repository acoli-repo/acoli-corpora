00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.816
Hundreds of women
come to this place daily --

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.616
to learn new skills,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.016
be in community,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.896
and continue rebuilding their lives

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.640
following the country's civil war.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.056
These women literally pressed

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.136
the 500,000 bricks

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.000
that make up the 17
classroom pavilions like this one.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.376
Antoinette told me,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.080
"Everyone is so proud of it."

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.376
And then back here in the US

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.056
I listened to Monika,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.376
the director of a free clinic
