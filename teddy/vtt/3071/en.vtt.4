00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.000
the messages of that hospital room
stick with she and I to this day.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.816
Those messages are,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.336
"You are not at home,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.176
you are in a foreign place."

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.015
"You are not in control of anything.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.280
Not even the lighting."

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.640
"Your comfort, simply, is secondary."

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.936
At best,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.176
a hospital room like this

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.680
might just be described
or dismissed as uninspiring.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.000
At worst, it is undignifying.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.016
And I use it to point out that none of us,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.616
anywhere in the world,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.320
are immune from bad design.
