is to watch the seconds tick by.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.760
(Laughter)

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.096
An architect by training,
I've always been fascinated

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.136
watching people experience design
in the world around them.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.656
I believe design functions
like the soundtrack

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.840
that we're not even
fully aware is playing.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.016
It sends us subconscious messages
about how to feel

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.400
and what to expect.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.816
That room that we were in
seemed completely misaligned

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.776
with the moment
that we were experiencing --

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.696
welcoming a human being,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.000
our daughter, into this world.
