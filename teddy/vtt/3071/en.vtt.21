00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.080
had made far greater strides
in these crucial areas.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.896
How might our shared built environment --

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.776
our homes, our hospitals,
our schools, our public spaces --

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.056
be shaped differently

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.456
if women and people of color

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.136
were behind half
of the proverbial blueprints?

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.256
It is not a question of whether,

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.976
but to what extent

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.456
our buildings, our landscapes,

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.016
our cities and our rural communities

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.176
are less beautiful, less functional,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.856
less equitable and less dignifying

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.080
because women and people of color
are less likely to be creating them.
