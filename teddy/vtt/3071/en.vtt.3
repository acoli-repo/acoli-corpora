00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.000
our daughter, into this world.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.496
At one point a nurse, without any prompt,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.176
turned to us and said,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.896
"I always think to myself,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.776
'I wish I had become an architect,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.776
because I could have designed
rooms like this better.'"

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.016
I said to her,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.416
"An architect did design this room."

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.176
(Laughter)

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.856
Despite the immense joy
of our daughter's birth,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.000
the messages of that hospital room
stick with she and I to this day.
