Now, in order to do this,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.776
my architecture and design friends,
especially my fellow white guys,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.976
we must simultaneously
and significantly diversify our ranks.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.216
If we want the public to believe
that design is for them

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.616
and for everyone.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.496
Today, barely 15 percent

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.176
of registered architects
in the United States are women.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.320
And a far smaller percentage
are persons of color.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.856
Other professions, like law and medicine

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.080
had made far greater strides
in these crucial areas.
