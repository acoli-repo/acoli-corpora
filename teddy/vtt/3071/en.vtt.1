00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.400
Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.840
the paint on the walls was beige

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.416
and machines beeped inexplicably

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
as a wall clock indicated
day turning to night.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.496
That clock was placed above a door

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.496
in direct line of sight

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.280
to where my wife lay as her contractions
increased hour after hour.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.136
Now, I've never given birth --

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.176
(Laughter)

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.096
but she assured me that the last thing
that a birthing woman would ever want

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.896
is to watch the seconds tick by.
