in a suburban area
planned without sidewalks.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.816
If good design
is only for a privileged few,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.160
what good is it?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.776
It's time designers change this

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.936
by dedicating their practices
to the public good

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.696
in the model of firms

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.416
like Orkidstudio,

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.856

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.736
and MASS Design Group.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.136
Their clients

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.736
are orphaned children in Kenya,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.256
foster children in Chicago

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.200
and pregnant women in Malawi.
