After one of our
conversations about design,

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.576
she wrote me a letter.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.280
She said, "Dear Johnny,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.016
I thought the other day,
as I sat in my doctor's office,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.296
how depressing it was,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.936
from the color on the wall,
to the carpet on the floor.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.096
(Laughter)

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.896
Now I will have to call to see

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.576
who is responsible
for the drabness in that place."

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.736
(Laughter)

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.656
In the same letter, mind you, she said,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.856
"I did call, and I got the man in charge,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.496
and he said he appreciated
someone calling him.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.896
My doctor's office
is now on the list for an upgrade."
