00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.456
On a beautiful day, just a few years ago

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.896
my wife and I entered a hospital

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.696
near our home in Oakland, California

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.960
for the birth of our first daughter, Maya.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.256
We had responsibly toured
the birthing center in advance

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.216
and yet we were somehow
still startled to find ourselves

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.096
in the place where we would experience

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.640
one of the most significant
moments of our lives.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.776
We were stuck in a windowless room

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.200
with no hint of the bright
and sunny day that we had left.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.400
Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead,
