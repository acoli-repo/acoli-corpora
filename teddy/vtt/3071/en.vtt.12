Over the past two years

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.816
I had the opportunity to interview
over 100 people from all walks of life

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.176
about their experience of design.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.416
I wanted to test my hunch

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.280
that dignity and design
are uniquely related.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.736
I listened to Gregory,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.976
a resident of this cottage community

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.816
designed specifically

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.696
for the 50 most chronically
homeless people in Dallas.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.456
Gregory had been living on the streets,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.360
drifting from town to town
for over 30 years.
