don't confuse me with that.

00:06:00.417 --> 00:06:04.584
But what I am saying is that we need
to look at the bigger picture.

00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:08.045
If you are within the sound of my voice,

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.519
I want you to close your eyes for a moment

00:06:10.543 --> 00:06:13.172
and examine your own social circle.

00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:15.536
Who are your foreign-born?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.874
What would it feel like
if the circle were broken?

00:06:20.488 --> 00:06:21.833
Share your story.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.174
I'm building a global archive
of first-person accounts

00:06:25.198 --> 00:06:27.459
and linking them with mapping technology,

00:06:27.483 --> 00:06:31.387
so that we can see exactly
where these circles break,
