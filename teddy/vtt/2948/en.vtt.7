00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:30.821
technologists, scientists, doctors,

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:34.563
who are all scrambling
to make sense of new realities

00:03:34.587 --> 00:03:37.019
when their social circles are broken.

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:41.540
These are the real lives
behind all these statistics

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:44.012
that dominate discussions
about immigration policy.

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:45.997
But we don't often think about them.

00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:47.534
And I'm trying to change that.

00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:51.874
Here's just one of the real-life stories
that I've collected.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.918
And it still haunts me.

00:03:54.482 --> 00:03:58.227
I met Ramon and his son in 2016,

00:03:58.251 --> 00:04:01.787
the same year both of them
were being ordered out of the country.
