The social circle is what's key here.

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:35.384
Here's another example
that illustrates those critical bonds.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.746
A group of citizens in Philadelphia
were concerned about their jobs,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.761
because the legal owner
of the restaurant where they worked

00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:43.525
was an undocumented immigrant,

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.825
and immigration officials
had picked him up.

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:47.561
They rallied behind him.

00:04:47.585 --> 00:04:49.008
An immigration lawyer argued

00:04:49.032 --> 00:04:51.206
he was too important
to the local community

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.678
to be deported.

00:04:52.702 --> 00:04:56.760
At the hearing, they even submitted
restaurant reviews --

00:04:56.784 --> 00:04:58.053
restaurant reviews!

00:04:58.645 --> 00:05:03.313
In the end, a judge exercised
what's called "judicial discretion"
