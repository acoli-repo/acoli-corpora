00:05:27.438 --> 00:05:30.343
about 100 million individuals

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:33.466
whose lives could be impacted
by deportation.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.663
And the stress of it all is trickling down
through the population.

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:40.962
A 2017 poll by UCLA of LA County residents

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:44.759
found that 30 percent
of citizens in LA County

00:05:44.783 --> 00:05:47.104
are stressed about deportation,

00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:50.104
not because they themselves
could be removed,

00:05:50.128 --> 00:05:54.869
but rather, because members
of their social circle were at risk.

00:05:55.823 --> 00:05:58.518
I am not suggesting that no one
should ever be deported;

00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:00.393
don't confuse me with that.
