00:06:58.546 --> 00:07:00.450
all those decades ago,

00:07:00.474 --> 00:07:02.072
when I was scared,

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:04.727
and I had just spotted that green lady.

00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:09.730
And I guess the question
that I keep on thinking about

00:07:09.754 --> 00:07:11.006

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.290
and all the younger replicas of her
that are so obviously brown,

00:07:15.314 --> 00:07:18.127
and even the paintings
that showcase her in the beginning

00:07:18.151 --> 00:07:20.257
as not quite green --

00:07:21.532 --> 00:07:23.239
when I look at all of that,

00:07:24.038 --> 00:07:27.386
the question that my research
seeks to answer

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.707
becomes, to me, the same one
that confounded me all those years ago:
