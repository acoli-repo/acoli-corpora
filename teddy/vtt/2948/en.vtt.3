00:01:28.568 --> 00:01:30.455
at least two are foreign-born.

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:34.851
My life as a US citizen is in many ways
shaped by newcomers,

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:36.034
and chances are,

00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:37.510
so is yours.

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:41.187
There are more than 40 million
immigrants in the USA.

00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:42.721
According to census data,

00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:47.407
a quarter of the nation's children
have at least one foreign-born parent.

00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:52.542
I know all these statistics
because I study global migration patterns.

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.728
I'm a journalist,
and for the last few years,

00:01:54.752 --> 00:01:57.159
I've been documenting
the lives of US citizens

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.111
who've lost people to deportation.

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:01.438
And the numbers are enormous.
