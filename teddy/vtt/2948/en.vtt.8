the same year both of them
were being ordered out of the country.

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.349
Ramon was being deported to Latin America,

00:04:06.373 --> 00:04:09.698
while his son, who was a sergeant
in the US military,

00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:11.291
was being deployed.

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:13.798
Deported ...

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:15.679
deployed.

00:04:16.308 --> 00:04:19.294
If you just look at Ramon's case,

00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:22.586
it wouldn't be clear how deeply
connected to the country he is.

00:04:23.307 --> 00:04:24.627
But consider his son:

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.982
a US citizen defending a country
that's banished his father.

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:31.382
The social circle is what's key here.
