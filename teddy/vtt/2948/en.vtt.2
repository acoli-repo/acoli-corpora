00:00:59.403 --> 00:01:02.555
The Green Lady was actually brown,

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:04.555
brown like me,

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.045
and that she changed
colors over the years,

00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:09.238
much like America.

00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:14.556
Now, the part that really
is intriguing about this

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.211
is that when she changed colors,

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:17.976
she made me think about myself.

00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:19.876
It all made sense to me,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.897
because as a first-generation American,

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:23.398
I was surrounded by immigrants.

00:01:23.422 --> 00:01:27.232
In fact, within my immediate social circle
of the people who support me,

00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:28.544
who enrich my life,

00:01:28.568 --> 00:01:30.455
at least two are foreign-born.
