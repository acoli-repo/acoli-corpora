A toothpaste brand claims
their product will destroy more plaque

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.910
than any product ever made.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.411
A politician tells you their plan
will create the most jobs.

00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:18.951
We're so used to hearing these
kinds of exaggerations

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:20.850
in advertising and politics

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.131
that we might not even bat an eye.

00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.111
But what about when the claim
is accompanied by a graph?

00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:28.471
Afterall, a graph isn't an opinion.

00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:32.611
It represents cold, hard numbers,
and who can argue with those?
