00:00:01.825 --> 00:00:03.448
Thank you so much.

00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:06.842
It's really scary to be here
among the smartest of the smart.

00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:07.868
(Laughter)

00:00:07.892 --> 00:00:10.780
I'm here to tell you
a few tales of passion.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.276
There's a Jewish saying that I love:

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.692
What is truer than truth?

00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:19.636
Answer: the story.

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:22.347
I'm a storyteller.

00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:26.063
I want to convey something
that is truer than truth

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:27.933
about our common humanity.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.325
All stories interest me,
