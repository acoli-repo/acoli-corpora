00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.636
where we're looking at other forms of waste

00:07:00.636 --> 00:07:02.121
that could be lessened

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:04.854
from manufacturing and industrial sources.

00:07:04.854 --> 00:07:08.859
Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,

00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:12.857
accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.

00:07:12.857 --> 00:07:15.244
It's a remarkable statistic.

00:07:15.244 --> 00:07:17.722
So in the flow of your days,

00:07:17.722 --> 00:07:19.248
in the flow of your lives,

00:07:19.248 --> 00:07:22.276
next time you see someone whose job is

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:25.419
to clean up after you,

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.908
take a moment to acknowledge them.

00:07:27.908 --> 00:07:32.500
Take a moment to say thank you.
