00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:31.478
looking over a crystal, beautiful lake,

00:00:31.478 --> 00:00:34.174
when I discovered a horror.

00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:37.272
Behind the lean-to was a dump,

00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:38.730
maybe 40 feet square

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.043
with rotting apple cores

00:00:41.043 --> 00:00:42.790
and balled-up aluminum foil,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.539
and a dead sneaker.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.110
And I was astonished,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.542
I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:52.124
The campers who were too lazy

00:00:52.124 --> 00:00:54.082
to take out what they had brought in,

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:57.927
who did they think would clean up after them?

00:00:57.927 --> 00:00:59.836
That question stayed with me,

00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:01.803
and it simplified a little.
