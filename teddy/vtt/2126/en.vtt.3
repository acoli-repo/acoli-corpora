00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:31.358
I wanted to understand who takes the job.

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:33.877
What's it like to wear the uniform

00:01:33.877 --> 00:01:35.531
and bear that burden?

00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:38.184
So I started a research project with them.

00:01:38.184 --> 00:01:40.723
I rode in the trucks and walked the routes

00:01:40.723 --> 00:01:43.132
and interviewed people in offices and facilities

00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:44.639
all over the city,

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:46.378
and I learned a lot,

00:01:46.378 --> 00:01:48.727
but I was still an outsider.

00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:50.605
I needed to go deeper.

00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:53.721
So I took the job as a sanitation worker.

00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:56.368
I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.

00:01:56.368 --> 00:01:59.513
And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.

00:01:59.513 --> 00:02:01.412
It was a remarkable privilege
