00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:31.206
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,

00:02:31.206 --> 00:02:33.408
sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous

00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:35.300
occupations in the country,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.051
and I learned why.

00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:38.472
You're in and out of traffic all day,

00:02:38.472 --> 00:02:39.433
and it's zooming around you.

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.317
It just wants to get past you, so it's often

00:02:41.317 --> 00:02:43.367
the motorist is not paying attention.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:45.193
That's really bad for the worker.

00:02:45.193 --> 00:02:47.353
And then the garbage itself is full of hazards

00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:49.372
that often fly back out of the truck

00:02:49.372 --> 00:02:51.453
and do terrible harm.

00:02:51.453 --> 00:02:54.268
I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.

00:02:54.268 --> 00:02:55.579
When you step off the curb

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.428
and you see a city from behind a truck,

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.214
you come to understand that trash
