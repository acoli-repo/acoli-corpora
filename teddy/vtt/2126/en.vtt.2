00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:01.803
and it simplified a little.

00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:04.179
Who cleans up after us?

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:05.601
However you configure

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.308
or wherever you place the us,

00:01:07.308 --> 00:01:09.898
who cleans up after us in Istanbul?

00:01:09.898 --> 00:01:12.154
Who cleans up after us in Rio

00:01:12.154 --> 00:01:14.683
or in Paris or in London?

00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:16.255
Here in New York,

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:18.847
the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,

00:01:18.847 --> 00:01:21.517
to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage

00:01:21.517 --> 00:01:25.879
and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:28.512
I wanted to get to know them as individuals.

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:31.358
I wanted to understand who takes the job.
