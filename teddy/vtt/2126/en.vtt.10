00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:00.022
and bring them into this conversation

00:05:00.022 --> 00:05:05.612
of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.

00:05:05.612 --> 00:05:09.773
Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical.

00:05:09.773 --> 00:05:12.234
They're on the streets every day, rhythmically.

00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:14.295
They wear a uniform in many cities.

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:16.164
You know when to expect them.

00:05:16.164 --> 00:05:20.087
And their work lets us do our work.

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:22.878
They are almost a form of reassurance.

00:05:22.878 --> 00:05:24.615
The flow that they maintain

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.605
keeps us safe from ourselves,

00:05:26.605 --> 00:05:29.242
from our own dross, our cast-offs,

00:05:29.242 --> 00:05:32.500
and that flow must be maintained always
