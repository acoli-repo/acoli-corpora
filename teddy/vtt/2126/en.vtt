00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:02.572
I was about 10 years old

00:00:02.572 --> 00:00:04.271
on a camping trip with my dad

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:07.031
in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area

00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:10.026
in the northern part of New York State.

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:11.467
It was a beautiful day.

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:13.469
The forest was sparkling.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.993
The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,

00:00:16.993 --> 00:00:20.198
and if it weren't for the path we were following,

00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:21.602
we could almost pretend we were

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:25.164
the first human beings to ever walk that land.

00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:26.815
We got to our campsite.

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:28.782
It was a lean-to on a bluff

00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:31.478
looking over a crystal, beautiful lake,
