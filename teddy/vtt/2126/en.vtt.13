00:06:28.482 --> 00:06:32.275
all the costs, including the very real human cost

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:33.779
of the labor.

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.580
And we also would be well informed

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.798
to reach out to the people who do that work

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.643
and get their expertise

00:06:40.643 --> 00:06:42.396
on how do we think about,

00:06:42.396 --> 00:06:45.646
how do we create systems around sustainability

00:06:45.646 --> 00:06:49.125
that perhaps take us from curbside recycling,

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:51.710
which is a remarkable success across 40 years,

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.948
across the United States and countries around the world,

00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:57.750
and lift us up to a broader horizon

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.636
where we're looking at other forms of waste
