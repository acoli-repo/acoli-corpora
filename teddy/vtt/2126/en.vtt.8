00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:01.322
Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries

00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:04.228
burst forth again and start to harm us.

00:04:04.228 --> 00:04:05.900
The economy needs them.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.826
If we can't throw out the old stuff,

00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:10.716
we have no room for the new stuff,

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:12.785
so then the engines of the economy

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:15.714
start to sputter when consumption is compromised.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:19.778
I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.

00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:21.766
And then there's what I call

00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:25.978
our average, necessary quotidian velocity.

00:04:25.978 --> 00:04:27.027
By that I simply mean

00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:29.279
how fast we're used to moving

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.411
in the contemporary day and age.
