00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.214
you come to understand that trash

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:02.831
is like a force of nature unto itself.

00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:05.287
It never stops coming.

00:03:05.287 --> 00:03:08.766
It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:11.811
It must always be in motion.

00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:13.859
And then there's the stigma.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.775
You put on the uniform, and you become invisible

00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:19.079
until someone is upset with you for whatever reason

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.394
like you've blocked traffic with your truck,

00:03:21.394 --> 00:03:24.045
or you're taking a break too close to their home,

00:03:24.045 --> 00:03:27.159
or you're drinking coffee in their diner,

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.569
and they will come and scorn you,

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.831
and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.
