00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.411
in the contemporary day and age.

00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:36.755
We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:39.392
our coffee cup, our shopping bag,

00:04:39.392 --> 00:04:40.877
our bottle of water.

00:04:40.877 --> 00:04:43.556
We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,

00:04:43.556 --> 00:04:45.336
because we know there's a workforce

00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:48.356
on the other side that's going to take it all away.

00:04:48.356 --> 00:04:50.803
So I want to suggest today a couple of ways

00:04:50.803 --> 00:04:55.317
to think about sanitation that will perhaps help

00:04:55.317 --> 00:04:57.791
ameliorate the stigma

00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:00.022
and bring them into this conversation
