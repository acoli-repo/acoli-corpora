00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.376
even in a .8-mile stretch.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.936
CA: Whoa. Good brakes.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.216
EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.856
It's either going to smash
into tiny pieces or go quite fast.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.456
CA: But you can picture,
then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.296
running quite long distances.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.016
EM: Exactly.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.816
And looking at tunneling technology,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.376
it turns out that
in order to make a tunnel,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.600
you have to --

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.696
In order to seal against the water table,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.376
you've got to typically design
a tunnel wall to be good
