00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.776
So it was quite fun to do that,
but it was kind of a hobby thing,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.496
and then we think we might --

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.880
so we've built a little pusher car
to push the student pods,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.376
but we're going to try seeing
how fast we can make the pusher go

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.829
if it's not pushing something.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.056
So we're cautiously optimistic

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.096
we'll be able to be faster
than the world's fastest bullet train

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.376
even in a .8-mile stretch.
