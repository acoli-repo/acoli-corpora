00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.816
and then the rest of the time
is putting in reinforcements

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.136
for the tunnel wall.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.376
So if you design the machine instead

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.736
to do continuous
tunneling and reinforcing,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.976
that will give you
a factor of two improvement.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.216
Combine that and that's a factor of eight.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.896
Also these machines are far from being
at their power or thermal limits,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.976
so you can jack up the power
to the machine substantially.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.136
I think you can get
at least a factor of two,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.336
maybe a factor of four or five
improvement on top of that.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.576
So I think there's a fairly
straightforward series of steps
