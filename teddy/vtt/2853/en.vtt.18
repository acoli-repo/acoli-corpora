00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.296
what kind of length tunnel
is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.536
EM: I think there's no real length limit.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.576
You could dig as much as you want.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.816
I think if you were to do something

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:15.016
like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.896
I think you'd probably want
to go underground the entire way

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.536
because it's a high-density area.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.616
You're going under
a lot of buildings and houses,

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.176
and if you go deep enough,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.576
you cannot detect the tunnel.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.536
Sometimes people think,
well, it's going to be pretty annoying
