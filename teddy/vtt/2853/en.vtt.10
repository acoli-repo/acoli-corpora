00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.576
So I think there's a fairly
straightforward series of steps

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.576
to get somewhere in excess
of an order of magnitude improvement

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.336
in the cost per mile,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.296
and our target actually is --

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.136
we've got a pet snail called Gary,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.696
this is from Gary the snail
from "South Park,"

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.656
I mean, sorry, "SpongeBob SquarePants."

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.256
(Laughter)

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.696
So Gary is capable of --

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.816
currently he's capable
of going 14 times faster

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.616
than a tunnel-boring machine.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.416
(Laughter)
