00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.616
EM: Yeah, it's looking quite good
for starting production in July.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.016
CA: Wow.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.416
One of the things
that people are so excited about

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.656
is the fact that it's got autopilot.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.016
And you put out this video a while back

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.376
showing what that technology
would look like.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.616
EM: Yeah.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.126
CA: There's obviously autopilot
in Model S right now.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.536
What are we seeing here?

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:57.576
EM: Yeah, so this is using
only cameras and GPS.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.096
So there's no LIDAR
or radar being used here.
