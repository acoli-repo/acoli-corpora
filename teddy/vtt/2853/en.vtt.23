A lot of people think
that when you make cars autonomous,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.976
they'll be able to go faster
and that will alleviate congestion.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.896
And to some degree that will be true,

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.976
but once you have shared autonomy
where it's much cheaper to go by car

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.440
and you can go point to point,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:50.096
the affordability of going in a car
will be better than that of a bus.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.336
Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.416
So the amount of driving that will occur
will be much greater with shared autonomy,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.296
and actually traffic will get far worse.
