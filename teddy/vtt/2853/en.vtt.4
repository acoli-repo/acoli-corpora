00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.296
in six minutes -- five, six minutes.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.656
(Applause)

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.256
CA: So possibly, initially done,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.576
it's like on a sort
of toll road-type basis.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.816
EM: Yeah.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.896
CA: Which, I guess,
alleviates some traffic

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.616
from the surface streets as well.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.256
EM: So, I don't know
if people noticed it in the video,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.416
but there's no real limit
to how many levels of tunnel you can have.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.256
You can go much further deep
than you can go up.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.456
The deepest mines are much deeper
than the tallest buildings are tall,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.736
so you can alleviate any arbitrary
level of urban congestion
