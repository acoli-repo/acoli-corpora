00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.376
you've got to typically design
a tunnel wall to be good

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.720
to about five or six atmospheres.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.176
So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.616
or near-vacuum.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.056
So actually, it sort of turns out
that automatically,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.056
if you build a tunnel that is good enough
to resist the water table,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.496
it is automatically
capable of holding vacuum.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.136
CA: Huh.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.696
EM: So, yeah.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.576
CA: And so you could actually picture,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.296
what kind of length tunnel
is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?
