(Laughter)

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.296
CA: I think you've brought with you

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.775
the first visualization
that's been shown of this.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.136
Can I show this?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.856
EM: Yeah, absolutely.
So this is the first time --

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.736
Just to show what we're talking about.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.896
So a couple of key things
that are important

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.816
in having a 3D tunnel network.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.456
First of all, you have to be able

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.736
to integrate the entrance
and exit of the tunnel

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.816
seamlessly into the fabric of the city.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.496
So by having an elevator,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.296
sort of a car skate,
that's on an elevator,
