00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.016
EM: Yeah.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.256
Well, they're right.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.056
To give you an example,
the LA subway extension,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.736
which is -- I think it's
a two-and-a-half mile extension

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.999
that was just completed
for two billion dollars.

00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:17.416
So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile
to do the subway extension in LA.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.416
And this is not the highest
utility subway in the world.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.936
So yeah, it's quite difficult
to dig tunnels normally.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.136
I think we need to have
at least a tenfold improvement

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.480
in the cost per mile of tunneling.
