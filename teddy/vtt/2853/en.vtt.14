Could you apply these tunnels
to use for this Hyperloop idea

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.221
you released a few years ago.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.056
EM: Yeah, so we've been
sort of puttering around

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.696
with the Hyperloop stuff for a while.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.536
We built a Hyperloop test track
adjacent to SpaceX,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.696
just for a student competition,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.736
to encourage innovative
ideas in transport.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.776
And it actually ends up being
the biggest vacuum chamber in the world

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.720
after the Large Hadron Collider,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.000
by volume.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.776
So it was quite fun to do that,
but it was kind of a hobby thing,
