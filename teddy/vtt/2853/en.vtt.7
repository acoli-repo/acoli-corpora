00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.480
in the cost per mile of tunneling.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.840
CA: And how could you achieve that?

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.296
EM: Actually, if you just do two things,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.656
you can get to approximately
an order of magnitude improvement,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.856
and I think you can go beyond that.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.136
So the first thing to do
is to cut the tunnel diameter

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.776
by a factor of two or more.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.776
So a single road lane tunnel
according to regulations

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.656
has to be 26 feet,
maybe 28 feet in diameter

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.856
to allow for crashes
and emergency vehicles

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.136
and sufficient ventilation
for combustion engine cars.
