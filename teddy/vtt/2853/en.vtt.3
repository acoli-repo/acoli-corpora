00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.296
sort of a car skate,
that's on an elevator,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.256
you can integrate the entrance
and exits to the tunnel network

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.520
just by using two parking spaces.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.936
And then the car gets on a skate.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.336
There's no speed limit here,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.376
so we're designing this to be able
to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.616
CA: How much?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.960
EM: 200 kilometers an hour,
or about 130 miles per hour.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.016
So you should be able
to get from, say, Westwood to LAX

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.296
in six minutes -- five, six minutes.
