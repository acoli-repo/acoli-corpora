00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.416
(Laughter)

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.216
CA: You want to beat Gary.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.536
EM: We want to beat Gary.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.096
(Laughter)

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.336
He's not a patient little fellow,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.456
and that will be victory.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.880
Victory is beating the snail.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.336
CA: But a lot of people imagining,
dreaming about future cities,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.256
they imagine that actually
the solution is flying cars, drones, etc.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.496
You go aboveground.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.336
Why isn't that a better solution?

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.336
You save all that tunneling cost.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.576
EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.
