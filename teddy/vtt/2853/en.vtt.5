00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.736
so you can alleviate any arbitrary
level of urban congestion

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.056
with a 3D tunnel network.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.616
This is a very important point.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.016
So a key rebuttal to the tunnels
is that if you add one layer of tunnels,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.816
that will simply alleviate congestion,
it will get used up,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.136
and then you'll be back where you started,
back with congestion.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.576
But you can go to any
arbitrary number of tunnels,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.936
any number of levels.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.496
CA: But people -- seen traditionally,
it's incredibly expensive to dig,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.296
and that would block this idea.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.016
EM: Yeah.
