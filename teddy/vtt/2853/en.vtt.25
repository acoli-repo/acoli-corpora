00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.256
I think almost every automaker
has some electric vehicle program.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.536
They vary in seriousness.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.856
Some are very serious
about transitioning entirely to electric,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.240
and some are just dabbling in it.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.696
And some, amazingly,
are still pursuing fuel cells,

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.856
but I think that won't last much longer.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.936
CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.656
where you can now just declare victory
and say, you know, "We did it."

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.760
Let the world electrify,
and you go on and focus on other stuff?
