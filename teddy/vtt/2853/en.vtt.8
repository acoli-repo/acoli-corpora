00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.136
and sufficient ventilation
for combustion engine cars.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.736
But if you shrink that diameter
to what we're attempting,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.416
which is 12 feet, which is plenty
to get an electric skate through,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.656
you drop the diameter by a factor of two

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.576
and the cross-sectional area
by a factor of four,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.456
and the tunneling cost scales
with the cross-sectional area.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.696
So that's roughly a half-order
of magnitude improvement right there.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.616
Then tunneling machines currently tunnel
for half the time, then they stop,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.816
and then the rest of the time
is putting in reinforcements
