It strikes me that we talk very deeply about design,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.556
but actually there's an economics behind architecture

00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:05.024
that we don't talk about, and I think we need to.

And a good place to start is your own paycheck.

00:01:08.655 --> 00:01:11.097
So, as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate,

00:01:11.097 --> 00:01:14.073
I might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:17.689

which raises the question of, who is it I'm working for?

00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:30.747
The uncomfortable fact is that
