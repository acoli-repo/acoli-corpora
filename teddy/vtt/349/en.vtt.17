00:08:27.701 --> 00:08:30.160
onto which you can then apply systems like windows

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.218
and cladding and insulation and services

00:08:32.218 --> 00:08:35.267
based on what's cheap and what's available.

00:08:35.267 --> 00:08:37.452
Of course, the house is never finished.

00:08:37.452 --> 00:08:40.333
We're shifting our heads here, so the house is not a finished product.

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:43.090
With the CNC machine, you can make new parts for it

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.947
over its life or even use it to make the house next door.

00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:50.385
So we can begin to see the seed of a completely open-source,

00:08:50.385 --> 00:08:54.660
citizen-led urban development model, potentially.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.210
And we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now,

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.331
and some really interesting lessons here.
