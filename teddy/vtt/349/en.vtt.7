00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:31.222
And instead of having one school bell that goes off once,

00:03:31.222 --> 00:03:33.480
have several smaller school bells that go off

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.728
in different places and different times,

00:03:35.728 --> 00:03:37.976
distribute the traffic through the corridors."

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:39.393
It solves the same problem,

00:03:39.393 --> 00:03:42.201
but instead of spending several million pounds,

00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:44.344
you spend several hundred pounds.

00:03:44.344 --> 00:03:47.144
Now, it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job,

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:49.705
but you're not. You're actually making yourself more useful.

00:03:49.705 --> 00:03:51.178
Architects are actually really, really good

00:03:51.178 --> 00:03:53.520
at this kind of resourceful, strategic thinking.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.482
And the problem is that, like a lot of design professions,

00:03:55.482 --> 00:03:57.665
we got fixated on the idea of providing

00:03:57.665 --> 00:03:59.946
a particular kind of consumer product,

00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:02.416
and I don't think that needs to be the case anymore.
