00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:31.196
I think the challenge facing the next generation of architects

00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:33.238
is, how are we going to turn our client

00:02:33.238 --> 00:02:36.859
from the one percent to the 100 percent?

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.433
And I want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:42.275
for how it might be done.

00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:45.657
The first is, I think we need to question this idea

00:02:45.657 --> 00:02:47.948
that architecture is about making buildings.

00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:50.692
Actually, a building is about the most expensive solution

00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:53.708
you can think of to almost any given problem.

00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:56.236
And fundamentally, design should be much, much more interested

00:02:56.236 --> 00:02:58.968
in solving problems and creating new conditions.

00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:00.490
So here's a story.
