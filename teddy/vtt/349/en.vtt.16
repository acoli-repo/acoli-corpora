00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:02.456
And a team of about two or three people,

00:08:02.456 --> 00:08:04.495
working together, can build this.

00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:06.975
They don't need any traditional construction skills.

00:08:06.975 --> 00:08:10.126
They don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that,

00:08:10.126 --> 00:08:12.639
and they can build a small house of about this size

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:17.403
in about a day.

00:08:17.403 --> 00:08:24.680
(Applause)

00:08:24.706 --> 00:08:27.701
And what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house

00:08:27.701 --> 00:08:30.160
onto which you can then apply systems like windows
