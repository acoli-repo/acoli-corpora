00:10:58.542 --> 00:11:02.638
They're self-made cities in one form or another.

00:11:02.638 --> 00:11:06.262
If we're talking about the 21st-century city,

00:11:06.262 --> 00:11:08.886
these are the guys who are going to be making it.

00:11:08.886 --> 00:11:13.368
You know, like it or not, welcome to the world's biggest design team.

00:11:13.368 --> 00:11:15.494
So if we're serious about problems

00:11:15.494 --> 00:11:19.648
like climate change, urbanization and health,

00:11:19.648 --> 00:11:23.546
actually, our existing development models aren't going to do it.

00:11:23.546 --> 00:11:25.634
As I think Robert Neuwirth said, there isn't a bank

00:11:25.634 --> 00:11:28.411
or a corporation or a government or an NGO

00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:29.797
who's going to be able to do it

00:11:29.797 --> 00:11:33.446
if we treat citizens only as consumers.
