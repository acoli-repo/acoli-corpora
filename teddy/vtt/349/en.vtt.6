00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:00.490
So here's a story.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.088
The office was working with a school,

00:03:02.088 --> 00:03:04.514
and they had an old Victorian school building.

00:03:04.514 --> 00:03:07.245
And they said to the architects, "Look,

00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:09.198
our corridors are an absolute nightmare.

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.890
but we're reconciled to the fact."

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.596
And the team thought about this, and they went away,

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:25.613
and they said, "Actually, don't do that.

00:03:25.613 --> 00:03:28.393
Instead, get rid of the school bell.

00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:31.222
And instead of having one school bell that goes off once,
