00:05:58.547 --> 00:06:02.593
that anyone can download and make for themselves.

00:06:02.593 --> 00:06:05.834
And that's where 3D printing gets really, really interesting.

00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:09.370
Right? When suddenly you had a 3D printer

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.924
that was open-source, the parts for which

00:06:10.924 --> 00:06:13.205
could be made on another 3D printer.

00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:16.266
Or the same idea here, which is for a CNC machine,

00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:20.762
which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood.

00:06:20.762 --> 00:06:23.576
What these technologies are doing is radically

00:06:23.576 --> 00:06:26.657
lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill.

00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:28.239
They're challenging the idea that

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:32.065
if you want something to be affordable it's got to be one-size-fits-all.
