00:04:28.213 --> 00:04:30.432
form follows finance.

00:04:30.432 --> 00:04:33.456
So what you end up with are single, monolithic neighborhoods

00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:37.144
based on this kind of one-size-fits-all model.

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:39.657
And a lot of people can't even afford them.

00:04:39.657 --> 00:04:42.624
But what if, actually, it's possible now for cities

00:04:42.624 --> 00:04:45.394
to be made not just by the few with a lot

00:04:45.394 --> 00:04:48.582
but also by the many with a bit?

00:04:48.582 --> 00:04:49.876
And when they do, they bring with them

00:04:49.876 --> 00:04:53.215
a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live.

00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:55.319
And it raises really interesting questions about,

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.602
how will we plan cities? How will finance development?

00:04:58.602 --> 00:05:00.263
How will we sell design services?
