00:11:29.797 --> 00:11:33.446
if we treat citizens only as consumers.

00:11:33.446 --> 00:11:37.227
How extraordinary would it be, though, if collectively

00:11:37.227 --> 00:11:39.500
we were to develop solutions not just to the problem

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.914
of structure that we've been working on,

00:11:41.914 --> 00:11:46.634
but to infrastructure problems like solar-powered air conditioning,

00:11:46.634 --> 00:11:49.450
off-grid energy, off-grid sanitation --

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.379
low-cost, open-source, high-performance solutions

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.319
that anyone can very, very easily make,

00:11:55.319 --> 00:11:57.220
and to put them all into a commons

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.568
where they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone?
