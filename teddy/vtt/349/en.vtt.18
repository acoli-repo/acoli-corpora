00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.331
and some really interesting lessons here.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.658
One of them is that it's always incredibly sociable.

00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:07.356
People get confused between construction work and having fun.

00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:10.015
But the principles of openness go right down

00:09:10.015 --> 00:09:12.821
into the really mundane, physical details.

00:09:12.821 --> 00:09:15.824
Like, never designing a piece that can't be lifted up.

00:09:15.824 --> 00:09:17.123
Or, when you're designing a piece,

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:20.003
make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round,

00:09:20.003 --> 00:09:22.956
or, if you do, it doesn't matter, because it's symmetrical.

00:09:22.956 --> 00:09:26.998
Probably the principal which runs deepest with us

00:09:26.998 --> 00:09:29.953
is the principal set out by Linus Torvalds,

00:09:29.953 --> 00:09:32.678
the open-source pioneer,
