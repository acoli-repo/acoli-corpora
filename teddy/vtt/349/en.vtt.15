they can generate a set of cutting files

00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:34.872
which allow them, in effect,

00:07:34.872 --> 00:07:38.060

and a standard sheet material like plywood.

00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:44.391

can be provided on the cutting sheets as well.

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:02.456
And a team of about two or three people,
