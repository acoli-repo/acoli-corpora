00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:31.938
to set up a kind of community factory

00:10:31.938 --> 00:10:33.852
and micro-university.

00:10:33.852 --> 00:10:35.716
These are very, very small beginnings,

00:10:35.716 --> 00:10:38.591
and actually there's more people in the last week

00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:40.774
who have got in touch and they're not even on this map.

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:44.514
I hope next time you see it, you won't even be able to see the map.

00:10:44.514 --> 00:10:48.963
We're aware that WikiHouse is a very, very small answer,

00:10:48.963 --> 00:10:52.535
but it's a small answer to a really, really big question,

00:10:52.535 --> 00:10:56.311
which is that globally, right now, the fastest-growing cities

00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:58.542
are not skyscraper cities.

00:10:58.542 --> 00:11:02.638
They're self-made cities in one form or another.
