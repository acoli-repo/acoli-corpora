A kind of Wikipedia for stuff?

00:12:05.738 --> 00:12:07.779
And once something's in the commons,

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:09.135
it will always be there.

00:12:09.135 --> 00:12:12.663
How much would that change the rules?

00:12:12.663 --> 00:12:16.099
And I think the technology's on our side.

00:12:16.099 --> 00:12:19.759

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:23.520

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:29.946
that was Henry Ford, Levittown, Coca-Cola, IKEA —

00:12:29.946 --> 00:12:33.568
I think design's great project in the 21st century
