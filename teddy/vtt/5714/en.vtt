Simone Ross: Jack, I would love you
to tell us what Esri is

00:00:03.485 --> 00:00:06.841
and also why GIS is so important.

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:09.333
Jack Dangermond: So it is a company,

00:00:09.357 --> 00:00:12.741
it builds software products
that are used by millions of people.

00:00:13.654 --> 00:00:16.136
Kind of like a platform technology,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.644
but not literally platform.

00:00:18.668 --> 00:00:22.185
It builds tools that help people
do their work better.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.783
And that's a very general statement,

00:00:24.807 --> 00:00:29.624
but helps them do their work better
using geography as a science

00:00:29.648 --> 00:00:33.483
and visualization
as a science and technology
