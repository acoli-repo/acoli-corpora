00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So it's 1995,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm in college,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and a friend and I go on a road trip

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
from Providence, Rhode Island

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to Portland, Oregon.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And you know, we're young and unemployed,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so we do the whole thing on back roads

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
through state parks

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and national forests --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
basically the longest route we can possibly take.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I turn to my friend
