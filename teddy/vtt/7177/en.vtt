Four years ago, something profound
happened in my life.

00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:07.662
I saw the fear and mental effects
of racism, hate crimes and Islamaphobia

00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:09.336
was having on my community.

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.001
I'm an American Muslim
of Nigerian descent,

00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:13.210
and growing up,

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.780
my parents instilled in me
the importance of community

00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:17.095
and serving others.

00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:21.114
My mom is fond of an African proverb
from my Yoruba tribe which states,

00:00:21.138 --> 00:00:24.191
(In Yoruba) “Ènìyàn kan lon bímọ,
gbogbo ayé lon tọ́ ọmọ,”

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:27.481
which translated means, "a single
person gives birth to a child,

00:00:27.505 --> 00:00:29.736
but every other person
looks after the child."
