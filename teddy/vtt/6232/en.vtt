00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.026
So, security is two different things:

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.576
it's a feeling, and it's a reality.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.025
And they're different.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.476
You could feel secure even if you're not.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.476
And you can be secure

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.350
even if you don't feel it.

00:00:14.374 --> 00:00:16.491
Really, we have two separate concepts

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.167
mapped onto the same word.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.326
And what I want to do in this talk
is to split them apart --

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.960
figuring out when they diverge
and how they converge.

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:28.726
And language is actually a problem here.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.826
There aren't a lot of good words
