00:01:57.788 --> 00:02:00.630
In 1975, he lost again.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.900
A year later, he ran for the California 
Assembly– and lost.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.369
Yet he tirelessly continued 
to support his district,

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.699
befriending bartenders, construction 
unions, and local Chinese grocers.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:17.699
This earned him the affectionate title, 
the "mayor of Castro Street.”

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:22.839
And when he ran his third campaign for 
the Board of Supervisors in 1977,

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.026
Harvey finally won the seat–

00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:30.296
becoming one of the first openly gay 
public officials in US history.
