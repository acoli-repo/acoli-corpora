00:03:55.038 --> 00:04:00.228
who had positioned himself against those 
he called "radicals, social deviates

and incorrigibles.”

He had frequently clashed with Harvey 
at Board meetings,

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:09.966
and resented the spirit of change 
which Milk personified for many.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:11.416
The night of Milk's murder,

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:14.526
thousands marched by candlelight 
through the city.

00:04:14.526 --> 00:04:16.046
In the wake of this tragedy,

00:04:16.046 --> 00:04:18.036
yet another injustice arose.

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:20.216
In a highly controversial verdict,

00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:24.416
White received a sentence of only seven 
years and eight months–

00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:27.433
a decision that sparked uproar 
throughout the city

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:31.593
in what became known as 
the White Night Riots.
