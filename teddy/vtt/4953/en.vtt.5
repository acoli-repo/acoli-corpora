00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:30.296
becoming one of the first openly gay 
public officials in US history.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.980
Elated, Milk arrived in office determined 
to make lasting change.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.022
He immediately introduced a bill outlawing
discrimination on the grounds of sexuality

00:02:40.022 --> 00:02:42.672
and launched a major clean-up of the city.

00:02:42.672 --> 00:02:45.352
But not everyone was happy 
with this direction.

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:48.202
Anti-gay sentiment was gaining national 
momentum,

00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:52.562
especially in the form of 
California’s Proposition 6.

00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:55.008
The proposition, which sought 
to make it illegal

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:58.318
for homosexuals to work 
in Californian schools,

00:02:58.318 --> 00:03:02.318
would prove to be the biggest battle 
of Milk’s career.
