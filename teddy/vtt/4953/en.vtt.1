From the Watergate hearings 
on national news,

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.829
to the teacher who had to rent a projector
when her school couldn’t afford one,

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.240
Harvey saw a desperate need 
for political reform.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.258
Milk strongly believed that tight knit 
neighborhoods

00:00:43.258 --> 00:00:45.578
were essential to the fabric of the city,

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:49.888
and that government should solve those 
community’s most practical problems.

00:00:49.888 --> 00:00:52.830
From fixing potholes and putting

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.760

of cooperation,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.880
Milk envisioned a more personal 
approach to local government.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.979
This philosophy led him to run 
for the city’s Board of Supervisors
