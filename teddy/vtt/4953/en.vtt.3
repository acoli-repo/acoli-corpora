to all of San Francisco’s disenfranchised 
groups,

00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:46.098
regardless of race, age, or sexuality.

00:01:46.098 --> 00:01:48.378
But despite his flair for public speaking

00:01:48.378 --> 00:01:50.148
and open-hearted approach,

00:01:50.148 --> 00:01:53.418

the Board of Supervisors.

00:01:57.788 --> 00:02:00.630
In 1975, he lost again.
