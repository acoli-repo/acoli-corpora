Corey Hajim: Hi, Chris, how are you?

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.309
Chris Anderson: I'm very well, Corey,

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.518
it's absolutely lovely to see you.

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:08.184
CH: It's great to see you, too.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.559
(Laughter)

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:14.851
CA: Somehow, you're always smiling,
no matter how dangerous, weird,

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:16.184
crazy things are.

00:00:16.208 --> 00:00:17.476
Thank you for that.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.184
CH: You don't see me
in the other room crying afterwards,

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:22.559
but we'll leave that
for the other [unclear].

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:25.684
So Chris, this is week three
of these conversations,

00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:29.833
how are you thinking about the people
we should be speaking with?
