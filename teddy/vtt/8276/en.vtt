00:00:00.121 --> 00:00:01.204
I remember the day.

00:00:01.746 --> 00:00:05.579
My wife was three months pregnant,
and I knew that I wanted to take time off.

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:07.704
But when I walked in to ask my boss,

00:00:07.704 --> 00:00:09.163
I was so nervous.

00:00:09.163 --> 00:00:12.746
I was about to ask
for seven months of paternity leave,

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.329
and I just didn’t know
how my boss would react to that.

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.038

Like most men in Japan,

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:25.246
I grew up being told that masculinity
is supposed to look a certain way.

00:00:25.288 --> 00:00:27.788
You’re supposed to be stoic and strong,

00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:29.538
dominant and in control;

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:31.079
the breadwinner for your family.
