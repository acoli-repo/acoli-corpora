00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I've been in Afghanistan for 21 years.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I work for the Red Cross

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and I'm a physical therapist.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
My job is to make arms and legs --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
well it's not completely true.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We do more than that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We provide the patients,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the Afghan disabled,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
first with the physical rehabilitation

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
then with the social reintegration.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's a very logical plan,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but it was not always like this.
