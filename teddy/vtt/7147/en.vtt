00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.996
I work in aviation, but the truth is
I don't much like flying.

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:07.329
Current commercial flights
are inconvenient,

00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:10.496
noisy, expensive
and use ancient plane designs

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:13.079
that have hardly changed from the 1950s.

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:16.579
It also represents my biggest
personal impact on the environment,

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:20.579
just as it does for many of us
who fly multiple times a year.

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:24.121
Aviation will continue
to face fierce headwinds globally

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:26.413
even after the pandemic subsides,

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:30.413
because flying is becoming the symbol
of a polluting lifestyle.
