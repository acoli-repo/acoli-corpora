00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:02.294
and a very precise measurement
of the distance from that satellite.

00:04:02.294 --> 00:04:06.821
Let's ignore the fact that you're almost
definitely on Earth.

00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:10.327
We now know that you're at a fixed 
distance from the satellite.

00:04:10.327 --> 00:04:13.187
In other words, you're somewhere 
on the surface of a sphere

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:15.950
centered around the satellite.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.137
Measure your distance 
from a second satellite

00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:21.218
and you get another overlapping sphere.

00:04:21.218 --> 00:04:22.186
Keep doing that,

00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:23.793
and with just four measurements,

00:04:23.793 --> 00:04:27.269
and a little correction 
using Einstein's theory of relativity,

00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:33.537
you can pinpoint your location to exactly
one point in space.
