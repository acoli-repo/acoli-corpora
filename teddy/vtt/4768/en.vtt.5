00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.222
you would normally continuously go 
from, say, 20 miles/hour up to 70 miles/hour.

00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:34.792
Now, if you had a quantum atomic car,

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:37.778
you wouldn't accelerate 
in a linear fashion.

00:02:37.778 --> 00:02:44.495
Instead, you would instantaneously jump,
or transition, from one speed to the next.

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:48.768
For an atom, when a transition 
occurs from one energy level to another,

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.183
quantum mechanics says

00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:54.622
that the energy difference 
is equal to a characteristic frequency,

00:02:54.622 --> 00:02:57.199
multiplied by a constant,

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:02.815
where the change in energy is equal to 
a number, called Planck's constant,
