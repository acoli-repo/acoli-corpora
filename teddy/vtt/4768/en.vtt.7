00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:31.636
That's 9 billion cycles per second.

00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:33.625
That's a really fast clock.

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:36.005
No matter how skilled a clockmaker may be,

00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:38.160
every pendulum, wind-up mechanism

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.760
and quartz crystal resonates 
at a slightly different frequency.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.969
However, every cesium 133 atom 
in the universe

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.818
oscillates at the same exact frequency.

00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:53.261
So thanks to the atomic clock,

00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:57.279
we get a time reading accurate
to within 1 billionth of a second,

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:02.294
and a very precise measurement
of the distance from that satellite.
