00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:33.537
you can pinpoint your location to exactly

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:34.970
So that's all it takes:

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.770
a multibillion-dollar 
network of satellites,

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.817
oscillating cesium atoms,

00:04:39.817 --> 00:04:41.232
quantum mechanics,

00:04:41.232 --> 00:04:42.327
relativity,

00:04:42.327 --> 00:04:43.484
a smartphone,

00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:45.727
and you.

No problem.
