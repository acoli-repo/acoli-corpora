00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:30.563
that they would not gain or lose a second

00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:35.603
even if they ran 
for the next 300 million years.

00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:38.847
Atomic clocks work 
because of quantum physics.

00:01:38.847 --> 00:01:41.808
All clocks must have a constant frequency.

00:01:41.808 --> 00:01:45.371
In other words, a clock must carry out
some repetitive action

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:49.385
to mark off equivalent increments of time.

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:52.731
Just as a grandfather clock 
relies on the constant swinging

00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:55.847
back and forth of a pendulum 
under gravity,

00:01:55.847 --> 00:01:57.939
the tick tock of an atomic clock

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.041
is maintained by the transition 
between two energy levels of an atom.
