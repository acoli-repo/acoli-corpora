00:00:57.717 --> 00:01:03.085
where c is the speed of light
and time is how long the signal traveled.

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:04.336
But there's a problem.

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:06.238
Light is incredibly fast.

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:09.640
If we were only able to calculate 
time to the nearest second,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.950
every location on Earth, and far beyond,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.102
would seem to be the same 
distance from the satellite.

00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:20.375
So in order to calculate that distance
to within a few dozen feet,

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:24.168
we need the best clock ever invented.

00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:27.697
Enter atomic clocks,
some of which are so precise

00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:30.563
that they would not gain or lose a second
