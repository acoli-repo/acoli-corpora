00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:02.815
where the change in energy is equal to 
a number, called Planck's constant,

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.092
times the frequency.

00:03:05.092 --> 00:03:10.297
That characteristic frequency 
is what we need to make our clock.

00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:16.311
GPS satellites rely on cesium and rubidium
atoms as frequency standards.

00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:18.651
In the case of cesium 133,

00:03:18.651 --> 00:03:28.846
the characteristic clock frequency
is 9,192,631,770 Hz.

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:31.636
That's 9 billion cycles per second.
