00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.041
is maintained by the transition 
between two energy levels of an atom.

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:06.069
This is where quantum physics 
comes into play.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.311
Quantum mechanics 
says that atoms carry energy,

00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:13.168
but they can't take on 
just any arbitrary amount.

00:02:13.168 --> 00:02:18.215
Instead, atomic energy 
is constrained to a precise set of levels.

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:20.300
We call these quanta.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.402
As a simple analogy, 
think about driving a car onto a freeway.

00:02:24.402 --> 00:02:25.730
As you increase your speed,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.222
you would normally continuously go 
from, say, 20 miles/hour up to 70 miles/hour.
