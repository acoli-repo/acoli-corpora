How does your smartphone
know exactly where you are?

00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:13.756
The answer lies 12,000 miles 
over your head

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:18.229
in an orbiting satellite that keeps time
to the beat of an atomic clock

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:21.406
powered by quantum mechanics.

00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:22.436
Phew.

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:24.425
Let's break that down.

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:29.121
First of all, why is it so important 
to know what time it is on a satellite

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:32.149
when location is what
we're concerned about?
