00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:32.149
when location is what
we're concerned about?

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.359
The first thing 
your phone needs to determine

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.696
is how far it is from a satellite.

00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:40.883
Each satellite constantly 
broadcasts radio signals

00:00:40.883 --> 00:00:45.762
that travel from space to your phone
at the speed of light.

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:48.562
Your phone records 
the signal arrival time

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:51.753
and uses it to calculate 
the distance to the satellite

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:57.717
using the simple formula,
distance = c x time,

00:00:57.717 --> 00:01:03.085
where c is the speed of light
and time is how long the signal traveled.
