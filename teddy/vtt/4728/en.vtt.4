00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:00.815
but scientists all over the world are searching

00:02:00.815 --> 00:02:02.950
for this elusive particle or particles

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.843
and the effects of dark matter on the universe.

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:08.256
But this still doesn't add up to 100%.

00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:09.784
The remaining 68%

00:02:09.784 --> 00:02:11.680
of the energy density of the universe

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.759
is made up of dark energy,

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.457
which is even more mysterious than dark matter.

00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:18.422
This dark energy doesn't behave

00:02:18.422 --> 00:02:20.590
like any other substance we know at all

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.013
and acts more like anti-gravity force.

00:02:23.013 --> 00:02:25.420
We say that it has a gravitational pressure,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.330
which ordinary matter and dark matter do not.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.213
Instead of pulling the universe together,
