00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.694
living in a universe

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:32.735
that will end its lifetime cold

00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:34.237
and devoid of life,

00:03:34.237 --> 00:03:36.027
the end fate of our universe

00:03:36.027 --> 00:03:37.937
actually has a beautiful symmetry

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:40.087
to its hot, fiery beginning.

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:41.998
We call the accelerating end state

00:03:41.998 --> 00:03:44.111
of the universe a de Sitter phase,

00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:46.082
named after the Dutch mathematician

00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:47.927
Willem de Sitter.

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.685
However, we also believe

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:51.520
that the universe had another phase

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.831
of de Sitter expansion

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:54.607
in the earliest times of its life.

00:03:54.607 --> 00:03:57.228
We call this early period inflation,

00:03:57.228 --> 00:03:58.894
where, shortly after the Big Bang,

00:03:58.894 --> 00:04:01.219
the universe expanded extremely fast
