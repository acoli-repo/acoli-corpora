00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:00.694
of the cosmological constant,

00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:03.451
the future universe will be more and more dominated

00:03:03.451 --> 00:03:04.592
by dark energy,

00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:06.330
becoming colder and colder

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.715
and expanding faster and faster.

00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:10.736
Eventually, the universe will run out of gas

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:11.842
to form stars,

00:03:11.842 --> 00:03:13.941
and the stars themselves will run out of fuel

00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:15.192
and burn out,

00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:18.062
leaving the universe with only black holes in it.

00:03:18.062 --> 00:03:19.255
Given enough time,

00:03:19.255 --> 00:03:21.610
even these black holes will evaporate,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.523
leaving a universe that is completely cold and empty.

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:28.127
That is what we call the heat death of the universe.

00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:29.569
While it might sound depressing

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.694
living in a universe
