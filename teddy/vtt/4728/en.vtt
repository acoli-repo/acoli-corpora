00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:07.890
Looking up at the night sky,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.910
we are amazed by how it seems to go on forever.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.395
But what will the sky look like

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:13.865
billions of years from now?

00:00:13.865 --> 00:00:15.372
A particular type of scientist,

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:16.616
called a cosmologist,

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.531
spends her time thinking about that very question.

00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:21.924
The end of the universe is intimately linked

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:23.868
to what the universe contains.

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:25.170
Over 100 years ago,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.879
Einstein developed the Theory of General Relativity,

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:29.923
formed of equations that help us

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:31.258
understand the relationship
