00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.213
Instead of pulling the universe together,

00:02:30.213 --> 00:02:32.004
as we would expect gravity to do,

00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:34.287
the universe appears to be expanding apart

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.110
at an ever-increasing rate.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.938
The leading idea for dark energy

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:40.148
is that it is a cosmological constant.

00:02:40.148 --> 00:02:42.245
That means it has the strange property

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.434
that it expands as the volume of space increases

00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:47.606
to keep its energy density constant.

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:49.441
So, as the universe expands

00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:50.772
as it is doing right now,

00:02:50.772 --> 00:02:52.742
there will be more and more dark energy.

00:02:52.742 --> 00:02:54.574
Dark matter and baryonic matter,

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.277
on the other hand,

00:02:55.277 --> 00:02:56.622
don't expand with the universe

00:02:56.622 --> 00:02:58.409
and become more diluted.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.335
Because of this property

00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:00.694
of the cosmological constant,
