00:03:58.894 --> 00:04:01.219
the universe expanded extremely fast

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:02.860
for a brief period.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.391
So, the universe will end

00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:06.858
in much the same state as it began,

00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:08.768
accelerating.

00:04:08.768 --> 00:04:10.778
We live at an extraordinary time

00:04:10.778 --> 00:04:12.350
in the life of the universe

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.861
where we can start to understand

00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:15.153
the universe's journey

00:04:15.153 --> 00:04:16.437
and view a history

00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:18.520
that plays itself out on the sky

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.622
for all of us to see.
