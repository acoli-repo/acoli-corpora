00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:01.793
if we measure the amounts or energy densities

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:04.588
of the various components in the universe today.

00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:06.727
So, what is the universe made of?

00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:09.393
The universe contains all the things that we can see,

00:01:09.393 --> 00:01:11.564
like stars, gas, and planets.

00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:14.733
We call these things ordinary or baryonic matter.

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.593
Even though we see them all around us,

00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:18.702
the total energy density of these components

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:20.440
is actually very small,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.530
around 5% of the total energy of the universe.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.675
So, now let's talk about what the other 95% is.

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:29.081
Just under 27% of the rest

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:30.913
of the energy density of the universe
