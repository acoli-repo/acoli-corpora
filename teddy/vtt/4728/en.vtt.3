00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:30.913
of the energy density of the universe

00:01:30.913 --> 00:01:33.825
is made up of what we call dark matter.

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:36.928
Dark matter is only very weakly interacting with light,

00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:39.208
which means it doesn't shine or reflect light

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:41.191
in the way that stars and planets do,

00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:42.288
but, in every other way,

00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:44.259
it behaves like ordinary matter --

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.128
it attracts things gravitationally.

00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:48.761
In fact, the only way we can detect this dark matter

00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:51.052
is through this gravitational interaction,

00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:52.343
how things orbit around it

00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:53.595
and how it bends light

00:01:53.595 --> 00:01:56.008
as it curves the space around it.

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:58.343
We have yet to discover a dark matter particle,

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:00.815
but scientists all over the world are searching
