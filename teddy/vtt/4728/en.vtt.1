00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:31.258
understand the relationship

00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:33.462
between what a universe is made of

00:00:33.462 --> 00:00:34.511
and its shape.

00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:36.124
It turns out that the universe

00:00:36.124 --> 00:00:38.178
could be curved like a ball or sphere.

00:00:38.178 --> 00:00:40.676
We call this positively curved or closed.

00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:42.228
Or it could be shaped like a saddle.

00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:44.488
We call this negatively curved or open.

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:46.033
Or it could be flat.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.155
And that shape determines

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.537
how the universe will live and die.

00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:52.632
We now know that the universe is very close to flat.

00:00:52.632 --> 00:00:54.338
However, the components of the universe

00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:56.454
can still affect its eventual fate.

00:00:56.454 --> 00:00:58.033
We can predict how the universe

00:00:58.033 --> 00:00:59.611
will change with time

00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:01.793
if we measure the amounts or energy densities
