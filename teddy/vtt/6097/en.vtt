As the sun rises over Delphi in 500 BCE,

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.413
Aristonike hurries
to the temple of Apollo.

00:00:16.788 --> 00:00:20.371
Like all Greeks, she's known the legend
of Delphi since childhood.

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:26.538
Two eagles released by Zeus 
from opposite ends of the Earth

00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:29.121
met on the slopes of Mount Parnassus,

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:31.913
identifying Delphi 
as the center of the world.
