00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:02.123
Throughout the world,

00:00:02.123 --> 00:00:04.417
we find ourselves
faced with self-inflicted

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:06.252
and interconnected problems

00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:09.714
that challenge our social fabric,
our economic security

00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:12.550
and the very ability
of the Earth to sustain us.

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:17.096
We're certainly not short on solutions
to address these problems.

00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:20.475
But we often get caught up
in arguments against one another

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:24.020
vying for supremacy instead of deciding
on a course of action.

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:26.064
How can we move forward?

00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:28.608
It begins by acknowledging the difference

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.777
between choices and dilemmas.
