00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:12.013
Cú Chulainn, hero of Ulster, 
stood at the ford at Cooley,

00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:15.513
ready to face an entire army 
singlehandedly—

00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:19.513
all for the sake of a single bull.

00:00:19.513 --> 00:00:23.620
The army in question belonged 
to Queen Meadhbh of Connaught.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.129
Enraged at her husband’s possession
of a white bull of awesome strength,

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:32.027
she had set out to capture 
the fabled brown bull of Ulster
