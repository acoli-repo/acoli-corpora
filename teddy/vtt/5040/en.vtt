00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:12.412
Billions of years ago 
on the young planet Earth

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:17.432
simple organic compounds assembled 
into more complex coalitions

00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:20.122
that could grow and reproduce.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:23.372
They were the very first life on Earth,

00:00:23.372 --> 00:00:27.512
and they gave rise to every one 
of the billions of species

00:00:27.512 --> 00:00:30.602
that have inhabited our planet since.
