00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.000
So, here's some information on sleep.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.960
There are four stages:
we have lighter stages of sleep and REM,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.600
but what we're interested in
is called slow-wave sleep.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.880
And it gets its name
from the electrical signals

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.240
called Delta waves
that we record from the brain.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.640
This is the part of sleep
where scientists believe

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.480
that memory consolidation can happen.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.920
In this deep period of sleep,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.080
we're going to do something
that you don't know we're going to do.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.410
JM: Here's where the tricky part comes,
and we start playing our cues.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.360
(Car engine starting)

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.840
GG: Do you play all the cues?

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.480
JM: No. We only want to play half of them
to see if there's a difference.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.880
GG: So your hypothesis is
