00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.880
to see if we can improve memories
through the use of sound in sleep.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.280
So Joud, how do you test if we can
improve our memories with sleep?

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.760
Joud Mar’i: We need a human subject.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.680
[Step 1: Play a game]

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.320
We have a memory game
that we have on an iPad,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.360
and then we make our subject
play this game

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.240
and remember the images
and where they appear on the screen.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.160
GG: So this is like a memory game
you used to play as a child,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.440
which picture was where.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.320
And we tie each picture
with a sound that represents it.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.920
JM: So, if you can see
a picture of a car, for example,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.600
and you would hear the car engine.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.800
