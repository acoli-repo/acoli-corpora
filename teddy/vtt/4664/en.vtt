Greg Gage: Who wouldn't love
acing a geography exam,

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.320
remembering all the locations
of the countries on a map

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.960
or avoiding embarrassing situations
of suddenly forgetting the person's name

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.520
standing right in front of you.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.240
It turns out that memory,
like other muscles in the body,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.880
can be strengthened and enhanced.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.000
But instead of practicing
with flash cards,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.560
there may be an interesting way

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.760
that we can hack our memory
while we sleep.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.960
(Music)

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.400
Why do we sleep?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.640
This has been a question asked
since the early days of civilization.
