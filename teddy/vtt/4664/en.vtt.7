00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.080
But we replicated these experiments.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.440
The facts and memories we collect
throughout the day are very fragile,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.360
and they are easily lost and forgotten.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.560
But by reactivating them during sleep,
even without us being aware,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.080
it seems like we could make them
more stable and less prone to forgetting.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.360
That's pretty incredible.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.640
Our brains are still active
even when we're not.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.640
So if you're like me and a bit forgetful,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.400
perhaps a solution is a pair
of headphones and a soft couch.
