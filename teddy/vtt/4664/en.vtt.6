you'd be less likely to remember
that guitar when you woke up.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.120
The memories that were cued
they remembered better

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.480
than the ones they weren't,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.000
even though they don't remember
hearing those sounds?

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.280
JM: Yes, we ask them.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.240
GG: We know they're sleeping,
they can't hear it, they wake up,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.840
they do better on those
than the ones you didn't play.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.680
GG: That's amazing.
JM: It's like magic.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.200
GG: Joud ran this experiment on 12 people
and the results were significant.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.680
It's not that you remember things better;
it's that you forget them less.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.560
I was a huge skeptic when I first heard
that you could do better at a memory test

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.320
just by playing sounds during sleep.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.080
But we replicated these experiments.
