GG: So your hypothesis is

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.760
the one that they were listening to
while they're sleeping

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.240
they're going to do better at.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.520
JM: Yes, exactly.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.280
GG: When you wake back up
and play the game again,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.400
do you do better or worse
than before a nap?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.720
What we found is that if we played you
a cue during your sleep,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.280
for example, a car --

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.360
You would remember
the position of that car

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.960
when you woke back up again.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.400
But if we didn't play you the cue
during the sleep,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.000
for example, a guitar,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.280
you'd be less likely to remember
that guitar when you woke up.
