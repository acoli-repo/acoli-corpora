00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.800
(Car engine starting)

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.440
GG: Just before you go to sleep
we're going to test you.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.520
We're going to see how well
you remember where the pictures are.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.520
Every time you see the picture,
you're going to hear the sound.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.120
And now comes the experiment.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.620
You're going to go take a nap.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.650
[Step 2: Take a nap]

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.360
And while you're sleeping,
we're going to be recording your EEG.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.960
JM: And then we wait for them to go
into what's called the slow-wave sleep,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.920
which is the deepest phase of your sleep
where it's really hard for you to wake up.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.160
GG: OK, pause.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.000
So, here's some information on sleep.
