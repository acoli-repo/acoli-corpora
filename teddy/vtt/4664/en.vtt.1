This has been a question asked
since the early days of civilization.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.920
And while we may not know
the exact answer,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.000
there are a number of really
good theories about why we need it.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.520
Sleep is when the brain transfers
short-term memories

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.040
experienced throughout the day

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.320
into long-term memories.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.540
This process is called
memory consolidation,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.860
and it's the memory consolidation theory
that has scientists wondering

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.000
if we can enhance
certain memories over others.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.440
There was a paper recently
in the journal "Science"

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.720
by Ken Paller and his colleagues
at Northwestern

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.720
that seemed to show that this may be true,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.200
and that piqued our curiosity.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.640
Joud has been working
on a DIY version of this task

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.880
to see if we can improve memories
through the use of sound in sleep.
