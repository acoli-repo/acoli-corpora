00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.576
or product,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.976
what my goals are,
what my preferences are,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.256
what my hopes are,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.936
how do I think, how do I hope
this might help me,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.576
what am I afraid of.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.176
These are the sorts of questions

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.656
that patients like Robin
get asked all the time.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.616
These are the sorts of questions
that make me confident

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.296
that the person I'm talking with
really has my best interests at heart

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.000
and wants to get to know me.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.896
The second thing I learned
in those clinics

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.096
is the availability of education.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.936
Education from the folks
behind the counter,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.176
but also education
from folks in the waiting room.
