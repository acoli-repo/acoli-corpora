surprising.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.416
And that is that a lot
of the patients I talked with

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.136
who've turned to medical
marijuana for help,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.096
weren't turning to medical marijuana
because of its benefits

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.136
or the balance of risks and benefits,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.536
or because they thought
it was a wonder drug,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.296
but because it gave them
control over their illness.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.496
It let them manage their health

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.696
in a way that was productive and efficient

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.280
and effective and comfortable for them.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.176
To show you what I mean,
let me tell you about another patient.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.376
Robin was in her early 40s when I met her.
