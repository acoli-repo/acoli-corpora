00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.376
Robin was in her early 40s when I met her.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.776
She looked though
like she was in her late 60s.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.056
She had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis
for the last 20 years,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.496
her hands were gnarled by arthritis,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.256
her spine was crooked,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.896
she had to rely
on a wheelchair to get around.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.536
She looked weak and frail,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.816
and I guess physically she probably was,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.816
but emotionally,
cognitively, psychologically,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.520
she was among the toughest
people I've ever met.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.736
And when I sat down next to her

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.416
in a medical marijuana dispensary
in Northern California
