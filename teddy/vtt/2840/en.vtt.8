00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.416
in a medical marijuana dispensary
in Northern California

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.856
to ask her about why she turned
to medical marijuana,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.856
what it did for her and how it helped her,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.616
she started out by telling me things

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.656
that I had heard
from many patients before.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.656
It helped with her anxiety;

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.056
it helped with her pain;

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.136
when her pain was better,
she slept better.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.616
And I'd heard all that before.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.296
But then she said something
that I'd never heard before,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.096
and that is that it gave her
control over her life

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.816
and over her health.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.936
She could use it when she wanted,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.376
in the way that she wanted,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.816
at the dose and frequency
that worked for her.
