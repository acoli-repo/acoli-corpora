00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.776
whether it's rheumatoid arthritis
or lupus or cancer or diabetes,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.296
or cirrhosis,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.136
we lose control.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.696
And note what I said: "when," not "if."

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.976
All of us at some point in our lives
will face a chronic serious illness

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.496
that causes us to lose control.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.376
We'll see our function decline,
some of us will see our cognition decline,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.056
we'll be no longer able
to care for ourselves,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.336
to do the things that we want to do.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.456
Our bodies will betray us,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.056
and in that process, we'll lose control.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.976
And that's scary.
