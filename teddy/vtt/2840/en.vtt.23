00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.296
in ways that billion-dollar
healthcare systems aren't --

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.016
we should be embarrassed by that --

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.936
but we can also learn from that.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.096
And there are probably
three lessons at least

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.360
that we can learn
from those small dispensaries.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.496
One: we need to find ways
to give patients more control

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.536
in small but important ways.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.616
How to interact with healthcare providers,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.816
when to interact
with healthcare providers,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.456
how to use medications
in ways that work for them.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.696
In my own practice,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.456
I've gotten much more
creative and flexible

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.616
in supporting my patients
in using drugs safely
