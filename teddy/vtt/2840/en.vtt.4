00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.376
(Laughter)

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.536
That was the moment at which I realized

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.816
I needed to learn something
about medical marijuana

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.696
because what I was prepared for
in medical school

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.160
bore no relationship to reality.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.456
So I started reading more articles,
I started talking to researchers,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.896
I started talking to doctors,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.680
and most importantly,
I started listening to patients.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.136
I ended up writing a book
based on those conversations,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.256
and that book really revolved
around three surprises --

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.256
surprises to me, anyway.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.816
One I already alluded to --

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.976
that there really are some benefits
to medical marijuana.
