00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.616
in supporting my patients
in using drugs safely

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.136
to manage their symptoms --

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.536
with the emphasis on safely.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.016
Many of the drugs I prescribe
are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.816
which can be dangerous if overused.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.056
But here's the point.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.136
They can be dangerous if they're overused,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.056
but they can also be ineffective
if they're not used in a way

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.736
that's consistent with
what patients want and need.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.976
So that flexibility,
if it's delivered safely,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.096
can be extraordinarily valuable
for patients and their families.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.336
That's number one.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.376
Number two: education.
