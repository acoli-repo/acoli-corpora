00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.216
we know a lot about
the risks of recreational use,

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.136
we know next to nothing
about the risks of medical marijuana.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.736
So we absolutely do need research,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.096
but to say that we need research

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.176
and not that we need
to make any changes now

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.136
is to miss the point entirely.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.736
People like Robin
aren't seeking out medical marijuana

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.616
because they think it's a wonder drug,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.376
or because they think
it's entirely risk-free.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.056
They seek it out because the context
in which it's delivered and administered

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.296
and used,

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.856
gives them the sort of control
they need over their lives.
