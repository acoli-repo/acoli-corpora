00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:02.416
in ways that larger, more mainstream
health systems are years behind.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.816
But we can learn from them,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.376
and we have to learn from them.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.736
All we have to do is swallow our pride --

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.416
put aside the thought for a minute

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.936

lots of letters after our name,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.216

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.376

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.576

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.016
We need to swallow our pride.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.096
We need to go visit
a few medical marijuana dispensaries.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.096
We need to figure out what they're doing.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.696
We need to figure out
why so many patients like Robin

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.896
are leaving our mainstream medical clinics
