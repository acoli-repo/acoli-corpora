00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.310
by creating concrete that heals itself?

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.770
This idea isn’t as far-fetched

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.920
as it may seem.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.763
It boils down to an understanding

00:00:35.763 --> 00:00:37.453
of how concrete forms,

00:00:37.453 --> 00:00:39.243
and how to exploit that process

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:40.633
to our benefit.

00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:42.798
Concrete is a combination of coarse stone

00:00:42.798 --> 00:00:45.146
and sand particles, called aggregates,

00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:47.576
that mix with cement, a powdered blend

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:49.236
of clay and limestone.

00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:51.185
When water gets added to this mix,

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.815
the cement forms a paste and

00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:55.045
coats the aggregates, quickly hardening

00:00:55.045 --> 00:00:56.275
through a chemical reaction

00:00:56.275 --> 00:00:58.075
called hydration.

00:00:58.077 --> 00:00:59.937
Eventually, the resulting material

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:02.247
grows strong enough to prop up buildings
