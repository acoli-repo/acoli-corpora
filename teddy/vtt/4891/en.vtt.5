00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.729
that are less than 0.3mm wide.

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.589
Material scientists have figured out how

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.649
to heal cracks up to twice that size by

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.179
adding hidden glue into the concrete mix.

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:40.069
If we put adhesive-filled fibers

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.559
and tubes into the mixture,

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.079
they’ll snap open when a crack forms,

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.939
releasing their sticky contents

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.509
and sealing the gap.

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.469
But adhesive chemicals often behave

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.969
very differently from concrete,

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.709
and over time, these adhesives

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.209
can lead to even worse cracks.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.899
So perhaps the best way to heal

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.059
large cracks is to give concrete

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.139
the tools to help itself.
