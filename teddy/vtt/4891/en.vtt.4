00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:00.354
with ways this material

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:02.124
could start fixing itself.

00:02:02.124 --> 00:02:03.374
And some of these solutions

00:02:03.374 --> 00:02:04.744
are inspired by concrete’s

00:02:04.744 --> 00:02:06.854
natural self-healing mechanism.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.119
When water enters these tiny cracks,

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.109
it hydrates the concrete’s calcium oxide.

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.979
The resulting calcium hydroxide

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.379
reacts with carbon dioxide in the air,

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.789
starting a process called

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.559
autogenous healing, where

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.819
microscopic calcium carbonate crystals

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.259
form and gradually fill the gap.

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:26.159
Unfortunately, these crystals

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.749
can only do so much, healing cracks

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.729
that are less than 0.3mm wide.
