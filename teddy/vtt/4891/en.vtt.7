00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.809
to create the perfect conditions

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.259
for calcium carbonate to grow.

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:35.329
These crystals gradually fill the gaps,

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.839
and after roughly three weeks,

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:38.219
the hard-working microbes

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.919
can completely repair cracks

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.699
up to almost 1mm wide.

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:43.869
When the cracks seal,

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.049
the bacteria or fungi will make spores

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.569
and go dormant once more—

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.849
ready to start a new cycle of self-healing

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.279
when cracks form again.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.709
Although this technique

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.349
has been studied extensively,

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.689
we still have a ways to go

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:56.869
before incorporating it

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.909
in the global production of concrete.

00:03:58.963 --> 00:04:01.503
But, these spores have huge potential
