00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:30.044
Concrete is often used

00:01:30.044 --> 00:01:31.464
as a secondary support

00:01:31.464 --> 00:01:33.644
around steel reinforcements.

00:01:33.644 --> 00:01:35.854
In this concrete, even small cracks

00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:37.944
can channel water, oxygen,

00:01:37.944 --> 00:01:40.794
and carbon dioxide that corrode the steel

00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:43.354
and lead to disastrous collapse.

00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:45.264
On structures like bridges and highways

00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:46.934
that are constantly in use,

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:48.344
detecting these problems

00:01:48.344 --> 00:01:50.164
before they lead to catastrophe

00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:52.314
becomes a huge and costly challenge.

00:01:52.314 --> 00:01:53.794
But not doing so

00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:56.564
would also endanger thousands of lives.

00:01:56.564 --> 00:01:59.034
Fortunately, we’re already experimenting

00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:00.354
with ways this material
