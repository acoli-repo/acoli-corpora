00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:02.247
grows strong enough to prop up buildings

00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:03.697
that climb hundreds of meters

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.137
into the sky.

00:01:05.137 --> 00:01:06.299
While people have been using

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.279
a variety of recipes to produce cement

00:01:08.283 --> 00:01:10.283
for over 4,000 years,

00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:11.279
concrete itself

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.909
has a surprisingly short lifespan.

00:01:13.914 --> 00:01:15.624
After 20 to 30 years,

00:01:15.624 --> 00:01:18.574
natural processes like concrete shrinkage,

00:01:18.574 --> 00:01:20.334
excessive freezing and thawing,

00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:23.514
and heavy loads can trigger cracking.

00:01:23.514 --> 00:01:25.994
And it’s not just big breaks that count:

00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:28.394
tiny cracks can be just as dangerous.

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:30.044
Concrete is often used
