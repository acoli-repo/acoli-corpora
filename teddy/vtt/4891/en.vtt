00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.840
Concrete is the most widely used

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.920
construction material in the world.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.470
It can be found in swathes of city pavements,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.980
bridges that span vast rivers,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.220
and the tallest skyscrapers on earth.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.770
But this sturdy substance

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.130
does have a weakness:

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.840
itâ€™s prone to catastrophic cracking

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.540
that costs tens of billions of dollars

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.130
to repair each year.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.290
But what if we could avoid that problem,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.310
by creating concrete that heals itself?
