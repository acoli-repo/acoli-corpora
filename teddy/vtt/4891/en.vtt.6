00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.139
the tools to help itself.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.289
Scientists have discovered that

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:03.869
some bacteria and fungi

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.459
can produce minerals,

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.429
including the calcium carbonate

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:09.459
found in autogenous healing.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.069
Experimental blends of concrete

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.429
include these bacterial or fungal spores

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:15.979
alongside nutrients in their concrete mix,

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.249
where they could lie dormant

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:18.999
for hundreds of years.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.329
When cracks finally appear

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.099
and water trickles into the concrete,

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.209
the spores germinate, grow, and consume

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.429
the nutrient soup that surrounds them,

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.029
modifying their local environment

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.809
to create the perfect conditions
