00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:12.050
In 2010, a parrot that spoke 
with the same British accent as his owner

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.176
went missing.

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:15.762
They were reunited four years later,

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:18.848
but the intervening time left
a conspicuous mark:

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:22.435
the parrot had lost its British accent

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:26.105
and was instead chattering
away in Spanish.

00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:30.026
Parrots and several other birds are
the only other animals
