00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you. It's really an honor and a privilege to be here

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
spending my last day as a teenager.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Today I want to talk to you about the future, but

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
My story starts way before I was born.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And somehow -- we don't really know exactly the whole story -- but
