00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:02.372
What I want to talk to you about today

00:00:02.396 --> 00:00:06.976
is some of the problems that the military
of the Western world --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.737
Australia, United States,
the UK and so on --

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:12.891
face in some of the deployments
that they're dealing with

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:14.819
in the modern world at this time.

00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:16.667
If you think about the sorts of things

00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:19.788
we've sent Australian military
personnel to in recent years,

00:00:19.812 --> 00:00:22.205
we've got obvious things
like Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:25.397
but you've also got things like
East Timor and the Solomon Islands,

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:26.574
and so on.

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:28.034
And a lot of these deployments

00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:31.192
that we're sending
military personnel to these days
