00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.760
Egypt's 2011 revolution
was also a grassroots design revolution.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.360
Everyone became a creator.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.176
People were the real designers

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.696
and, just overnight,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.296
Cairo was flooded with posters,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.400
signage, graffiti.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.856
Visual communication

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.056
was the medium that spoke
far louder than words

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.296
when the population of over
90 million voices were suppressed

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.960
for almost 30 years.
