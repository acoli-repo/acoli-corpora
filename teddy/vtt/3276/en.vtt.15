It's because we are all made
of the same building unit,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.136
is that I can see a future

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.960
where the barriers between people

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.400
all come tumbling down.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.456
So no matter how ugly
the world around us gets,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.096
or how many discouraging books
on ISIS, the terrorist group,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.296
and not Isis, the ancient
Egyptian goddess,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.296
continue to be published,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.960
I will keep building one colorful world.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.136
Shukran, which means "thank you."

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.776
