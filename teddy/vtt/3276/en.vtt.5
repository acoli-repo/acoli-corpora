00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.496
(Laughter)

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.360
Fear, terrorism and destruction.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.000
One word: ISIS.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.656
My heart ached

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.896
that this is how we are
portrayed to the world,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.960
even from a literary perspective.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.016
I asked myself: Whatever happened
to the world-renowned writers

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.200
like Naguib Mahfouz, Khalil Gibran,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.200
iconic poets like Mutanabbi,
Nizar Qabbani?

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.616
Think about this.
