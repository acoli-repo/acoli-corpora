What if I combined
the two most significant symbols

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.216
of innocence and Arab identity?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.040
Maybe then people could resonate.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.656
What's more pure,
innocent and fun as LEGO?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.256
It's a universal child's toy.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.576
You play with them, you build with them,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.200
and with them, you imagine
endless possibilities.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.616
My eureka moment was to find
a bilingual solution for Arabic education,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.296
because effective
communication and education

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.096
is the road to more tolerant communities.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.416
However, the Arabic and Latin scripts
do not only represent different worlds
