that less and less people are using
the Arabic script to communicate.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.376
As I was studying my master's in Italy,
I noticed myself missing Arabic.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.336
I missed looking at the letters,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.176
digesting their meaning.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.536
So one day, I walked into
one of the biggest libraries in Italy

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.160
in search of an Arabic book.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.536
I was surprised to find
that this is what they had

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.960
under the category of
"Arabic/Middle Eastern books."

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.496
