It also uses an entirely different
system of punctuation and diacritics.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.416
But most importantly,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.576
Arabic has no capital letters.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.936
Instead it has four
different letter forms:

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.200
initial, medial, isolated and final.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.376
I want to introduce the Arabic language
to young learners, foreign speakers,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.440
but most importantly help refugees
integrate to their host societies

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.896
through creating
a bilingual learning system,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.536
a two-way flow of communication.
