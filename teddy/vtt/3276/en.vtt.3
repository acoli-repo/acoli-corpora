00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.496
It was precisely this political
and social suppression,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.536
coupled with decades of colonialism

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.336
and miseducation

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.216
that slowly eroded the significance
of the Arabic script in the region.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.816
All of these countries once used Arabic.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.602
Now it's just the green and the blue.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.656
To put it simply,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.360
the Arabic script is dying.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.736
In postcolonial Arab countries functioning
in an increasingly globalized world,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.296
it is a growing alarm

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.200
that less and less people are using
the Arabic script to communicate.
