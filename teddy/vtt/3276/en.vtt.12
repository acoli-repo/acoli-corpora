Together, they form a fun pocket book

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.216
with the 29 Arabic letters
and the four different forms,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.160
plus a 400-word dictionary.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.936
So this is how the page looks like.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.416
You have the letter,
the transliteration in Latin

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.120
and the description underneath.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.820
I'll take you through the process.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.656
So first in my tiny studio in Florence,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.136
I built the letters.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.976
I photographed each letter separately,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.976
and then I retouched every letter
and chose the correct color background

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.440
and typefaces to use.
