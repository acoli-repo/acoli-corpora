However, the Arabic and Latin scripts
do not only represent different worlds

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.016
but also create technical difficulties
for both Eastern and Western communities

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.536
on a daily basis.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.456
There are so many reasons
why Arabic and Latin are different,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.176
but here are some of the main ones.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.896
Yes, both use upward and downward strokes,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.200
but have completely different baselines.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.416
Arabic tends to be more calligraphic

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.376
and connectivity is important
to the Arabic language,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.736
whose letters have to be mostly joined
in order to articulate a given word.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.336
It also uses an entirely different
system of punctuation and diacritics.
