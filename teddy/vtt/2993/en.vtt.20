00:09:59.385 --> 00:10:00.580
in sanctuary cities,

00:10:00.604 --> 00:10:03.567
hundreds of cities and counties
and states sat up in defiance

00:10:03.591 --> 00:10:05.682
and refused to enact that order.

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:08.883
(Applause)

00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:12.747
So cities are and can take action.

00:10:13.731 --> 00:10:16.573
But we're going to need
to see a lot more of it,

00:10:16.597 --> 00:10:18.523
especially in the global south.

00:10:18.547 --> 00:10:22.337
You see, parts of Africa
and Latin America are urbanizing

00:10:22.361 --> 00:10:23.713
before they industrialize.

00:10:23.737 --> 00:10:26.187
They're growing at three times
the global average

00:10:26.211 --> 00:10:27.674
in terms their population.

00:10:28.532 --> 00:10:31.956
And this is putting enormous strain
on infrastructure and services.
