00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.231
We're still locked
in a 17th-century paradigm

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.542
of parochial national sovereignty.

00:02:06.606 --> 00:02:07.825
And yet, in the 1600's,

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.438
when nation-states were really
coming into their own,

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:12.815
less than one percent
of the world's population

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:14.291
resided in a city.

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:15.943
Today, it's 54 percent.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.928
And by 2050, it will be
closer to 70 percent.

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.816
So the world has changed.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.440
We have these 193 nation-states,

00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:29.874
but we have easily as many cities
that are beginning to rival them

00:02:29.898 --> 00:02:31.429
in power and influence.
