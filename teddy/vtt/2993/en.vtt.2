They take up just three percent
of the world's surface area,

00:01:00.103 --> 00:01:03.509
but they account for more than 75 percent
of our energy consumption,

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.633
and they emit 80 percent
of our greenhouse gases.

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:12.056
There are hundreds of thousands
of people who die in our cities

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.929
every single year from violence,

00:01:13.953 --> 00:01:17.062
and millions more who are killed
as a result of car accidents

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:18.615
and pollution.

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:20.723
In Brazil, where I live,

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:25.006
we've got 25 of the 50 most homicidal
cities on the planet.

00:01:25.497 --> 00:01:28.844
And a quarter of our cities
have chronic water shortages --

00:01:28.868 --> 00:01:32.398
and this, in a country with 20 percent
of the known water reserves.
