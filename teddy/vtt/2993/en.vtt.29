00:14:28.624 --> 00:14:32.039
which partly explains why it's got
some of the longest commuting times

00:14:32.063 --> 00:14:33.364
in North America.

00:14:33.388 --> 00:14:35.453
Singapore, by contrast, got it right.

00:14:35.477 --> 00:14:36.644
They built vertically

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:38.631
and built in affordable housing to boot.

00:14:39.989 --> 00:14:41.832
Fifth: steal.

00:14:42.987 --> 00:14:45.604
The smartest cities are nicking,
pilfering, stealing,

00:14:45.628 --> 00:14:46.788
left, right and center.

00:14:46.812 --> 00:14:48.296
They don't have time to waste.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.303
They need tomorrow's technology today,

00:14:50.327 --> 00:14:52.332
and they're going
to leapfrog to get there.

00:14:52.356 --> 00:14:53.511
This is New York,

00:14:53.535 --> 00:14:56.369
but it's not just New York
that's doing a lot of stealing,

00:14:56.393 --> 00:14:58.457
it's Singapore, it's Seoul, it's Medellín.

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.818
The urban renaissance
is only going to be enabled
