00:01:28.868 --> 00:01:32.398
and this, in a country with 20 percent
of the known water reserves.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.081
So cities are dual-edged.

00:01:35.674 --> 00:01:37.051
Part of the problem is that,

00:01:37.075 --> 00:01:40.434
apart from a handful of megacities
in the West and the Far East,

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:43.812
we don't know that much
about the thousands of cities

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:46.215
in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia,

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.154
where 90 percent of all future
population growth is set to take place.

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:52.964
So why this knowledge gap?

00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:54.940
Well, part of the problem

00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:58.258
is that we still see the world
through the lens of nation-states.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.231
We're still locked
in a 17th-century paradigm
