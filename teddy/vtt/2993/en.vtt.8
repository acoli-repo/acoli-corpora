00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:00.357
income inequality,

00:04:00.381 --> 00:04:02.074
poverty,

00:04:02.098 --> 00:04:03.888
youth unemployment,

00:04:03.912 --> 00:04:05.751
different issues around violence,

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:09.548
even exposure to droughts,
cyclones and earthquakes.

00:04:10.515 --> 00:04:13.693
Now obviously, some cities
are more fragile than others.

00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:17.051
The good news, if there is any,

00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:19.751

a permanent condition.

00:04:19.775 --> 00:04:23.121
Some cities that were once the most
fragile cities in the world,

00:04:23.145 --> 00:04:24.536
like Bogotá in Colombia

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.152
or Ciudad Juárez in Mexico,

00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:28.908
have now fallen more
around the national average.

00:04:29.845 --> 00:04:32.260
The bad news is
that fragility is deepening,
