that don't solve just one problem,
but that solve multiple problems.

00:13:01.808 --> 00:13:05.010
Take the case of integrated
public transport.

00:13:05.704 --> 00:13:07.018
When done well --

00:13:07.042 --> 00:13:08.427
rapid bus transit,

00:13:08.451 --> 00:13:09.794
light rail,

00:13:09.818 --> 00:13:12.223
bikeways, walkways, boatways --

00:13:12.247 --> 00:13:15.593
these can dramatically reduce
emissions and congestion.

00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:18.154
But they can do a lot more than that.

00:13:18.178 --> 00:13:19.853
They can improve public health.

00:13:19.877 --> 00:13:21.521
They can reduce dispersion.

00:13:21.545 --> 00:13:23.174
They can even increase safety.

00:13:24.109 --> 00:13:26.104
A great example of this comes from Seoul.

00:13:26.128 --> 00:13:30.109
You see, Seoul's population doubled
over the last 30 years,
