They also moved up north
towards Western Europe.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.466
See, over 1.4 million Syrians
made the perilous journey

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.213
through the Mediterranean
and up through Turkey

00:06:39.237 --> 00:06:41.602
to find their way
into two countries, primarily:

00:06:41.626 --> 00:06:43.427
Germany and Sweden.

00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:46.466
Now, climate change --

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.200
not just drought, but also sea level rise,

00:06:49.224 --> 00:06:52.169
is probably one of the most severe
existential threats

00:06:52.193 --> 00:06:53.484
that cities face.

00:06:53.508 --> 00:06:56.580
That's because two-thirds
of the world's cities are coastal.

00:06:58.156 --> 00:07:03.392
Over 1.5 billion people live in low-lying,
flood-prone coastal areas.
