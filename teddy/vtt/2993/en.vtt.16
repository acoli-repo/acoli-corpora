00:07:58.688 --> 00:08:01.096
But Miami is built
on porous limestone -- a swamp.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.096
There's no way any kind of flood barrier

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.456
is going to keep
the water from seeping in.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.686
As we scroll back,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.402
and we look across the Caribbean
and along the Gulf,

00:08:09.426 --> 00:08:10.580
we begin to realize

00:08:10.604 --> 00:08:13.720
that those cities that have suffered
worst from natural crises --

00:08:13.744 --> 00:08:16.748
Port-au-Prince, New Orleans, Houston --

00:08:16.772 --> 00:08:19.371
as severe and as awful
as those situations have been,

00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:21.863
they're a dress rehearsal
for what's to come.

00:08:22.855 --> 00:08:24.536
No city is an island.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.816
Every city is connected
to its rural hinterland

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.992
in complex ways --

00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:30.818
often, in relation
to the production of food.
