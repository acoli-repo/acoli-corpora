00:00:00.798 --> 00:00:02.837
So, here's a prediction.

00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:05.562
If we get our cities right,

00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:08.496
we just might survive the 21st century.

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:12.070
We get them wrong,

00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:13.787
and we're done for.

00:00:14.307 --> 00:00:17.631
Cities are the most extraordinary
experiment in social engineering

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:19.982
that we humans have ever come up with.

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:21.354
If you live in a city,

00:00:21.378 --> 00:00:23.567
and even if you live in a slum --

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:26.420
which 20 percent of the world's
urban population does --

00:00:26.444 --> 00:00:29.206
you're likely to be healthier,
wealthier, better educated

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.747
and live longer than your country cousins.
