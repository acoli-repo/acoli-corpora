00:02:59.698 --> 00:03:00.880
or São Paulo

00:03:00.904 --> 00:03:02.124
or Johannesburg

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:03.315
or Dhaka

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:04.512
or Shanghai --

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:06.897
they're punching above
their weight economically,

00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:09.107
but below their weight politically.

00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.981
And that's going to have to change.

00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:13.673
Cities are going to have to find
their political voice

00:03:13.697 --> 00:03:15.300
if we want to change things.

00:03:16.131 --> 00:03:19.174
Now, I want to talk to you
a little bit about the risks

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.415
that cities are facing --

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.741
some of the big mega-risks.

00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:24.963
I'm also going to talk to you briefly
about some of the solutions.

00:03:24.987 --> 00:03:27.435
I'm going to do this
using a big data visualization

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.922
that was developed with Carnegie Mellon's
CREATE Lab and my institute,
