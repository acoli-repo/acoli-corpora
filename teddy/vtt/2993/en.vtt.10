00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:03.520
more than at any other time
since the second world war.

00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:07.923
Now, there's not one refugee crisis;

00:05:07.947 --> 00:05:09.774
there are multiple refugee crises.

00:05:09.798 --> 00:05:12.139
And contrary to what
you might read in the news,

00:05:12.163 --> 00:05:15.251
the vast majority of refugees
aren't fleeing from poor countries

00:05:15.275 --> 00:05:16.444
to wealthy countries,

00:05:16.468 --> 00:05:19.454
they're moving from poor cities
into even poorer cities --

00:05:19.478 --> 00:05:21.087
often, cities nearby.

00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:26.202
Every single dot on this map
represents an agonizing story

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:28.014
of struggle and survival.

00:05:28.038 --> 00:05:30.848
But I want to briefly tell you
about what's not on that map,
