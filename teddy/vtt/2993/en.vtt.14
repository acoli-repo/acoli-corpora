00:06:58.156 --> 00:07:03.392
Over 1.5 billion people live in low-lying,
flood-prone coastal areas.

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:06.858
What you see here is a map
that shows sea level rise

00:07:06.882 --> 00:07:08.938
in relation to changes in temperature.

00:07:09.953 --> 00:07:12.361
Climate scientists predict
that we're going to see

00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:14.922
anywhere between three
and 30 feet of sea level rise

00:07:14.946 --> 00:07:16.498
this side of the century.

00:07:16.522 --> 00:07:19.856
And it's not just low island nation-states
that are going to suffer --

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.220
Kiribati or the Maldives
or the Solomons or Sri Lanka --

00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:24.892
and they will suffer,

00:07:24.916 --> 00:07:26.907
but also massive cities like Dhaka,

00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:28.766
like Hong Kong,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.050
like Shanghai.
