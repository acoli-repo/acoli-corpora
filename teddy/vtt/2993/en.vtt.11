00:05:28.038 --> 00:05:30.848
But I want to briefly tell you
about what's not on that map,

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.811
and that's internal displacement.

00:05:32.835 --> 00:05:36.643
There are more than 36 million people
who have been internally displaced

00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:37.835
around the world.

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:40.354
These are people living
in refugee-like conditions,

00:05:40.378 --> 00:05:43.773
but lacking the equivalent international
protection and assistance.

00:05:43.797 --> 00:05:45.389
And to understand their plight,

00:05:45.413 --> 00:05:47.518
I want to zoom in briefly on Syria.

00:05:49.523 --> 00:05:54.178
Syria suffered one of the worst droughts
in its history between 2007 and 2010.

00:05:54.202 --> 00:05:58.144
More than 75 percent of its agriculture
and 85 percent of its livestock

00:05:58.168 --> 00:05:59.620
were wiped out.

00:05:59.644 --> 00:06:02.683
And in the process,
over a million people moved into cities
