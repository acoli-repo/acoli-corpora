WEBVTT

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.922
that was developed with Carnegie Mellon's
CREATE Lab and my institute,

00:03:30.946 --> 00:03:32.540
along with many, many others.

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:35.942
I want you to first imagine the world
not as made up of nation-states,

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.530
but as made up of cities.

00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:40.326
What you see here is every single city

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.438
with a population
of a quarter million people or more.

00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:46.001
Now, without going into technical detail,

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.789
the redder the circle,
the more fragile that city is,

00:03:48.813 --> 00:03:51.076
and the bluer the circle,
the more resilient.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.156
Fragility occurs when
the social contract comes unstuck.

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:59.054
And what we tend to see is a convergence
of multiple kinds of risks:

00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:00.357
income inequality,
