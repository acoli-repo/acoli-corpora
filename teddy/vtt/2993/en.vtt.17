00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:30.818
often, in relation
to the production of food.

00:08:30.842 --> 00:08:34.216
I want to take you to the northern part
of the Amazon, in Rondônia.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.121
This is one of the world's largest
terrestrial carbon sinks,

00:08:37.145 --> 00:08:39.407
processing millions of carbon
every single year.

00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:42.276
What you see here is a single road
over a 30-year period.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.165
On either side you see land being
cleared for pasture, for cattle,

00:08:46.189 --> 00:08:48.384
but also for soy and sugar production.

00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:51.606
You're seeing deforestation
on a massive scale.

00:08:52.673 --> 00:08:57.236
The red area here implies a net loss
of forest over the last 14 years.

00:08:57.854 --> 00:09:00.401
The blue, if you could see it --
there's not much --
