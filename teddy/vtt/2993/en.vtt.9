The bad news is
that fragility is deepening,

00:04:32.284 --> 00:04:35.387
especially in those parts of the world
that are most vulnerable,

00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:37.045
in North Africa, the Middle East,

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.659
in South Asia and Central Asia.

00:04:39.516 --> 00:04:44.369
There, we're seeing fragility rising
way beyond scales we've ever seen before.

00:04:44.945 --> 00:04:48.063
When cities become too fragile

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.516

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.870
And when that happens,

00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:53.122
we have explosive forms of migration:

00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:55.165
refugees.

00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:59.761
There are more than 22 million
refugees in the world today,
