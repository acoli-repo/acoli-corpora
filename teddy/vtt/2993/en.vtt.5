00:02:29.898 --> 00:02:31.429
in power and influence.

00:02:31.453 --> 00:02:32.906
Just look at New York.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.741
The Big Apple has 8.5 million people

00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:39.002
and an annual budget
of 80 billion dollars.

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:41.749
Its GDP is 1.5 trillion,

00:02:41.773 --> 00:02:45.430
which puts it higher
than Argentina and Australia,

00:02:45.454 --> 00:02:47.386
Nigeria and South Africa.

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.710
Its roughly 40,000 police officers

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:53.734
means it has one of the largest
police departments in the world,

00:02:53.758 --> 00:02:56.381
rivaling all but
the largest nation-states.

00:02:57.653 --> 00:02:59.674
But cities like New York

00:02:59.698 --> 00:03:00.880
or São Paulo
