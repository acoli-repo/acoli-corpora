00:10:28.532 --> 00:10:31.956
And this is putting enormous strain
on infrastructure and services.

00:10:32.514 --> 00:10:35.645
Now, there is a golden opportunity.

00:10:36.134 --> 00:10:39.459
It's a small opportunity but a golden one:
in the next 10 to 20 years,

00:10:39.483 --> 00:10:43.027
to really start designing in
principles of resilience into our cities.

00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:45.516
There's not one single way of doing this,

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.333
but there are a number of ways
that are emerging.

00:10:48.357 --> 00:10:50.970
And I've spoken with hundreds
of urban planners,

00:10:50.994 --> 00:10:52.428
development specialists,

00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:54.820
architects and civic activists,

00:10:54.844 --> 00:10:57.487
and a number of recurring
principles keep coming out.

00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:59.301
I just want to pass on six.
