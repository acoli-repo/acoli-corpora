My name is Amy Padnani,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.619
and I'm an editor on the obituaries desk
at the "New York Times."

00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:08.992
Or, as some friends call me,
the angel of death.

00:00:09.016 --> 00:00:11.315
(Laughter)

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.110
In fact, people will ask me,

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:15.387
"Isn't it depressing,
working on obituaries

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:17.704
and thinking about death all the time?"

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:19.205
But you know what I tell them?

00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:21.895
Obits aren't about death,
they're about life,

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.053
they're interesting, they're relatable.

00:00:24.077 --> 00:00:26.544
Often about something you never knew.

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:28.942
Recently, for example,

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.223
we had the obit for the inventor
of the sock puppet.
