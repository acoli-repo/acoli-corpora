00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:30.610
This cell-based screen,
developed in South Africa,

00:03:30.634 --> 00:03:34.121
costs over 10 times less
than traditional equipment

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:36.685
and does not require advanced training.

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:39.942
If I were screening Anuk at school,

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:42.975
sound-attenuating headphones
and noise monitoring

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.255
would take the place of a sound booth,

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.926
and I would use a phone adapter
instead of a microscope

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.478
to examine his ears.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.030
In a matter of minutes,
screening and images are done.

00:03:54.054 --> 00:03:56.870
We then apply Alaska
telemedicine technology

00:03:56.894 --> 00:03:59.447
to transmit the data to specialists,

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.222
who connect Anuk
to the treatment he needs.
