00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:33.374
To overcome these barriers,
Alaska has developed

00:02:33.398 --> 00:02:36.076
a state-of-the-art telemedicine system

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.338
that connects over 250
village health clinics

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:43.173
with specialists who triage
all types of health concerns.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.846
My colleagues have validated
that ear-related telemedicine consults

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.599
are equivalent to an in-person exam.

00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:56.341
In 2016, travel was prevented
for 91 percent of patients

00:02:56.365 --> 00:02:59.898
receiving specialty telemedicine
in the Norton Sound region.
