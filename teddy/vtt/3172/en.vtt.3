00:01:28.016 --> 00:01:33.473
The World Health Organization estimates
that half of all global hearing loss

00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:35.022
can be prevented.

00:01:35.752 --> 00:01:40.154
If Anuk's hearing loss
is identified and treated promptly,

00:01:40.178 --> 00:01:45.027
his life and the opportunities
he has as he grows up

00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:46.950
could look vastly different.

00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:51.422
I'm an ear surgeon working
with partners around the world

00:01:51.446 --> 00:01:54.222
on new pathways
for hearing loss prevention.

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:59.566
This solution comes from my collaboration
with a tribal health organization

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.530
called the Norton Sound
Health Corporation.
