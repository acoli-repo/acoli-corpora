00:00:01.246 --> 00:00:04.247
Listen to the sounds
of why hearing matters

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:05.941
to the Alaskan Native people.

00:00:06.718 --> 00:00:10.573
Hearing loss makes it hard
to fish on the open water,

00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:13.605
hunt caribou and harvest berries,

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.885
activities central
to Alaskan Native culture.

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.558
Hearing loss isn't unique to rural Alaska.

00:00:21.582 --> 00:00:22.800
It's global.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.469
The Global Burden of Disease Project
estimates there are 1.1 billion people

00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:31.758
living with hearing loss worldwide.
