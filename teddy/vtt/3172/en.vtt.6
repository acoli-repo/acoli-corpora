Telemedicine has saved over 18 million
in travel costs in this single region

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:07.737
over the past 15 years.

00:03:08.474 --> 00:03:12.182
Our team is taking the power
of telemedicine to a new level,

00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:13.364
through a project

00:03:13.388 --> 00:03:16.689
funded by the Patient-Centered
Outcomes Research Institute.

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:19.690
For the first time,
we are merging telemedicine

00:03:19.714 --> 00:03:22.317
with mobile screening technology

00:03:22.341 --> 00:03:26.632
that extends the reach of expert triage
beyond health care settings.
