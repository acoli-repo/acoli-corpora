00:04:28.354 --> 00:04:33.513
In Malawi, for example, there are only
two ear surgeons and 11 audiologists

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:36.053
for a population of 17 million.

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:40.796
This technology could empower teachers
and community health workers

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.210
to provide access to care
to children in places like Malawi.

00:04:45.767 --> 00:04:49.218
Scaling up globally
could change children's lives

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:52.488
who have never had access
to hearing care before,

00:04:52.512 --> 00:04:55.541
using just the power of a cell phone.

00:04:56.418 --> 00:04:59.871
It's time to change the course
of preventable hearing loss.
