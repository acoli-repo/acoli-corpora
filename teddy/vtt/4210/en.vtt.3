00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:30.937
It becomes an illegal activity.

00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:32.818
It becomes counterculture.

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:36.547
The father of modern surfing
is a Hawaiian named Duke Kahanamoku.

00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:38.887
He is an extraordinary swimmer,

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:41.587
wins gold at the Olympics in 1912.

00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:44.277
Goes around the world
to show his swimming

00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:47.457
but brings surfboards
and demonstrates surfing.

00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:49.747
Imagine, people had never
seen surfing before.

00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:52.521
Suddenly, some person from a faraway place

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.857
is standing on water, riding on water.

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.377
He comes back to Hawaii,

00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:58.577
and they start to make more boards.

00:01:58.601 --> 00:01:59.947
Pre-Second World War,

00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:02.727
you're still looking
at big, heavy wood boards.
