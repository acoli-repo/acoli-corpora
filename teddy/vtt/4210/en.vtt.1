00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.007
It's really considered
for the rider in some areas

00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:35.396
and for water and physics in others.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.468
A surfboard is made out of a core element

00:00:37.492 --> 00:00:40.407
which tends to be foam,
which makes the board float,

00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:43.857
and the skin of the board
is some kind of resin,

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:46.027
epoxy, sometimes fiberglass.

00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:47.900
There often is also a stringer,

00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:49.423
a wood piece down the middle,

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:51.117
which makes it stronger.

00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:54.637
The rocker is the curvature
of the board in the front.

00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:57.427
That is important because that determines

00:00:57.451 --> 00:01:00.477
what kind of wave
you will be able to take,
