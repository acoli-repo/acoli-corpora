00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.867
A longboard is typically
used on smaller waves.

00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:32.727
The riding has a lot of style.

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.217
You can walk the board,

00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:36.687
put your toes over it, do a hang ten.

00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:38.597
A shortboard will be faster.

00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:41.157
They're harder to ride,
they sink under the body.

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:45.267
Board design comes at the intersection
between those physical factors,

00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:49.077
and really, how I want to put
myself in the water.

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:53.317
It's an expression
as much as it is a physical activity.

00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:55.957
The draw may be
because water is so elusive.

00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:58.577
You can't fight it, you can't change it.

00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:02.047
The best I can do
is recognize what it does.
