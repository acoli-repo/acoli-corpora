00:00:00.401 --> 00:00:04.307
Riding a wave is like
suddenly gaining speed

00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:06.737
and gliding at the same time.

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:09.577
Like walking on water, like flying.

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:15.043
I think it's really about being one
with a natural phenomenon.

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:17.567
[Small thing. Big idea.]

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:23.427
The surfboard requires
a lot of ergonomic thinking.

00:00:23.451 --> 00:00:25.967
How do I stand on it?
How do I not slip off?

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:27.157
But at the same time,

00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:29.467
it really has to work
in that fluid environment.

00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.007
It's really considered
for the rider in some areas
