00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:02.727
you're still looking
at big, heavy wood boards.

00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:03.907
Post-Second World War,

00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:06.757
new materials and new technologies
become available,

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.554
and those make the board
lighter, more accessible, cheaper,

00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:12.847
but it continues to be a custom object,

00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:15.337
something that is made
specifically for a person

00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:16.538
or for a certain spot.

00:02:16.562 --> 00:02:18.687
It's a very symbiotic relationship

00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:20.677
between surfer and shaper.

00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:22.507
There's so many different criteria

00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.837
that affect the physics
of how that surfboard

00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:27.877
is moving in water.

00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.867
A longboard is typically
used on smaller waves.
