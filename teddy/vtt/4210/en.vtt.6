00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:02.047
The best I can do
is recognize what it does.

00:03:02.071 --> 00:03:04.767
The surf may be big and getting bigger

00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:06.677
and surging while you're in the water.

00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:07.940
The elements are changing.

00:03:07.964 --> 00:03:09.147
The wind is coming up.

00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:12.167
You have to be in symbiosis
with the environment.

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.837
You need to look and feel for everything

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.687
that's happening around you.

00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:18.287
And yet, it's so short.

00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:20.667
Five, eight, 15 seconds.

00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:23.377
It's fleeting,
but you have to go back to it.
