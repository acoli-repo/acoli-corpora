00:00:57.451 --> 00:01:00.477
what kind of wave
you will be able to take,

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:01.897
how steep the wave is.

00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:03.377
The tail affects performance.

00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:05.957
Different tails will make
the board react differently,

00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:08.477
so it's a lot about personal preference.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.931
Our understanding of surfing

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:14.597
comes from when the Tahitians in 1200 AD
brought it to Hawaii.

00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:17.307
So when James Cook arrived around 1780,

00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:21.127
he was mesmerized
by hundreds of people in the water,

00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:24.367
children, women, men, surfing naked.

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:26.137
Calvinist missionaries arrive

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:28.367
and they're scandalized by it.

00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:30.937
It becomes an illegal activity.
