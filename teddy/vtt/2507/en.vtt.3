00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:32.804
live below the national poverty lines.

00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:35.761
Only half of the children go to school,

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.807
which means that people
are living very badly.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.755
Not only are they refugees, out of home,

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:43.231
not only have they suffered
what they have suffered,

00:01:43.255 --> 00:01:45.824
but they are living in very,

00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:49.895
international aid decreased.

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:52.712
The World Food Programme was forced,
for lack of resources,

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:55.800
to cut by 30 percent food support
to the Syrian refugees.

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.247
They're not allowed to work,

00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:00.799
so they are totally dependent
on international support,
