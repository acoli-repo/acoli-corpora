that was approved by the Commission,
always too little too late,

00:04:02.078 --> 00:04:04.000
or by the Council, too little too late --

00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:05.509
BG: It's already breaking down.

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:07.990
AG: My country is supposed
to receive four thousand.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:10.021
Four thousand in Portugal means nothing.

00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:13.814
So this is perfectly manageable
if it is managed,

00:04:13.838 --> 00:04:17.248
but in the present circumstances,
the pressure is at the point of entry,

00:04:17.272 --> 00:04:20.731
and then, as people move
in this chaotic way through the Balkans,

00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:24.101
then they come to Germany,
Sweden, basically, and Austria.

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:27.631
They are the three countries that are,
in the end, receiving the refugees.

00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:30.187
The rest of Europe is looking
without doing much.
