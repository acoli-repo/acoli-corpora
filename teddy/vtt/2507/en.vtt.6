00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.941
You talk about one million people.

00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:02.536
It looks enormous,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.060
but the population of the European Union
is 550 million people,

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:11.449
which means we are talking about one
per every [550] Europeans.

00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:15.402
Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugee
per three Lebanese.

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:19.657
And Lebanon? Struggling,
of course, but it's managing.

00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:23.947
So, the question is: is this something
that could have been managed

00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:26.992
if -- not mentioning the most
important thing,

00:03:27.016 --> 00:03:29.388
which would have been
addressing the root causes,

00:03:29.412 --> 00:03:31.388
but forgetting about root causes for now,
