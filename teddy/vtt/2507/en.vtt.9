The rest of Europe is looking
without doing much.

00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:32.570
BG: Let me try to bring up
three questions,

00:04:32.594 --> 00:04:34.091
playing a bit devil's advocate.

00:04:34.115 --> 00:04:37.037
I'll try to ask them, make them blunt.

00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:39.100
But I think the questions are very present

00:04:39.124 --> 00:04:41.377

is not much, but realistically,

00:04:48.186 --> 00:04:50.136

00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:57.241
because refugees have
the right to be protected.

00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:01.114
And there is such a thing
as international law,
