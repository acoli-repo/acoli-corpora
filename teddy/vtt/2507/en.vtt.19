00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:30.028
but the truth is that for a large period,

00:09:30.052 --> 00:09:32.044
all borders in the Middle East were open.

00:09:32.068 --> 00:09:33.520
The truth is that for Afghans,

00:09:33.544 --> 00:09:36.377
the borders of Pakistan and Iran
were open for, at the time,

00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:38.294
six million Afghans that came.

00:09:38.318 --> 00:09:42.139
So I would say that even today,
the trend in the developing world

00:09:42.163 --> 00:09:44.489
has been for borders to be open.

00:09:44.513 --> 00:09:48.925
The trend in the developed world
is for these questions to become

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:51.055
more and more complex,

00:09:51.079 --> 00:09:53.650
especially when there is,
in the public opinion,

00:09:53.674 --> 00:09:58.757
a mixture of discussions between refugee
protections on one side

00:09:58.781 --> 00:10:02.420
and security questions -- in my opinion,
misinterpreted -- on the other side.
