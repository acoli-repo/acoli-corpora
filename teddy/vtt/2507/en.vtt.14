00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:02.720
and our way of life is going to change,
and everything will --

00:07:02.744 --> 00:07:06.609
And the problem is that if this
had been properly managed,

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:08.495
if people had been properly received,

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:13.234
welcomed, sheltered at point of entry,
screened at point of entry,

00:07:13.258 --> 00:07:15.947
and the moved by plane
to different European countries,

00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:18.129
this would not have scared people.

00:07:18.153 --> 00:07:20.796
But, unfortunately, we have
a lot of people scared,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.843
just because Europe was not able
to do the job properly.

00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:25.859
BG: But there are villages in Germany

00:07:25.883 --> 00:07:29.219
with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees.

00:07:29.243 --> 00:07:31.217
So, what's your position?
