00:11:57.657 --> 00:12:00.420
It's clear that multilateral
cooperation is essential.

00:12:00.444 --> 00:12:04.039
It's clear that international financial
institutions should have flexibility

00:12:04.063 --> 00:12:06.782
in order to be able to invest
more massively

00:12:06.806 --> 00:12:08.332
in support to these countries.

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:11.602
We need to combine all the instruments
and to understand that today,

00:12:11.626 --> 00:12:14.072
in protracted situations,
at a certain moment,

00:12:14.096 --> 00:12:16.766
that it doesn't make sense anymore
to make a distinction

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.439
between humanitarian aid
and development aid

00:12:20.463 --> 00:12:22.812
or development processes.

00:12:22.836 --> 00:12:26.439
Because you are talking
about children in school,

00:12:26.463 --> 00:12:27.872
you are talking about health,

00:12:27.896 --> 00:12:30.728
you are talking about infrastructure
that is overcrowded.
