00:07:29.243 --> 00:07:31.217
So, what's your position?

00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:33.208
How do you imagine these people reacting?

00:07:33.232 --> 00:07:36.105
AG: If there would be a proper
management of the situation

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:39.209
and the proper distribution
of people all over Europe,

00:07:39.233 --> 00:07:42.209
you would always have
the percentage that I mentioned:

00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:44.035
one per each 2,000.

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:46.328
It is because things are not
properly managed

00:07:46.352 --> 00:07:48.112
that in the end we have situations

00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:54.553
that are totally impossible to live with,
and of course if you have a village --

00:07:54.577 --> 00:07:56.254
in Lebanon, there are many villages

00:07:56.278 --> 00:07:59.686
that have more Syrians than Lebanese;
Lebanon has been living with that.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.977
I'm not asking for the same
to happen in Europe,
