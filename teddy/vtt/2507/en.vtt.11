00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:30.710
to assume our international
responsibilities?

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:33.184
And Europe has not been able to do so,

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:36.759
because basically, Europe is divided
because there is no solidarity

00:05:36.783 --> 00:05:37.962
in the European project.

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:41.112
And it's not only about refugees;
there are many other areas.

00:05:41.136 --> 00:05:44.770
And let's be honest, this is the moment
in which we need more Europe

00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:46.330
instead of less Europe.

00:05:46.354 --> 00:05:50.973
But as the public less and less believes
in European institutions,

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:54.279
it is also each time more difficult
to convince the public

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:56.605
that we need more Europe
to solve these problems.

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:58.076
BG: We seem to be at the point

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.511
where the numbers turn into political
shifts, particularly domestically.
