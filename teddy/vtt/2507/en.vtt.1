00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:31.575
And the first question is very simple:

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.067
Why has the movement of refugees
spiked so fast in the last six months?

00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:39.384
AG: Well, I think, basically,
what triggered this huge increase

00:00:39.408 --> 00:00:41.329
was the Syrian refugee group.

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:46.089
There has been an increased movement
into Europe from Africa, from Asia,

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:49.939
but slowly growing, and all of a sudden
we had this massive increase

00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:52.397
in the first months of this year.

00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:54.289
Why? I think there are three reasons,

00:00:54.313 --> 00:00:56.346
two long-term ones and the trigger.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.918
The long-term ones,
in relation to Syrians,

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:05.549
is that hope is less and less
clear for people.
