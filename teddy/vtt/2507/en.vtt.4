00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:00.799
so they are totally dependent
on international support,

00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:03.127
and they felt, "The world
is abandoning us."

00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:05.111
And that, in my opinion, was the trigger.

00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:06.770
All of a sudden, there was a rush,

00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:08.809
and people started to move
in large numbers

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:10.391
and, to be absolutely honest,

00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:12.614
if I had been in the same situation

00:02:12.638 --> 00:02:14.745
and I would have been brave
enough to do it,

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.472
I think I would have done the same.

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:20.761
BG: But I think what surprised
many people is it's not only sudden,

00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:22.985
but it wasn't supposed to be sudden.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.422
The war in Syria has been
happening for five years.

00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:29.106
Millions of refugees are in camps
and villages and towns around Syria.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.510
You have yourself warned
about the situation
