00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:01.114
And there is such a thing
as international law,

00:05:01.138 --> 00:05:05.507
so there is no way you can say,
"I take 10,000 and that's finished."

00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:07.318
I remind you of one thing:

00:05:07.342 --> 00:05:11.218
in Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis,
I remember one minister saying,

00:05:11.242 --> 00:05:14.217
"Turkey will be able to receive
up to 100,000 people."

00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:17.686
Turkey has now two million
three-hundred thousand

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.158
or something of the sort,
if you count all refugees.

00:05:20.182 --> 00:05:24.371
So I don't think it's fair to say
how many we can take.

00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:27.941
What it is fair to say is:
how we can we organize ourselves

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:30.710
to assume our international
responsibilities?
