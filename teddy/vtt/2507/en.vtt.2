00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:05.549
is that hope is less and less
clear for people.

00:01:05.573 --> 00:01:07.605
I mean, they look at their own country

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:10.310
and they don't see much hope
to go back home,

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:12.279
because there is no political solution,

00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:15.358
so there is no light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:17.006
Second, the living conditions

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.356
of the Syrians in the neighboring
countries have been deteriorating.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.633
We just had research with the World Bank,

00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:26.993
and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan

00:01:27.017 --> 00:01:29.918
and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon

00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:32.804
live below the national poverty lines.
