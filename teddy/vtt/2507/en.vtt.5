00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.510
You have yourself warned
about the situation

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:34.817
and about the consequences
of a breakdown of Libya, for example,

00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:37.880
and yet Europe looked totally unprepared.

00:02:38.618 --> 00:02:41.077
AG: Well, unprepared because divided,

00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:44.379
and when you are divided,
you don't want to recognize the reality.

00:02:44.403 --> 00:02:46.260
You prefer to postpone decisions,

00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:48.720
because you do not have
the capacity to make them.

00:02:48.744 --> 00:02:52.206
And the proof is that even when
the spike occurred,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.533
Europe remained divided

00:02:53.557 --> 00:02:59.226
and was unable to put in place
a mechanism to manage the situation.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.941
You talk about one million people.
