00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.230
They have millions of refugees there,

00:11:00.254 --> 00:11:03.744
and to be honest, they are pillars
of stability in the region,

00:11:03.768 --> 00:11:05.506
with all the difficulties they face,

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.220
and the first line of defense
of our collective security.

00:11:08.244 --> 00:11:09.407
So it doesn't make sense

00:11:09.431 --> 00:11:11.574
that these countries
are not a first priority

00:11:11.598 --> 00:11:13.343
in development cooperation policies.

00:11:13.367 --> 00:11:14.526
And they are not.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.952
And not only do the refugees live
in very dramatic circumstances

00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:19.206
inside those countries,

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.056
but the local communities
themselves are suffering,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.336
because salaries went down,

00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:27.138
because there are more unemployed,

00:11:27.162 --> 00:11:29.562
because prices and rents went up.
