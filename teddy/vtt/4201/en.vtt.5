00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.080
How is it possible that all our 
success is due to these circuits?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.240
Come, let’s do a small experiment.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.080
Take a sheet of paper,
and make a tube out of it.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.040
Now hold this tube in one hand,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.040
and with the second hand 
we will take two positions.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.976
Once here, in front and the other
behind, but don’t block the tube.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.143
Once here, in front and the other
behind, but don’t block the tube.

00:02:56.167 --> 00:03:00.656
Now keep it in the first position, keep
both your eyes open and look ahead.
