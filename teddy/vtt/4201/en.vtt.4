00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.416
But some people walk more
gracefully than the others.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.976
Just by looking at them, you can
say that’s a dancer or an athlete.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.800
Similarly, we all look at the world,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.800
but some people have 
distinct perspectives.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.936
They have a design sense
or aesthetic sense

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.200
which would help them achieve 
success in the fields of architecture

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.240
or fashion designing or fine arts.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.896
So, everyone has the same fundamental
capabilities and basic circuit,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.000
but its fine tuning
is different for each one.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.710
You must be wondering:

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.080
How is it possible that all our 
success is due to these circuits?
