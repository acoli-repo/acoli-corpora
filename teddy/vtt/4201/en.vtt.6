00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.616
Keep the tube on one eye,
and hand on the second eye.

Can you see me? Yes.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.640
Now take the hand to the second position.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.300
Both eyes open, 
hand at the second position.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.840
What do you see?

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.670
Strange people. 


00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.460
Some say, there 
is a hole in the hand!

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.086
Do you really think there
is a hole in the hand?

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.240
The thing is, we can experience the whole
world around us through our five senses.
