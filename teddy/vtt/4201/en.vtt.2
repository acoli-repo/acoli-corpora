00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.976
how our brain does all our work

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.960
and teaches us new things.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.456
There is nothing the brain can’t do,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.814
someone does mountaineering,
someone engineering,

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:09.936
someone writes poetry,
while someone paints.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.576
Some scientists think
about the outer space

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.096
while I, a brain scientist,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.480
study that brain which gives
us all this capability.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.896
The brain is a fantastic
computer, and we all know

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.159
while a computer can be assembled
bringing different parts together,

00:01:27.183 --> 00:01:28.656
who assembles the brain?

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.046
Each part is produced in the womb
and then wired together.
