00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.240
The thing is, we can experience the whole
world around us through our five senses.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.176
These five senses send signals to thebrain
which runs a special software

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.576
that makes us realize that
“Oh! The leaves of this tree are green.”,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.816
“This table is solid.”

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.602
And yes, “There is hole in my hand!”

00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:55.728
(Applause)

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.616
It’s just that the way our brain is wired,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.150
the signals from both 
the eyes will overlap,
