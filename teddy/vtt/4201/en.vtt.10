00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.376
This is an example from my own children.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.736
What I want to say is,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.536
you child’s childhood is precious.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.816
It is in this period
that the circuits learn new things

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.656
and get fine-tuned.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.656
So encourage your children

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.536
to try out everything.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.275
It is when you try out everything
that you will realize,

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:19.560
what skills resonate
most with your circuits.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.976
So we should tell the children,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.056
“Try everything,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.970
hone your skills, and when you 
have to pursue a field,

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.390
listen to your mind, not your heart.”
