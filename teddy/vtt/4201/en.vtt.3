00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.046
Each part is produced in the womb
and then wired together.

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:37.176
And this circuit’s wiring
pattern is what determines

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.200
our core talents
and fundamental capabilities.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.776
Now everyone has a basic circuit.
Everyone walks, learns somehow.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.576
And we walk because, one leg
drops and the other rises,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.200
this cycle is embedded
in the circuit’s timing.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.416
But some people walk more
gracefully than the others.
