00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.856
Some of their circuits
are flexible, a little adjustable

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.376
and have the ability
to learn something new.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.656
And this is what critical periods are.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.976
For example,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.776
a new language.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.936
Without even realizing, kids
pick up a new language.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.936
It is much harder for older
people to learn a new language,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.936
If you want your child
to learn a language,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.016
then speak to him in that language
right from childhood.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.898
The child’s brain will not be confused;

00:04:52.922 --> 00:04:54.776
instead it will quickly adapt

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.416
and know that with Papa he has to speak
in Hindi and with Mom in Marathi.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.376
This is an example from my own children.
