I can show you a picture of my cat
so you can see how chunky he is ...

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.816
AdG: Stephanie set a company record

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.174
for the longest customer call
ever at Zappos.

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:37.708
And I'd wager, one
of the longest ever anywhere.

00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:40.497
(Phone) SVH: Thank you so much
for being amazing

00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:43.865
and I hope you guys enjoy
your extremely late dinner.

AdG: Customer service calls are so often

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.141
about dealing with people's
negative emotions.

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:53.966
But Stephanie turned a mundane call
into a source of positive emotions.

00:01:54.276 --> 00:01:56.609
And that is ridiculously hard work.

00:01:57.124 --> 00:02:03.671
