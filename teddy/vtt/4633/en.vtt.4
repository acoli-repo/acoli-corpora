00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:04.846
I'm Adam Grant,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.051
and this is WorkLife, my podcast with TED.

00:02:07.472 --> 00:02:09.401
I'm an organizational psychologist.

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:11.593
I study how to make work not suck.

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:16.331
In this show, I'm inviting myself in
to some truly unusual places,

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:19.426
where they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work.

00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:21.839
Today: emotional work

00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:23.551
and how to avoid burnout.

00:02:23.575 --> 00:02:26.783
