00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:01.220
but you have to do that all day long.

00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:04.728
And not only that,
but it's explicitly part of your job,

00:06:04.752 --> 00:06:08.491
it's tied to your wages and outcomes,

00:06:08.515 --> 00:06:12.164
and if you don't do it,
there are consequences,

00:06:12.188 --> 00:06:14.978
like, you could loose your job
or you could get in trouble.

00:06:15.002 --> 00:06:17.526
And it's with strangers,
for the most part.

00:06:19.018 --> 00:06:21.018
AdG: It seems like the easiest way to cope

00:06:21.042 --> 00:06:23.835
is to tell yourself,
"Well, this is just my job.

00:06:23.859 --> 00:06:26.960
I'll pretend to be this person
in this role when I'm at work."

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:29.652
That's called surface acting.
