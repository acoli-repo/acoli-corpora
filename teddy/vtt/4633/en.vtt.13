It's wearing a mask that you take off
at the end of the day.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.410
It feels like the simple way
to distance yourself from the role.

00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:39.022
But it creates a sense
of being inauthentic,

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.664
which can take a real toll.

00:06:40.986 --> 00:06:43.510
AlG: I had the experience,
while working at Starbucks,

00:06:43.534 --> 00:06:46.173
of a customer saying

And yet inside, I'm really upset.

00:06:53.466 --> 00:06:57.138
I've got dissonance between my feelings
and what I'm supposed to show.

00:06:57.573 --> 00:06:59.648
And so you just put on that expression,

00:06:59.672 --> 00:07:03.613
you have to hide or push down
the feelings you're actually having,
