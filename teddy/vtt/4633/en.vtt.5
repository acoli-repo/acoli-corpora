(Music)

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.744
We all have to manage
our own emotions in our jobs.

00:02:37.768 --> 00:02:40.348
Think of a time you were
really annoyed by a colleague,

00:02:40.372 --> 00:02:43.150
but masked your feelings
so you could get the job done.

00:02:43.174 --> 00:02:46.552
Or when you marched into
your boss's office to ask for a raise,

00:02:46.576 --> 00:02:49.376
but kept your cool so you could negotiate.

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:52.727
At work, we also manage
other people's emotions.

00:02:53.196 --> 00:02:55.640
Whether inspiring a team
about a boring project

00:02:55.664 --> 00:02:58.401
or talking your frustrated
colleague out of quitting.

00:02:59.132 --> 00:03:02.332
And in some jobs,
managing emotions is the job.
