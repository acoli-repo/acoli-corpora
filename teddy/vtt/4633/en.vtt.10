AdG: This is Alicia Grandey, an industrial
organizational psychologist at Penn State.

00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:06.203
She studies how people manage emotions.

00:05:06.227 --> 00:05:09.910
Something she got a real taste of
early on, when she worked at Starbucks.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:11.245
AlG: I would find myself --

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:15.062

completely exhausted
after a part-time shift at Starbucks,

00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:21.070

and I didn't really understand why.

00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:24.871
My face would hurt.

00:05:24.895 --> 00:05:28.268
Like, it would literally hurt
from all the interacting and the smiling

00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:30.355
and the emotional labor I was doing,
