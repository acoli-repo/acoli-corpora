And in some jobs,
managing emotions is the job.

00:03:03.053 --> 00:03:05.823
In the US and many developed
economies around the world,

00:03:05.847 --> 00:03:08.767
about eight out of 10 people
work in service jobs.

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.339
The human touch is hard to automate.

00:03:11.363 --> 00:03:14.112
We want an actual person
on the other end of the line.

00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:16.895
And even if you're not
in one of those jobs,

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.323
you're engaged in a service encounter
every time you get a haircut,

00:03:20.347 --> 00:03:22.720
visit the doctor or order a coffee.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.466
Every one of those service jobs

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.029
has expectations
about what emotions to show.

00:03:28.654 --> 00:03:30.750
