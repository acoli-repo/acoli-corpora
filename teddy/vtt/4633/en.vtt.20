JL: Churchill was a wonderful adventure,

00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:08.689
Very unlooked for and unexpected.

00:10:09.219 --> 00:10:13.102
I felt that I was so extremely different
from Winston Churchill

00:10:13.126 --> 00:10:15.034
that that was almost liberating.

00:10:17.037 --> 00:10:19.244
It's like, I wasn't fooling anybody,

00:10:19.268 --> 00:10:23.401
I'm not going to be a precise imitation
of Winston Churchill.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.752
So, I could go after what I sensed to be

00:10:28.776 --> 00:10:32.735
the essence of the man,
the spirit of the man
