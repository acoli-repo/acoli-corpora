00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:02.184
AdG: But there's an alternative
to surface acting --

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:03.358
deep acting.

00:08:03.672 --> 00:08:07.172
Instead of putting on a mask,
you actually try to feel the emotion.

00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:09.212
That way, it comes out naturally.

00:08:09.236 --> 00:08:12.537
AlG: Deep acing is just the modifying
of your own feelings

00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:15.442
to appear in the way
that you're expected to appear.

00:08:15.466 --> 00:08:19.292
AdG: So it sounds like you're saying,
instead of faking it till you make it,

00:08:19.316 --> 00:08:21.782
feel it so you don't have to fake it.

00:08:22.244 --> 00:08:27.006
AlG: Yeah, so there's certainly evidence
to support that if you can try to feel it,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.920
then you won't need to fake it,

00:08:28.944 --> 00:08:31.630
and that there's less cost to feeling it.
