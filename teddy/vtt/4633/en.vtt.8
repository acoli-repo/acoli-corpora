Once I heard it, you know,
I mentioned that I grew up in New York,

00:04:08.427 --> 00:04:12.354
and she was actually in the process
of making pizza for lunch

00:04:12.378 --> 00:04:14.022
for her son and daughter.

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:18.942
And of course, me being a New Yorker,
I was like, man I really miss that pizza.

00:04:26.696 --> 00:04:28.776
and was like, "You're still on the phone?"

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.323
And she'd start laughing, she was like,
"Yeah, I'm talking to Stephanie."
