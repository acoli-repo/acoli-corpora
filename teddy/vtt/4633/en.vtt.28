"Let's at least make this
a bearable experience

00:14:03.736 --> 00:14:07.609
for everybody else
on the crew and in the cast."

AdG: I found, in my research,

00:14:12.913 --> 00:14:15.685
that when we focus on the people
who benefit from our work,

00:14:15.709 --> 00:14:16.869
it energizes us.

00:14:16.893 --> 00:14:19.227
Firefighters, fundraisers
and government employees

00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:20.900
were all less likely to burn out

00:14:20.924 --> 00:14:23.065
when they saw
how their jobs helped others.

00:14:23.585 --> 00:14:26.641
Even keeping a daily journal
about how you contribute to others

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:28.188
is enough to boost your effort.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.969
Creating a positive outcome for customers
makes the experience less negative for us.
