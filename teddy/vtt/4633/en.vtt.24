00:11:58.013 --> 00:12:02.401
and long, sustained scenes,
where I have to sit for the painting

00:12:02.425 --> 00:12:08.187
and have this intermittent, halting
conversation with the painter.

00:12:08.211 --> 00:12:10.450
Well, the painter was played
by Stephen Dillane,

00:12:10.474 --> 00:12:12.935
one of the best actors
I've ever worked with,

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:18.022
and he's a fantastic actor to work with,

00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:20.362
but he's not an easy actor to work with.

00:12:20.744 --> 00:12:23.990
Because he's very ...

00:12:24.014 --> 00:12:30.196
He looks very inward, he waits and waits
until things are right,
