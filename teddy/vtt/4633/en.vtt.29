Creating a positive outcome for customers
makes the experience less negative for us.

00:14:33.402 --> 00:14:36.406
Or at least gives us a reason
to put up with the stress.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.525
The way John makes is bearable
is to focus on his customer --

00:14:39.549 --> 00:14:40.699
the audience.

00:14:41.398 --> 00:14:44.798
JL: When you delight an audience,
it inflates you.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.911
But you have to think of it
in terms of what you're giving to them,

00:14:48.935 --> 00:14:50.860
not what they're giving to you.

00:14:51.251 --> 00:14:53.966
AdG: I'm wondering if you could
describe the sensation of,

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.545
you know, that moment when you know
you've really gotten into the role.

00:14:57.569 --> 00:14:59.236
What does that feel like?
