00:03:28.654 --> 00:03:30.750
Here's Stephanie Van Hasselt of Zappos.

00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:33.408
You heard her in that
crazy long phone call.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.750
SVH: I don't know, I guess in a weird way,

00:03:35.774 --> 00:03:38.180
I find talking to my customers
kind of therapeutic.

00:03:38.204 --> 00:03:39.354
(Laughter)

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.754
If I'm having a great day,
I want to share that joy with them

00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:48.411
or if I'm having a rough day, it's a way
for me to get away from the roughness

00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:51.504
and vent in a fun way ...

00:03:51.528 --> 00:03:52.894
AdG: Clearly.

00:03:52.918 --> 00:03:57.450
I don't know that many people
who call in to customer service, thinking,

00:03:57.474 --> 00:03:59.943
"Yeah, I've got 10 or 11 hours free,

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:03.212
let me make this into a friendship here."
