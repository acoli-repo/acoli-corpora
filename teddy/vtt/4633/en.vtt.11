00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:30.355
and the emotional labor I was doing,

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.568
but I didn't know
that's what it was called.

00:05:32.592 --> 00:05:35.998
And at the same time,
I took this class, just for fun,

00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:40.770
where I was assigned to read the classic
"Managed Heart" by Arlie Hochschild.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:44.086
And that's when the light bulbs
went off and I was like,

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.236
"Ah, I'm doing emotional labor."

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.127
AdG: What is emotional labor?

00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:52.839
AlG: It's kind of like when you get a gift
and you don't really like it,

00:05:52.863 --> 00:05:55.926
and you have to still
kind of smile and act nice,

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.760
because otherwise, your aunt
Bernadette would be offended,

00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:01.220
but you have to do that all day long.
