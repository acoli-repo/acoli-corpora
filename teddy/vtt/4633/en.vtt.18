AdG: You might recognize this voice.

00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:05.839
JL: Oh yeah, this is John Lithgow,
ready to talk about work.

00:09:07.197 --> 00:09:11.672
I'm an actor and the interesting thing
about me as an actor

00:09:11.696 --> 00:09:16.967
is that I act in movies, TV,
plays and musicals,

00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:18.823
tragedy and farce,

00:09:18.847 --> 00:09:21.434
and I even do stuff
outside the acting game,

00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:23.958
entertaining children
and writing kids' books.

00:09:24.446 --> 00:09:26.498
I'm sort of all over the place.

00:09:26.522 --> 00:09:30.672
Mainly because I'm always afraid
that nobody will ever hire me to act.
