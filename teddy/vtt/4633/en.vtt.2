00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:02.204
(Phone) Woman: That's by far
my favorite episode.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.123
AdG: And pizza, and travel and their pets.

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:08.588
Stephanie resolved
the customer's issue in 15 minutes.

00:01:08.993 --> 00:01:10.778
But they just kept talking.

00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.342
Here's Stephanie coming up
on hour number eight.

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.189
(Phone) SVH: I didn't think
I was this much of a chatterbox,

00:01:16.213 --> 00:01:18.560
my dad would always tell me
that I never shut up,

00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:20.755
but I didn't realize
I like to talk this much,

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.245
until I started working here.

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:23.599
AdG: And the 10-hour mark.

00:01:23.623 --> 00:01:26.321
(Phone) SVH: I'm pretty sure,
before I get off the phone,

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:30.125
I can show you a picture of my cat
so you can see how chunky he is ...
