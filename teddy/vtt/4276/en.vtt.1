(Laughter)

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.583
I created it because
a lot of people at school

00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:36.924
disliked Justin Bieber a little bit,

00:00:36.948 --> 00:00:39.694
so I decided to make the app.

00:00:39.718 --> 00:00:41.873
So I went to work programming it,

00:00:41.897 --> 00:00:45.563
and I released it
just before the holidays in 2010.

00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:50.476
A lot of people ask me,
how did I make these?

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.392
A lot of times it's because
the person who asked the question

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:55.438
wants to make an app also.

00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:58.565
A lot of kids these days
like to play games,

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.119
but now they want to make them,
and it's difficult,
