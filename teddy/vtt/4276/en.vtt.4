I made a couple of apps,
I made some test apps.

00:02:03.445 --> 00:02:05.588
One of them happened to be
"Earth Fortune,"

00:02:05.612 --> 00:02:08.480
and I was ready to put
"Earth Fortune" on the App Store,

00:02:08.504 --> 00:02:12.879
and so I persuaded my parents
to pay the 99 dollar fee

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:15.699
to be able to put my apps
on the App Store.

00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:18.693
They agreed, and now I have
apps on the App Store.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.363
I've gotten a lot of interest
and encouragement

00:02:22.387 --> 00:02:26.056
from my family, friends, teachers
and even people at the Apple Store,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.061
and that's been a huge help to me.

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:32.218
I've gotten a lot
of inspiration from Steve Jobs,
