These days, students usually know
a little bit more than teachers

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:34.438
with the technology.

00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:38.777
(Laughter)

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.025
So --

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.988
(Laughter)

00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:44.198
Sorry.

00:03:44.222 --> 00:03:46.885
(Laughter)

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:49.615
So this is a resource to teachers,

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.734
and educators should recognize
this resource and make good use of it.

00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:55.440
(Laughter)

00:03:56.333 --> 00:04:00.044
I'd like to finish up by saying
what I'd like to do in the future.
