00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:33.425
First of all, I've been programming
in multiple other programming languages

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:35.459
to get the basics down,

00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:39.078
such as Python, C, Java, etc.

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:42.234
And then Apple released the iPhone,

00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:45.272
and with it, the iPhone
software development kit,

00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:48.875
and the software development kit
is a suite of tools

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.601
for creating and programming
an iPhone app.

00:01:52.888 --> 00:01:56.216
This opened up a whole new world
of possibilities for me,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.510
and after playing with the software
development kit a little bit,

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:03.421
I made a couple of apps,
I made some test apps.
