A big challenge is,
how should the iPads be used,

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:06.956
and what apps should we put on the iPads?

00:03:07.714 --> 00:03:11.516
So we're getting feedback
from teachers at the school

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.608
to see what kind of apps they'd like.

00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:16.416
When we design the app and we sell it,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.259
it will be free to local districts;
and other districts that we sell to --

00:03:22.883 --> 00:03:26.203
all the money from that will go
into the local ed foundations.

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:32.854
These days, students usually know
a little bit more than teachers
