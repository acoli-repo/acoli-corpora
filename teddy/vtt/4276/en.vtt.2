00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.119
but now they want to make them,
and it's difficult,

00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:07.079
because not many kids know where to go
to find out how to make a program.

00:01:07.103 --> 00:01:09.598
I mean, for soccer,
you could go to a soccer team.

00:01:09.622 --> 00:01:12.639
For violin, you could get
lessons for a violin.

00:01:12.663 --> 00:01:14.650
But what if you want to make an app?

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:18.681
And the kid's parents might have done

00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:20.563
but not many parents have written apps.

00:01:20.587 --> 00:01:22.894
(Laughter)

00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:25.467
Where do you go to find out
how to make an app?

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:28.227
Well, this is how I approached it,
this is what I did.

00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:33.425
First of all, I've been programming
in multiple other programming languages
