00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:31.315
negative thoughts and feelings,
like fear, anger, and guilt,

00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:36.236
and “reactive” symptoms like irritability 
and difficulty sleeping.

00:02:36.236 --> 00:02:38.719
Not everyone has all these symptoms,

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.672
or experiences them to the same extent 
and intensity.

00:02:41.672 --> 00:02:46.531
When problems last more than a month, 
PTSD is often diagnosed.

00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:47.485
Genetics,

00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:49.736
on-going overwhelming stress,

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:53.464
and many risk factors 
like preexisting mental illnesses

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:54.959
or lack of emotional support,

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.272
likely play a role in determining 
who will experience PTSD.

00:02:59.272 --> 00:03:04.613
But the underlying cause 
is still a medical mystery.
