have persistent problems

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:04.545
—sometimes vanishing temporarily 
only to resurface months later.

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:07.503
We don’t completely understand 
what’s happening in the brain,

00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:10.564
but one theory is that 
the stress hormone cortisol

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:14.589
may be continuously activating 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:19.864
while reducing overall brain functioning,
leading to a number of negative symptoms.

00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:22.353
These symptoms often fall 
into four categories:

00:02:22.353 --> 00:02:25.441
intrusive thoughts, 
like dreams and flashbacks,

00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:27.418
avoiding reminders of the trauma,

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:31.315
negative thoughts and feelings,
like fear, anger, and guilt,
