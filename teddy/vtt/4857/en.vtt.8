But, there are options.

00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:04.123
If you think you might 
be suffering from PTSD,

00:04:04.123 --> 00:04:07.827
the first step is an evaluation 
with a mental health professional

00:04:07.827 --> 00:04:11.155
who can direct you towards 
the many resources available.

00:04:11.155 --> 00:04:14.385
Psychotherapy can 
be very effective for PTSD,

00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:17.575
helping patients better 
understand their triggers.

00:04:17.575 --> 00:04:20.402
And certain medications 
can make symptoms more manageable,

00:04:20.402 --> 00:04:25.182
as can self- care practices,
like mindfulness and regular exercise.

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:29.116
What if you notice signs of PTSD 
in a friend or family member?

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:33.658
Social support, acceptance, and
empathy are key to helping and recovery.
