00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:01.583
which activate the brain’s alarm system,

00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:04.969
known as 
the “fight-flight-freeze” response.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:06.493
When this alarm sounds,

00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:09.745
the hypothalamic, pituitary, 
and adrenal systems,

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:11.677
known as the HPA axis,

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:16.064
work together to send signals 
to the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:19.828
That’s the network that communicates 
with adrenal glands and internal organs

00:01:19.828 --> 00:01:22.046
to help regulate functions like
heart rate,

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:22.936
digestion,

00:01:22.936 --> 00:01:24.589
and respiration.

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:26.842
These signals start a chemical cascade

00:01:26.842 --> 00:01:30.153
that floods the body with several 
different stress hormones,
