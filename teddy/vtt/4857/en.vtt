Many of us will experience some kind 
of trauma during our lifetime.

00:00:10.997 --> 00:00:14.227
Sometimes, we escape 
with no long-term effects.

00:00:14.227 --> 00:00:18.110
But for millions of us, 
those experiences linger,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.801
causing symptoms like flashbacks,

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:20.708
nightmares,

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:23.735
and negative thoughts 
that interfere with everyday life.

00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:27.052
This phenomenon, 
called post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:00:27.052 --> 00:00:28.450
or PTSD,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.440
isnâ€™t a personal failing;
