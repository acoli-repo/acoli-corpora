Social support, acceptance, and
empathy are key to helping and recovery.

00:04:33.658 --> 00:04:37.187
Let them know you believe their
account of what they’re experiencing,

00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:39.730
and that you don’t blame them 
for their reactions.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.970
If they’re open to it,

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.994
encourage them to seek evaluation 
and treatment.

00:04:43.994 --> 00:04:46.880
PTSD has been called “the hidden wound”

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.608
because it comes 
without outward physical signs.

00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:54.427
But even if it’s an invisible disorder, 
it doesn’t have to be a silent one.
