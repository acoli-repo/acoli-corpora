00:03:28.302 --> 00:03:30.209
For someone with PTSD,

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.571
that memory activates the same
neurochemical cascade

00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:35.563
as the original event.

00:03:35.563 --> 00:03:39.584
That then stirs up the same feelings 
of panic and helplessness

00:03:39.584 --> 00:03:43.645
as if they’re experiencing 
the trauma all over again.

00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:47.638
Trying to avoid these triggers,
which are sometimes unpredictable,

00:03:47.638 --> 00:03:49.741
can lead to isolation.

00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.775
That can leave people feeling invalidated,

00:03:51.775 --> 00:03:52.529
ignored,

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:53.894
or misunderstood,

00:03:53.894 --> 00:03:56.385
like a pause button has been
pushed on their lives

00:03:56.385 --> 00:03:59.248
while the rest of the world 
continues around them.

00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:01.621
But, there are options.
