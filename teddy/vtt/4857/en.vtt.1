00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.440
isn’t a personal failing;

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.788
rather, it’s a treatable malfunction 
of certain biological mechanisms

00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:39.245
that allow us to cope 
with dangerous experiences.

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:40.893
To understand PTSD,

00:00:40.893 --> 00:00:45.520
we first need to understand how the brain 
processes a wide range of ordeals,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.624
including the death of a loved one,

00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:48.884
domestic violence,

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:50.695
injury or illness,

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:51.744
abuse,

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:52.678
rape,

00:00:52.678 --> 00:00:53.468
war,

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:54.412
car accidents,

00:00:54.412 --> 00:00:55.947
and natural disasters.

00:00:55.947 --> 00:00:59.356
These events can bring on feelings 
of danger and helplessness,

00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:01.583
which activate the brain’s alarm system,
