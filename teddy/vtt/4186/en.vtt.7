00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.080
put together samples for the future,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.260
so that you can feel 
those possibilities and fears

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.560
today, now, here.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.800
We do this because we have seen

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.480
that this is the most successful way 
to bring about change.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.080
To show people 
that what they are doing today

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.240
will result in this tomorrow.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.800
These days, we are in the process

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.500
of imagining possible 
future scenarios of 2050.
