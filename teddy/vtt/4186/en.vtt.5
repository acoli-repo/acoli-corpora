that it will be full of poisonous gasses 
and life-threatening particles.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It will be something like this

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.800
to look at and to smell.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.190
Don’t get scared,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.670
this is not a sample of the actual air

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.720
because carrying that would be 
pretty dangerous for me.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.680
But the question is,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.600
do we want to give our children 
such a polluted future as a legacy?

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.150
How can we change the direction 
we are headed in?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.000
How can we build a bond with our future?
