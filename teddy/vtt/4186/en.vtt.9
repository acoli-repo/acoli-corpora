In this room, inspired 
by our country’s innovative

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.480
and do-it-yourself culture we 
are creating what I call "food computers."

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.280
These food computers
are fully automated machines

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.860
where we use a technique 
called "fogponics."

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.040
Fogponics is a technique where, 
without the use of soil or water,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.400
you grow things faster 
only through fog or mist.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.440
Through this technique, we have 
successfully grown tomatoes

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.520
and are now trying to grow potatoes, 
cucumbers and other things.
