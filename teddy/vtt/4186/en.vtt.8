00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.500
of imagining possible 
future scenarios of 2050.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.080
On the basis of estimates 
of climate changes,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.700
we are imagining a future where

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.640
we will experience floods regularly.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.640
Supermarkets will have no water 
or food for days on end.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.600
So what will we do?

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.519
The question is not just about survival;

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.920
it’s about how will we make progress
even in such a situation.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.360
How do we move ahead?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.920
To find answers to these questions,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.040
we are creating a room set in 2050.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.360
Like a future time capsule.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.200
In this room, inspired 
by our country’s innovative
