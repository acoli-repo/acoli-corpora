00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.480
We ourselves, every moment, are creating
our own future, in front of our own eyes,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.720
which is why it’s very important
that today we speak up for our tomorrow.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.580
Today on TED Talks India Nayi Soch

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.400
I have come here to startle you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.600
with a glimpse of the future.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.540
Have you ever thought about the kind
of air we will breathe in Mumbai tomorrow?

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.440
According to scientists, 
given the situation today,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.090
if we do not change our behavior,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.080
then by 2036

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.040
Mumbai’s air will be so polluted

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.670
that it will be full of poisonous gasses 
and life-threatening particles.
