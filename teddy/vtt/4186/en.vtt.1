Anab Jain: There was a time in India,

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.230
when you felt like you
could really plan your future.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.200
I am talking about the '80s.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200
My parents had to plan 
even for the smallest of things.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.560
If you needed a phone, 
you applied for it and then waited.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.910
The phone connection 
was set up after five years.
