00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.910
The phone connection 
was set up after five years.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.239
Then if we had to call our grandparents, 
a trunk call had to be booked

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.450
and another long wait.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.000
Then one day, at two in the morning,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.160
the phone would ring 
and we would all jump out of bed

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.310
and shout loudly into the phone.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.200
The entire neighbourhood knew 
who we had spoken to!

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.880
Which is why today, 
when we have high tech smart phones,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.420
people from that generation 
still shout on the phone.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.760
When they say “Hello” loudly,
I just smile.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.120
I belong to that generation as well.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.190
These days it seems like things
are happening very fast.
