00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.000
How can we build a bond with our future?

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.680
This is my job,
but I am not an astrologer.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.740
The future I analyze
is a future that I have given a face to

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.960
along with my husband John,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.200
in our design studio 
and laboratory called Superflux.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.920
We constantly look at trends

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.200
and question how 
we will live in the future.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.880
What will we see, what will we hear,
how will we breathe?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.480
Then we conduct experiments,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.080
put together samples for the future,
