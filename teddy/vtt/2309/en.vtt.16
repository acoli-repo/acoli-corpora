00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.364
But some people refer to me more
as, like, an Internet guru or --

[JACKASS]

00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:04.842
swami.

00:08:04.866 --> 00:08:05.976
(Laughter)

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.671
I knew I had something.

00:08:08.695 --> 00:08:11.976
I'd basically distilled
a very difficult-to-explain

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.976
and complex philosophy,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.283

[DANCE LIKE AN IDIOT
AND DON'T SELL ANYTHING]

00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:29.324
It's unfortunate
that I don't have more time.

00:08:29.348 --> 00:08:32.976
Maybe I can come back next year,
or something like that.
