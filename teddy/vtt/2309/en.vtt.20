00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.976
And so, this year, Chris sent us
a TED conference simulator.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.407
(Laughter)

00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:09.976
Which really allowed us as speakers
to get there, in the trenches,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.976
and practice at home so that we would be
ready for this experience.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.976
And I've got to say that, you know,
it's really, really great to be here.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.845
(Pre-recorded applause)

00:10:20.869 --> 00:10:22.965
I'd like to tell all of you a little joke.

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:25.454
(Pre-recorded applause and cheering)

00:10:25.478 --> 00:10:27.611
Not just the good stuff, though.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.627
You can do heckler mode.
