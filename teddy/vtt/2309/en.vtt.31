The watch is particularly incredible.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.976
(Laughter)

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.784
Online drawing tools --
you've probably seen a lot of them.

00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:37.055
I think they're wonderful.

00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:39.551
It's a chance for people
to get to play with crayons

00:15:39.575 --> 00:15:40.861
and all that kind of stuff.

00:15:40.885 --> 00:15:43.238
But I'm interested
in the process of creating,

00:15:43.262 --> 00:15:46.440
as the real event that I'm interested in.

00:15:46.464 --> 00:15:50.598
And the problem is that
a lot of people suck at drawing,

00:15:50.622 --> 00:15:54.588
and they get bummed out at this,
sort of, you know, stick figure,

00:15:54.612 --> 00:15:56.815
awful little thing that they created.

00:15:56.839 --> 00:15:59.976
And eventually, it just makes them
stop playing with it,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.521
or they draw penises and things like that.
