00:00:01.498 --> 00:00:05.976
You know, when Chris first approached me
to speak at TED, I said no,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.143
because I felt
like I wasn't going to be able

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:11.406
to make that personal connection,
you know, that I wanted to.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.976
It's such a large conference.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.499
But he explained to me
that he was in a bind,

00:00:15.523 --> 00:00:18.976
and that he was having trouble
finding the kind of sex appeal

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.976
and star power that
the conference was known for.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.835
So I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.976
I'll come on two conditions.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.842
One: I want to speak as early
in the morning as possible.
