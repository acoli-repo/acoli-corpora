00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:33.926
(Laughter)

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.717
So really, what are we talking about here?

00:13:36.741 --> 00:13:37.976
Oh, tech joy.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.393
(Laughter)

00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:44.119
Tech joy, to me, means something,
because I get a lot of joy out of tech.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.976
And in fact, making things
using technology --

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.428
and I'm being serious here,

00:13:50.452 --> 00:13:53.597
even though I'm using
my sarcastic voice -- I won't -- hold on.

00:13:54.657 --> 00:13:57.712
Making things, you know --

00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.042
making things actually
does give me a lot of joy.
