And I also feel like I get a lot
of inspiration from the average user.

00:09:03.857 --> 00:09:07.976
For example, somebody wrote,
"Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.559
you should rock out with us,"
and I said, "Why wait?"

00:09:11.773 --> 00:09:14.739
(Video) (Music)

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:17.976
And they said,
"Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.715
but I meant the kind of rocking out
where we'd be naked."

00:09:20.739 --> 00:09:22.183
(Laughter)

00:09:22.207 --> 00:09:23.651
And that was embarrassing.

00:09:23.675 --> 00:09:28.105
But you know, it's kind of a collaboration
between me and the fans,

00:09:28.129 --> 00:09:29.691
so I said, "Sure."

00:09:29.715 --> 00:09:30.992
