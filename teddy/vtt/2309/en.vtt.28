making things actually
does give me a lot of joy.

00:14:00.066 --> 00:14:02.381
It's the process of creation that keeps me

00:14:02.405 --> 00:14:05.976
sort of a bubble and a half
above perpetual anxiety in my life,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.429
and it's that feeling of being
about 80 percent complete on a project --

00:14:09.453 --> 00:14:11.644
where you know you still have
something to do,

00:14:11.668 --> 00:14:14.976
but it's not finished,
and you're not starting something --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.690
that really fills my entire life.

00:14:17.714 --> 00:14:19.548
And so, what I've done is,

00:14:19.572 --> 00:14:23.178
I started getting interested
in creating online social spaces

00:14:23.202 --> 00:14:24.672
to share that feeling

00:14:24.696 --> 00:14:27.100
with people who don't consider
themselves artists.

00:14:27.124 --> 00:14:29.598
We're in a culture of guru-ship.

00:14:29.622 --> 00:14:33.454
It's so hard to use some software
because, you know, it's unapproachable,
