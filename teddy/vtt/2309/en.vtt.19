00:09:29.715 --> 00:09:30.992
[rocking out naked]

00:09:31.016 --> 00:09:32.043
(Video) (Music)

00:09:32.067 --> 00:09:35.439
(Laughter)

00:09:35.463 --> 00:09:36.976
I hear a lot of you whispering.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.976
(Laughter)

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.915
And I know what you're saying,

00:09:40.939 --> 00:09:42.170
"Holy crap!

00:09:42.194 --> 00:09:43.976
How is his presentation so smooth?"

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.348
(Laughter)

00:09:47.372 --> 00:09:50.195
And I have to say
that it's not all me this year.

00:09:50.219 --> 00:09:54.976
I guess Chris has to take some credit
here, because in years past,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.710
I guess there's been
some sort of subpar speakers at TED.

00:09:57.734 --> 00:09:58.976
I don't know.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.976
And so, this year, Chris sent us
a TED conference simulator.
