00:11:59.191 --> 00:12:00.786
is being spent on these things.

00:12:01.239 --> 00:12:04.797
So I decided to try my hand.

00:12:05.177 --> 00:12:06.604
I came up with a few games.

00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:08.722
(Laughter)

00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:09.976
This is called "Atheist."

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.643
I figured it would be popular
with the young kids.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.364
OK.

00:12:14.388 --> 00:12:17.000
Look, I'll move around
and say some things.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.560
(Sighs)

00:12:20.218 --> 00:12:22.526
[Game over. There is no replay.]

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.328
(Laughter)

00:12:24.352 --> 00:12:25.976
So that didn't go over so well.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.333
(Laughter)

00:12:29.357 --> 00:12:31.627
I don't really understand
why you're laughing.
