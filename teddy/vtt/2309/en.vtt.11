1,860 -- am I good?

00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:33.297
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:34.976
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.976

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:42.976
Yeah, I was hanging out
with some Google guys last night.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.976
Really cool, we were getting wasted.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.897

with Google over your lifetime,

00:05:56.641 --> 00:05:59.739
they can actually predict
what you are going to say --

00:05:59.763 --> 00:06:01.094
(Laughter)
