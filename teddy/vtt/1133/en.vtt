00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Over the last 13 years --

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
one, three, 13 years --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and partners around the world

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for taking this idea, this concept,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
noninvasive surgery,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
from the research lab to routine clinical use.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And this is what I'll tell you about.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
13 years --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
for some of you, you can empathize with that number.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For me, today, on this date,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it's like a second bar mitzvah experience.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
