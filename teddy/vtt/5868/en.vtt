00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:02.972
This is poo,

00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:05.455
and what I want to do today is share my passion

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:08.598
for poo with you,

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:11.411
which might be quite difficult,

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.504
but I think what you might find more fascinating

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:17.705
is the way these small animals deal with poo.

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:20.057
So this animal here has got a brain

00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:24.017
about the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things

00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:27.767
that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:31.889
And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source,
