00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:31.237
I waited my whole life
for my father to apologize to me.

00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:33.470
He didn't.

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:35.009
He wouldn't.

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:37.794
And then, with the recent
scandals of famous men,

00:01:37.818 --> 00:01:41.207
as one after another was exposed,

00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:42.381
I realized something:

00:01:43.481 --> 00:01:46.536
I have never heard a man

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.758
who has committed rape
or physical violence

00:01:50.782 --> 00:01:54.838
ever publicly apologize to his victim.

00:01:56.294 --> 00:01:58.116
I began to wonder,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.360
what would an authentic,
deep apology be like?
