I discovered an apology has four steps,

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:04.133
and, if you would,
I'd like to take you through them.

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:07.989
The first is you have to say
what, in detail, you did.

00:03:08.858 --> 00:03:10.807
Your accounting cannot be vague.

00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:12.682
"I'm sorry if I hurt you"

00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:14.707
or "I'm sorry if I sexually abused you"

00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:16.049
doesn't cut it.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.474
You have to say what actually happened.

00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.676
"I came into the room
in the middle of the night,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.074
and I pulled your underpants down."

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.921
"I belittled you because
I was jealous of you

00:03:27.945 --> 00:03:30.349
and I wanted you to feel less."
