00:06:57.847 --> 00:07:00.232
For so many years, I hated my father.

00:07:00.256 --> 00:07:03.234
I wanted him dead. I wanted him in prison.

00:07:03.258 --> 00:07:07.085
But actually, that rage kept me
connected to my father's story.

00:07:08.086 --> 00:07:12.657
What I really wanted
wasn't just for my father to be stopped.

00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:14.253
I wanted him to change.

00:07:14.277 --> 00:07:16.157
I wanted him to apologize.

00:07:16.181 --> 00:07:17.515
That's what we want.

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:20.172
We don't want men to be destroyed,

00:07:20.196 --> 00:07:22.950
we don't want them to only be punished.

00:07:22.974 --> 00:07:27.632
We want them to see us,
the victims that they have harmed,

00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:29.651
and we want them to repent

00:07:29.675 --> 00:07:31.120
and change.
