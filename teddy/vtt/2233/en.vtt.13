00:06:26.024 --> 00:06:30.440
although punishment
sometimes is effective,

00:06:30.464 --> 00:06:32.714
on its own, it is not enough.

00:06:32.738 --> 00:06:34.285
My father punished me.

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:36.076
I was shut down,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.051
and I was broken.

00:06:38.587 --> 00:06:42.142
I think punishment hardens us,
but it doesn't teach us.

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:44.604
Humiliation is not revelation.

00:06:45.334 --> 00:06:50.190
We actually need to create a process
that may involve punishment,

00:06:50.214 --> 00:06:52.529
whereby we open a doorway

00:06:52.553 --> 00:06:57.293
where men can actually become
something and someone else.

00:06:57.847 --> 00:07:00.232
For so many years, I hated my father.
