00:00:00.721 --> 00:00:03.391
I work with children with autism.

00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:05.305
Specifically, I make technologies

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:07.476
to help them communicate.

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:09.015
Now, many of the problems that children

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:12.778
with autism face, they have a common source,

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:14.872
and that source is that they find it difficult

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:20.132
to understand abstraction, symbolism.

00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:24.784
And because of this, they have 
a lot of difficulty with language.

00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:27.799
Let me tell you a little bit about why this is.

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:31.733
You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup.
