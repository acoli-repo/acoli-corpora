00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:30.468
it's just some shows
that you just -- that are pretend.

00:03:30.492 --> 00:03:32.914
And when you explore,

00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:37.894
you get more imagination
than you already had,

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:41.090
and when you get more imagination,

00:03:41.114 --> 00:03:43.613
it makes you want to go deeper in

00:03:43.637 --> 00:03:46.817
so you can get more
and see beautifuller things,

00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:49.272
like the path,

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:54.121
if it's a path, it could lead you
to a beach or something,

00:03:54.145 --> 00:03:55.788
and it could be beautiful.

00:03:58.752 --> 00:04:04.084
