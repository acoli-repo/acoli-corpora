00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:04.611
When I graduated UCLA,
I moved to Northern California,

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:08.146
and I lived in a little town called Elk,
on the Mendocino coast.

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:13.167
And I didn't have a phone or TV,
but I had US mail.

00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:16.561
And life was good back then --
if you could remember it.

00:00:17.693 --> 00:00:21.605
I'd go to the general store
for a cup of coffee and a brownie,

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:23.870
I'd ship my film to San Francisco,

00:00:23.894 --> 00:00:27.411
and lo and behold, two days later,

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:29.034
it would end up on my front door,

00:00:29.058 --> 00:00:33.298
which was way better than having
to fight the traffic of Hollywood.
