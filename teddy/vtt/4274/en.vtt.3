When we see ourselves in nature,

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:33.038
it also connects us to every one of us,

00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:35.945
because it's clear
that it's all connected in one.

00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:40.733
When people see my images,
a lot of times they'll say,

00:01:40.757 --> 00:01:42.047
"Oh my God."

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:44.661
Have you ever wondered what that meant?

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.794
The "oh" means it caught your attention;

00:01:47.818 --> 00:01:50.075
it makes you present, makes you mindful.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.897
The "my" means it connects
with something deep inside your soul.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.501
It creates a gateway for your inner voice
to rise up and be heard.
