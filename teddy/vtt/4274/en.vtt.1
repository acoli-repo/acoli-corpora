00:00:29.058 --> 00:00:33.298
which was way better than having
to fight the traffic of Hollywood.

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:35.593
I didn't have much money,

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:37.858
(Music)

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:40.700
but I had time and a sense of wonder.

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:43.588
So I started shooting
time-lapse photography.

00:00:43.987 --> 00:00:48.047
It would take me a month to shoot
a four-minute roll of film,

00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:49.874
because that's all I could afford.

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:54.811
I've been shooting time-lapse
flowers continuously, nonstop,

00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:56.624
24 hours a day, seven days a week,

00:00:56.648 --> 00:00:58.511
for over 30 years.

00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:02.258
And to see them move
is a dance I'll never get tired of.
