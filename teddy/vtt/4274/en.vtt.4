00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:01.446
And "God"?

00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:05.246
God is that personal journey
we all want to be on,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.541
to be inspired,

00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:11.225
to feel like we're connected
to a universe that celebrates life.

00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:17.288
Did you know that 80 percent
of the information we receive

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:19.439
comes through our eyes,

00:02:19.463 --> 00:02:22.648
and if you compare light energy
to musical scales,

00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:25.498
it would only be one octave
that the naked eye could see,

00:02:25.522 --> 00:02:27.006
which is right in the middle?

00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:29.807
And aren't we grateful for our brains,

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:33.797
that can take this electrical impulse
that comes from light energy
