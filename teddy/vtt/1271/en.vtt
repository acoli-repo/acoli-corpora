00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One thing the world needs,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
one thing this country desperately needs

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is a better way

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of conducting our political debates.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We need to rediscover

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the lost art of democratic argument.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Applause)

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If you think about the arguments we have,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
most of the time it's shouting matches

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
on cable television,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
ideological food fights on the floor of Congress.
