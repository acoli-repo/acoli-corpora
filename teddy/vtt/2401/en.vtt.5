♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong, ♫

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
♫ 'cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
♫ and I don’t care what the politicians spout. ♫

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
♫ and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
♫ 'cause that's what it's all about, ♫

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
♫ that's what it's all about, ♫

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
♫ that's what it's all abou-BOW-WOW-WOW-WOW ♫

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
♫ that's what it's all about. ♫
