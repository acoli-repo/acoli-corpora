00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ But then I looked in your eyes ♫

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
♫ and I was no more a failure. ♫

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
♫ You looked so wacky and wise. ♫

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
♫ And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, ♫

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
♫ catching some sun. We can't go wrong." ♫

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, singing our song, strolling along. ♫

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
♫ 'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
♫ and I don't care what the politicians spout. ♫

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫
