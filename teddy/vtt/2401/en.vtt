00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I’d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But apparently he was a very nice dog

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
♫ I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along. ♫

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong. ♫
