00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
♫ And then there was you -- on time, and wagging your tail ♫

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
♫ in the cutest mime that you was in jail. ♫

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
♫ I said, "Woof, be mine!" and you gave a wail and then ♫

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
♫ I was no longer alone. ♫

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
♫ And I was no more a boozer. ♫

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
♫ We'll make the happiest home. ♫

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
♫ And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I’m just a'walking my dog, ♫

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
♫ singing my song, strolling along." ♫

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong, ♫
