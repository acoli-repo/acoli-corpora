00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
♫ and I don't care what the politicians spout. ♫

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
♫ and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
♫ 'cause that's what it's all about. ♫

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
♫ My life was tragic and sad. ♫

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
♫ I was the archetypal loser. ♫

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
♫ I was a pageant gone bad. ♫

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
♫ And then there was you -- on time, and wagging your tail ♫
