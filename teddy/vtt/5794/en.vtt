00:00:01.055 --> 00:00:03.380
It was December 2015,

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:06.536
a month since the end
of the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.806
and I was driving along the Grafton Road

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.876
on the outskirts
of our capital city, Freetown.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.146
I'd driven along that road so many times
over the past 18 months,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.046
but honestly, I'd been so preoccupied,
I didn't notice my surroundings.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.766
But that afternoon,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.453
I wasn't distracted, and I took it all in.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.333
I was shocked.
