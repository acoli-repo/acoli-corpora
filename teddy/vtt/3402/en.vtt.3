00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.966
She said, "Because babies like you."

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.498
(Laughter)

00:01:32.522 --> 00:01:33.911
I was like, "No, they don't."

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:35.673
She was like, "No, they do like you.

00:01:35.697 --> 00:01:37.355
And I think it would be great

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:40.736
for our children to see what love
looks like, coming from a father."

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:43.563
I was like, OK.

00:01:43.587 --> 00:01:46.047
(Laughter)

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.627
So, I had issues with this,

00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:51.302
because I haven't seen a lot
of stay-at-home dads before

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:54.545
and I thought men would judge me,
so get this, I said this --

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.069
please don't be offended -- I said,

00:01:57.093 --> 00:01:59.427
"Uh, you know, that sounds boring.

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:02.855
And what do stay-at-home moms
do all day, anyway?"
