00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:30.143
I was sitting in my car,
looking in the rearview mirror,

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:33.712
trying to figure out
which friend I could call

00:00:33.736 --> 00:00:34.935
to call in a bomb threat,

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:37.022
so I didn't have to go
back in the building.

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:38.047
(Laughter)

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.038
OK, this was having
a lot of issues for me,

00:00:41.062 --> 00:00:42.886
I was having a lot of issues at my job

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.672
and I'd come home every day from work

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:47.211
and my wife would ask me
the same question.

00:00:47.458 --> 00:00:48.768
And when you hate your job,

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:51.299
this is the worst question
anyone could ask you.

00:00:51.323 --> 00:00:54.283
She'd say, "Hey babe, how was your day?"

00:00:54.307 --> 00:00:56.045
(Laughter)

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:57.237
And I'd say,

00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:58.831
"Why you bringing up old stuff?"

00:00:58.855 --> 00:00:59.856
(Laughter)

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.752
I just left it, I don't want
to think about that place again.
