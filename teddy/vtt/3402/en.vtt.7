(Laughter)

00:03:33.744 --> 00:03:35.903
GH: What had I gotten myself into?

00:03:35.927 --> 00:03:38.927
I thought I knew everything
about being a stay-at-home parent --

00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:40.150
in fact, I knew nothing.

00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:42.650
I thought that all I had to do
was feed them,

00:03:42.674 --> 00:03:44.800
change their diapers, and they'd be fine.

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:47.396
Like, I really thought that's it.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.063
"Sesame Street" on TV,
keep them distracted,

00:03:50.087 --> 00:03:53.030
apple sauce in a bowl,
milk in a bottle, they'd be fine.

00:03:53.054 --> 00:03:55.205
But if you leave children alone,

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.618
they'll get into
just a little bit of mischief.

00:03:57.642 --> 00:03:59.462
