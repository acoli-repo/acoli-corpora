00:05:29.077 --> 00:05:31.906
GH: See, I knew nothing
about being a stay-at-home parent,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.249
and once I embraced the fact
that I knew nothing,

00:05:34.273 --> 00:05:36.091
I began to learn from my new managers.

00:05:36.115 --> 00:05:37.312
And I always was told

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:41.178
that as a stay-at-home parent,
you get no sleep.

00:05:41.202 --> 00:05:43.283
Or as a parent in general,
you get no sleep.

00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:46.196
But that's not true,
because if you sleep when they do,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.823
you actually can get some sleep.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.686
(Laughter)

00:05:50.376 --> 00:05:53.201
You know what else I thought
as a stay-at-home parent?

00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:56.463
I though I knew that the best way
to teach kids right from wrong

00:05:56.487 --> 00:05:57.641
was to discipline them,

00:05:57.665 --> 00:06:00.601
because that would make sure
they understood right from wrong,
