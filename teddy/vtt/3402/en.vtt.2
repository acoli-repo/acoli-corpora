00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.752
I just left it, I don't want
to think about that place again.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.291
See, we were spending about
40 percent of my income on childcare.

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:08.604
We had one child.

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:11.664
And we were pregnant
with our second child.

00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:15.188
And we were trying to figure out
how we were going to fix this whole thing

00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:17.037
of this money situation, and she said,

00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:19.497
"Hey, babe, I've got a great idea."

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:20.855
I said, "What's up?"

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:23.482
She said, "I think you'd be
a great stay-at-home dad."

00:01:23.506 --> 00:01:25.212
(Laughter)

00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:27.672
I was like, "Why would you say
something like that?"

00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:28.697
(Laughter)

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.966
She said, "Because babies like you."
