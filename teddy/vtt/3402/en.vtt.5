00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:31.648
(Laughter)

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:33.339
running all down my face.

00:02:33.363 --> 00:02:34.931
(Laughter)

00:02:35.252 --> 00:02:38.553
My one-and-a-half-year-old
was banging on the bathroom door --

00:02:38.577 --> 00:02:40.432
because I locked them out, you know --

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:41.457
(Laughter)

00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:43.586
crying, tears running down his face.

00:02:44.252 --> 00:02:48.466
And my newborn was in the bassinet,
crying, tears running down his face.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.783
I looked at myself
in the mirror, and I said ...

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:54.302
"Which friend can you call
to call in a bomb threat?

00:02:54.326 --> 00:02:55.779
We've got to get out of here."

00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:57.918
(Laughter)

00:02:57.942 --> 00:03:01.149
See, I had traded my manager
for my children.
