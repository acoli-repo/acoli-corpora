And some people are done with their spouse
as a stay-at-home parent.

00:08:03.193 --> 00:08:05.200
Because the spouse just doesn't get it.

00:08:06.113 --> 00:08:08.946
I was talking to a friend
of mine, he said,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.545
"Man, I come home from work,

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:15.077
drawers are open, clothes
hanging outside the drawers,

00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:17.228
the kids are still in their pajamas ...

00:08:17.252 --> 00:08:20.611
And it can't be that hard to have
dinner ready when I get home, right?"

00:08:20.635 --> 00:08:22.572
(Laughter)

00:08:22.596 --> 00:08:24.723
Start to freak out,
you know what I'm saying?

00:08:24.747 --> 00:08:26.183
(Laughter)

00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:28.334
He was trying to confide in me --

00:08:28.358 --> 00:08:29.523
(Laughter)

00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:32.024
I said, "You have no idea
what you're talking about."
