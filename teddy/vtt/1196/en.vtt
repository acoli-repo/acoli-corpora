00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:03.394
So I'd like to start by focusing on

00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:05.930
the world's most dangerous animal.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.090
Now, when you talk about dangerous animals,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.137
most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks.

00:00:11.137 --> 00:00:12.814
But of course the most dangerous animal

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:14.677
is the mosquito.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:16.836
The mosquito has killed more humans

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:19.825
than any other creature in human history.

00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:21.815
In fact, probably adding them all together,

00:00:21.815 --> 00:00:24.001
the mosquito has killed more humans.

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.660
And the mosquito has killed more humans than wars

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.359
and plague.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.932
And you would think, would you not,
