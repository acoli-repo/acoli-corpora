Whitney Pennington-Rodgers: Hi, Nick, 
thanks so much for being here.

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:05.543
Nick Turner: Whitney, thank you.

00:00:05.543 --> 00:00:07.253
WPR: For those who arenâ€™t familiar,

00:00:07.253 --> 00:00:09.964
could you start by just telling us
a little bit about Vera

00:00:09.964 --> 00:00:10.965
and the work you do?

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:14.844
NT: The Vera Institute of Justice
is a leading justice reform organization.

00:00:14.844 --> 00:00:19.307

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:21.100
We call it the criminal legal system

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.186
because to call it

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:24.687
is a little bit of a misnomer.

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:26.314
It doesn't deliver justice.

00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:29.525
And we work to transform
the immigration system

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:30.902
because many of the problems
