00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
But it turns out, I jumped on a plane,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and I ended up walking a red carpet

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And the surprise

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and just the amazement of that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
when, in my inbox,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
10 literary agents were waiting for me

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
to talk about putting this into a book.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Flash-forward to the next year

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and "The Book of Awesome" has now been

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
