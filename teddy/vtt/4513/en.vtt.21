00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
That's what he said.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
he started joining clubs.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And he even put out a book

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
called "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men."

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
(Laughter)

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
(Applause)

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
It's a great cover.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
(Laughter)

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And so what I love about this story

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
is that Rosey Grier

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
is just such an authentic person,
