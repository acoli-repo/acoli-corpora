00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
there was olives, those little white onions.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
There was rolled up turkey cold cuts,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and little cubes of cheese.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and salmon salad sandwiches.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
There was lasagna, there was casseroles,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
there was brownies, there was butter tarts,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and there was pies, lots and lots of pies.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And when my dad tells the story, he says,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
(Laughter)

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.
