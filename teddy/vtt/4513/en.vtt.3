00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I graduated from school,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We actually saw seals out of our car window,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and then blocked them with our giant heads.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So you can't actually see them,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but it was breathtaking,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
believe me.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
(Laughter)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
not just me.
