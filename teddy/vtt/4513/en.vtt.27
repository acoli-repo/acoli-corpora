00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
(Laughter)

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I was eating olives with pie.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
(Laughter)

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
(Laughter)

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
When I was five years old,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
my dad used to take me grocery shopping,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and he would stare in wonder

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
He would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
They've got an apple here from South Africa.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"
