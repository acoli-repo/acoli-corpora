00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the Awesome story:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It begins about 40 years ago,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
when my mom and my dad came to Canada.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And they got here in the late 1960s.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and they settled into a new life.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
They saw their first dentist,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
they ate their first hamburger,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and they had their first kids.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
My sister and I

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
grew up here,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and we had quiet, happy childhoods.
