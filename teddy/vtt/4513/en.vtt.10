00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and then hundreds and then thousands

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and then millions.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And then I got a phone call,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and the voice at the other end of the line said,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award."

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
(Laughter)

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
But it turns out, I jumped on a plane,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and I ended up walking a red carpet
