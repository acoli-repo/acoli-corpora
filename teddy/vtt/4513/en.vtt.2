00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I moved out of the house, I got a job,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I found a girl, I settled down --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
(Laughter)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
but life was pretty good.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Life was pretty good.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
2006 was a great year.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I got married,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
surrounded by 150 family and friends.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
2007 was a great year.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I graduated from school,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.
