00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
is just such an authentic person,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and that's what authenticity is all about.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
It's just about being you and being cool with that.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And I think when you're authentic,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
you end up following your heart,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and you put yourself in places

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and situations and in conversations

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that you love and that you enjoy.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
You meet people that you like talking to.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
You go places you've dreamt about.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And you end you end up following your heart

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and feeling very fulfilled.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So those are the three A's.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to my parents coming to Canada.
