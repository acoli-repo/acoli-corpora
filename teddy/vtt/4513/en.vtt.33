00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
You will never be as young as you are right now.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And that's why I believe that if you live your life

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
with a great attitude,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
choosing to move forward and move on

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
whenever life deals you a blow,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
living with a sense of awareness of the world around you,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
embracing your inner three year-old

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and being authentic to yourself,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
being you and being cool with that,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,
