I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
at their first baseball game

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and the smell of the hotdogs.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and putting them into a nice centerpiece

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
for Thanksgiving dinner.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I love the way that they see the world,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
because they're seeing the world

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
for the first time.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Having a sense of awareness

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is just about embracing your inner three year-old.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Because you all used to be three years old.
