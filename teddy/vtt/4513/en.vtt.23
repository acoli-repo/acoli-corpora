For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to my parents coming to Canada.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I don't know what it would feel like

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I don't know, because I never did it,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and appreciating the small wonders

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
that you're starting to see in your new world.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And I think you'd have to be really authentic,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
you'd have to be really true to yourself

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
in order to get through what you're being exposed to.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I'd like to pause my TEDTalk
