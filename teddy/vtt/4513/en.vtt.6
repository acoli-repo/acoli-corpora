00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
until only a month later,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
when I heard something even more heartbreaking.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
had been battling mental illness for some time.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And for those of you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
whose lives have been touched by mental illness,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
you know how challenging it can be.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
on a Sunday night.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Very sadly, he took his own life.
