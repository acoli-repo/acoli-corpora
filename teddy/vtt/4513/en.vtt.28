Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Is this A&amp;P?"

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And when we did, my dad would say,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
picked this thing off it, put it in a truck,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
drove it all the way to the docks

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and then sailed it all the way

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
across the Atlantic Ocean
