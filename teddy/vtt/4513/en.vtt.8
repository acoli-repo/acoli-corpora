00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I was trying to remind myself

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
but we just don't talk about enough --

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
things like waiters and waitresses

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
who bring you free refills without asking,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
being the first table to get called up

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to the dinner buffet at a wedding,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and you get to be first in line --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(Laughter)

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And slowly over time,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I started putting myself in a better mood.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I mean, 50,000 blogs
