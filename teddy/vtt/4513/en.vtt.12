(Applause)

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So let's talk about those three As.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Over the last few years,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I haven't had that much time to really think.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that helped me grow my website,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
but also grow myself?"

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And I've summarized those things, for me personally,
