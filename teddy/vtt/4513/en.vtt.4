I know that they were tougher for a lot of people,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
not just me.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
First of all, the news was so heavy.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it was about ice caps melting,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
wars going on around the world,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
earthquakes, hurricanes

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and then eventually did collapse,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and so many of us losing our homes,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
or our jobs,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
or our retirements,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
or our livelihoods.
