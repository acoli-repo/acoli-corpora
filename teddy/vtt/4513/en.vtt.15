00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but your kids could get mixed up in gangs

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
or bad scenes.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Your mom could get cancer,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
your dad could get mean.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And there are times in life

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
when you will be tossed in the well, too,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and when that bad news washes over you,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and when that pain sponges and soaks in,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I just really hope you feel

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
like you've always got two choices.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
One, you can swirl and twirl

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and gloom and doom forever,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
or two, you can grieve

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and then face the future

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
with newly sober eyes.
