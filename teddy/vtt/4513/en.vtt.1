00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
grew up here,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and we had quiet, happy childhoods.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We had close family,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
good friends, a quiet street.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We grew up taking for granted

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
when they grew up --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
things like power always on

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in our houses,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
things like schools across the street

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and hospitals down the road

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and popsicles in the backyard.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We grew up, and we grew older.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I went to high school.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I graduated.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I moved out of the house, I got a job,
