00:00:00.885 --> 00:00:02.407
So I've been thinking about the difference between

00:00:02.407 --> 00:00:05.541
the résumé virtues and 
the eulogy virtues.

00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:08.443
The résumé virtues are the
ones you put on your résumé,

00:00:08.443 --> 00:00:11.909
which are the skills 
you bring to the marketplace.

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:13.647
The eulogy virtues are the ones

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:15.129
that get mentioned in the eulogy,

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.067
which are deeper: who are you, 
in your depth,

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:19.843
what is the nature of your relationships,

00:00:19.843 --> 00:00:23.407
are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency?

00:00:23.407 --> 00:00:24.901
And most of us, including 
me, would say

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.117
that the eulogy virtues are the
more important of the virtues.

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:30.200
But at least in my case, 
are they the ones that
