00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
One day when I was only seven years old and fishing,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I pulled a "pinfish," they're called, with sharp dorsal spines, up too hard and fast,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and I blinded myself in one eye.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I later discovered I was also hard of hearing,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
possibly congenitally, in the upper registers.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So in planning to be a professional naturalist --

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I never considered anything else in my entire life --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either.
