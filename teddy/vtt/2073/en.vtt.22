00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:07.000
are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology, a world unto themselves.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
although they're obviously of enormous importance to us.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
But this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
exceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Nowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity,
