00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Consider the fungi -- including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
60,000 species are known to science,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Consider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms.
