Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
in ways we have not begun even to imagine.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
at the peril of our own existence --

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:07.000
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student,
