a specialist on the biology of ants,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but my attention and research continued to make journeys

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
across the great variety of life on Earth in general --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
including all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you.
