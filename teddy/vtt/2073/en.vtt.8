00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
In so doing, I reached a frontier of biology so strange, so rich,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that it seemed as though it exists on another planet.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
In fact, we live on a mostly unexplored planet.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
In the last 30 years, thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and advances in technology,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
biologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species,
