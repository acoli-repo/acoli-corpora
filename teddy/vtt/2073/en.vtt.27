but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:43.000
are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and other harsh changes in environment,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.000
including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
around the growing population of bacteria.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically
