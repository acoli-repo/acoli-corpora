00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Nowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface
