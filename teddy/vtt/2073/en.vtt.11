00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
These bacteria were not uncovered sooner

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms --

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Consider the fungi -- including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms.
