00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Some serious biologists, and I count myself among them,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:12.000
have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
one might -- just might -- find aliens among them.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
True aliens, stocks that arrived from outer space.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
They've had billions of years to do it,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000
but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet.
