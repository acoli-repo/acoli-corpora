There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
hardly worth distinguishing one from the other.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
But each of these species, even the tiniest Prochlorococci,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
are masterpieces of evolution.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend
