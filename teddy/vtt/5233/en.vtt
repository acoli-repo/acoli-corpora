Depression is the leading cause
of disability in the world.

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:10.954
In the United States,

00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:15.454
close to 10% of adults
struggle with depression.

00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:17.746
But because it's a mental illness,

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:21.663
it can be a lot harder to understand
than, say, high cholesterol.

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:25.329
One major source of confusion is
the difference between having depression

00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.579
and just feeling depressed.

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.538
Almost everyone feels down
from time to time.
