Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
Each of us, no matter who we are,

00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:05.036
have dreams for ourselves.

00:00:05.076 --> 00:00:07.156
and all of us also have fears.

00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:09.676
Luvvie Ajayi Jones has spent lots of time

00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:12.156
thinking about the intersection
of these two things,

00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:15.996
namely, how you can overcome your fears
to accomplish your dreams.

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:19.716
Here to break this all down for us
is Luvvie Ajayi Jones.

00:00:19.716 --> 00:00:20.876
Welcome, Luvvie.

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:22.076
Luvvie Ajayi Jones: Hi!

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:23.756
WPR: Hi, Luvvie. How are you doing?

00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:25.316
LAJ: Doing well. Doing well.

00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:27.996
WPR: Why do you use the term
"professional troublemaker"

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:29.156
to describe yourself?

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:32.196
Why is that sort of the term
that you've landed on
