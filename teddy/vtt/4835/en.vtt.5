00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:32.074
and hungry bacteria.

00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:36.633
In fact, some can even start to feed
on the mucus lining.

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:41.175
We also know that specific foods 
can affect gut bacteria.

00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:43.345
In one recent microbiome study,

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:44.925
scientists found that fruits,

00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:45.864
vegetables,

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:46.614
tea,

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:47.364
coffee,

00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:48.263
red wine,

00:02:48.263 --> 00:02:49.284
and dark chocolate

00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:53.154
were correlated with 
increased bacterial diversity.

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:55.945
These foods contain polyphenols,

00:02:55.945 --> 00:03:00.114
which are naturally occurring 
antioxidant compounds.
