00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:00.962
the rural African group showed
increased inflammation of the colon,

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:03.525
as well as a decrease of butyrate.

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:08.163
That's a short chain fatty acid thought
to lower risk of colon cancer.

00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:11.574
Meanwhile, the group that switched
to a high-fiber, low-fat diet

00:02:11.574 --> 00:02:14.943
had the opposite result.

00:02:14.943 --> 00:02:20.183
So what goes wrong with our gut bacteria 
when we eat low-fiber processed foods?

00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:24.093
Lower fiber means less fuel
for the gut bacteria,

00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:27.583
essentially starving them 
until they die off.

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:29.804
This results in less diversity

00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:32.074
and hungry bacteria.
