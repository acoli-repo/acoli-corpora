which are naturally occurring 
antioxidant compounds.

00:03:00.114 --> 00:03:01.155
On the other hand,

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:02.815
foods high in dairy fat,

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.504
like whole milk, and sugar-sweetened sodas

00:03:05.504 --> 00:03:08.564
were correlated with decreased diversity.

00:03:08.564 --> 00:03:11.055
How food is prepared also matters.

00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:14.524
Minimally processed, fresh foods
generally have more fiber

00:03:14.524 --> 00:03:16.745
and provide better fuel.

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:17.836
So lightly steamed,

00:03:17.836 --> 00:03:18.598
sautéed,

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:19.675
or raw vegetables

00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:23.255
are typically more beneficial
than fried dishes.

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:27.785
There are also ways of preparing food
that can actually introduce good bacteria,

00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:31.454
also known as probiotics,
into your gut.
