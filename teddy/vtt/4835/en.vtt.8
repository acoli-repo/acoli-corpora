That doesn't necessarily mean that
all yogurt is good for us, though.

00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:05.226
Brands with too much sugar
and not enough bacteria

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:07.527
may not actually help.

00:04:07.527 --> 00:04:09.197
These are just general guidelines.

00:04:09.197 --> 00:04:11.816
More research is needed before 
we fully understand

00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:16.687
exactly how any of these foods
interact with our microbiomes.

00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:18.253
We see positive correlations,

00:04:18.253 --> 00:04:23.397
but the insides of our guts are difficult
places to make direct observations.

00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:25.258
For instance, we don't currently know

00:04:25.258 --> 00:04:28.907
whether these foods are directly
responsible for the changes in diversity,

00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:32.381
or if something more complicated
is happening.
