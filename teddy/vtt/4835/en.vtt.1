produce important nutrients,

00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:32.490
regulate the immune system,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.951
and protect against harmful germs.

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:37.560
We don't yet have the blueprint

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.751
for exactly which good bacteria 
a robust gut needs,

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:44.672
but we do know that it's important
for a healthy microbiome

00:00:44.672 --> 00:00:47.511
to have a variety of bacterial species.

00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:49.711
Many factors affect our microbiomes,

00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:51.091
including our environment,

00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:53.270
medications like antibiotics,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.922
and even whether we were delivered
by C-section or not.

00:00:57.922 --> 00:01:01.121
Diet, too, is emerging as one 
of the leading influences
