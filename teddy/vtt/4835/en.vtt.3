and can help prevent inflammation,
which reduces the risk of cancer.

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:36.426
And the more fiber you ingest,

00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:40.904
the more fiber-digesting bacteria
colonize your gut.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:45.123
In a recent study, scientists exchanged
the regular high-fiber diets

00:01:45.123 --> 00:01:47.363
of a group of rural South Africans

00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:52.624
with the high-fat, meat-heavy diets
of a group of African-Americans.

00:01:52.624 --> 00:01:57.054
After just two weeks on the high-fat,
low-fiber, Western-style diet,

00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:00.962
the rural African group showed
increased inflammation of the colon,
