00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:31.322
No longer able to produce sufficient 
energy to maintain its structure,

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:36.862
it collapses under its own gravitational 
pressure and explodes in a supernova.

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:39.972
The star shoots most of its 
innards into space,

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:42.472
seeding the galaxy with heavy elements.

00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:48.222
But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves
behind might be even more remarkable:

00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:51.752
a ball of matter so dense that 
atomic electrons

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:56.265
collapse from their quantum orbits 
into the depths of atomic nuclei.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:59.925
The death of that star 
is the birth of a neutron star:

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:03.295
one of the densest known objects 
in the universe,
