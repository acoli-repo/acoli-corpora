00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:31.435
A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion,

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:34.445
gorging on its more 
loosely bound atmosphere

00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:39.397
before eventually collapsing
cataclysmically into a black hole.

00:03:39.397 --> 00:03:42.098
While many stars exist as binary systems,

00:03:42.098 --> 00:03:46.488
only a small percentage of those end up 
as neutron-star binaries,

00:03:46.488 --> 00:03:52.398
where two neutron stars circle each other 
in a waltz doomed to end as a merger.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:56.508
When they finally collide, they send 
gravity waves through space-time

00:03:56.508 --> 00:04:00.548
like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake.
