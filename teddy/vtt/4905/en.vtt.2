00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:03.295
one of the densest known objects 
in the universe,

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:08.835
and a laboratory for the strange physics 
of supercondensed matter.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.024
But what is a neutron star?

00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:17.124
Think of a compact ball inside of which 
protons and electrons fuse into neutrons

00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:21.084
and form a frictionless liquid 
called a superfluid—

00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:23.274
surrounded by a crust.

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:25.704
This material is incredibly dense –

00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:29.154
the equivalent of the mass of a 
fully-loaded container ship

00:01:29.154 --> 00:01:32.264
squeezed into a human hair,
