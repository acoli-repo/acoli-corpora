00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.792
About once every century,

00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:13.602
a massive star somewhere in our galaxy


00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:15.222
runs out of fuel.

00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:18.722
This happens after millions of years 
of heat and pressure

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:20.962
have fused the star’s hydrogen

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:27.222
into heavier elements like helium,
carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron.

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:31.322
No longer able to produce sufficient 
energy to maintain its structure,
