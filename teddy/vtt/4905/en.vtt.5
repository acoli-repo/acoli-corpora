Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object.

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:37.705
This magnetic concentration
forms vortexes

00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:40.875
that radiate beams 
from the magnetic poles.

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:44.985
Since the poles aren’t always aligned 
with the rotational axis of the star,

00:02:44.985 --> 00:02:48.125
the beams spin like lighthouse beacons,

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:50.875
which appear to blink 
when viewed from Earth.

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:53.235
We call those pulsars.

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:56.815
The detection of one of these 
tantalizing flashing signals
