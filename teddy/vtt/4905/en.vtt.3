00:01:29.154 --> 00:01:32.264
squeezed into a human hair,

00:01:32.264 --> 00:01:37.364
or the mass of Mount Everest 
in a space of a sugar cube.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:41.832
Deeper in the crust, the neutron 
superfluid forms different phases

00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:45.032
that physicists call “nuclear pasta,”

00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:49.362
as it’s squeezed from lasagna 
to spaghetti-like shapes.

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:53.259
The massive precursors to 
neutron stars often spin.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.229
When they collapse,

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.339
stars that are typically millions of 
kilometers wide

00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:02.649
compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across.
