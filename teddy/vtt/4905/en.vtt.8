00:03:56.508 --> 00:04:00.548
like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake.

00:04:00.548 --> 00:04:02.728
Einstein’s theory of General Relativity

00:04:02.728 --> 00:04:07.768
predicted this phenomenon over 100 years
ago, but it wasn't directly verified

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:09.818
until 2017,

00:04:09.818 --> 00:04:14.028
when gravitational-wave observatories 
LIGO and VIRGO

00:04:14.028 --> 00:04:17.018
observed a neutron star collision.

00:04:17.018 --> 00:04:21.271
Other telescopes picked up a burst of 
gamma rays and a flash of light,

00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:26.371
and, later, x-rays and radio signals, 
all from the same impact.

00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:30.501
That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy.
