by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967

00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:04.895
was in fact the way we indirectly
discovered neutron stars

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:06.545
in the first place.

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:12.585
An aging neutron star’s furious rotation
slows over a period of billions of years

00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:18.485
as it radiates away its energy in the form
of electromagnetic and gravity waves.

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:22.055
But not all neutron stars 
disappear so quietly.

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:25.095
For example, we’ve observed binary systems

00:03:25.095 --> 00:03:28.445
where a neutron star 
co-orbits another star.

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:31.435
A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion,
