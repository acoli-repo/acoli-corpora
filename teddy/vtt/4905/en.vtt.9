00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:30.501
That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy.

00:04:30.501 --> 00:04:32.691
It yielded a treasure trove of data

00:04:32.691 --> 00:04:34.906
that’s helped pin down the speed 
of gravity,

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:37.736
bolster important theories 
in astrophysics,

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:43.566
and provide evidence for the origin 
of heavy elements like gold and platinum.

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:47.026
Neutron stars haven’t given up 
all their secrets yet.

00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:51.606
LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded 
to detect more collisions.

00:04:51.606 --> 00:04:53.316
That’ll help us learn what else

00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:58.306
the spectacular demise of these dense, 
pulsating, spinning magnets

00:04:58.306 --> 00:05:02.386
can tell us about the universe.
