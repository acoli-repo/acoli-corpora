00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:02.649
compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.852
But the original star’s angular 
momentum is preserved.

00:02:06.852 --> 00:02:10.362
So for the same reason that a figure 
skater’s spin accelerates

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:12.052
when they bring in their arms,

00:02:12.052 --> 00:02:16.342
the neutron star spins much more 
rapidly than its parent.

00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:22.592
The fastest neutron star on record 
rotates over 700 times every second,

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:26.002
which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.155
at more than a fifth 
of the speed of light.

00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:34.305
Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object.
