00:00:59.587 --> 00:01:01.283
That glucose is then transformed

00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:02.701
into more complex organic molecules

00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:06.845
to form leaves, stems, roots, fruit, and so on.

00:01:06.845 --> 00:01:08.764
The energy stored in these organic molecules

00:01:08.764 --> 00:01:11.557
supports the food chains with which we're familiar.

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:13.950
You've probably seen illustrations like this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.537
or this.

00:01:15.537 --> 00:01:16.981
These green food chains

00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:19.241
start with living plants at their base.

00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:22.034
But in real-life terrestrial ecosystems,

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:23.989
less than 10% of plant matter

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:26.002
is eaten while it's still alive.

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:27.701
What about the other 90?

00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:29.159
Well, just look at the ground

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.326
on an autumn day.
