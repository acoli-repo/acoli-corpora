00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:00.818
but most are eaten only

00:02:00.818 --> 00:02:02.609
when they're dead and rotting.

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.142
And all along this food chain,

00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:06.031
living things shed organic matter

00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:07.655
and expel digestive waste

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:10.700
before dying and leaving their remains to decay.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.246
All that death sounds grim, right?

00:02:13.246 --> 00:02:14.581
But it's not.

00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.584
All detritus is ultimately consumed

00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:18.533
by microbes and other scavengers,

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:21.169
so it actually forms the base of the brown food chain

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.452
that supports many other organisms,

00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:25.368
including us.

00:02:25.368 --> 00:02:26.701
Scientists are learning

00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:27.469
that this detritus

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.712
is an unexpectedly huge energy source,

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:31.885
fueling most natural ecosystems.
