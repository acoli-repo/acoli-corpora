00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:00.002
even us humans.

00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:01.616
You probably don't eat rotting things,

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:03.783
poop, or pond scum directly,

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:06.091
but your food sources probably do.

00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:07.841
Many animals we eat

00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:09.927
either feed directly on detritus themselves,

00:03:09.927 --> 00:03:11.851
like pork, poultry, mushrooms, shellfish,

00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:15.475
or catfish and other bottom feeders,

00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:16.891
or they are fed animal by-products.

00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:19.686
So, if you're thinking nature is full of waste,

00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:20.945
you're right.

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:23.566
But one organism's garbage is another's gold,

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:25.025
and all that rotting dead stuff

00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:27.152
ultimately provides the energy that nourishes us

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:29.070
and most of life on Earth,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.992
as it passes through the food web.
