00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:31.935
are just two or three degrees of separation

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:34.772
from things like pond scum.

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:36.564
All species in an ecosystem,

00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:38.109
from the creatures in a coral reef

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.485
to the fish in a lake

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:40.821
to the lions on the savannah,

00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:42.362
are directly or indirectly

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:44.325
nourished by dead stuff.

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:46.826
Most of the organic matter in our bodies,

00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:48.617
if we trace it back far enough,

00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:50.413
comes from CO2 and water

00:00:50.413 --> 00:00:52.249
through photosynthesis.

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.070
Plants use the energy from sunlight

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.178
to transform carbon dioxide and water from the environment

00:00:57.178 --> 00:00:59.587
into glucose and oxygen.

00:00:59.587 --> 00:01:01.283
That glucose is then transformed
