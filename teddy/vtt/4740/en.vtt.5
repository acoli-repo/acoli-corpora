WEBVTT

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:31.885
fueling most natural ecosystems.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.182
But the interactions within an ecosystem

00:02:34.182 --> 00:02:36.476
are even more complex than that.

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:38.118
What a food chain really represents

00:02:38.118 --> 00:02:40.651
is a single pathway of energy flow.

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:42.694
And within any ecosystem,

00:02:42.694 --> 00:02:43.859
many of these flows

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:44.987
are linked together

00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:46.363
to form a rich network of interactions,

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:48.739
or food web,

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.243
with dead matter supporting that network at every step.

00:02:52.243 --> 00:02:53.538
The resulting food web

00:02:53.538 --> 00:02:54.617
is so connected

00:02:54.617 --> 00:02:55.829
that almost every species

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.032
is no more than two degrees from detritus,

00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:00.002
even us humans.
