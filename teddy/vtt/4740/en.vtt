If someone called you scum,

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:11.451
you'd probably be offended,

00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:12.868
but scientifically,

00:00:12.868 --> 00:00:14.451
they might not be far off.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:15.503
Have you ever thought about

00:00:15.503 --> 00:00:17.367
where your food comes from?

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:18.721
You might say it comes from

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:20.404
plants, animals, or even fungi,

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:21.960
but you'd probably rather not

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.720
think about the rotting organisms and poop

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.867
that feed those plants, animals, and fungi.

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:29.352
So really, you and most of the matter in your body

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:31.935
are just two or three degrees of separation
