00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.326
on an autumn day.

00:01:30.326 --> 00:01:32.079
Living plants shed dead body parts:

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.748
fallen leaves, broken branches,

00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:35.501
and even underground roots.

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:36.919
Many plants are lucky enough

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:38.617
to go their whole lives without being eaten,

00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:41.254
eventually dying and leaving remains.

00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:44.540
All of these uneaten, undigested, and dead plant parts,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.200
that 90% of terrestrial plant matter?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.846
That becomes detritus,

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:51.700
the base of what we call the brown food chain,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.034
which looks more like this.

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:55.475
What happens to plants

00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:58.064
also happens to all other organisms up the food chain:

00:01:58.064 --> 00:01:59.398
some are eaten alive,

00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:00.818
but most are eaten only
