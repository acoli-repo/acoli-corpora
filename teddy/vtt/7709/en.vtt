(Applause)

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
David Gallo: This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we're not going to show you any of it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The truth of the matter is that the Titanic --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
it's not the most exciting story from the sea.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
When you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.
