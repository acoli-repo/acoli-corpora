A few years ago,

00:00:02.413 --> 00:00:04.190
an American defense consultant I know

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:06.587
told me about a trip
he took to Uzbekistan.

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:09.325
His role there was to help sell technology

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.016
that the Uzbek government could use
to spy on its own citizens.

00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:15.889
He eventually shared with me
the marketing material

00:00:15.913 --> 00:00:18.032
he'd presented to the Uzbek government.

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:23.082
One glossy brochure featured technology
that could not just intercept phone calls,

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.689
but identify the caller,

00:00:24.713 --> 00:00:27.164
regardless of what phone number
they were using,

00:00:27.188 --> 00:00:29.283
based on their unique voiceprint,

00:00:29.307 --> 00:00:32.577
and then identify their exact
geographic location.
