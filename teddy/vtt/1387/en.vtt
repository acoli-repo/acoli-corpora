00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A few months ago,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in a hospital close to where I live,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and she was brought in confused.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Her blood pressure was an alarming

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
230 over 170.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Within a few minutes, she went into cardiac collapse.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
She was resuscitated, stabilized,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
whisked over to a CAT scan suite

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
right next to the emergency room,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the CAT scan revealed

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
no blood clots in the lung,
