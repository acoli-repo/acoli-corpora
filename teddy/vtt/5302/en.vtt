00:00:06.446 --> 00:00:09.026
From 2016 to 2019,

00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:13.321
meteorologists saw record-breaking
heat waves around the globe,

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.821
rampant wildfires 
in California and Australia,

00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:21.801
and the longest run 
of category 5 tropical cyclones on record.

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:26.611
The number of extreme weather events
has been increasing for the last 40 years,

00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:30.521
and current predictions suggest 
that trend will continue.
