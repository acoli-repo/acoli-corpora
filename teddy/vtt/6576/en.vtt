Paula Stone Williams: So, I was the CEO
of a large, religious nonprofit,

00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:10.222
spoke at some of the largest
churches in America,

00:00:10.246 --> 00:00:13.700
was on television in 70 different markets,

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:16.464
but more than anything else,

00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:19.154
I just wanted to be a good parent.

00:00:19.577 --> 00:00:21.284
I told all three of my children,

00:00:21.308 --> 00:00:23.237
"When the going gets tough,

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:26.351
you have to choose the road less traveled,

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:27.669
the narrow path."

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:32.765
I had no idea how difficult
that was going to become.
