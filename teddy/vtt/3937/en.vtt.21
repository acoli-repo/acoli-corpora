00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.096
have told me that the show
has changed their lives,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.136
how it helped them
shift their relationship

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.496
to their own and other people's bodies,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.280
and how it made them confront
their own bias.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.776
But of course, work
that pushes people's buttons

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.000
is not without its detractors.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.296
I have been told
that I'm glorifying obesity.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.816
I have received violent death threats

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.296
and abuse for daring to make work
that centers fat people's bodies and lives

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.840
and treats us as worthwhile human beings
with valuable stories to tell.
