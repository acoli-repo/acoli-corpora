The very idea of a fat dance work

was, to put it mildly, controversial,

because nothing like it had ever been done
on mainstream dance stages before

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.960
anywhere in the world.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.960
People were skeptical.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.376
"What do you mean, 'fat dancers?'

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.800
