00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.416
to how we value ourselves and each other

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.176
that we rarely question why
we have such contempt for people of size

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.040
and where that disdain comes from.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.896
But we must question it,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.096
because the enormous value
we place on how we look

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.240
affects every one of us.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.536
And do we really want to live in a society

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.496
where people are denied
their basic humanity

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.480
if they don't subscribe
to some arbitrary form of acceptable?
