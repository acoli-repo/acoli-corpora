00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.976
like capitalism, patriarchy and racism,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.776
and that can make it
really difficult to see,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.080
let alone challenge.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.256
We live in a culture

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.256
where being fat
is seen as being a bad person --

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.096
lazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.600
and morally suspect.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.016
And we tend to see thinness

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.240
as being universally good --

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.056
responsible, successful,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.440
and in control of our appetites,
bodies and lives.
