In other words, "Jeopardy!" doesn't ask
many different types of questions,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.227
but a single type,

00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:35.787
which we call "factoid questions."

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:39.142
By the way, do you know the answer?

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.035
If you do not know the answer
and if you want to know the answer,

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.346
what would you do?

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.292
You Google, right? Of course.

00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:52.796
Why not?

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.412
But you have to pick appropriate keywords

00:03:56.436 --> 00:04:00.800
like "Mozart," "last"
and "symphony" to search.
