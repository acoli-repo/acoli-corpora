Yes! It is now executing
symbolic computation.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.610
Even more weird,

00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:38.459
but probably this is the most
fun part for the machine.

00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:40.834
(Laughter)

00:07:40.858 --> 00:07:43.673
Now it outputs a perfect answer,

00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:48.404
though its proof is impossible to read,
even for mathematicians.

00:07:50.773 --> 00:07:57.734
Anyway, last year our robot
was among the top one percent

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:01.832
in the second stage written
exam in mathematics.
