00:04:56.433 --> 00:05:00.482
Our Todai Robot works similarly,
but a bit smarter

00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:03.745
in answering history yes-no questions,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.223
like, "'Charlemagne repelled the Magyars.'
Is this sentence true or false?"

00:05:11.181 --> 00:05:15.254
Our robot starts producing
a factoid question,

00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:20.177
like: "Charlemagne repelled
[this person type]" by itself.

00:05:20.995 --> 00:05:25.727
Then, "Avars" but not
"Magyars" is ranked top.

00:05:26.357 --> 00:05:29.406
This sentence is likely to be false.
