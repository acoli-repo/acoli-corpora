Why did I take the entrance exam
as its benchmark?

00:02:07.098 --> 00:02:11.839
Because I thought we had to study
the performance of AI

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:13.977
in comparison to humans,

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.861
especially on the skills and expertise

00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:20.973
which are believed
to be acquired only by humans

00:02:20.997 --> 00:02:23.332
and only through education.
