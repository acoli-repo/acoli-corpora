00:05:30.772 --> 00:05:35.632
Our robot does not read,
does not understand,

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:40.479
but it is statistically
correct in many cases.

00:05:42.147 --> 00:05:44.655
For the second stage written test,

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:49.785
it is required to write
a 600-word essay like this one:

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:52.087
[Discuss the rise and fall
of the maritime trade

00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:54.533
in East and Southeast Asia
in the 17th century ...]

00:05:54.557 --> 00:05:55.944
and as I have shown earlier,

00:05:55.968 --> 00:06:00.162
our robot took the sentences
from the textbooks and Wikipedia,
