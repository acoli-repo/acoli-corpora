So let me first explain
how modern AI works,

00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:03.404
taking the "Jeopardy!" challenge
as an example.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.618
Here is a typical "Jeopardy!" question:

00:03:08.642 --> 00:03:13.103
"Mozart's last symphony
shares its name with this planet."

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:18.208
Interestingly, a "Jeopardy!"
question always asks,

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:21.560
always ends with "this" something:

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:24.411
"this" planet, "this" country,

00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:27.043
"this" rock musician, and so on.

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:31.366
In other words, "Jeopardy!" doesn't ask
many different types of questions,
