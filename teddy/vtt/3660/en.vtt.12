00:05:55.968 --> 00:06:00.162
our robot took the sentences
from the textbooks and Wikipedia,

00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:02.147
combined them together,

00:06:02.171 --> 00:06:05.790
and optimized it to produce an essay

00:06:05.814 --> 00:06:08.021
without understanding a thing.

00:06:08.045 --> 00:06:09.782
(Laughter)

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:14.701
But surprisingly, it wrote a better essay

00:06:14.725 --> 00:06:16.286
than most of the students.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.701
(Laughter)

00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:20.254
How about mathematics?

00:06:21.354 --> 00:06:24.512
A fully automatic math-solving machine

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:26.167
has been a dream

00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:30.870
since the birth of the word
"artificial intelligence,"
