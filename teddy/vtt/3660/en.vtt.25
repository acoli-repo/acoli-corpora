what they can do amazingly

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.715
and what they can't do.

But -- do I read you right,

00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:41.527
that you think we really need

00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:56.047
That is something
which is very, very lacking in AI.

00:12:56.071 --> 00:13:00.439
But most of the students
just pack the knowledge
