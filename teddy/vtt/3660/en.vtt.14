00:06:57.674 --> 00:07:02.071
and we had to teach it
2,000 mathematical axioms

00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:04.869
and 8,000 Japanese words

00:07:04.893 --> 00:07:09.451
to make it accept the problems
written in natural language.

00:07:10.234 --> 00:07:13.776
And it is now translating
the original problems

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.939
into machine-readable formulas.

00:07:18.578 --> 00:07:24.677
Weird, but it is now ready
to solve it, I think.

00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:26.112
Go and solve it.

00:07:26.818 --> 00:07:31.102
Yes! It is now executing
symbolic computation.
