Today, I'm going to talk about AI and us.

AI researchers have always said

00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:14.571
because only menial jobs
will be taken over by machines.

00:00:15.274 --> 00:00:16.877
Is that really true?

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:22.192
They have also said
that AI will create new jobs,

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:25.627
so those who lose their jobs
will find a new one.

00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:27.619
Of course.

00:00:27.643 --> 00:00:29.815

who may lose their jobs to AI
