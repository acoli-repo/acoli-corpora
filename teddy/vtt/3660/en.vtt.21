Here is an example:

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.708
[Buddhism spread to ... ,
Christianity to ... and Oceania,

00:10:34.732 --> 00:10:35.883
and Islam to ...]

00:10:35.907 --> 00:10:38.647
Of course, the original problems
are written in Japanese,

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:39.826
their mother tongue.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.365
[ ______ has spread to Oceania.

00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:43.806
1. Hinduism 2. Christianity
3. Islam 4. Buddhism ]

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.129
Obviously, Christianity
is the answer, isn't it?

00:10:46.153 --> 00:10:47.367
It's written!

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:53.508
And Todai Robot chose
the correct answer, too.

00:10:54.758 --> 00:10:59.637
But one-third of junior
high school students

00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:02.273
failed to answer this question.
