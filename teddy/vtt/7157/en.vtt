Cloe Shasha Brooks: Hello, Sahaj,
welcome, thanks for joining us.

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:10.297
Sahaj Kaur Kohli: Thank you for having me,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.930
I'm so excited to be here.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.063
CSB: I'm so excited
to be speaking with you.

00:00:14.063 --> 00:00:16.597
So you are a mental health
therapist in training

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.597
and the founder of Brown Girl Therapy,

00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:21.363
a community you started
to allow the children of immigrants

00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:23.863
to speak openly
about mental health issues.

00:00:23.863 --> 00:00:26.263
And one theme I've noticed
in the content you share

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:29.663
is the guilt frequently experienced
by people with immigrant parents.

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:31.597
Can you talk more about that guilt?
