00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
They'll do whatever it takes to survive,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
even if that means undermining other people.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Now, my birthday is coming up shortly,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and my driver's license expires.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I will be walking into what we call

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
a Stage Two tribe,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
which looks like this.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
(Laughter)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
across the land, you find a Stage Two culture?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
No. But in the one near me,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
where I have to go in just a few days,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
what I will say when I'm standing in line is,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"
