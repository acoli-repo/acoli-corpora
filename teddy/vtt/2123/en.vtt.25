00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
he was Chief of Police in San Francisco.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And he grew up essentially in Stage One.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And you know what changed his life? It was walking into

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
one of these, a Boys and Girls Club.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Now here is what happened to this person

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
He went from being alive and passionate

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
at Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" --

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
to walking into a Boys and Girls Club,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
folding his arms, sitting down in a chair,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I don't know anybody.
