00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But not just work. It's within these tribes

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that societies get built,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that important things happen.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
from various tribal councils that met,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
also known as Super Bowl parties,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We said, "The tribes that we're in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
are saying it's going to be Obama."

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now, the reason we knew that

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
was because we spent the previous 10 years

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.
