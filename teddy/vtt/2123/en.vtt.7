This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But it's one that I think we need to learn from.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Stage One produces people

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
who do horrible things.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Stage One is a group where people

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
systematically sever relationships from functional tribes,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and then pool together

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
with people who think like they do.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Stage One is literally the culture of gangs

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and it is the culture of prisons.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And I want to make the point

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that as members of society, we need to.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It's not enough to simply write people off.
