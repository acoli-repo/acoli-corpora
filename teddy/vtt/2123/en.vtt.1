WEBVTT

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the reason that this date was so momentous

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is that what my colleagues, John King

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
is that it seemed to us

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that across the United States,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
if you will, tribal councils had convened.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And they had discussed things of great national importance.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.
