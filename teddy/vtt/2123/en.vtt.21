00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great."

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
that come out of all this.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and actually read it,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
the phrase that sticks in many of our minds

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
is things about inalienable rights.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
oriented only by our values,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
no other guidance.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
also known as King George.
