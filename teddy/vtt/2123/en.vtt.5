00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
If you focus in on a group like this --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
this happens to be a USC game --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and do magnification factors so you could see individual people,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
you would in fact see not a single crowd,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
just like there is not a single crowd here,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And from a distance it appears that it's a single group.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And so people form tribes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
They always have. They always will.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Just as fish swim and birds fly,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
people form tribes. It's just what we do.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But here's the rub.
