00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
people form tribes. It's just what we do.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But here's the rub.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Not all tribes are the same,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and what makes the difference is the culture.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Now here is the net out of this.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You're all a member of tribes.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and nudge them forward,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
along these tribal stages

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But we're going to start with what we call Stage One.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Now, this is the lowest of the stages.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You don't want this. Okay?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But it's one that I think we need to learn from.
