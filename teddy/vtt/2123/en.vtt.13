And one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
in the New England Journal of Medicine?"

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And the other said, "No. That's great. Congratulations!"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
"Well while you were, you know, doing your research," --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
notice the condescending tone --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."

And the third one got the same wry smile and said,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
"Well, while you were off doing your research,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that eventually we'll train monkeys to do,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,
