00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Notice people are applauding for us.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
they probably wouldn't applaud.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
But you'll notice the level of excitement.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Notice, again, how they decorate their office.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Now, what's important to people at Zappos,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
these may not be the things that are important to you.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But they value things like fun. And they value creativity.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
One of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.
