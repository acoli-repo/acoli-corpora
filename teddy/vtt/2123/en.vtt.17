00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So when individuals come together

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and find something that unites them

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that's greater than their individual competence,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
then something very important happens.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
The group gels. And it changes

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
from a group of highly motivated

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
but fairly individually-centric people

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
into something larger,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
There is, in fact, another stage.
