00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
You know they do polls, right?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Pretty much everybody else who does polls.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
So, they were bored.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
"How could we,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
instead of just polling what Asia thinks

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
or what the United States thinks,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
or who thinks what about Obama

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
versus McCain or something like that,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
what does the entire world think?"

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.
