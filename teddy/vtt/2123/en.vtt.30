00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
what does the entire world think?"

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
They had people involved who were Nobel laureates

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
in economics, who reported being bored.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the population

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
of Sub-Saharan Africa?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and speak languages we don't speak,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
to achieve on this great mission,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
we have to be able to do it.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Incidentally, they did pull it off.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And they released the first-ever world poll.
