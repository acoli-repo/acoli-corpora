What we're really here to talk about is the "how."

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay, so how exactly do we create this

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
world-shattering, if you will, innovation?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now, I want to tell you a quick story.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We'll go back a little more than a year.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In fact, the date -- I'm curious to know

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if any of you know what happened on this momentous date?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It was February 3rd, 2008.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Anyone remember what happened,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
February 3rd, 2008?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the reason that this date was so momentous
