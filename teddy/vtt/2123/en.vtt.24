00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
get to Stage Five.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And those are the ones that change the world.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
So the first little finding from this

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
so that you can touch every person in society.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
So we have to have the ability to talk

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
all the levels, to go to where they are.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And then leaders nudge people

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
within their tribes to the next level.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I'd like to show you some examples of this.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that
