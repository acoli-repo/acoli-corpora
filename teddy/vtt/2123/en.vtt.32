00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
You remember to talk all five culture stages.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Because we've got people in all five, around us.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Will your tribes change the world?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
