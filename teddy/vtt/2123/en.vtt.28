00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
See, people who build world-changing tribes do that.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
They extend the reach of their tribes

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
by connecting them, not just to myself,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
so that my following is greater,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
but I connect people who don't know each other

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
to something greater than themselves.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And ultimately that adds to their values.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
which is great, to Stage Five?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
a place called the Gallup Organization.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
You know they do polls, right?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?
