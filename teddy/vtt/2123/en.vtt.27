WEBVTT

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and as we unite around these values,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
something really interesting begins to emerge.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
If you want this experience to live on

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
as something historic,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
beyond what people normally do

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and call networking.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Which is not just to meet new people

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and extend your reach, extend your influence,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
but instead, find someone you don't know,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and find someone else you don't know,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and introduce them.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
That's called a triadic relationship.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
See, people who build world-changing tribes do that.
