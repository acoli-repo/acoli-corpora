00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to people in your tribe, in effect,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
"My life sucks.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does."

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
What kind of innovation would get done?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
In fact it would be basically nil.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
that hits closest to home for many of us.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And we park. And we stay.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."
