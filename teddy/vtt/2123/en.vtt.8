00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It's not enough to simply write people off.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But let's move on to Stage Two.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks."

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So, this other book that Steve mentioned,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance,"

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
argue that as people see the world, so they behave.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
then their behavior will follow automatically from that.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It will be despairing hostility.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
They'll do whatever it takes to survive,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
even if that means undermining other people.
