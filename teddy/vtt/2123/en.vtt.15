00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It is moving from Stage Three

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to Stage Four.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Let's take a look at a quick video snippet.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And my question on the other side is just going to be,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
"What do you think they value?"

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
This is their lobby.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.
