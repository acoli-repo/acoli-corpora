00:02:27.328 --> 00:02:30.400
we're still blessed
with a relatively blank canvas

00:02:30.424 --> 00:02:33.608
that we can fill with the most
fanciful adventures

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:36.079
and incredible experiences.

00:02:36.103 --> 00:02:40.047
It's just a matter of how far
our imagination will take us.

00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:42.601
See, a lot of people
look at this and they say,

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:44.403
"Oh yeah, wow, that's a pretty tree."

00:02:44.427 --> 00:02:45.898
But I don't just see a tree --

00:02:45.922 --> 00:02:48.501
I look at this and I see opportunity.

00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:50.122
I see an entire weekend.

00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:53.759
Because when I was a kid,
these were the types of images

00:02:53.783 --> 00:02:56.251
that got me off the sofa
and dared me to explore,

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:57.716
dared me to go find the woods

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.635
and put my head underwater
and see what we have.
