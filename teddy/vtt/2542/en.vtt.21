00:10:29.985 --> 00:10:32.048
but to also get personally
connected to it,

00:10:32.072 --> 00:10:35.347
I decided to break the story down
into several different narratives.

00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:38.159
And I wanted that story to start
in Lake Okeechobee,

00:10:38.183 --> 00:10:40.930
the beating heart of the Everglade system.

00:10:40.954 --> 00:10:43.417
And to do that, I picked an ambassador,

00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:44.690
an iconic species.

00:10:45.204 --> 00:10:47.196
This is the Everglade snail kite.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.966
It's a great bird,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.864
and they used to nest in the thousands,

00:10:50.888 --> 00:10:52.691
thousands in the northern Everglades.

00:10:52.715 --> 00:10:56.219
And then they've gone down
to about 400 nesting pairs today.

00:10:56.243 --> 00:10:57.588
And why is that?

00:10:57.612 --> 00:11:00.736
Well, it's because they eat
one source of food, an apple snail,
