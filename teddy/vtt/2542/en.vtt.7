But they're missing out on those
fundamental connections

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.292
that create a real sense
of pride and ownership

00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:36.419
for the place that they call home.

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:40.290
And this is compounded by the issue
that the landscapes

00:03:40.314 --> 00:03:42.423
that define our natural heritage

00:03:42.447 --> 00:03:45.423
and fuel our aquifer
for our drinking water

00:03:45.447 --> 00:03:49.890
have been deemed as scary
and dangerous and spooky.

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.082
When our ancestors first came here,

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:54.742
they warned, "Stay out
of these areas, they're haunted.

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:57.863
They're full of evil spirits and ghosts."

00:03:57.887 --> 00:04:00.233
I don't know where
they came up with that idea.
