I don't know where
they came up with that idea.

00:04:00.804 --> 00:04:03.436
But it's actually led
to a very real disconnect,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.221
a very real negative mentality

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.823
that has kept the public
disinterested, silent,

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:11.412
and ultimately, our environment at risk.

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:15.975
We're a state that's surrounded
and defined by water,

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:17.275
and yet for centuries,

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.192
swamps and wetlands have been regarded

00:04:19.216 --> 00:04:21.923
as these obstacles to overcome.

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:26.349
And so we've treated them
as these second-class ecosystems,

00:04:26.373 --> 00:04:28.637
because they have
very little monetary value

00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:32.346
and of course, they're known
to harbor alligators and snakes --
