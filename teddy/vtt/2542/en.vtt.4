00:01:59.674 --> 00:02:02.522
And I fell in love
with adventure and discovery,

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:04.603
going to explore
all these different places

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:06.920
that were just minutes
from my front doorstep.

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:09.532
There are a lot
of beautiful places to find.

00:02:09.872 --> 00:02:12.174
Despite all these years that have passed,

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.492
I still see the world
through the eyes of a child

00:02:14.516 --> 00:02:17.369
and I try to incorporate
that sense of wonderment

00:02:17.393 --> 00:02:22.074
and that sense of curiosity
into my photography

00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:23.848
as often as I can.

00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.304
And we're pretty lucky
because here in the South,

00:02:27.328 --> 00:02:30.400
we're still blessed
with a relatively blank canvas
