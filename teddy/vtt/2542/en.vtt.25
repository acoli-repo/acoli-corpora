00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:33.394
(Mac Stone in film) Oh my gosh,
I can't believe it!]

00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:36.292
You can believe how excited I was
when that happened.

00:12:36.316 --> 00:12:37.656
But what the idea was,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.879
is that for someone
who's never seen this bird

00:12:39.903 --> 00:12:41.973
and has no reason to care about it,

00:12:41.997 --> 00:12:44.622
these photos, these new perspectives,

00:12:44.646 --> 00:12:47.768
will help shed a little new light
on just one species

00:12:47.792 --> 00:12:52.074
that makes this watershed
so incredible, so valuable, so important.

00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:55.538
Now, I know I can't come
here to Gainesville

00:12:55.562 --> 00:12:57.808
and talk to you about animals
in the Everglades

00:12:57.832 --> 00:12:59.620
without talking about gators.

00:12:59.644 --> 00:13:01.934
I love gators, I grew up loving gators.
