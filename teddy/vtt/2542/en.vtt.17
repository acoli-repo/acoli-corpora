00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:30.933
until going further south
into the mangrove swamps,

00:08:30.957 --> 00:08:34.707
and then finally -- finally --
reaching Florida Bay,

00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:36.504
the emerald gem of the Everglades,

00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:37.711
the great estuary,

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:39.988
the 850 square-mile estuary.

00:08:40.464 --> 00:08:44.797
So sure, the national park
is the southern end of this system,

00:08:44.821 --> 00:08:48.124
but all the things that make it unique
are these inputs that come in,

00:08:48.148 --> 00:08:50.955
the fresh water that starts
100 miles north.

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:54.244
So no manner of these political
or invisible boundaries

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:58.655
protect the park from polluted water
or insufficient water.

00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:02.068
And unfortunately, that's precisely
what we've done.
