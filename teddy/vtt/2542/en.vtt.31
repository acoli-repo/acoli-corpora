00:15:28.637 --> 00:15:33.286
shooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 --

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.066
just as that started happening, we started
draining the southern Everglades.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.594
And we stopped two-thirds
of that water from moving south.

00:15:40.618 --> 00:15:43.117
And it had drastic consequences.

00:15:43.584 --> 00:15:46.198
And just as those numbers
started reaching their peak,

00:15:46.222 --> 00:15:49.295
unfortunately, today,
the real spoonbill story,

00:15:49.319 --> 00:15:53.936
the real photo of what it looks like
is more something like this.

00:15:55.007 --> 00:15:59.623
And we're down to less than 70
nesting pairs in Florida Bay today,

00:15:59.647 --> 00:16:02.191
because we've disrupted
the system so much.
