00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:32.346
and of course, they're known
to harbor alligators and snakes --

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.668
which, I'll admit, these aren't
the most cuddly of ambassadors.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:36.828
(Laughter)

00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:39.630
So it became assumed, then,
that the only good swamp

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:40.972
was a drained swamp.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.515
And in fact,

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.950
draining a swamp to make way
for agriculture and development

00:04:45.974 --> 00:04:49.887
was considered the very essence
of conservation not too long ago.

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:52.068
But now we're backpedaling,

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:55.443
because the more we come to learn
about these sodden landscapes,

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:57.433
the more secrets we're starting to unlock

00:04:57.457 --> 00:04:59.820
about interspecies relationships

00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:04.394
and the connectivity of habitats,
watersheds and flyways.
