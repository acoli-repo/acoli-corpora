Well, it's because they eat
one source of food, an apple snail,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.161
about the size of a ping-pong ball,
an aquatic gastropod.

00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:07.410
So as we started damming up
the Everglades,

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:10.911
as we started diking Lake Okeechobee
and draining the wetlands,

00:11:10.935 --> 00:11:13.047
we lost the habitat for the snail.

00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:15.863
And thus, the population
of the kites declined.

00:11:16.454 --> 00:11:19.950
And so, I wanted a photo that would
not only communicate this relationship

00:11:19.974 --> 00:11:23.063
between wetland, snail and bird,

00:11:23.087 --> 00:11:25.336
but I also wanted a photo
that would communicate

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.154
how incredible this relationship was,

00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:32.334
and how very important it is
that they've come to depend on each other,
