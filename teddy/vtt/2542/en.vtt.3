00:01:27.773 --> 00:01:30.171
Now the majority of us
aren't going to willingly go

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:31.847
way down to a swamp.

00:01:32.638 --> 00:01:36.232
So how can we still expect
those same people to then advocate

00:01:36.256 --> 00:01:37.974
on behalf of their protection?

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.584
We can't.

00:01:39.608 --> 00:01:43.853
So my job, then, is to use photography
as a communication tool,

00:01:43.877 --> 00:01:47.852
to help bridge the gap
between the science and the aesthetics,

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:49.494
to get people talking,

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:50.887
to get them thinking,

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:52.568
and to hopefully, ultimately,

00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:53.983
get them caring.

00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.751
I started doing this 15 years ago
right here in Gainesville,

00:01:57.775 --> 00:01:59.650
right here in my backyard.

00:01:59.674 --> 00:02:02.522
And I fell in love
with adventure and discovery,
