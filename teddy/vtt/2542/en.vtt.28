00:13:59.203 --> 00:14:00.967
(Laughter)

00:14:01.955 --> 00:14:03.915
I still have all my fingers, it's cool.

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.379
But I understand, I know
I'm not going to rally you guys,

00:14:07.403 --> 00:14:11.013
I'm not going to rally the troops to
"Save the Everglades for the gators!"

00:14:11.037 --> 00:14:13.235
It won't happen because
they're so ubiquitous,

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:14.410
we see them now,

00:14:14.434 --> 00:14:17.776
they're one of the great conservation
success stories of the US.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.126
But there is one species in the Everglades
that no matter who you are,

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.229
you can't help but love, too,
and that's the roseate spoonbill.

00:14:24.253 --> 00:14:27.884
These birds are great, but they've had
a really tough time in the Everglades,

00:14:27.908 --> 00:14:31.374
because they started out with thousands
of nesting pairs in Florida Bay,
