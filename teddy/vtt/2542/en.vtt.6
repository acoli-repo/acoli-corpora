WEBVTT

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.635
and put my head underwater
and see what we have.

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:04.234
And folks, I've been photographing
all over the world

00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:05.599
and I promise you,

00:03:05.623 --> 00:03:07.118
what we have here in the South,

00:03:07.142 --> 00:03:08.823
what we have in the Sunshine State,

00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:11.142
rivals anything else that I've seen.

00:03:11.943 --> 00:03:15.955

promoting all the wrong things.

00:03:16.698 --> 00:03:19.429
Before most kids are 12,
they'll have been to Disney World

00:03:19.453 --> 00:03:21.414
more times than they've been in a canoe

00:03:21.438 --> 00:03:24.280
or camping under a starry sky.

00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:28.363
And I have nothing against Disney
or Mickey; I used to go there, too.

00:03:28.387 --> 00:03:31.046
But they're missing out on those
fundamental connections
