I love gators, I grew up loving gators.

00:13:02.361 --> 00:13:05.777
My parents always said I had
an unhealthy relationship with gators.

00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:07.269
But what I like about them is,

00:13:07.293 --> 00:13:09.897
they're like the freshwater
equivalent of sharks.

00:13:09.921 --> 00:13:11.569
They're feared, they're hated,

00:13:11.593 --> 00:13:13.957
and they are tragically misunderstood.

00:13:14.386 --> 00:13:18.150
Because these are a unique species,
they're not just apex predators.

00:13:18.174 --> 00:13:19.464
In the Everglades,

00:13:19.488 --> 00:13:21.982
they are the very architects
of the Everglades,

00:13:22.006 --> 00:13:24.149
because as the water drops
down in the winter

00:13:24.173 --> 00:13:25.331
during the dry season,

00:13:25.355 --> 00:13:28.377
they start excavating these holes
called gator holes.

00:13:28.401 --> 00:13:30.711
And they do this because
as the water drops down,
