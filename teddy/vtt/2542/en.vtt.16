00:07:57.171 --> 00:08:00.200
that's roughly a third the size
the state of Florida, it's huge.

00:08:00.224 --> 00:08:01.501
And when I say Everglades,

00:08:01.525 --> 00:08:03.993
most people are like,
"Oh, yeah, the national park."

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:09.030
But the Everglades is not just a park;
it's an entire watershed,

00:08:09.054 --> 00:08:12.059
starting with the Kissimmee
chain of lakes in the north,

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:14.308
and then as the rains
would fall in the summer,

00:08:14.332 --> 00:08:16.964
these downpours would flow
into Lake Okeechobee,

00:08:16.988 --> 00:08:20.235
and Lake Okeechobee would fill up
and it would overflow its banks

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:23.533
and spill southward, ever slowly,
with the topography,

00:08:23.557 --> 00:08:26.153
and get into the river of grass,
the Sawgrass Prairies,

00:08:26.177 --> 00:08:28.222
before meting into the cypress slews,

00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:30.933
until going further south
into the mangrove swamps,
