00:09:29.255 --> 00:09:31.280
But I'll show you
these beautiful pictures,

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:32.765
because it gets you on board.

00:09:32.789 --> 00:09:35.917
And while I have your attention,
I can tell you the real story.

00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:37.892
It's that we're taking this,

00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:40.879
and we're trading it for this,

00:09:40.903 --> 00:09:42.398
at an alarming rate.

00:09:43.358 --> 00:09:45.068
And what's lost on so many people

00:09:45.092 --> 00:09:47.603
is the sheer scale
of which we're discussing.

00:09:47.627 --> 00:09:51.055
Because the Everglades is not just
responsible for the drinking water

00:09:51.079 --> 00:09:53.283
for 7 million Floridians;

00:09:53.307 --> 00:09:55.845
today it also provides
the agricultural fields

00:09:55.869 --> 00:09:58.428
for the year-round tomatoes and oranges

00:09:58.452 --> 00:10:01.283
for over 300 million Americans.
