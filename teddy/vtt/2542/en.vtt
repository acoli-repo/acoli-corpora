00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:02.714
So I've had the great privilege

00:00:02.738 --> 00:00:05.154
of traveling to some incredible places,

00:00:05.178 --> 00:00:09.412
photographing these distant landscapes
and remote cultures

00:00:09.436 --> 00:00:10.862
all over the world.

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:12.296
I love my job.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.885
But people think it's
this string of epiphanies

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.398
and sunrises and rainbows,

00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:20.186
when in reality, it looks
more something like this.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.432
(Laughter)

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:22.981
This is my office.

00:00:23.473 --> 00:00:26.104
We can't afford the fanciest places
to stay at night,

00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:28.966
so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors.

00:00:29.365 --> 00:00:30.794
As long as we can stay dry,
