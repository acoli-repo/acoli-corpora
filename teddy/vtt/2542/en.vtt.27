00:13:28.401 --> 00:13:30.711
And they do this because
as the water drops down,

00:13:30.735 --> 00:13:34.122
they'll be able to stay wet
and they'll be able to forage.

00:13:34.645 --> 00:13:36.964
And now this isn't just affecting them,

00:13:36.988 --> 00:13:39.221
other animals also depend
on this relationship,

00:13:39.245 --> 00:13:41.923
so they become a keystone species as well.

00:13:42.677 --> 00:13:46.912
So how do you make an apex predator,
an ancient reptile,

00:13:46.936 --> 00:13:49.414
at once look like it dominates the system,

00:13:49.438 --> 00:13:51.881
but at the same time, look vulnerable?

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:56.749
Well, you wade into a pit
of about 120 of them,

00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:59.179
then you hope that you've made
the right decision.

00:13:59.203 --> 00:14:00.967
