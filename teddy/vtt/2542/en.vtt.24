00:11:59.131 --> 00:12:02.847
wading waist-deep,
9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk,

00:12:02.871 --> 00:12:06.031
to get one image that I thought
might communicate this.

00:12:06.055 --> 00:12:08.270
And here's the day that it finally worked:

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:11.151
[Video: (Mac Stone narrating)
After setting up the platform,

00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:13.712
I look off and I see a kite
coming over the cattails.

00:12:13.736 --> 00:12:15.658
And I see him scanning and searching.

00:12:15.682 --> 00:12:17.287
And he gets right over the trap,

00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:18.832
and I see that he's seen it.

00:12:18.856 --> 00:12:21.579
And he beelines,
he goes straight for the trap.

00:12:21.603 --> 00:12:24.759
And in that moment,
all those months of planning, waiting,

00:12:24.783 --> 00:12:26.893
all the sunburn, mosquito bites --

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:29.455
suddenly, they're all worth it.

00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:33.394
(Mac Stone in film) Oh my gosh,
I can't believe it!]
