00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:04.394
and the connectivity of habitats,
watersheds and flyways.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.025
Take this bird, for example:

00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:08.937
this is the prothonotary warbler.

00:05:08.961 --> 00:05:11.147
I love this bird because
it's a swamp bird,

00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:12.875
through and through, a swamp bird.

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:16.547
They nest and they mate and they breed
in these old-growth swamps

00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:18.035
in these flooded forests.

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:20.607
And so after the spring,
after they raise their young,

00:05:20.631 --> 00:05:23.436
they then fly thousand of miles
over the Gulf of Mexico

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.409
into Central and South America.

00:05:25.806 --> 00:05:27.058
And then after the winter,

00:05:27.082 --> 00:05:29.097
the spring rolls around
and they come back.

00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:32.020
They fly thousands of miles
over the Gulf of Mexico.
