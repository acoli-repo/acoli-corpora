00:07:29.136 --> 00:07:31.256
it's only fitting that I'd
eventually end up

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.457
in the most famous swamp of all:

00:07:33.481 --> 00:07:34.731
the Everglades.

00:07:35.144 --> 00:07:37.113
Growing up here in North Central Florida,

00:07:37.137 --> 00:07:38.867
it always had these enchanted names,

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:42.233
places like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee,

00:07:42.257 --> 00:07:44.379
Corkscrew, Big Cypress.

00:07:44.403 --> 00:07:47.943
I started what turned
into a five-year project

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.717
to hopefully reintroduce
the Everglades in a new light,

00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:53.422
in a more inspired light.

00:07:53.922 --> 00:07:57.147
But I knew this would be a tall order,
because here you have an area

00:07:57.171 --> 00:08:00.200
that's roughly a third the size
the state of Florida, it's huge.
