00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:02.068
And unfortunately, that's precisely
what we've done.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.163
Over the last 60 years,

00:09:04.187 --> 00:09:07.544
we have drained, we have dammed,
we have dredged the Everglades

00:09:07.568 --> 00:09:11.549
to where now only one third of the water
that used to reach the bay

00:09:11.573 --> 00:09:13.580
now reaches the bay today.

00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:18.254
So this story is not all sunshine
and rainbows, unfortunately.

00:09:18.953 --> 00:09:20.839
For better or for worse,

00:09:20.863 --> 00:09:24.280
the story of the Everglades
is intrinsically tied

00:09:24.304 --> 00:09:27.500
to the peaks and the valleys
of mankind's relationship

00:09:27.524 --> 00:09:28.864
with the natural world.

00:09:29.255 --> 00:09:31.280
But I'll show you
these beautiful pictures,
