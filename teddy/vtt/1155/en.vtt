00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
ages six to eight, at a children's museum,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and I brought with me a bag full of legs,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
similar to the kinds of things you see up here,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and had them laid out on a table for the kids.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
about what they don't know, or don't understand,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
or is foreign to them.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
They only learn to be frightened of those differences

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
when an adult influences them to behave that way,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and maybe censors that natural curiosity,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or you know, reins in the question-asking
