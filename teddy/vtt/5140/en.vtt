00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:11.861
In 2013, a team of researchers 
held a math test.

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:15.911
The exam was administered 
to over 1,100 American adults,

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:21.594
and designed, in part, to test 
their ability to evaluate sets of data.

00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:26.794
Hidden among these math problems 
were two almost identical questions.

00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:29.834
Both problems 
used the same difficult data set,

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:33.670
and each had one objectively 
correct answer.
