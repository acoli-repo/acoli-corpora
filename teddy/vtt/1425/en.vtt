00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I've got apparently 18 minutes

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to convince you that history has a direction, an arrow;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that in some fundamental sense, it's good;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that the arrow points to something positive.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
(Laughter)

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
-- that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It was before the avian flu had reached Europe.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
eliciting various counter-measures by Israel.
