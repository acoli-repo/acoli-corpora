00:14:58.944 --> 00:15:01.682
for relationships that were
already dying on the vine.

00:15:02.753 --> 00:15:05.769
But others will jolt us
into new possibilities.

00:15:05.953 --> 00:15:07.936
The fact is, the majority of couples

00:15:07.936 --> 00:15:10.150
who have experienced
affairs stay together.

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:13.399
But some of them will merely survive,

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:18.103
and others will actually be able
to turn a crisis into an opportunity.

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:22.460
They'll be able to turn this
into a generative experience.

00:15:22.484 --> 00:15:26.198
And I'm actually thinking even
more so for the deceived partner,

00:15:26.222 --> 00:15:27.558
who will often say,

00:15:27.558 --> 00:15:29.365
"You think I didn't want more?

00:15:29.365 --> 00:15:31.207
But I'm not the one who did it."
