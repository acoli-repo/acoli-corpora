00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:02.349
Why do we cheat?

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.928
And why do happy people cheat?

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:13.447
And when we say "infidelity,"
what exactly do we mean?

00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:20.586
Is it a hookup, a love story,
paid sex, a chat room,

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.625
a massage with a happy ending?

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:29.494
Why do we think that men cheat
out of boredom and fear of intimacy,

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:34.256
but women cheat out of loneliness
and hunger for intimacy?
