00:03:28.403 --> 00:03:31.634
I've been asked that question
since I arrived at this conference.

00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:34.236
(Laughter)

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.640
It applies to you.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:40.959
But the definition of infidelity
keeps on expanding:

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.021
sexting, watching porn, staying
secretly active on dating apps.

00:03:46.332 --> 00:03:50.817
So because there is no
universally agreed-upon definition

00:03:50.817 --> 00:03:53.956
of what even constitutes an infidelity,

00:03:53.956 --> 00:03:59.586
estimates vary widely,
from 26 percent to 75 percent.
