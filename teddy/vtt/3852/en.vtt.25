00:12:28.602 --> 00:12:32.458
there is one word that people
who have affairs always tell me.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.911
They feel alive.

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:40.286
And they often will tell me
stories of recent losses --

00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:42.141
of a parent who died,

00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:44.341
and a friend that went too soon,

00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:46.141
and bad news at the doctor.

00:12:47.482 --> 00:12:52.138
Death and mortality often live
in the shadow of an affair,

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.608
because they raise these questions.

00:12:54.632 --> 00:12:57.536
Is this it? Is there more?

00:12:57.901 --> 00:13:00.957
Am I going on for another
25 years like this?
