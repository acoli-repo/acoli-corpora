00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:02.260
We used to marry,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.169
and had sex for the first time.

00:03:04.614 --> 00:03:06.076
But now we marry,

00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:08.003
and we stop having sex with others.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:13.677
The fact is that monogamy
had nothing to do with love.

00:03:14.332 --> 00:03:16.895
Men relied on women's fidelity

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.959
in order to know whose children these are,

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.300
and who gets the cows when I die.

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:26.655
Now, everyone wants to know

00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:28.403
what percentage of people cheat.

00:03:28.403 --> 00:03:31.634
I've been asked that question
since I arrived at this conference.
