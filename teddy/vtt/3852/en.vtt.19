00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:34.563
Now, the typical assumption
is that if someone cheats,

00:09:34.563 --> 00:09:38.408
either there's something wrong
in your relationship or wrong with you.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.686
But millions of people
can't all be pathological.

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:48.291
The logic goes like this: If you
have everything you need at home,

00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:51.715
then there is no need
to go looking elsewhere,

00:09:51.715 --> 00:09:55.182
assuming that there is such
a thing as a perfect marriage

00:09:55.187 --> 00:09:58.038
that will inoculate us against wanderlust.

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:02.499
But what if passion
has a finite shelf life?
