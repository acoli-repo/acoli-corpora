00:04:27.326 --> 00:04:33.032
a secretive relationship,
which is the core structure of an affair;

00:04:33.032 --> 00:04:37.826
an emotional connection
to one degree or another;

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:39.466
and a sexual alchemy.

00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:43.337
And alchemy is the key word here,

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:50.265
because the erotic frisson is such that
the kiss that you only imagine giving,

00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:53.349
can be as powerful and as enchanting

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.839
as hours of actual lovemaking.

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.315
As Marcel Proust said,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.640
it's our imagination that is responsible
for love, not the other person.
