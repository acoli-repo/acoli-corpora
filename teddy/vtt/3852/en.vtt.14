Infidelity -- a violation of trust,

"Can I ever trust you again?" he asks.

00:07:05.148 --> 00:07:07.450
"Can I ever trust anyone again?"

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:11.905
And this is also what my patient
Heather is telling me,

00:07:11.905 --> 00:07:14.532
when she's talking to me
about her story with Nick.

00:07:14.532 --> 00:07:15.982
Married, two kids.

00:07:15.982 --> 00:07:18.659
Nick just left on a business trip,

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:22.190
and Heather is playing
on his iPad with the boys,

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.127
when she sees a message
appear on the screen:

00:07:25.127 --> 00:07:26.665
"Can't wait to see you."

00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:30.054
Strange, she thinks,
we just saw each other.
