But at 47, Priya's affair is about
the adolescence that she never had.

00:12:03.753 --> 00:12:09.030
And her story highlights for me
that when we seek the gaze of another,

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:13.748
it isn't always our partner
that we are turning away from,

00:12:13.748 --> 00:12:16.585
but the person that
we have ourselves become.

00:12:17.728 --> 00:12:21.274
And it isn't so much that we're
looking for another person,

00:12:21.274 --> 00:12:24.816
as much as we are
looking for another self.

00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:28.602
Now, all over the world,

00:12:28.602 --> 00:12:32.458
there is one word that people
who have affairs always tell me.
