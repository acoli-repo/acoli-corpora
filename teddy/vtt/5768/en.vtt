You might not know this
just from looking at me,

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.526
but you might guess it from smelling me.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.506
One of my favorite things to do
is take out the trash.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.966
It's the laziest way to technically
pare down your possessions,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.336
because the one thing
you can never do enough of

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.956
in a small New York City
apartment like mine

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.326
is get rid of stuff.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.188
The stuff that our modern consumerist
carbon-powered culture

00:00:22.212 --> 00:00:25.594
makes us buy endlessly
and often for no reason.

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:27.906
Getting rid of people never hurts either.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.856
Roommates, family members,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.566
that old lady who's been
in your living room for weeks.
