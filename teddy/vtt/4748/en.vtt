00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:09.349
Think about all the things that need to happen

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.776
for a human settlement to thrive:

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:13.174
obtaining food,

00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:14.344
building shelter,

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:16.676
raising children and more.

00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:18.815
There needs to be a way to divide resources,

00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:20.542
organize major efforts

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:23.111
and distribute labor efficiently.

00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:26.240
Now imagine having to do this without any sort of planning

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.455
or higher level communication.

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:30.267
Welcome to the ant colony.
