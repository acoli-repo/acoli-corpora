00:02:29.927 --> 00:02:32.680
that ants maximize their searching efficiency;

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.358
by changing their movement patterns

00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:37.099
based on individual interactions.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.567
When two ants meet,

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:40.913
they sense each other by touching antennae.

00:02:40.913 --> 00:02:44.652
If there are many ants in a small area this will happen more often

00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:46.698
causing them to respond by moving

00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:51.761
in more convoluted, random paths in order to search more thoroughly.

00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:55.757
But in a larger area, with less ants, where such meetings happen less often,

00:02:55.757 --> 00:02:59.007
they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground.

00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.330
While exploring their environment in this way,
