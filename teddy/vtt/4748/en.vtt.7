The scent dissipates and ants are no longer attracted to that path.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:36.772
These seemingly crude methods of search and retrieval

00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:40.654
are, in fact, so useful that they are applied in computer models

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:44.813
to obtain optimal solutions from decentralized elements,

00:03:44.813 --> 00:03:48.079
working randomly and exchanging simple information.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.134
This has many theoretical and practical applications,

00:03:51.134 --> 00:03:53.967
from solving the famous traveling salesman problem,

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:58.177
to scheduling computing tasks and optimizing Internet searches,

00:03:58.177 --> 00:04:01.072
to enabling groups of robots to search a minefield
