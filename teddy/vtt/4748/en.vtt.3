00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.455
who care for the queen and her eggs.

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:31.951
They will then defend the colony

00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:33.652
and forage for food,

00:01:33.652 --> 00:01:36.524
while unfertilized eggs grow into males

00:01:36.524 --> 00:01:40.055
whose only job is to wait until they are ready to leave the nest

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.852
and reproduce, beginning the cycle again.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:46.241
So how do worker ants decide what to do and when?

00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:48.054
Well, they don't really.

00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:50.813
Although they have no methods of intentional communication,

00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:53.600
individual ants do interact with one another

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.850
through touch, sound and chemical signals.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.241
These stimuli accomplish many things

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:02.674
from serving as an alarm to other ants if one is killed,
