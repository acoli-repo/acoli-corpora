00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.253
each leave from their different nests

00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:03.932
and meet at a central place to mate,

00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:07.655
using pheromones to guide each other to a breeding ground.

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:10.177
After mating, the males die off,

00:01:10.177 --> 00:01:13.236
while females try to establish a new colony.

00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:16.349
The few that are successful settle down in a suitable spot,

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:17.739
lose their wings,

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:19.659
and begin laying eggs,

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.251
selectively fertilizing some using stored sperm they've saved up from mating.

00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:27.980
Fertilized eggs grow into female workers

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.455
who care for the queen and her eggs.
