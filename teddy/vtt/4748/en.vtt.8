00:03:58.177 --> 00:04:01.072
to enabling groups of robots to search a minefield

00:04:01.072 --> 00:04:04.807
or a burning building collectively, without any central control.

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:09.160
But you can observe these fascinatingly simple, yet effective, processes directly

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.994
through some simple experiments,

00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:14.717
by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes

00:04:14.717 --> 00:04:17.135
and paying attention to their behavior.

00:04:17.135 --> 00:04:21.026
Ants may not be able to vote, hold meetings or even make any plans,

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:23.830
but we humans may still be able to learn something

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.938
from the way that such simple creatures

00:04:25.938 --> 00:04:30.468
are able to function so effectively in such complex ways.
