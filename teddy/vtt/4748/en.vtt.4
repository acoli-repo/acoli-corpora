00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:02.674
from serving as an alarm to other ants if one is killed,

00:02:02.674 --> 00:02:06.778
to signaling when a queen is nearing the end of her reproductive life.

00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:10.673
But one of the most impressive collective capabilities of an ant colony

00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:14.231
is to thoroughly and efficiently explore large areas

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:16.917
without any predetermined plan.

00:02:16.917 --> 00:02:19.815
Most species of ants have little or no sense of sight

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:22.613
and can only smell things in their vicinity.

00:02:22.613 --> 00:02:24.852
Combined with their lack of high level coordination,

00:02:24.852 --> 00:02:28.024
this would seem to make them terrible explorers,

00:02:28.024 --> 00:02:29.927
but there is an amazingly simple way

00:02:29.927 --> 00:02:32.680
that ants maximize their searching efficiency;
