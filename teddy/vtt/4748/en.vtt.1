00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:30.267
Welcome to the ant colony.

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:33.564
Ants have some of the most complex social organization

00:00:33.564 --> 00:00:35.319
in the animal kingdom,

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:36.639
living in structured colonies

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:38.697
containing different types of members

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:40.934
who perform specific roles.

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:44.126
But although this may sound similar to some human societies,

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:47.966
this organization doesn't arise from any higher level decisions,

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:51.712
but is part of a biologically programmed cycle.

00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:53.305
In many species,

00:00:53.305 --> 00:00:56.215
all the winged males and winged virgin queens

00:00:56.215 --> 00:00:58.950
from all the nearby colonies in the population

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.253
each leave from their different nests
