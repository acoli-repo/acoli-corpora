00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.330
While exploring their environment in this way,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.879
an ant may come across any number of things,

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.835
from threats or enemies, to alternate nesting sites.

00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:11.707
And some species have another capability known as recruitment.

00:03:11.707 --> 00:03:14.216
When one of these ants happens to find food,

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:18.266
it will return with it, marking its path with a chemical scent.

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:20.863
Other ants will then follow this pheromone trail,

00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:24.516
renewing it each time they manage to find food and return.

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:26.998
Once the food in that spot is depleted,

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.382
the ants stop marking their return.

00:03:29.382 --> 00:03:33.875
The scent dissipates and ants are no longer attracted to that path.
