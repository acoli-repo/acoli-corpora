Maria walked into the elevator at work.

00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:08.601
She went to press the button
when her phone fell out of her hand.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:13.059
It bounced on the floor and --

00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:17.601
went straight down that little opening
between the elevator and the floor.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.476
And she realized it wasn't just her phone,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.024
it was her phone wallet
that had her driver's license,

00:00:23.048 --> 00:00:25.809
her credit card, her whole life.

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:29.226
She went to the front desk
to talk to Ray, the security guard.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.351
Ray was really happy to see her.
