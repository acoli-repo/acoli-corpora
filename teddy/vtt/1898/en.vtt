Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
praise, admiration and thank you,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and having it be specific and genuine.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And the way I got interested in this was,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I noticed in myself, when I was growing up,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and until about a few years ago,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that I would want to say thank you to someone,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I would want to praise them,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I would want to take in their praise of me

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and I'd just stop it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And I asked myself, why?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And then my question became,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
am I the only one who does this?
