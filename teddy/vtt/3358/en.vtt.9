00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.696
The skeletal remains
of some Sudanese Nubian

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.576
were found to contain
significant deposits of tetracycline.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.440
That's an antibiotic that we use
in modern medicine today.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.936
And nearly 1500 years later,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.416
Alexander Fleming discovered
the antimicrobial properties of mold.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.976
And it was only through the industrialized
fermentation of penicillin

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.720
that millions could survive
infectious diseases.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.696
Fermentation could once again
play an important role

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.016
in our human development.
