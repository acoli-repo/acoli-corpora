00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.616
And using them in a systematic way

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.360
enables us to be able
to generate an organic pattern ...

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.520
a uniform dye ...

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.080
and even a graphic print.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:19.336
Another problem is how to scale
these artisanal methods of making

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.040
so that we can start
to use them in industry.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.256
When we talk about scale,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.816
we consider two things in parallel:

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.456
scaling the biology,
