You're watching the life cycle
of a Streptomyces coelicolor.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.896
It's a strain of bacteria
that's found in the soil

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.336
where it lives in a community
with other organisms,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.680
decomposing organic matter.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.600
Coelicolor is a beautiful organism.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.320
A powerhouse for synthesizing
organic chemical compounds.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.136
It produces an antibiotic
called actinorhodin,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.736
which ranges in color
from blue to pink and purple,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000
depending on the acidity
of its environment.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.056
That it produces these pigment molecules
sparked my curiosity
