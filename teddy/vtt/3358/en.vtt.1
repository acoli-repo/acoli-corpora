That it produces these pigment molecules
sparked my curiosity

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.480
and led me to collaborate
closely with coelicolor.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.336
It is an unlikely partnership,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.720
but it's one that completely transformed
my practice as a materials designer.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.976
From it, I understood how nature
was going to completely revolutionize

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.856
how we design and build our environments,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.336
and that organisms like coelicolor

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.680
were going to help us
grow our material future.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.520
So what's wrong with things as they are?
