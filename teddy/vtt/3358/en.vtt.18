00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.400
of how to scale biology.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.536
It's a bioreactor;

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.656
a kind of microorganism brewery
that contains yeasts

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.816
that have been engineered to produce
specific commodity chemicals and compounds

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.880
like fragrances and flavors.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.256
It's actually connected to a suite
of automated hardware and software

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.216
that read in real time

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:25.416
and feed back to a design team
the growth conditions of the microbe.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.536
So we can use this system
to model the growth characteristics

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.176
of an organism like coelicolor
