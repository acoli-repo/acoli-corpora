00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.576
as an advanced technological
toolkit for our survival.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.656
When a solid or a liquid ferments,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.240
it's chemically broken down
by bacterial fungi.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.976
The byproduct of this is what we value.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.480
So for example, we add yeast
to grapes to make wine.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.336
Well in nature, these transformations
are part of a complex network --

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.376
a continuous cycle
that redistributes energy.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.256
Fermentation gives rise
to multispecies interactions

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.416
of bacteria and fungi,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.056
plants, insects, animals and humans:

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.240
in other words, whole ecosystems.
