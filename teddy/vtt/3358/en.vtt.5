00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.456
can move and place atoms
more quickly and precisely

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.400
than anything we've ever engineered.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.880
And we know that it can do this at scale.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.816
Nature has evolved over 3.8 billion years

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.696
to be able to do this,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.696
but now through the use
of synthetic biology,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.336
an emerging scientific discipline

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.336
that seeks to customize
this functionality of living systems,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.080
we can now rapid prototype
the assembly of DNA.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.536
That means that we can engineer
the kind of biological precision

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.096
that makes it possible
to design a bacteria
