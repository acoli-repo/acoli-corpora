00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.856
they've engineered a yeast
to produce spider-silk protein

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.776
that can be spun
into a highly programmable yarn.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.656
So think water resistance,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.040
stretchability and superstrength.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.376
To reach economies of scale,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.096
these kinds of startups
are having to build and design

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.920
and engineer the infrastructure
to work with biology.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.856
For example,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.720
Bolt Threads have had to engage
in some extreme biomimicry.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.656
To be able to spin the product
this yeast creates into a yarn,
