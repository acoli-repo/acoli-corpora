00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.456
scaling the biology,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.336
and then scaling
the tools and the processes

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.280
required to work with the biology.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.655
If we can do this,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.056
then we can move
what happens on a petri dish

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.576
so that it can meet the human scale,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.080
and then hopefully
the architecture of our environments.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.176
If Fleming were alive today,

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.000
this would definitely
be a part of his toolkit.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.576
You're looking at our current best guess

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.400
of how to scale biology.
