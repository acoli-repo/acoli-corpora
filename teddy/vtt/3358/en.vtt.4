That means we need to find
new material systems

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.336
that are not petroleum-based.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.080
I believe that those material systems
will be biological,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.175
but what matters
is how we design and build them.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.240
They mustn't perpetuate
the destructive legacies of the oil age.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.056
When you look at this image,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.280
what do you see?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.296
Well, I see a highly sophisticated
biological system,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.376
that through the use of enzymes,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.456
can move and place atoms
more quickly and precisely
