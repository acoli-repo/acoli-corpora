00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.896
Well, for the last century,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.976
we've organized ourselves
around fossil fuels,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.056
arguably, the most valuable
material system we have ever known.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.776
We are tethered to this resource,
and we've crafted a dependency on it

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.840
that defines our identities, cultures,
our ways of making and our economies.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.856
But our fossil fuel-based activities
are reshaping the earth

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.456
with a kind of violence that is capable
of dramatically changing the climate,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.856
of accelerating a loss of biodiversity

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.840
and even sustaining human conflict.
