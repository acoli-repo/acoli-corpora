00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.416
this sort of direct fermentation

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.336
when you add the bacteria
directly onto the silk --

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.576
is that to dye one t-shirt,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.440
the bacteria survive
on just 200 milliliters of water.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.656
And you can see how this process
generates very little runoff

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.256
and produces a colorfast pigment
without the use of any chemicals.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.816
So now you're thinking --

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.336
and you're thinking right --

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.396
an inherent problem associated
with designing with a living system is:
