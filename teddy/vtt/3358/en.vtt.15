00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.396
an inherent problem associated
with designing with a living system is:

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.880
How do you guide a medium
that has a life force of its own?

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.856
Well, once you've established
the baseline for cultivating Streptomyces

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.096
so that it consistently
produces enough pigment,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.176
you can turn to twisting, folding,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.056
clamping, dipping, spraying,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.616
submerging --

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.640
all of these begin to inform
the aesthetics of coelicolor's activity.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.616
And using them in a systematic way
