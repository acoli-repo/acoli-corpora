in other words, whole ecosystems.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.776
We've known about these powerful
microbial interactions

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.976
for thousands of years.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.896
You can see how through
the fermentation of grains,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.576
vegetal matter and animal products,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.296
all peoples and cultures of the world
have domesticated microorganisms

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.920
to make the inedible edible.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:24.176
And there's even evidence

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.440
people deliberately fermented
foodstuffs that contained antibiotics.
