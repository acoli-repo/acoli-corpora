00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.016
in our human development.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.696
Could it represent a new mode of survival

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.400
if we harness it to completely
change our industries?

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.376
I've worked in my creative career
to develop new material systems

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.936
for the textile industry.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.216
And while it is work that I love,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.955
I cannot reconcile with the fact
that the textile industry

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.256
is one of the most polluting in the world.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.096
Most of the ecological harm
caused by textile processing

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.400
occurs at the finishing
and the dyeing stage.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.440
Processing textiles
requires huge amounts of water.
