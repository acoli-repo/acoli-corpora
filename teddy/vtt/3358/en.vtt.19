00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.176
of an organism like coelicolor

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.600
to see how it would
ferment at 50,000 liters.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.616
I'm currently based at Ginkgo Bioworks,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.120
which is a biotechnology
startup in Boston.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.496
I am working to see
how their platform for scaling biology

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.776
interfaces with my artisanal methods
of designing with bacteria for textiles.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.096
We're doing things like engineering
Streptomyces coelicolor

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.600
to see if it can produce more pigment.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.776
And we're even looking at the tools
for synthetic biology.
