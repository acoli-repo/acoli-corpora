00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.096
So again, contrast this with biology.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.216
Evolved over 3.8 billion years,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.096
to rapid prototype,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.696
to recycle and to replenish

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.400
better than any system
we've ever engineered.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.816
I was inspired by this immense potential

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.776
and wanted to explore it
through a seemingly simple question --

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.000
at the time.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.376
If a bacteria produces a pigment,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.920
how do we work with it to dye textiles?

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.456
Well, one of my favorite ways

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.536
is to grow Streptomyces coelicolor
directly onto silk.
