00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.976
What we now have is the technology

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.816
to design, build, test and scale
these capabilities.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.096
At this present moment,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.776
as we face the ecological
crisis in front of us,

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.136
what we have to do is to determine

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.336
how we're going to build
these new material systems

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.136
so that they don't mirror
the damaging legacies of the oil age.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.616
How we're going to distribute them
to ensure a sustainable development

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.416
that is fair and equitable
across the world.
