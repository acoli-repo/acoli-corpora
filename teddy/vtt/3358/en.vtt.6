00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.096
that makes it possible
to design a bacteria

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.216
that can recycle metal,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.216
to grow fungi into furniture

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.040
and even sequester
renewable energy from algae.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.656
To think about how we might access
this inherent brilliance of nature --

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.456
to build things from living things --

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.616
let's consider the biological
process of fermentation.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.296
I've come to think of fermentation,
when harnessed by humans,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.576
as an advanced technological
toolkit for our survival.
