00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.136
that is engineered to produce
a bespoke print on a whole garment.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.880
We're making lots of kimonos.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.736
Here's the exciting thing:

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.136
I'm not alone.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.056
There are others who are building
capacity in this field,

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.016
like MycoWorks.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.776
MycoWorks is a startup

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.416
a versatile, high-performance material

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.560
that has applications beyond textiles
and into product and architecture.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.576
And Bolt Threads --

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.856
they've engineered a yeast
to produce spider-silk protein
