00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So, I kind of believe that we're in like the "cave-painting" era of computer interfaces.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Like, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and I'd like to change all that.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Hit me.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's very flat, kind of rigid.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you know, 30 years.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
