00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:01.913
So, how many of you have ever

00:00:01.913 --> 00:00:03.568
gotten behind the wheel of a car

00:00:03.568 --> 00:00:09.255
when you really shouldn't have been driving?

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:11.160
Maybe you're out on the road for a long day,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.650
and you just wanted to get home.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.297
You were tired, but you felt you could drive a few more miles.

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:16.496
Maybe you thought,

00:00:16.496 --> 00:00:18.513
I've had less to drink than everybody else,

00:00:18.513 --> 00:00:20.249
I should be the one to go home.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.840
Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.294
Does this sound familiar to you?

00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:29.192
Now, in those situations, wouldn't it be great

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:30.785
if there was a button on your dashboard
