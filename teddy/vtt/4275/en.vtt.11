00:05:28.358 --> 00:05:31.178
This probably is: the Aral Sea.

00:05:31.178 --> 00:05:34.082
Now, a lot you will remember this from your geography classes.

00:05:34.082 --> 00:05:36.141
This is in the former Soviet Union

00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:38.713
in between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:41.161
one of the great inland seas of the world.

00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:43.473
But there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like

00:05:43.473 --> 00:05:46.995
it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here?

00:05:46.995 --> 00:05:48.958
The reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side,

00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.450
you see two little rivers kind of coming down

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.967
through the sand, feeding this basin with water.

00:05:54.967 --> 00:05:57.549
Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains

00:05:57.549 --> 00:06:00.482
far to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river
