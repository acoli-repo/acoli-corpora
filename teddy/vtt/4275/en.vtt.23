00:11:28.807 --> 00:11:32.592
of agriculture and farm the lands we have better.

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:34.992
This is work that we're doing to try to highlight places

00:11:34.992 --> 00:11:37.559
in the world where we could improve yields

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:39.825
without harming the environment.

00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:42.226
The green areas here show where corn yields,

00:11:42.226 --> 00:11:44.376
just showing corn as an example,

00:11:44.376 --> 00:11:46.977
are already really high, probably the maximum you could

00:11:46.977 --> 00:11:49.855
find on Earth today for that climate and soil,

00:11:49.855 --> 00:11:52.206
but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where

00:11:52.206 --> 00:11:54.720
we're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.060
you should be able to get.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.378
You see a lot of this in Africa, even Latin America,

00:11:58.378 --> 00:12:01.238
but interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union
