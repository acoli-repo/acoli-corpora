00:12:28.821 --> 00:12:32.530
growing food and having a healthy environment work better.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.060
Right now, it's kind of an all-or-nothing proposition.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.022
We can grow food in the background --

00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:38.483
that's a soybean field —

00:12:38.483 --> 00:12:41.610
and in this flower diagram, it shows we grow a lot of food,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.128
but we don't have a lot clean water, we're not storing

00:12:44.128 --> 00:12:47.125
a lot of carbon, we don't have a lot of biodiversity.

00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:49.133
In the foreground, we have this prairie

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:50.691
that's wonderful from the environmental side,

00:12:50.691 --> 00:12:53.895
but you can't eat anything. What's there to eat?

00:12:53.895 --> 00:12:56.432
We need to figure out how to bring both of those together

00:12:56.432 --> 00:13:00.542
into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together.
