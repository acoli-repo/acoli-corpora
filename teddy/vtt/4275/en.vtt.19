00:09:27.938 --> 00:09:30.557
since the end of the ice age. No question.

00:09:30.557 --> 00:09:33.537
And it rivals climate change in importance.

00:09:33.537 --> 00:09:36.462
And they're both happening at the same time.

00:09:36.462 --> 00:09:38.834
But what's really important here to remember is that

00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:42.102
it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.

00:09:42.102 --> 00:09:44.282
In fact, we completely depend on it.

00:09:44.282 --> 00:09:48.722
It's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity.

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:50.866
We have to provide food and feed and, yeah,

00:09:50.866 --> 00:09:54.722
fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people

00:09:54.722 --> 00:09:57.458
in the world today, and if anything,

00:09:57.458 --> 00:09:59.488
we're going to have the demands on agriculture

00:09:59.488 --> 00:10:02.026
increase into the future. It's not going to go away.
