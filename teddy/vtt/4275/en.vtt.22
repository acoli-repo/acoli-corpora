00:10:58.802 --> 00:11:02.296
the crops are today, on the right is where they could be

00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:05.244
based on soils and climate, assuming climate change

00:11:05.244 --> 00:11:07.085
doesn't disrupt too much of this,

00:11:07.085 --> 00:11:08.973
which is not a good assumption.

00:11:08.973 --> 00:11:11.162
We could farm more land, but the problem is

00:11:11.162 --> 00:11:14.143
the remaining lands are in sensitive areas.

00:11:14.143 --> 00:11:16.181
They have a lot of biodiversity, a lot of carbon,

00:11:16.181 --> 00:11:18.615
things we want to protect.

00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:21.439
So we could grow more food by expanding farmland,

00:11:21.439 --> 00:11:22.757
but we'd better not,

00:11:22.757 --> 00:11:26.423
because it's ecologically a very, very dangerous thing to do.

00:11:26.423 --> 00:11:28.807
Instead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint

00:11:28.807 --> 00:11:32.592
of agriculture and farm the lands we have better.
