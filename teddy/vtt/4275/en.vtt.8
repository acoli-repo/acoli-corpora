00:03:57.802 --> 00:04:00.593
If we look at this carefully, we find it's about 40 percent

00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:03.305
of the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture,

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:05.874
and it's 60 times larger

00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:08.449
than all the areas we complain about,

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.666
our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live.

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:14.529
Half of humanity lives in cities today,

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:18.465
but a 60-times-larger area is used to grow food.

00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:20.384
So this is an amazing kind of result,

00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:22.561
and it really shocked us when we looked at that.

00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:25.265
So we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture,

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.971
but also we're using a lot of water.

00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:30.499
