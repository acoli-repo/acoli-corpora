00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.995
Tonight, I want to have a conversation about

00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:04.929
this incredible global issue

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.466
that's at the intersection of land use, food and environment,

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:24.077

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:29.069
around the planet. And the thing you would notice first,

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.386
of course, is how dominant the human presence
