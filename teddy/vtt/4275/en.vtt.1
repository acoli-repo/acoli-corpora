00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.386
of course, is how dominant the human presence

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:34.450
on our planet is.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.185
We see cities, we see oil fields,

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:40.382
you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea,

00:00:40.382 --> 00:00:42.946
that we are dominating much of our planet,

00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:44.719
and mostly through the use of energy

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.453
that we see here at night.

00:00:46.453 --> 00:00:48.627
But let's go back and drop it a little deeper

00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:50.669
and look during the daytime.

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:54.359
What we see during the day is our landscapes.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.912
This is part of the Amazon Basin, a place called Rondônia

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:01.502
in the south-center part of the Brazilian Amazon.
