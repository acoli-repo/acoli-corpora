00:14:28.615 --> 00:14:31.305
At this rate, we'll reach 9 billion people by 2040.

00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:33.073
And we all need food.

00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:34.424
But how?

00:14:34.424 --> 00:14:37.312
How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet?

00:14:37.312 --> 00:14:40.557
We already know climate change is a big problem.

00:14:40.557 --> 00:14:41.807
But it's not the only problem.

00:14:41.807 --> 00:14:44.729
We need to face 'the other inconvenient truth.'

00:14:44.729 --> 00:14:47.277
A global crisis in agriculture.

00:14:47.277 --> 00:14:53.536
Population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources.

00:14:53.536 --> 00:14:56.985
More than 40% of Earth's land has been cleared for agriculture.

00:14:56.985 --> 00:14:58.991
Global croplands cover 16 million km².

00:14:58.991 --> 00:15:02.184
That's almost the size of South America.
