00:03:26.207 --> 00:03:30.471
That's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.

00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:32.595
If you put it all together in one place,

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:35.262
it'd be the size of South America.

00:03:35.262 --> 00:03:37.938
The second area, in brown, is the world's pastures

00:03:37.938 --> 00:03:40.155
and rangelands, where our animals live.

00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:42.871
That area's about 30 million square kilometers,

00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:45.290
or about an Africa's worth of land,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.203
a huge amount of land, and it's the best land, of course,

00:03:48.203 --> 00:03:50.355
is what you see. And what's left is, like,

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.366
the middle of the Sahara Desert, or Siberia,

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.057
or the middle of a rain forest.

00:03:54.057 --> 00:03:57.802
We're using a planet's worth of land already.

00:03:57.802 --> 00:04:00.593
If we look at this carefully, we find it's about 40 percent
