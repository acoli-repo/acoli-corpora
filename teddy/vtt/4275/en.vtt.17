burning tropical rainforest,

00:08:30.756 --> 00:08:33.316
or methane coming from cows and rice,

00:08:33.316 --> 00:08:36.229
or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers,

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:39.000
it turns out agriculture is 30 percent of the greenhouse

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.016
gases going into the atmosphere from human activity.

00:08:42.016 --> 00:08:43.870
That's more than all our transportation.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.620
It's more than all our electricity.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.245
It's more than all other manufacturing, in fact.

00:08:48.245 --> 00:08:51.355
It's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases

00:08:51.355 --> 00:08:53.675
of any human activity in the world.

00:08:53.675 --> 00:08:56.301
And yet, we don't talk about it very much.

00:08:56.301 --> 00:08:59.354
So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture

00:08:59.354 --> 00:09:01.491
dominating our planet,
