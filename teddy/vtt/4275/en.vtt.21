00:10:28.116 --> 00:10:31.317
and of course having an energy crisis at the same time,

00:10:31.317 --> 00:10:34.790
where we have to replace oil with other energy sources

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.361
that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels

00:10:37.361 --> 00:10:39.140
and bio-energy sources.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.893
So you put these together. It's really hard to see

00:10:41.893 --> 00:10:44.245
how we're going to get to the rest of the century

00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:48.573
without at least doubling global agricultural production.

00:10:48.573 --> 00:10:50.522
Well, how are we going to do this? How are going to

00:10:50.522 --> 00:10:53.315
double global ag production around the world?

00:10:53.315 --> 00:10:56.003
Well, we could try to farm more land.

00:10:56.003 --> 00:10:58.802
This is an analysis we've done, where on the left is where

00:10:58.802 --> 00:11:02.296
the crops are today, on the right is where they could be
