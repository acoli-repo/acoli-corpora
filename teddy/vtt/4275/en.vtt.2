00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:01.502
in the south-center part of the Brazilian Amazon.

00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:04.118
If you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner,

00:01:04.118 --> 00:01:06.644
you're going to see a thin white line,

00:01:06.644 --> 00:01:10.022
which is a road that was built in the 1970s.

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:13.689
If we come back to the same place in 2001,

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.946
what we're going to find is that these roads

00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:19.796
spurt off more roads, and more roads after that,

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:22.937
at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.098
where there are going to be a few cows.

00:01:25.098 --> 00:01:28.410
These cows are used for beef. We're going to eat these cows.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.041
And these cows are eaten basically in South America,
