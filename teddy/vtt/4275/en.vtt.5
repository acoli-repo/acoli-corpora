00:02:29.207 --> 00:02:32.832
showing how trade and globalization are

00:02:32.832 --> 00:02:35.704
really responsible for the connections to rainforests

00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:37.641
and the Amazon -- an incredibly strange

00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:40.357
and interconnected world that we have today.

00:02:40.357 --> 00:02:42.678
Well, again and again, what we find as we look

00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:44.814
around the world in our little tour of the world

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:48.565
is that landscape after landscape after landscape

00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:51.334
have been cleared and altered for growing food

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:53.669
and other crops.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.029
So one of the questions we've been asking is,

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:58.517
how much of the world is used to grow food,

00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:00.913
and where is it exactly, and how can we change that
