00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.041
And these cows are eaten basically in South America,

00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:33.825
in Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here.

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:36.561
But this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation

00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:39.146
is something we notice a lot of around the tropics,

00:01:39.146 --> 00:01:41.374
especially in this part of the world.

00:01:41.374 --> 00:01:44.697
If we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world,

00:01:44.697 --> 00:01:47.089
we can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon,

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:51.225
here also in 1975, and if you look really carefully,

00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:54.787
there's a thin white line through that kind of seam,

00:01:54.787 --> 00:01:56.099
and there's a lone farmer out there

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.662
in the middle of the primeval jungle.

00:01:58.662 --> 00:02:03.435
Let's come back again a few years later, here in 2003,
