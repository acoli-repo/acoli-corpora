Let's come back again a few years later, here in 2003,

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:05.963
and we'll see that that landscape actually looks

00:02:05.963 --> 00:02:08.845
a lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest.

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:12.213
In fact, what you're seeing here are soybean fields.

00:02:12.213 --> 00:02:15.086
These soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China

00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:18.832
as animal feed, especially after the mad cow disease scare

00:02:18.832 --> 00:02:21.373
about a decade ago, where we don't want to feed animals

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:24.803
animal protein anymore, because that can transmit disease.

00:02:24.803 --> 00:02:27.415
Instead, we want to feed them more vegetable proteins.

00:02:27.415 --> 00:02:29.207
So soybeans have really exploded,

00:02:29.207 --> 00:02:32.832
