00:06:58.957 --> 00:07:01.167
The Soviet Union didn't really have a Sierra Club.

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:02.707
Let's put it that way.

00:07:02.707 --> 00:07:06.111
So what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty.

00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:08.055
There's a lot of toxic waste, a lot of things

00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:10.471
that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne.

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:12.603
One of those small islands that was remote

00:07:12.603 --> 00:07:14.215
and impossible to get to was a site

00:07:14.215 --> 00:07:16.911
of Soviet biological weapons testing.

00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.265
You can walk there today.

00:07:18.265 --> 00:07:19.812
Weather patterns have changed.

00:07:19.812 --> 00:07:23.121
Nineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only

00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:26.071
in the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth.

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.951
This is an environmental disaster writ large.

00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:30.446
But let's bring it home.
