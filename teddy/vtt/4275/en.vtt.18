00:08:59.354 --> 00:09:01.491
dominating our planet,

00:09:01.491 --> 00:09:03.849
whether it's 40 percent of our land surface,

00:09:03.849 --> 00:09:05.957
70 percent of the water we use,

00:09:05.957 --> 00:09:08.682
30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:11.531
We've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus

00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:13.994
around the world simply by using fertilizers,

00:09:13.994 --> 00:09:16.765
causing huge problems of water quality from rivers,

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:19.482
lakes, and even oceans, and it's also the single biggest

00:09:19.482 --> 00:09:22.157
driver of biodiversity loss.

00:09:22.157 --> 00:09:24.258
So without a doubt, agriculture is

00:09:24.258 --> 00:09:27.938
the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet

00:09:27.938 --> 00:09:30.557
since the end of the ice age. No question.
