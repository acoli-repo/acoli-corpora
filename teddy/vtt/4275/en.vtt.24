00:11:58.378 --> 00:12:01.238
but interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union

00:12:01.238 --> 00:12:03.479
and Eastern Bloc countries used to be,

00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:05.703
is still a mess agriculturally.

00:12:05.703 --> 00:12:08.336
Now, this would require nutrients and water.

00:12:08.336 --> 00:12:10.469
It's going to either be organic or conventional

00:12:10.469 --> 00:12:12.282
or some mix of the two to deliver that.

00:12:12.282 --> 00:12:14.447
Plants need water and nutrients.

00:12:14.447 --> 00:12:17.655
But we can do this, and there are opportunities to make this work.

00:12:17.655 --> 00:12:19.935
But we have to do it in a way that is sensitive

00:12:19.935 --> 00:12:22.544
to meeting the food security needs of the future

00:12:22.544 --> 00:12:25.807
and the environmental security needs of the future.

00:12:25.807 --> 00:12:28.821
We have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between

00:12:28.821 --> 00:12:32.530
growing food and having a healthy environment work better.
