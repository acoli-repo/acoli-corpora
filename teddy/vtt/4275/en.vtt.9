00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:30.499
This is a photograph flying into Arizona,

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:31.308
and when you look at it, you're like,

00:04:31.308 --> 00:04:32.435
"What are they growing here?" It turns out

00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:35.367
they're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert

00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:37.755
using water sprayed on top.

00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:39.305
Now, the irony is, it's probably sold

00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:41.981
in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities.

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:44.293
But what's really interesting is, this water's got to come

00:04:44.293 --> 00:04:46.837
from some place, and it comes from here,

00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:49.477
the Colorado River in North America.

00:04:49.477 --> 00:04:52.125
Well, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s,

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.244
this is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought,

00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:57.029
kind of an average day, it looks something like this.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.933
But if we come back today, during a normal condition

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:03.501
to the exact same location, this is what's left.
