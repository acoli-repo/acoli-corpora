00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:03.501
to the exact same location, this is what's left.

00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:06.503
The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food,

00:05:06.503 --> 00:05:10.059
or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.979
Well, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.386
and using it to grow food,

00:05:15.386 --> 00:05:18.066
and today, if you travel down further down the Colorado,

00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:21.346
it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean.

00:05:21.346 --> 00:05:24.474
We've literally consumed an entire river in North America

00:05:24.474 --> 00:05:26.602
for irrigation.

00:05:26.602 --> 00:05:28.358
Well, that's not even the worst example in the world.

00:05:28.358 --> 00:05:31.178
This probably is: the Aral Sea.
