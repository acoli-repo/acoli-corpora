far to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river

00:06:00.482 --> 00:06:03.682
through the desert, and forms the great Aral Sea.

00:06:03.682 --> 00:06:07.694

00:06:10.047 --> 00:06:13.827
in Kazakhstan, to sell cotton to the international markets

00:06:13.827 --> 00:06:15.887

00:06:25.187 --> 00:06:27.399

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:30.203
1999,
