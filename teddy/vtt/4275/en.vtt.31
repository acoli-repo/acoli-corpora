00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:31.627
Look at the Aral Sea, now turned to desert.

00:15:31.627 --> 00:15:35.250
Or the Colorado River, which no longer flows to the ocean.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.133
Fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment.

00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:40.389
The consequence?

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:42.373
Widespread water pollution

00:15:42.373 --> 00:15:44.535
and massive degradation of lakes and rivers.

00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:48.909
Surprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change.

00:15:48.909 --> 00:15:51.336
It generates 30% of greenhouse gas emissions.

00:15:51.336 --> 00:15:54.029
That's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry,

00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:57.005
or from all the world's planes, trains and automobiles.

00:15:57.005 --> 00:15:59.373
Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation,

00:15:59.373 --> 00:16:00.749
methane from animals and rice fields,
