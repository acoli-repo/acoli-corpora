00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:00.913
and where is it exactly, and how can we change that

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:03.407
into the future, and what does it mean?

00:03:03.407 --> 00:03:06.375
Well, our team has been looking at this on a global scale,

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:09.295
using satellite data and ground-based data kind of to track

00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:11.479
farming on a global scale.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:15.191
And this is what we found, and it's startling.

00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:17.982
This map shows the presence of agriculture

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:20.046
on planet Earth.

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:23.006
The green areas are the areas we use to grow crops,

00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:26.207
like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever.

00:03:26.207 --> 00:03:30.471
That's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.
