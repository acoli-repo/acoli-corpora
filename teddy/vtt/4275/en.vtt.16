00:07:57.783 --> 00:08:00.811
Well, that's the future we have to look forward to.

00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:03.724
We already use about 50 percent of the Earth's fresh water

00:08:03.724 --> 00:08:05.916
that's sustainable, and agriculture alone

00:08:05.916 --> 00:08:08.316
is 70 percent of that.

00:08:08.316 --> 00:08:11.476
So we use a lot of water, a lot of land for agriculture.

00:08:11.476 --> 00:08:14.820
We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.156
Usually when we think about the atmosphere,

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:19.804
we think about climate change and greenhouse gases,

00:08:19.804 --> 00:08:21.860
and mostly around energy,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.496
but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters

00:08:24.496 --> 00:08:26.548
of greenhouse gases too.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:28.604
If you look at carbon dioxide from

00:08:28.604 --> 00:08:30.756
burning tropical rainforest,
