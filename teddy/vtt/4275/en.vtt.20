00:09:59.488 --> 00:10:02.026
increase into the future. It's not going to go away.

00:10:02.026 --> 00:10:04.257
It's going to get a lot bigger, mainly because of

00:10:04.257 --> 00:10:07.250
growing population. We're seven billion people today

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.450
heading towards at least nine,

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.242
probably nine and a half before we're done.

00:10:12.242 --> 00:10:14.619
More importantly, changing diets.

00:10:14.619 --> 00:10:17.666
As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous,

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:20.733
we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat,

00:10:20.733 --> 00:10:24.194
which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does.

00:10:24.194 --> 00:10:28.116
So more people, eating more stuff, and richer stuff,

00:10:28.116 --> 00:10:31.317
and of course having an energy crisis at the same time,
