00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and dear friend and co-teacher.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Ken and I have been working together

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for almost 40 years.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That's Ken Sharpe over there.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Applause)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So there is among many people --

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
certainly me and most of the people I talk to --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a kind of collective dissatisfaction

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with the way things are working,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
with the way our institutions run.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them.
