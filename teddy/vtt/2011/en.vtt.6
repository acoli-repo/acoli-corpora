00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and I'm very proud to be a member

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of that incredible organization.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It's a grassroots campaign

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
with 80 percent membership being women,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
most of whom are HIV-positive.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
They work in the field.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
They have tremendous outreach

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to the people who are living directly

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
with the effects of the virus.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
They have education programs.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
They bring out the issues of stigma.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It's quite extraordinary what they do.
