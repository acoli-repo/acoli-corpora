00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And her baby will receive PMTCT,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
which will mean that that baby

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
can be born free of the virus.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Now that is prevention

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
at the very beginning of life.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It's one way to start looking at intervention

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
about Avelile.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
This is Avelile --

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
she goes with me wherever I go.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I tell her story to everyone

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
because she represents
