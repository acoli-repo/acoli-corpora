WEBVTT

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
are currently sending out to the world

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
is that we would like to see the virtual elimination

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
of the transmission of the virus

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
from mother to child by 2015.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It's a very ambitious goal

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
but we believe it can be achieved with political will.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
This can happen.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And here I am with a pregnant woman,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
who is HIV positive

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
because we know that that young woman

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
is receiving treatment

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
so her life can be extended

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.
