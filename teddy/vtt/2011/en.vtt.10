00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
because of their family being affected

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
by the AIDS virus.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe --

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
he's the director of UNAIDS.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And I'm very honored

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
by the fact that Michel invited me,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
only a few months ago,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
to become a UNAIDS ambassador.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and broadening my outreach.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
The message that UNAIDS

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
are currently sending out to the world

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
is that we would like to see the virtual elimination
