00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to share with you the story

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
as to how I have become

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
an HIV/AIDS campaigner.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In November of 2003,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I was invited to take part

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in the launch of Nelson Mandela's

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
46664 Foundation --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that is his HIV/AIDS foundation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And 46664 is the number

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour,
