It's quite extraordinary what they do.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And yes, my SING Campaign

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
has supported Treatment Action Campaign

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
in the way that I have tried to raise awareness

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and to try to also raise funds.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and the incredible work that they do,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and are still continuing to do in South Africa.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So this is my SING Campaign.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
SING Campaign is basically just me

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and about three or four wonderful people

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
who help to support me.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I've traveled all over the world

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
in the last two and a half years --
