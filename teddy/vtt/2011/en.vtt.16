00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:00.000
(Applause)

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
That round of applause is actually

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, I would like to say to you,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
each one in the audience,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
if you feel that every mother

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and every child in the world

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
has the right to have access

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
to good nutrition and good medical care,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
specifically five and six,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
should be absolutely committed to
