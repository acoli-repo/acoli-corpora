00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to have met Zackie Achmat,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the founder of Treatment Action Campaign,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
an incredible campaigner and activist.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I met him at a 46664 event.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This is a tool --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
this tells you I am in solidarity

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
with people who have HIV,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
people who are living with HIV.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It doesn't have to be in the closet."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign
