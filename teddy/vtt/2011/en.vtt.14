We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
They put her on very special nutritious diet

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and took great care of her.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And we didn't know when we left the hospital --

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and left us feeling very resonant

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
with this direct experience, this one child,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
you know, that story.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Five months later,
