00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
was directly affecting women in such a way.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And so I committed -- when I left South Africa,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
when I left Capetown,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I told myself, "This is going to be something

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that I have to talk about.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I have to serve."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And so, subsequently

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I participated in every single

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
46664 event

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that I could take part in

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and gave news conferences,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
interviews,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
talking and using my platform as a musician,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
with my commitment to Mandela --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
out of respect for the tremendous,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
unbelievable work that he had done.
