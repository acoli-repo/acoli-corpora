00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I tell her story to everyone

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
because she represents

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
one of millions

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
of HIV/AIDS orphans.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Avelile's mother

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
had HIV virus --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
she died

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
from AIDS-related illness.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Avelile had the virus,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
she was born with the virus.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And here she is at seven years old,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
weighing no more than a one year-old baby.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
At this point in her life,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
she's suffering with full-blown AIDS

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and had pneumonia.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape
