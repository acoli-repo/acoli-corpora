00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
in the last two and a half years --

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I went to about 12 different countries.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Here I am in Oslo in Norway,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
getting a nice, fat check;

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
who ended up in tears

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
because I use film clips

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that really touch the heart, the whole nature,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
of this terrible tragedy that is taking place,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that people are tending to avoid,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
because they are fatigued,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.
