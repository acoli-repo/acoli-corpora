This story

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is about taking imagination seriously.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Fourteen years ago,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
used the same way for centuries.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Today, I'm using it to create

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the scale of hard-edged buildings

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in cities around the world.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I was an unlikely person to be doing this.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I never studied sculpture,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
engineering or architecture.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In fact, after college
