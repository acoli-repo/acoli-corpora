What we're told in terms of arguments

00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:13.415
Now, I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul
can find women to interview.

00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:17.607
Not so sure about rural,
traditional areas,

00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:20.310
where I'm guessing
women can't talk to strange men.

00:08:20.858 --> 00:08:24.443
It's important to keep talking about this,
in light of Lara Logan.

00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:27.033
She was the CBS News correspondent

00:08:27.057 --> 00:08:29.970
who was brutally sexually assaulted
in Egypt's Tahrir Square,

00:08:29.994 --> 00:08:31.760
right after this photo was taken.
