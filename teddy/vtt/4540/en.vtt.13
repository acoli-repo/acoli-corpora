A recent global survey

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:33.325
found that 73 percent
of the top media-management jobs

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.993
are still held by men.

00:06:35.335 --> 00:06:37.968
But this is also about something
far more complex:

00:06:37.992 --> 00:06:40.960
our own unconscious
biases and blind spots.

00:06:41.817 --> 00:06:43.441
Shankar Vedantam is the author

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:46.513
of "The Hidden Brain: How Our Unconscious
Minds Elect Presidents,

00:06:46.537 --> 00:06:49.199
Control Markets, Wage Wars,
and Save Our Lives."

00:06:49.718 --> 00:06:52.845
He told the former ombudsman
at National Public Radio,

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:56.606
who was doing a report
on how women fare in NPR coverage,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.720
unconscious bias flows
throughout most of our lives.

00:06:59.744 --> 00:07:02.712
It's really difficult
to disentangle those strands.
