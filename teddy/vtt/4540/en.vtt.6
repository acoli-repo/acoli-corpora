00:02:59.175 --> 00:03:00.623
I disagree with that.

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:02.835
So three weeks later,

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.386
The Times revisits the story.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.159
This time, it adds another byline
to it with McKinley's:

00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:09.659
Erica Goode.

00:03:09.683 --> 00:03:12.585
What emerges is a truly sad, horrific tale

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.568
of a young girl and her family
trapped in poverty.

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:18.267
She was raped numerous times by many men.

00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:21.093
She had been a bright, easygoing girl.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:23.679
She was maturing quickly, physically,

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.695
but her bed was still covered
with stuffed animals.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.282
It's a very different picture.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.327
Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode
is what made this story more complete.
