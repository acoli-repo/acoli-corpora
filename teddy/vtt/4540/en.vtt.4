00:01:59.927 --> 00:02:01.581
about a gang rape of a young girl,

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:03.943
11 years old, in a small Texas town.

00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:07.570
McKinley writes that
the community is wondering,

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.416
"How could their boys
have been drawn into this?"

00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:12.540
"Drawn into this" --

00:02:12.564 --> 00:02:15.644
like they were seduced
into committing an act of violence.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.653
And the first person he quotes says,

00:02:17.677 --> 00:02:20.750
"These boys will have to live
with this the rest of their lives."

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:23.016
(Groans, laughter)

00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:26.620
You don't hear much
about the 11-year-old victim,

00:02:26.644 --> 00:02:30.061
except that she wore clothes
that were a little old for her
