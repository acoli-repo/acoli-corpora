00:08:29.994 --> 00:08:31.760
right after this photo was taken.

00:08:32.133 --> 00:08:34.902
Almost immediately, pundits weighed in,

00:08:34.926 --> 00:08:38.165
blaming her and saying things like,

00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:41.589
"You know, maybe women shouldn't
be sent to cover those stories."

00:08:41.613 --> 00:08:44.850
I never heard anyone say this
about Anderson Cooper and his crew,

00:08:44.874 --> 00:08:47.482
who were attacked covering the same story.

00:08:48.387 --> 00:08:50.438
One way to get more women into leadership

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:52.239
is to have other women mentor them.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.233
One of my board members is an editor
at a major global media company,

00:08:56.257 --> 00:08:58.893
but she never thought
about this as a career path,

00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:01.425
until she met female role models at JAWS.
