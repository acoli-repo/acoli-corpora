Like most journalists, I'm an idealist.

00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:08.158
I love unearthing good stories,
especially untold stories.

00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:11.559
I just didn't think that in 2011,

00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:13.744
women would still be in that category.

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:18.515
I'm the President of the Journalism
and Women Symposium -- JAWS.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.691
That's Sharky.

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:21.206
(Laughter)

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.034
I joined 10 years ago
because I wanted female role models,

00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:28.257
and I was frustrated by the lagging status
of women in our profession

00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:30.926
and what that meant
for our image in the media.
