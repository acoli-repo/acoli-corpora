00:02:26.644 --> 00:02:30.061
except that she wore clothes
that were a little old for her

00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:31.497
and she wore makeup.

00:02:32.223 --> 00:02:34.918
The Times was deluged with criticism.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.949
Initially, it defended itself,

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:38.694
and said, "These aren't our views.

00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:40.646
This is what we found in our reporting."

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.952
Now, here's a secret
you probably know already:

00:02:43.492 --> 00:02:45.090
Your stories are constructed.

00:02:45.114 --> 00:02:48.135
As reporters, we research, we interview.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.067
We try to give a good picture of reality.

00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:53.836
We also have our own unconscious biases.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.383
But The Times makes it sound like anyone
would have reported this story

00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:58.558
the same way.

00:02:59.175 --> 00:03:00.623
I disagree with that.
