Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode
is what made this story more complete.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.070
The Global Media Monitoring Project
has found that stories by female reporters

00:03:37.094 --> 00:03:40.863
are more likely to challenge stereotypes
than those by male reporters.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.260
At KUNM here in Albuquerque,

00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:44.419
Elaine Baumgartel
did some graduate research

00:03:44.443 --> 00:03:46.712
on the coverage of violence against women.

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:50.109
What she found was many of these
stories tend to blame victims

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:51.652
and devalue their lives.

00:03:51.676 --> 00:03:54.883
They tend to sensationalize,
and they lack context.

00:03:55.423 --> 00:03:56.638
So for her graduate work,

00:03:56.662 --> 00:03:59.559
she did a three-part series
on the murder of 11 women,

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:02.159
found buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa.
