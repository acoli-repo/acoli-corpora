She tried to challenge those patterns
and stereotypes in her work

00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:08.412
and she tried to show
the challenges that journalists face

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:11.956
from external sources,
their own internal biases

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.279
and cultural norms.

00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:16.375
And she worked with an editor
at National Public Radio

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.932
to try to get a story aired nationally.

00:04:18.956 --> 00:04:22.901

if the editor had not been a female.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:24.671
Stories in the news

00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:28.932
are more than twice as likely
to present women as victims than men,

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:32.805
and women are more likely to be defined
by their body parts.
