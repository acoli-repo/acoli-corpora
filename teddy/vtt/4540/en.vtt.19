It's for The Guardian newspaper.

00:09:30.733 --> 00:09:34.082
It's actually long before I ever thought
about becoming a journalist,

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:37.288
but I was very interested
in how we learn to perceive our world.

00:09:38.823 --> 00:09:43.156
Narrator: An event seen from one
point of view gives one impression.

00:09:48.579 --> 00:09:50.331
Seen from another point of view,

00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:52.720
it gives quite a different impression.

00:09:54.982 --> 00:09:57.360

the whole picture,

00:09:57.384 --> 00:10:00.050
you can fully understand what's going on.
