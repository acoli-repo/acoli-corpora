00:04:27.088 --> 00:04:30.363
depends on a philosophical and ethical question,

00:04:30.363 --> 00:04:32.033
and it's this:

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:34.341
Consider two scenarios.

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:39.577
Scenario A wipes out 90 percent of humanity.

00:04:39.577 --> 00:04:43.473
Scenario B wipes out 100 percent.

00:04:43.473 --> 00:04:46.391
How much worse is B than A?

00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:49.414
Some would say 10 percent worse.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:52.564
The body count is 10 percent higher.

00:04:52.564 --> 00:04:55.470
But I claim that B is incomparably worse.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.099
As an astronomer, I can't believe

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.566
that humans are the end of the story.
