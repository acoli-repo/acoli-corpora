00:02:27.627 --> 00:02:31.490
For instance, there are some eco-extremists

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.999
who think that it would be better for the planet,

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:37.402
for Gaia, if there were far fewer humans.

00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:40.119
What happens when such people have mastered

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.256
synthetic biology techniques

00:02:42.256 --> 00:02:45.108
that will be widespread by 2050?

00:02:45.108 --> 00:02:48.150
And by then, other science fiction nightmares

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.860
may transition to reality:

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.930
dumb robots going rogue,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.347
or a network that develops a mind of its own

00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:56.936
threatens us all.

00:02:56.936 --> 00:03:00.206
Well, can we guard against such risks by regulation?
