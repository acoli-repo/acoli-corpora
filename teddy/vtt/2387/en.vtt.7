There may be setbacks to our society —

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.255
indeed, a 50 percent chance of a severe setback.

00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:39.169
But are there conceivable events

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.330
that could be even worse,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.760
events that could snuff out all life?

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.686
When a new particle accelerator came online,

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.475
some people anxiously asked,

00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:54.384
rip apart the fabric of space?

00:03:54.384 --> 00:03:57.927
Well luckily, reassurance could be offered.

00:03:57.927 --> 00:03:59.971
I and others pointed out that nature

00:03:59.971 --> 00:04:01.904
has done the same experiments
