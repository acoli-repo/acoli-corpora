00:03:59.971 --> 00:04:01.904
has done the same experiments

00:04:01.904 --> 00:04:04.090
zillions of times already,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.855
via cosmic ray collisions.

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:08.909
But scientists should surely be precautionary

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.489
about experiments that generate conditions

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.972
without precedent in the natural world.

00:04:13.972 --> 00:04:17.395
Biologists should avoid release
of potentially devastating

00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:20.110
genetically modified pathogens.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.627
And by the way, our special aversion

00:04:23.627 --> 00:04:27.088
to the risk of truly existential disasters

00:04:27.088 --> 00:04:30.363
depends on a philosophical and ethical question,
