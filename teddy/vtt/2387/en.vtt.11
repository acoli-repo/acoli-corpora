00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:31.820
shouldn't accept even a one in a billion risk

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.049
that human extinction would foreclose

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:36.359
this immense potential.

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:38.131
Some scenarios that have been envisaged

00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:39.950
may indeed be science fiction,

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.336
but others may be disquietingly real.

00:05:43.336 --> 00:05:46.210
It's an important maxim that the unfamiliar

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.907
is not the same as the improbable,

00:05:48.907 --> 00:05:51.305
and in fact, that's why we at Cambridge University

00:05:51.305 --> 00:05:54.680
are setting up a center to study how to mitigate

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.712
these existential risks.

00:05:56.712 --> 00:05:59.775
It seems it's worthwhile just for a few people

00:05:59.775 --> 00:06:02.091
to think about these potential disasters.
