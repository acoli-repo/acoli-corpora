00:03:28.303 --> 00:03:30.598
Six and a half million people

00:03:30.598 --> 00:03:33.320
have fled for their lives.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.210
Over and well over three million people

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.932
have crossed the borders

00:03:37.932 --> 00:03:41.475
and have found sanctuary
in the neighboring countries,

00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:44.400
and only a small proportion, as you see,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.534
have moved on to Europe.

00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:51.205
What I find most worrying

00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:55.131
is that half of all Syrian refugees are children.

00:03:55.131 --> 00:03:57.369

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.294
It was just two hours after she had arrived
