00:00:00.812 --> 00:00:02.449
So I started working

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:04.333
with refugees because I wanted

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.673
to make a difference,

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.080
and making a difference starts

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.436
with telling their stories.

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:11.926
So when I meet refugees,

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:14.726
I always ask them questions.

00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:17.044
Who bombed your house?

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:19.697
Who killed your son?

00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:23.741
Did the rest of your family make it out alive?

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:25.727
How are you coping

00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:28.258
in your life in exile?

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:31.261
But there's one question that always seems to me
