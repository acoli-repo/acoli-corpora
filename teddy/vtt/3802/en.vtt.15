00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:30.546
to help the victims

00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:33.245
and we are doing far too little

00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:35.281
to stop and prevent

00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:38.690
the wars that are driving them from their homes.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.133
And there are more and more victims.

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:46.267
Every day, on average,

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:48.449
by the end of this day,

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:52.297
32,000 people will be forcibly displaced

00:07:52.297 --> 00:07:54.332
from their homes —

00:07:54.332 --> 00:07:57.244
32,000 people.

00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:03.020
They flee across borders like this one.
