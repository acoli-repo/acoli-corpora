00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:32.636
the humanity and the generosity of the countries

00:09:32.636 --> 00:09:36.754
that are hosting so many refugees.

00:09:36.754 --> 00:09:40.386
And all countries should make sure that no one

00:09:40.386 --> 00:09:42.939
fleeing war and persecution

00:09:42.939 --> 00:09:46.652
arrives at a closed border.

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:49.282
(Applause)

00:09:49.282 --> 00:09:52.519
Thank you.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.505
But there is something more that we can do

00:09:56.505 --> 00:10:00.915
than just simply helping refugees survive.
