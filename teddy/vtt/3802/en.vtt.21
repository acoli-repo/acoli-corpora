00:10:27.643 --> 00:10:30.724
as agents of positive change

00:10:30.724 --> 00:10:35.122
and social transformation.

00:10:35.122 --> 00:10:37.508
It makes so much sense,

00:10:37.508 --> 00:10:41.817
but I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia

00:10:41.817 --> 00:10:45.741
that has been raging on for 22 years.

00:10:45.741 --> 00:10:48.250
And imagine living in this camp.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.823
I visited this camp.

00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:51.700
It's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.244
and it was so remote

00:10:54.244 --> 00:10:56.685
that we had to take a helicopter to fly there.

00:10:56.685 --> 00:11:00.131
It was dusty and it was terribly hot.
