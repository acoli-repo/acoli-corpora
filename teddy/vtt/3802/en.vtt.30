00:14:58.926 --> 00:15:01.447
to lasting peace,

00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:03.256
and it's the refugees

00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:06.923
who can stop the cycle of violence.

00:15:06.923 --> 00:15:09.944
Hany is at a tipping point.

00:15:09.944 --> 00:15:12.209
We would love to help him go to university

00:15:12.209 --> 00:15:15.269
and to become an engineer,

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:19.116
but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life:

00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:23.163
tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets,

00:15:23.163 --> 00:15:27.519
food rations and a bit of medicine.

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:30.916
University is a luxury.
