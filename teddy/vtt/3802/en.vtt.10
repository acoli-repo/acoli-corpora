00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:11.950
a generation isolated and frustrated.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.496
And yet, look at what they fled:

00:05:15.496 --> 00:05:17.335
utter destruction,

00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:22.914
buildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.

00:05:22.914 --> 00:05:25.593
Hany's home was also destroyed.

00:05:25.593 --> 00:05:28.806
This will need to be rebuilt

00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:33.637
by architects, by engineers, by electricians.
