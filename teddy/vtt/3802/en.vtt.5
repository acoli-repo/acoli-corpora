And that day, they joined

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.304
the biggest population of refugees in the world,

00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:43.330
in a country, Lebanon, that is tiny.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.981
It only has four million citizens,

00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:49.551

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:58.392
that is not host to Syrian refugees.

00:02:58.392 --> 00:03:01.587
This is generosity and humanity
