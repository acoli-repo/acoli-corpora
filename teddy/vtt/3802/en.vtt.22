00:10:56.685 --> 00:11:00.131
It was dusty and it was terribly hot.

00:11:00.131 --> 00:11:02.425
And we went to visit a school

00:11:02.425 --> 00:11:04.342
and started talking to the children,

00:11:04.342 --> 00:11:06.936
and then I saw this girl across the room

00:11:06.936 --> 00:11:08.785
who looked to me to be the same age

00:11:08.785 --> 00:11:12.066
as my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.

00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:13.610
And I asked her the questions

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.789
that grown-ups ask kids,

00:11:15.789 --> 00:11:17.712
like, "What is your favorite subject?"

00:11:17.712 --> 00:11:20.367
and, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:23.664
And this is when her face turned blank,

00:11:23.664 --> 00:11:25.714
and she said to me,

00:11:25.714 --> 00:11:28.185
"I have no future.

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:31.162
My schooling days are over."
