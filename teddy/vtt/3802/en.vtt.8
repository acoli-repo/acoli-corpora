It was just two hours after she had arrived

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:04.636
after a long trek from Syria into Jordan.

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:08.061
And most troubling of all

00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:11.802
is that only 20 percent of 
Syrian refugee children

00:04:11.802 --> 00:04:15.277
are in school in Lebanon.

00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:18.210
And yet, Syrian refugee children,

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.508
all refugee children tell us

00:04:20.508 --> 00:04:25.574
education is the most important thing in their lives.

00:04:25.574 --> 00:04:29.755
Why? Because it allows them to think of their future

00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:33.150
rather than the nightmare of their past.
