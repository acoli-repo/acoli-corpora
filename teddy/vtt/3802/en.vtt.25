00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.378
chased and pursued by wild
animals and armed gangs,

00:12:30.378 --> 00:12:32.738
and they finally made it to refugee camps

00:12:32.738 --> 00:12:34.271
where they found safety,

00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:36.394
and he would spend the next seven years

00:12:36.394 --> 00:12:39.581
in Kenya in a refugee camp.

00:12:39.581 --> 00:12:42.109
But his life changed

00:12:42.109 --> 00:12:44.212
when he got the chance to be resettled

00:12:44.212 --> 00:12:46.417
to the United States,

00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:49.113
and he found love in a foster family

00:12:49.113 --> 00:12:51.701
and he was able to go to school,

00:12:51.701 --> 00:12:53.995
and he wanted me to share with you

00:12:53.995 --> 00:12:55.563
this proud moment

00:12:55.563 --> 00:12:57.868
when he graduated from university.

00:12:57.868 --> 00:13:01.810
