which he confessed to me he learned

00:06:30.435 --> 00:06:34.089
from reading all of Dan Brown's novels

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:38.444
and from listening to American rap.

00:06:38.444 --> 00:06:41.189
We also spent some nice moments of laughter

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:45.823
and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.

00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:47.444
But I'll never forget what he told me

00:06:47.444 --> 00:06:50.868
when we ended our conversation that day.

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:53.281
He said to me,

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:58.810
"If I am not a student, I am nothing."

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.527
