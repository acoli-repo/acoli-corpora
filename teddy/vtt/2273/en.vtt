00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:02.754
Paleontology,

00:00:02.778 --> 00:00:05.619
a science geared towards small children,

00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:08.532
focused on digging up dinosaurs

00:00:08.556 --> 00:00:10.635
while sporting a "Jurassic Park" costume.

00:00:11.188 --> 00:00:13.236
Skulls are popped out of the ground

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.736
and put on display for public gawking.

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:20.951
The relevance of this, beyond clickbait,
coloring books and monster movies

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:22.125
is unknown.

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:23.942
No ...

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.507
Wait.

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:29.221
That's not paleontology at all.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:33.965
Paleontology is nothing less
than the study of past life.
