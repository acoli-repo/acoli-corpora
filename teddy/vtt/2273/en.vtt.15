00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:30.736
and so much more.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.911
How?

00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:33.141
Why?

00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:35.816
Paleontology is a thriving science

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.374
at the intersection of multiple
other fields and technologies.

00:07:40.398 --> 00:07:43.128
There is no bigger data
than the fossil record,

00:07:43.152 --> 00:07:45.112
and we mine every bit of it.

00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:46.429
We use CAT scans,

00:07:46.453 --> 00:07:47.802
we use isotopes,

00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:49.350
we use genomes,

00:07:49.374 --> 00:07:50.696
we use robots,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.783
we use mathematical simulations

00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:55.149
and all kinds of analytics.

00:07:55.173 --> 00:07:58.970
We maximize all of it
so that we can understand the past

00:07:58.994 --> 00:08:00.594
and how evolution works.
