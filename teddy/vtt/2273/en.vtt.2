[The incredible diversity of ancient life,
Dinosaurs, Paleontology]

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:05.251
It's a very accurate meme;
I didn't even make this one.

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:06.886
This is just the truth.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.590
Anyway, most of us paleontologists
consider dinosaurs to be a gateway drug.

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:15.855
There is so much cooler stuff
in the fossil record,

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:18.227
and we know so much about it.

00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:21.244
Let's go on a brief, dinosaur-free tour

00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:23.482
of the last four billion years.

00:01:23.506 --> 00:01:24.783
(Laughter)

00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:26.720
First up, genetic material.

00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:29.886
Viruses, basically,
started producing proteins

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.102
and wrecking their environment.
