00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.102
and wrecking their environment.

00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:35.243
The Earth was infected with life.

00:01:35.826 --> 00:01:39.723
Some of these new bacteria
learned how to eat sunshine,

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:41.255
producing oxygen,

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:43.247
pulling in carbon from the air

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:47.075
and destroying the iron food
of other microbes

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:48.764
by turning it into rust.

00:01:48.788 --> 00:01:51.557
This went on for billions of years.

00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:54.724
Some bacteria consumed other bacteria,

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:58.423
gaining their power
to turn oxygen into energy,

00:01:58.447 --> 00:02:01.685
becoming the precursors
of animals and plants.
