00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:33.965
Paleontology is nothing less
than the study of past life.

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.545
All past life.

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.264
From ancestors to alien forms.

00:00:38.693 --> 00:00:42.336
It involves fundamental questions
like "Who are we?"

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.042
And "How did we get here?" --

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.736
using the broadest possible
definition of "we":

00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:48.796
life itself.

00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:52.769
Dinosaurs, a category of birds,

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:54.960
are just a small percentage of that.

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:56.182
(Laughter)

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:59.182
Yet they get the most media attention.

00:00:59.206 --> 00:01:02.409
