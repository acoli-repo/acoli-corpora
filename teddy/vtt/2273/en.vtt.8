00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:02.998
It was the age of weird fishes
and plated sea lilies.

00:04:03.022 --> 00:04:04.680
Sharks with wings.

00:04:04.704 --> 00:04:06.609
Sharks with buzz saw jaws.

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:09.299
Sharks with fins covered in tiny teeth.

00:04:09.323 --> 00:04:11.489
Sharks with crushing tooth plates.

00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:14.871
Bony fishes that looked like
modern angelfish and eels

00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:16.274
for the first time.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.014
Wetlands developed,

00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:21.887
sporting ten-foot-long millipedes
and giant dragon flies.

00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:25.474
These spread across the supercontinent
of Pangaea and died,

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.006
creating coal,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.259
leading to a 100-million-year Ice Age.
