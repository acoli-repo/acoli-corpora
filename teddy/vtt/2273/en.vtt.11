00:05:29.053 --> 00:05:31.920
(Laughter)

00:05:32.662 --> 00:05:36.790
So, finally, there were
whale-sized fishes,

00:05:36.814 --> 00:05:38.877
and modern fishes mobbed corals,

00:05:38.901 --> 00:05:44.245
made gigantic by using
their captured algae to eat sunshine.

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:48.697
Crabs, stingrays and other fishes
with crushing teeth appeared,

00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:49.936
smashing shells

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.466
and leading to an arms race
between predators and prey.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.449
There was an explosion
of marine biodiversity.

00:05:57.244 --> 00:05:59.434
Mammals climbed trees, flew

00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:03.693
and did a lot of other things
that are seemingly sort of modern.
