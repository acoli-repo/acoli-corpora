00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.117
Somewhere around China,
a fish developed jaws,

00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:35.768
and its descendants drove jawless fishes,

00:03:35.792 --> 00:03:37.895
sea scorpions and branching plankton

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.537
to extinction.

00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:40.752
Some of these fishes,

00:03:40.776 --> 00:03:42.672
which had arm bones in their fins,

00:03:42.696 --> 00:03:44.141
sprouted fingers,

00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:46.434
seven or eight per flipper.

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:49.252
On land, plants became trees,

00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:50.656
growing massive

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.014
or spreading their spores
only once before dying.

00:03:54.617 --> 00:03:56.958
But then the glaciers came back again,

00:03:56.982 --> 00:03:59.347
and it was mass extinction number two.

00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:02.998
It was the age of weird fishes
and plated sea lilies.
