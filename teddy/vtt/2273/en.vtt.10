00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:02.353
In the ocean, marine reptiles,

00:05:02.377 --> 00:05:06.551
giant rafts made of the living
relatives of sea urchins

00:05:06.853 --> 00:05:11.759
and armored squids, ammonoids,
of every kind and form.

00:05:12.347 --> 00:05:14.760
But then, Pangaea started to split apart,

00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:16.481
forming a sea of lava

00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:19.260
that would one day become
the Atlantic Ocean,

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:21.696
spewing toxic gas into the atmosphere

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.853
and mass extinction number four.

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:25.426
(Laughter)

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.798
Yeah, there's actually
a lot more than these five,

00:05:27.822 --> 00:05:29.029
these are the big ones.

00:05:29.053 --> 00:05:31.920
(Laughter)
