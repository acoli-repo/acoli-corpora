00:01:58.447 --> 00:02:01.685
becoming the precursors
of animals and plants.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.494
But as a result,
there were climate shocks,

00:02:04.518 --> 00:02:07.005
from hot to cold and back again,

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:11.091
which ended up turning the Earth
into a snowball covered with glaciers.

00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:14.834
The technical term for this time period
is "Snowball Earth."

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:18.283
(Laughter)

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:20.728
Seven hundred, eight hundred
million years ago.

00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:23.337
Anyway, microbes banded together,

00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:25.672
creating multicellular life.

00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:27.617
Six hundred million years ago,

00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:31.720
geometric colonies appeared,
sucking microbes from the water.
