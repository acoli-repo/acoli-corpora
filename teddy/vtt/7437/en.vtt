It's Monday morning.

00:00:02.248 --> 00:00:06.335
You've just received a voice notification
from your voice assistant.

00:00:07.628 --> 00:00:09.088
Voice assistant: Good morning.

00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:11.924
There's a new pair of pants
on sale at your favorite store.

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:14.093
Last week, while wearing
your smart glasses,

00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:16.554
you were drawn to a similar
pair on a colleague.

00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:19.140
Would you like to wear them
to the party on Thursday?

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.019
I suggest you skip the movies
tomorrow night to afford them.

00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:25.396
Say "yes" to validate the purchase.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.067
Let me know if I should also
find a gift for your host.

00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:31.569
I can make suggestions
based on your budget
