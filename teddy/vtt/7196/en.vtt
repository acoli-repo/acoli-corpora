Hi there, my name is Sean Sherman,

00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:05.496
I am a chef.

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:08.371
Unfortunately, I don't have food
for you guys tonight.

00:00:08.413 --> 00:00:10.954
Food for thought, I guess, maybe.

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:13.454
I'm here to talk
about Native American food.

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.454
I was born and raised
in Pine Ridge in South Dakota,

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:20.871
and our focus are on Indigenous foods.

00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:24.038
And, you know, it's been
a really interesting journey so far.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.204
I started my company
called The Sioux Chef --

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:29.038
S-I-O-U-X, a little play on words --

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.538
back in 2014.
