Even in places like India and Japan,

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:05.658
where women are not moving rapidly
into the regular job market,

00:11:05.682 --> 00:11:07.515
they're moving into journalism.

00:11:07.539 --> 00:11:11.976
And I think that the television
is like the global campfire.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.976
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.084
Almost always, when I'm on TV,
the producer who calls me,

00:11:20.108 --> 00:11:22.251
who negotiates what we're going to say,

00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:23.330
is a woman.

00:11:23.354 --> 00:11:26.012
In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said,

00:11:26.036 --> 00:11:29.190
"To have a great writer
is to have another government."

00:11:29.682 --> 00:11:34.269
Today 54 percent of people
who are writers in America are women.
