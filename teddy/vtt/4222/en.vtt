00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:05.499
I'd like to talk today
about the two biggest social trends

00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:06.976
in the coming century,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.500
and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:13.976
But I want to start
with my work on romantic love,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.865
because that's my most recent work.

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:20.976
What I and my colleagues did was put
32 people, who were madly in love,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.976
into a functional MRI brain scanner.

00:00:23.368 --> 00:00:26.217
17 who were madly in love
and their love was accepted;

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:29.191
and 15 who were madly in love
and they had just been dumped.
