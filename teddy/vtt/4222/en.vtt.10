00:04:56.028 --> 00:05:00.976
So we could look at the same brain
when it was in that heightened state

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.297
and when it was in a resting state.

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.140
And we found activity
in a lot of brain regions.

00:05:06.164 --> 00:05:08.822
In fact, one of the most important
was a brain region

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:12.054
that becomes active
when you feel the rush of cocaine.

00:05:12.657 --> 00:05:15.000
And indeed, that's exactly what happens.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.269
I began to realize that romantic love
is not an emotion.

00:05:20.293 --> 00:05:23.149
In fact, I had always thought
it was a series of emotions,

00:05:23.173 --> 00:05:24.879
from very high to very low.

00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:26.609
But actually, it's a drive.

00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:28.768
It comes from the motor of the mind,

00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:32.457
the wanting part of the mind,
the craving part of the mind.
