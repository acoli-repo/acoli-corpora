00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:30.571
And indeed, that's what we do.

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.849
(Laughter)

00:01:33.873 --> 00:01:36.469
And then you just focus on this person.

00:01:36.493 --> 00:01:39.310
You can list what you
don't like about them,

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:42.898
but then you sweep that aside
and focus on what you do.

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:44.921
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.691
In trying to understand romantic love,

00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:51.692
I decided I would read poetry
from all over the world,

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:54.368
and I just want to give
you one very short poem

00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:55.639
from eighth-century China,

00:01:55.663 --> 00:01:57.872
because it's an almost perfect example

00:01:57.896 --> 00:02:01.260
of a man who is focused totally
on a particular woman.
