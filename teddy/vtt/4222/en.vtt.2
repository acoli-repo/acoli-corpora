00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:03.666
by looking at the last 45 years
of the psychological research

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.997
and as it turns out,

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:08.975
there's a very specific group of things
that happen when you fall in love.

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:11.976
The first thing that happens is,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.976
a person begins to take on
what I call, "special meaning."

00:01:15.553 --> 00:01:17.195
As a truck driver once said to me,

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.000
"The world had a new center,
and that center was Mary Anne."

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.761
George Bernard Shaw said it differently.

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:26.253
"Love consists of overestimating
the differences

00:01:26.277 --> 00:01:28.285
between one woman and another."

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:30.571
And indeed, that's what we do.
