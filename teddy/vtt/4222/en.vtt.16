I've looked at 130 societies

00:08:04.248 --> 00:08:06.889
through the demographic yearbooks
of the United Nations.

00:08:06.913 --> 00:08:11.645
Everywhere in the world,
129 out of 130 of them,

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:13.976
women are not only moving
into the job market --

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.976
sometimes very, very slowly,
but they are moving into the job market --

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.854
and they are very slowly closing
that gap between men and women

00:08:21.878 --> 00:08:25.675
in terms of economic power,
health and education.

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:26.835
It's very slow.

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:29.976
For every trend on this planet,
there's a counter-trend.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.313
We all know of them, but nevertheless --
