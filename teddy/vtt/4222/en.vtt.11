00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:32.457
the wanting part of the mind,
the craving part of the mind.

00:05:32.481 --> 00:05:33.976
The kind of part of the mind

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.640
when you're reaching
for that piece of chocolate,

00:05:36.664 --> 00:05:40.502
when you want to win
that promotion at work.

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:42.445
The motor of the brain.

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:43.673
It's a drive.

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:46.800
And in fact, I think it's more powerful
than the sex drive.

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:49.649
You know, if you ask somebody
to go to bed with you,

00:05:49.673 --> 00:05:51.110
and they say, "No, thank you,"

00:05:51.134 --> 00:05:54.651
you certainly don't kill yourself
or slip into a clinical depression.

00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:57.868
But certainly, around the world,

00:05:57.892 --> 00:06:01.849
people who are rejected
in love will kill for it.
