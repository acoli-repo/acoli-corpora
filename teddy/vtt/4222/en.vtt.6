00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.159
mood swings into horrible despair
when things are going poorly.

00:03:00.183 --> 00:03:02.637
Real dependence on this person.

00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:05.060
As one businessman in New York said to me,

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.945
"Anything she liked, I liked."

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:09.485
Simple. Romantic love is very simple.

00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:12.976
You become extremely sexually possessive.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.731
You know, if you're just sleeping
with somebody casually,

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:18.625
you don't really care
if they're sleeping with somebody else.

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:20.203
But the moment you fall in love,

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:22.523
you become extremely
sexually possessive of them.

00:03:22.547 --> 00:03:25.976
I think there's a Darwinian
purpose to this.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.633
The whole point of this
is to pull two people together

00:03:28.657 --> 00:03:31.963
strongly enough to begin
to rear babies as a team.
