00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.270
just like with you and me.

00:02:37.294 --> 00:02:40.459
But anyway, not only does this person
take on special meaning,

00:02:40.483 --> 00:02:42.929
you focus your attention on them.

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:44.554
You aggrandize them.

00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:46.339
But you have intense energy.

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:49.858

You're walking till dawn.

00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:56.586
You feel intense elation
when things are going well;

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.159
mood swings into horrible despair
when things are going poorly.
