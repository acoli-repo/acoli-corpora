00:03:57.206 --> 00:04:00.571
The motor in the brain begins to crank,
and you want this person.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.864
And last but not least,
it is an obsession.

00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:07.976
Before I put these people
in the MRI machine,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.976
I would ask them all kinds of questions.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.165
But my most important question
was always the same.

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.976
It was: "What percentage of the day
and night do you think about this person?"

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.890
And indeed, they would say,

00:04:19.914 --> 00:04:22.071
"All day. All night.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.436
I can never stop thinking
about him or her."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.810
And then, the very last question --

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:29.433
I would always have to work
myself up to this question,

00:04:29.457 --> 00:04:31.024
because I'm not a psychologist.
