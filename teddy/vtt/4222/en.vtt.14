00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.333
that sense of calm and security
you can feel for a long-term partner.

00:07:00.698 --> 00:07:03.510
And I think that the sex drive
evolved to get you out there,

00:07:03.534 --> 00:07:06.089
looking for a whole range of partners.

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:08.898
You can feel it when you're just
driving along in your car.

00:07:08.922 --> 00:07:10.294
It can be focused on nobody.

00:07:10.318 --> 00:07:13.976
I think romantic love evolved
to enable you to focus your mating energy

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.976
on just one individual at a time,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.832
thereby conserving mating time and energy.

00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:21.586
And I think that attachment,
the third brain system,

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.152
evolved to enable you to tolerate
this human being

00:07:25.176 --> 00:07:29.229
at least long enough to raise
a child together as a team.
