00:03:28.923 --> 00:03:30.218
there can be some confusion

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:33.278
about when to call someone
by their new name and pronouns.

00:03:33.302 --> 00:03:36.107
There's no distinct point
in physical transition

00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:39.210
at which a trans person
becomes their true gender.

00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:41.719
As soon as they tell you
their new name and pronouns,

00:03:41.743 --> 00:03:43.711
that's when you start using them.

00:03:43.735 --> 00:03:45.775
It can be difficult to make the change.

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.480
You might slip up here and there;

00:03:47.504 --> 00:03:49.854
I've slipped up myself
with other trans people.

00:03:49.878 --> 00:03:51.280
But I always think to myself,

00:03:51.304 --> 00:03:54.798
if we can change from calling
Puff Daddy to P. Diddy,

00:03:54.822 --> 00:03:58.886
and if we apologize profusely
when we've used the wrong gender pronoun

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.473
for someone's pet cat --
