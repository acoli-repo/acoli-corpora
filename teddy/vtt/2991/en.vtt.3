00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:31.818
And when someone comes out as gay,

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:33.203
people know what that means,

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:34.772
but when you come out as trans,

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:36.464
you have to face the misconceptions

00:01:36.488 --> 00:01:38.988
that will color other people's
impressions of you

00:01:39.012 --> 00:01:40.932
even after you've educated them ...

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:43.669
And you will have to educate them.

00:01:43.693 --> 00:01:44.843
When I came out,

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:46.852
I wrote at 10-page encyclopedic document

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:49.368
with a zip-file attachment
of music and videos

00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:51.707
that I sent to every
single person I came out to.

00:01:51.731 --> 00:01:52.817
(Laughter)

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:55.601
And I kept it in my email signature
for months afterwards,

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:58.085
because you also
don't ever stop coming out.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.046
I came out to the accountant
helping me with my taxes
