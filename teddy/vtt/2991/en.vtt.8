00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.473
for someone's pet cat --

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:03.015
I mean, I think we can make
the same effort

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:04.649
for the real humans in our lives.

00:04:05.143 --> 00:04:10.565
Now, there is no topic that makes other
people more awkward about trans people

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:12.294
than public bathrooms.

00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:14.309
Ah, the bathrooms --

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:17.284
the latest political flash point
for LGBT opponents.

00:04:17.308 --> 00:04:19.447
Here's a fun fact about bathrooms:

00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:23.770
more US congressmen have been convicted
of assaulting someone in a public bathroom

00:04:23.794 --> 00:04:25.344
than trans people have been.

00:04:25.368 --> 00:04:27.471
(Laughter)

00:04:27.495 --> 00:04:31.608
The truth is we trans people are so much
more scared of you than you are of us.
