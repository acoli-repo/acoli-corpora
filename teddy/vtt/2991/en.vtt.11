00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:31.057
for trans women,

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.113
for trans people of color,

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:35.508
it is so much harder.

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:39.706
So I've given you a starter pack
of trans knowledge

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.427
that I hope will lead
to more learning on your own.

00:05:43.608 --> 00:05:45.078
Talk to trans people.

00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:46.849
Listen to us.

00:05:47.587 --> 00:05:49.140
Amplify our voices.

00:05:49.934 --> 00:05:52.379
Take the heat off of us
and educate those around you

00:05:52.403 --> 00:05:53.933
so we don't have to every time.

00:05:54.957 --> 00:05:57.120
Maybe someday, when I say,

00:05:57.144 --> 00:05:59.592
"Hi, I'm Jack, and I'm transgender,"
