The truth is we trans people are so much
more scared of you than you are of us.

00:04:31.632 --> 00:04:34.062
It's a huge point of discussion
in trans communities

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:36.234
about which bathroom
to start using and when,

00:04:36.258 --> 00:04:39.594
so we don't attract attention
that could lead to violence against us.

00:04:39.618 --> 00:04:41.594
I personally started using the men's room

00:04:41.618 --> 00:04:46.007
when I started getting confused
and frightened looks in the women's room,

00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.015
even though I was petrified
to start going into the men's room.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.775
And often we opt to just
not go to the bathroom at all.

00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:54.243
A 2015 national survey of trans people

00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:57.398
found that eight percent of us
had had a urinary tract infection

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:58.653
in the past year

00:04:58.677 --> 00:05:00.653
as a result of avoiding restrooms.
