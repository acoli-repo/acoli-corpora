00:01:00.318 --> 00:01:02.746
Being trans is awkward.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.752
And not just because the gender
I was assigned at birth

00:01:05.776 --> 00:01:07.474
mismatches the one I really am.

00:01:07.498 --> 00:01:08.801
Being trans is awkward

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:12.488
because everyone else gets awkward
when they're around me.

00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:16.216
People who support me and all other
trans people wholeheartedly

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.503
are often so scared to say to wrong thing,

00:01:18.527 --> 00:01:21.107
so embarrassed to not know
what they think they should,

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:22.947
that they never ask.

00:01:23.263 --> 00:01:26.544
Part of what was so nerve-racking
about coming out as transgender

00:01:26.568 --> 00:01:29.798
was knowing that people
wouldn't know what I meant.
