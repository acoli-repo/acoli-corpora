00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.871
I would totally support his right
to use the men's bathroom.

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:34.808
Wait, but how does he use the bathroom?

00:00:34.832 --> 00:00:35.990
How does he have sex?"

00:00:36.014 --> 00:00:39.010
OK, OK, let's stop
those hypothetical questions

00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:40.934
before we get too close for my comfort.

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.259
I mean, don't get me wrong,

00:00:42.283 --> 00:00:45.856
I did come here today to share
my personal experiences being transgender,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.682
but I did not wake up this morning
wanting to tell an entire audience

00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:50.967
about my sex life.

00:00:51.398 --> 00:00:54.027
Of course, that's the problem
with being trans, right?

00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:56.797
People are pretty much always
wondering how we have sex

00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:59.884
and what kind of equipment
we're working with below the belt.
