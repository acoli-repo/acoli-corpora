00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.046
I came out to the accountant
helping me with my taxes

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.761
and the TSA agents who didn't know
which one of them should pat me down,

00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:07.253

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.725
think that physical transition
means just one thing:

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:28.954

00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:30.616
