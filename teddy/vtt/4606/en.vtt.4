00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.096
and water shows up as blue.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.656
So here again you can see
that c-shaped pathway

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.600
that this river takes as it exits Nepal.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.136
And now this is monsoon season.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.656
August is monsoon season
in this region of the world,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.576
and anyone that lives near a river
is no stranger to flooding

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.172
and the hazards and inconveniences
at minimum that are associated with that.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.696
But something interesting
happened in 2008,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.616
and this river moved in a way
that's very different.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.640
It flooded in a way that's very
different than it normally does.

00:02:25.664 --> 00:02:28.416
So the Kosi River is flowing down here,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.016
but sometimes as these rivers
are bulldozing sediment,
