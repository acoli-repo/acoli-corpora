00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.176
we know climate has changed,
sea level has changed,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.856
we have a lot of different
types of landscapes

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.616
and different types of environments
that we can go back --

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.016
if we have a time machine --

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.376
we can go back and look at,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.136
and we do indeed have a time machine

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.496
because we can look at the rocks
that were deposited at these times.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.536
So I'm going to give you
an example of this

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.776
and take you to a special
time in earth's past.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.016
About 55 million years ago,
there was a really abrupt warming event,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.536
and what happened was
a whole bunch of carbon dioxide

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.376
was released into earth's atmosphere,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.256
and it caused a rapid
and pretty extreme global warming event.
