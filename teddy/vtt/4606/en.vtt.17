00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.976
this is actually a fossil river,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.667
so just like this cartoon I showed,

00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:35.976
these are deposits that were
laid down 55 million years ago.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.096
As geologists, we can go
and look at these up close

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.549
and reconstruct the landscape.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.736
So here's another example.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.216
The yellow blob here is a fossil river.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.776
Here's another one above it.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.096
We can go and look in detail
and make measurements and observations,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.496
and we can measure features.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.896
For example, the features
I just highlighted there

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.376
tell us that this particular river
was probably about three feet deep.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.496
You could wade
across this cute little stream

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.760
if you were walking around
55 million years ago.
