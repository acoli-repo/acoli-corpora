00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.336
This is really valuable real estate,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.616
and deltas like this are some of the most
densely populated areas on our planet.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.096
So understanding the dynamics
of these landscapes,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.256
how they formed and how they will
continue to change in the future

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.680
is really important
for the people that live there.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.016
So rivers also wiggle.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.936
These are sort of bigger jumps
that we've been talking about.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.216
I want to show you guys
some river wiggles here.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.776
So we're going to fly down
to the Amazon River basin,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.816
and here again we have a big river system

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.216
that is draining and moving and plowing
material from the Andean Mountains,
