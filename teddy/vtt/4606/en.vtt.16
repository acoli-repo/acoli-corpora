00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.256
and it caused a rapid
and pretty extreme global warming event.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.936
And when I say warm, I mean pretty warm,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.936
that there were things
like crocodiles and palm trees

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.976
as far north as Canada
and as far south as Patagonia.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.176
So this was a pretty warm time
and it happened really abruptly.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.416
So what we can do

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.496
is we can go back and find rocks
that were deposited at this time

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.120
and reconstruct how the landscape changed
in response to this warming event.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.456
So here, yay, rocks.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.816
(Laughter)

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.576
Here's a pile of rocks.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.216
This yellow blob here,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.976
this is actually a fossil river,
