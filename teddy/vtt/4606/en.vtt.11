00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.320
It changes and evolves
and warps its pattern.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.216
If you look in this area in particular,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.216
I want you guys to notice
there's a sort of a loop in the river

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.656
that gets completely cut off.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.256
It's almost like a whip cracking

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.960
and snaps off the pathway
of the river at a certain spot.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.976
So just for reference, again,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.936
in this location, that river
changed its course over four miles

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.640
over the course of a season or two.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.976
So the landscapes
that we live in on earth,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.416
as this material
is being eroded from the mountains

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.776
and transported to the sea,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.416
are wiggling around all the time.
