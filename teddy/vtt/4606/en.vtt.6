00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.736
So this river got clogged
and it jumped its banks.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.856
Here's an image from about a week later,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.136
and you can see
these are the previous pathways,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.816
and you can see this process
of river-jumping continues

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.412
as this river moves farther away
from its major course.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.976
So you can imagine
in landscapes like this,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.616
where rivers move around frequently,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.136
it's really important to understand when,
where and how they're going to jump.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.040
But these kinds of processes
also happen a lot closer to home as well.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.456
So in the United States,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.536
we have the Mississippi River
that drains most of the continental US.
