00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.776
So ultimately,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.416
as long as earth's surface is our home,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.816
we need to carefully manage
the resources and risks

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.816
associated with living
in dynamic environments.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.776
And I think the only way
we can really do that sustainably

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.016
is if we include information

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.136
about how landscapes evolved
and behaved in earth's past.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.376
Thank you.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.840
