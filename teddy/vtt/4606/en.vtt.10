00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.216
that is draining and moving and plowing
material from the Andean Mountains,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.056
transporting it across South America

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.760
and dumping it out
into the Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.256
So if we zoom in here, you guys
can see these nice, curvy river pathways.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.256
Again, they're really beautiful,
but again, they're not static.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.016
These rivers wiggle around.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.656
We can use satellite imagery
over the last 30 or so years

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.816
to actually monitor how these change.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.016
So take a minute and just watch
any bend or curve in this river,

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.016
and you'll see it doesn't stay
in the same place for very long.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.320
It changes and evolves
and warps its pattern.
