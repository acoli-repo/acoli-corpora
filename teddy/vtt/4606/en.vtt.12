00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.416
are wiggling around all the time.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.896
They're changing all the time,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.376
and we need to be able
to understand these processes

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.136
so we can manage and live
sustainably on these landscapes.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.216
But it's hard to do
if the only information we have

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.576
is what's going on today
at earth's surface.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.656
Right? We don't have
a lot of observations.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.496
We only have 30 years' worth
of satellite photos, for example.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.416
We need more observations
to understand these processes more.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.056
And additionally, we need to know

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.296
how these landscapes are going
to respond to changing climate

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.576
and to changing land use

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.440
as we continue to occupy
and modify earth's surface.
