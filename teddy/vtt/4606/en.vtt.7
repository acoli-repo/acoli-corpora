00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.536
we have the Mississippi River
that drains most of the continental US.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.936
It pushes material
from the Rocky Mountains

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.496
and from the Great Plains.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.736
It drains it and moves it
all the way across America

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.680
and dumps it out in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.776
So this is the course of the Mississippi
that we're familiar with today,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.896
but it didn't always flow
in this direction.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.576
If we use the geologic record,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.320
we can reconstruct
where it went in the past.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.416
So for example, this red area here

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.976
is where we know the Mississippi River
flowed and deposited material

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.640
about 4,600 years ago.
