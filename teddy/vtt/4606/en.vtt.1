00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.256
So there's a lot of exciting things
that go on on the surface of the earth.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.840
If we zoom in here a little bit,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.016
I want to talk to you guys a little bit
about one of the things that happens.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.786
Material get shuffled around
earth's surface all the time,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.036
and one of the big thing that happens
is material from high mountains

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.536
gets eroded and transported
and deposited in the sea.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.516
And this process is ongoing all the time,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.936
and it has huge effects
on how the landscape works.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.856
So this example here in south India --

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.376
we have some of the biggest
mountains in the world,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.376
and you can see in this satellite photo

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.576
rivers transporting material
from those mountains out to the sea.
