00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.736
and see what the landscapes
looked like in the past.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.896
We can do this to help reconstruct

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.240
and understand
how earth landscapes evolve.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.776
This is pretty convenient, too,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.776
because the earth has had
sort of an epic history. Right?

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.616
So this video here
is a reconstruction of paleogeography

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.256
for just the first
600 million years of earth's history.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.256
So just a little bit of time here.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.016
So as the plates move around,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.176
we know climate has changed,
sea level has changed,
