00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:04.240
All right, let's get up
our picture of the earth.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.976
The earth is pretty awesome.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.429
I'm a geologist, so I get
pretty psyched about this,

00:00:08.453 --> 00:00:09.816
but the earth is great.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.296
It's powerful, it's dynamic,
it's constantly changing.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.120
It's a pretty exciting place to live.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.976
But I want to share with you guys today
my perspective as a geologist

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.216
in how understanding earth's past

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.736
can help inform and guide
decisions that we make today

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.840
about how to sustainably live
on earth's surface.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.256
So there's a lot of exciting things
that go on on the surface of the earth.
