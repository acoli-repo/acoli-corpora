00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.576
rivers transporting material
from those mountains out to the sea.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.775
You can think of these rivers
like bulldozers.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.520
They're basically taking these mountains
and pushing them down towards the sea.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.256
We'll give you guys an example here.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.616
So we zoom in a little bit.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.176
I want to talk to you guys
specifically about a river.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.856
We can see these beautiful patterns
that the rivers make

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.976
as they're pushing material
down to the sea,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.616
but these patterns aren't static.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.326
These rivers are wiggling
and jumping around quite a bit,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.316
and it can have big impacts on our lives.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.736
So an example of this
is this is the Kosi River.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.416
So the Kosi River
has this nice c-shaped pathway,
