00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.136
if we look what happened
before this abrupt warming event,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.776
the rivers kind of carved their way
down from the mountains to the sea,

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.936
and they looked maybe similar to what
I showed you in the Amazon River basin.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.416
But right at the onset
of this climate change event,

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.920
the rivers change dramatically.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.336
All of a sudden they got much broader,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.920
and they started to slide back and forth
across the landscape more readily.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.776
Eventually, the rivers reverted
back to a state that was more similar

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.616
to what they would have looked like
before this climate event,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.280
but it took a long, long time.
