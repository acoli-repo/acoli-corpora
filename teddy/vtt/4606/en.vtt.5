00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.016
but sometimes as these rivers
are bulldozing sediment,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.296
they kind of get clogged,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.456
and these clogs can
actually cause the rivers

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.176
to shift their course dramatically.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.056
So this satellite image
is from just two weeks later.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.016
Here's the previous pathway,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.656
that c-shaped pathway,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.776
and you notice it's not blue anymore.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.776
But now what we have is this blue pathway

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.256
that cuts down the middle
of the field of view here.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.616
What happened is
the Kosi River jumped its banks,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.336
and for reference,
the scale bar here is 40 miles.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.880
This river moved
over 30 miles very abruptly.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.736
So this river got clogged
and it jumped its banks.
