00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.760
if you were walking around
55 million years ago.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.376
The reddish stuff that's above
and below those channels,

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.176
those are ancient soil deposits.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.056
So we can look at those to tell us
what lived and grew on the landscape

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.640
and to understand how these rivers
were interacting with their floodplains.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.056
So we can look in detail
and reconstruct with some specificity

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.936
how these rivers flowed
and what the landscapes looked like.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.440
So when we do this
for this particular place

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.376
at this time,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.136
if we look what happened
before this abrupt warming event,
