00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.336
Then about 3,500 years ago it moved

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.736
to follow the course
outlined here in orange.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.776
And it kept moving and it keeps moving.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.696
So here's about 2,000 years ago,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.416
a thousand years ago,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.656
700 years ago.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.096
And it was only
as recently as 500 years ago

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.959
that it occupied the pathway
that we're familiar with today.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.016
So these processes are really important,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.896
and especially here, this delta area,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.736
where these river-jumping events
in the Mississippi

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.576
are building land at the interface
of the land and the sea.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.336
This is really valuable real estate,
