00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.440
as we continue to occupy
and modify earth's surface.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.696
So this is where the rocks come in.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.216
So as rivers flow,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.136
as they're bulldozing material
from the mountains to the sea,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.616
sometimes bits of sand and clay
and rock get stuck in the ground.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.336
And that stuff that gets stuck
in the ground gets buried,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.096
and through time, we get
big, thick accumulations of sediments

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.136
that eventually turn into rocks.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.736
What this means is that we can
go to places like this,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.456
where we see big, thick stacks
of sedimentary rocks,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.976
and go back in time

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.736
and see what the landscapes
looked like in the past.
