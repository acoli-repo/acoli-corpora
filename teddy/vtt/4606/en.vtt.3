00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.416
So the Kosi River
has this nice c-shaped pathway,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.896
and it exits the big mountains of Nepal

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.056
carrying with it a ton of material,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.046
a lot of sediments that's being
eroded from the high mountains,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.926
and it spreads out across India

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.270
and moves this material.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.856
So we're going to zoom in to this area

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.309
and I'm going to tell you a little bit
about what happened with the Kosi.

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.896
It's an example of how dynamic
these systems can be.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.496
So this is a satellite image
from August of 2008,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.216
and this satellite image is colored

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.416
so that vegetations or plants
show up as green

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.096
and water shows up as blue.
