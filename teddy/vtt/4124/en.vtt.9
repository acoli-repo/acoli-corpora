00:04:28.096 --> 00:04:30.999
Well, it's very clear that poverty here

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:32.774
was almost halved,

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:34.453
and in U.S., when we asked the public,

00:04:34.453 --> 00:04:38.437
only five percent got it right.

00:04:38.437 --> 00:04:41.306
And you?

00:04:41.306 --> 00:04:45.164
Ah, you almost made it to the chimps.

00:04:45.164 --> 00:04:47.525
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:53.142
That little, just a few of you!

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:56.821
There must be preconceived ideas, you know.

00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:58.615
And many in the rich countries,

00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:02.275
they think that oh, we can never end extreme poverty.
