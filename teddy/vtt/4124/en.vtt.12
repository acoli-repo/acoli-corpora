00:05:59.281 --> 00:06:01.356
See, there was one hump here,

00:06:01.356 --> 00:06:03.254
around one dollar a day,

00:06:03.254 --> 00:06:04.710
and then there was one hump here

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.725
somewhere between 10 and 100 dollars.

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:08.471
The world was two groups.

00:06:08.471 --> 00:06:12.081
It was a camel world, like a camel with two humps,

00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:14.093
the poor ones and the rich ones,

00:06:14.093 --> 00:06:15.657
and there were fewer in between.

00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:17.826
But look how this has changed:

00:06:17.826 --> 00:06:19.652
As I go forward, what has changed,

00:06:19.652 --> 00:06:21.308
the world population has grown,

00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:24.076
and the humps start to merge.

00:06:24.076 --> 00:06:26.846
The lower humps merged with the upper hump,

00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:29.973
and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.228
with one hump only.
