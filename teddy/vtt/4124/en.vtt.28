00:13:58.431 --> 00:14:00.445
Let's start with the first misconception.

00:14:00.445 --> 00:14:02.082
This is very widespread.

00:14:02.082 --> 00:14:03.948
Everything is getting worse.

00:14:03.948 --> 00:14:07.218
You heard it. You thought it yourself.

00:14:07.218 --> 00:14:10.247
The other way to think is, most things improve.

00:14:10.247 --> 00:14:12.383
So you're sitting with a question in front of you

00:14:12.383 --> 00:14:15.616
and you're unsure. You should guess "improve."

00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:18.600
Okay? Don't go for the worse.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.963
That will help you score better on our tests.

00:14:20.963 --> 00:14:22.179
(Applause)

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:26.405
That was the first one.

00:14:26.405 --> 00:14:28.164
There are rich and poor

00:14:28.164 --> 00:14:29.630
and the gap is increasing.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.285
It's a terrible inequality.
