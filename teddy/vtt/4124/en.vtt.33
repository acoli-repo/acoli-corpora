00:16:29.785 --> 00:16:31.830
and how to bring girls in school.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.170
When we realize that actually it's
succeeding, we can understand it.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.982
But is it important for everyone else

00:16:37.982 --> 00:16:40.436
who cares about the rich end of this scale?

00:16:40.436 --> 00:16:42.480
I would say yes, extremely important,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.989
for the same reason.

00:16:43.989 --> 00:16:47.054
If you have a fact-based worldview of today,

00:16:47.054 --> 00:16:48.672
you might have a chance to understand

00:16:48.672 --> 00:16:50.426
what's coming next in the future.

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:52.864
We're going back to these two humps in 1975.

00:16:52.864 --> 00:16:54.214
That's when I was born,

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:57.233
and I selected the West.

00:16:57.233 --> 00:17:01.416
That's the current EU countries and North America.
