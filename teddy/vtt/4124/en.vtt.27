00:13:27.634 --> 00:13:31.213
There is, of course, one way,

00:13:31.213 --> 00:13:32.950
which is to sit down late nights

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.105
and learn all the facts by heart

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:36.873
by reading all these reports.

00:13:36.873 --> 00:13:38.885
That will never happen, actually.

00:13:38.885 --> 00:13:41.594
Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen.

00:13:41.594 --> 00:13:42.967
People don't have that time.

00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:46.350
People like shortcuts, and here are the shortcuts.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.124
We need to turn our intuition into strength again.

00:13:49.124 --> 00:13:50.568
We need to be able to generalize.

00:13:50.568 --> 00:13:52.673
So now I'm going to show you some tricks

00:13:52.673 --> 00:13:55.223
where the misconceptions are turned around

00:13:55.223 --> 00:13:58.431
into rules of thumb.

00:13:58.431 --> 00:14:00.445
Let's start with the first misconception.
