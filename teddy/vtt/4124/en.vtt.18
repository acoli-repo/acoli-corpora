It's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden.

00:09:01.579 --> 00:09:05.376
It's a neighborhood where I grew up,

00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:08.977
and it's a neighborhood with a large problem.

00:09:08.977 --> 00:09:10.963
Actually, it has exactly the same problem

00:09:10.963 --> 00:09:13.572
which existed in all the neighborhoods

00:09:13.572 --> 00:09:14.920
where you grew up as well.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.582
It was not representative. Okay?

00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:20.025
It gave me a very biased view

00:09:20.025 --> 00:09:22.373
of how life is on this planet.

00:09:22.373 --> 00:09:25.365
So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle.

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:26.637
We have a personal bias.

00:09:26.637 --> 00:09:28.750
We have all different experiences

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.390
from communities and people we meet,
