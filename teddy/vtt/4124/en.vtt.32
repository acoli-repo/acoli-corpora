00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:03.844
They cannot generalize these kinds of rules.

00:16:03.844 --> 00:16:07.856
And hopefully we can turn your world around

00:16:07.856 --> 00:16:10.691
and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay?

00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:14.612
(Applause)

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.248
That's a systematic approach.

00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:23.812
Now the question, is this important?

00:16:23.812 --> 00:16:26.538
Yeah, it's important to understand poverty,

00:16:26.538 --> 00:16:29.785
extreme poverty and how to fight it,

00:16:29.785 --> 00:16:31.830
and how to bring girls in school.
