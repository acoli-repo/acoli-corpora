00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.484
However, Ola's approach

00:07:30.484 --> 00:07:33.642
to really measure what we know made headlines,

00:07:33.642 --> 00:07:36.705
and CNN published these results on their web

00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:38.852
and they had the questions there, millions answered,

00:07:38.852 --> 00:07:42.334
and I think there were about 2,000 comments,

00:07:42.334 --> 00:07:44.647
and this was one of the comments.

00:07:44.647 --> 00:07:48.191
"I bet no member of the media
passed the test," he said.

00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:50.830
So Ola told me, "Take these devices.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.535
You are invited to media conferences.

00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:54.812
Give it to them and measure what the media know."

00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:56.736
And ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:56.736 --> 00:07:59.413
for the first time, the informal results

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:03.338
from a conference with U.S. media.
