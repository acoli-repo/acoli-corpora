00:11:58.898 --> 00:12:00.875
scale it up to all domains

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:03.423
or dimensions of global development,

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:07.505
such as climate, endangered species, human rights,

00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:10.715
gender equality, energy, finance.

00:12:10.715 --> 00:12:13.448
All different sectors have facts,

00:12:13.448 --> 00:12:15.044
and there are organizations trying to spread

00:12:15.044 --> 00:12:16.970
awareness about these facts.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.674
So I've started actually contacting some of them,

00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:24.015
like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF,

00:12:24.015 --> 00:12:26.613
and asking them, what are your favorite facts

00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:28.506
which you think the public doesn't know?

00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:30.084
Okay, I gather those facts.
