00:12:56.674 --> 00:13:00.429
a school, a university, or maybe a news agency,

00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:04.057
to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable.

00:13:04.057 --> 00:13:07.020
Basically meaning, we don't hire people

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.290
who score like chimpanzees.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.650
Of course you shouldn't.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.921
So maybe 10 years from now,

00:13:13.921 --> 00:13:15.913
if this project succeeds,

00:13:15.913 --> 00:13:18.161
you will be sitting in an interview

00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:22.367
having to fill out this crazy global knowledge.

00:13:22.367 --> 00:13:25.730
So now we come to the practical tricks.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.634
How are you going to succeed?

00:13:27.634 --> 00:13:31.213
There is, of course, one way,
