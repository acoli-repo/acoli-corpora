00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:00.529
So that's what we are focusing on.

00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:02.098
So we have these outdated facts

00:10:02.098 --> 00:10:05.032
added on top of our personal bias.

00:10:05.032 --> 00:10:07.508
What happens next is news, okay?

00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:10.025
An excellent journalist knows how to pick

00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:12.431
the story that will make headlines,

00:10:12.431 --> 00:10:15.030
and people will read it because it's sensational.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.995
Unusual events are more interesting, no?

00:10:18.995 --> 00:10:20.710
And they are exaggerated,

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.139
and especially things we're afraid of.

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:26.567
A shark attack on a Swedish person

00:10:26.567 --> 00:10:30.282
will get headlines for weeks in Sweden.
