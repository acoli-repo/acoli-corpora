00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:30.084
Okay, I gather those facts.

00:12:30.084 --> 00:12:33.619
Imagine a long list with, say, 250 facts.

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:34.918
And then we poll the public

00:12:34.918 --> 00:12:36.855
and see where they score worst.

00:12:36.855 --> 00:12:38.201
So we get a shorter list

00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:39.257
with the terrible results,

00:12:39.257 --> 00:12:41.806
like some few examples from Hans,

00:12:41.806 --> 00:12:43.723
and we have no problem finding these kinds

00:12:43.723 --> 00:12:44.938
of terrible results.

00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:47.783
Okay, this little shortlist, what
are we going to do with it?

00:12:47.783 --> 00:12:51.909
Well, we turn it into a knowledge certificate,

00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:53.771
a global knowledge certificate,

00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:56.674
which you can use, if you're a large organization,

00:12:56.674 --> 00:13:00.429
a school, a university, or maybe a news agency,
