00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.390
from communities and people we meet,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.377
and on top of this, we start school,

00:09:33.377 --> 00:09:35.298
and we add the next problem.

00:09:35.298 --> 00:09:36.442
Well, I like schools,

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:41.529
but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews,

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:44.130
because they learned something
when they went to school,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.683
and now they describe this world to the students

00:09:46.683 --> 00:09:48.889
without any bad intentions,

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:51.118
and those books, of course, that are printed

00:09:51.118 --> 00:09:54.049
are outdated in a world that changes.

00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:55.296
And there is really no practice

00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:58.545
to keep the teaching material up to date.

00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:00.529
So that's what we are focusing on.
