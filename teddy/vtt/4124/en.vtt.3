00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.887
floods, earthquakes, volcanic 
eruption, whatever, droughts.

00:01:32.887 --> 00:01:35.607
And then, how did that change?

00:01:35.607 --> 00:01:39.093
Gapminder asked the public in Sweden.

00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:40.952
This is how they answered.

00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:42.881
The Swedish public answered like this:

00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:44.353
Fifty percent thought it had doubled,

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:46.558
38 percent said it's more or less the same,

00:01:46.558 --> 00:01:48.656
12 said it had halved.

00:01:48.656 --> 00:01:51.308
This is the best data from the disaster researchers,

00:01:51.308 --> 00:01:54.274
and it goes up and down,

00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:56.826
and it goes to the Second World War,

00:01:56.826 --> 00:02:00.226
and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling
