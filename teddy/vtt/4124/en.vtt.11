00:05:29.504 --> 00:05:31.048
and he wanted, Ola told me

00:05:31.048 --> 00:05:33.608
we have to be more systematic

00:05:33.608 --> 00:05:35.481
when we fight devastating ignorance.

00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:37.699
So already the pilots reveal this,

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.909
that so many in the public score worse than random,

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:42.992
so we have to think about preconceived ideas,

00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:45.020
and one of the main preconceived ideas

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.889
is about world income distribution.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.720
Look here. This is how it was in 1975.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.939
It's the number of people on each income,

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:56.830
from one dollar a day —

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.281
(Applause)

00:05:59.281 --> 00:06:01.356
See, there was one hump here,
