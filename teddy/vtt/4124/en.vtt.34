00:16:57.233 --> 00:17:01.416
That's the current EU countries and North America.

00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:04.799
Let's now see how the rest and the West compares

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:06.880
in terms of how rich you are.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.131
These are the people who can afford

00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:12.709
to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation.

00:17:12.709 --> 00:17:16.017
In 1975, only 30 percent of them lived

00:17:16.017 --> 00:17:18.984
outside EU and North America.

00:17:18.984 --> 00:17:21.313
But this has changed, okay?

00:17:21.313 --> 00:17:26.056
So first, let's look at the change up till today, 2014.

00:17:26.056 --> 00:17:27.444
Today it's 50/50.

00:17:27.444 --> 00:17:31.125
The Western domination is over, as of today.
