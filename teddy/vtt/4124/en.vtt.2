00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.067
who live in extreme poverty change?

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:02.628
Extreme poverty — not having 
enough food for the day.

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.689
Did it almost double,

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.238
did it remain more or less the same,

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:07.751
or did it halve?

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:11.771
A, B or C?

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.927
Now, answers.

00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:16.021
You see,

00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:17.746
deaths from natural disasters in the world,

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:19.668
you can see it from this graph here,

00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:22.448
from 1900 to 2000.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:25.703
In 1900, there was about half a million people

00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:27.790
who died every year from natural disasters:

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.887
floods, earthquakes, volcanic 
eruption, whatever, droughts.
