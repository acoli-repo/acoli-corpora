Hans Rosling: I'm going to ask you

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.391
three multiple choice questions.

00:00:04.391 --> 00:00:08.122
Use this device. Use this device to answer.

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:10.677
The first question is, how did the number

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.798
of deaths per year

00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:14.090
from natural disaster,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.691
how did that change during the last century?

00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:18.070
Did it more than double,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.852
did it remain about the same in the world as a whole,

00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:23.226
or did it decrease to less than half?

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:25.630
Please answer A, B or C.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.730
I see lots of answers. This is much
faster than I do it at universities.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.887
They are so slow. They keep
thinking, thinking, thinking.
