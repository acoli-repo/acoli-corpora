00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:31.257
The chimps don't watch the evening news,

00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:32.715
so the chimps,

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:36.147
they choose by random, so the
Swedes answer worse than random.

00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:39.086
Now how did you do?

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:42.048
That's you.

00:02:42.048 --> 00:02:44.273
You were beaten by the chimps.

00:02:44.273 --> 00:02:46.063
(Laughter)

00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:49.038
But it was close.

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:53.059
You were three times better than the Swedes,

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.302
but that's not enough.

00:02:54.302 --> 00:02:56.884
You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes.

00:02:56.884 --> 00:03:00.415
You must have higher ambitions in the world.
