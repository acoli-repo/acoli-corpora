00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.091
So often,

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:05.068
I'll take a fitness class,

00:00:05.092 --> 00:00:07.924
or I'll go to a music venue,

00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:11.283
or, really, anywhere that plays
music in the background,

00:00:11.307 --> 00:00:14.336
and I'll find myself loving the rhythms

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.753
and the melodies and the beats ...

00:00:17.357 --> 00:00:19.956
And then I take a second
to listen to the lyrics,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.596
lyrics that, for example,
place us in a position of subservience

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.852
that we would never tolerate
in any other context.

00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:31.153
And I'm aghast at the degree to which
we normalize sexism in our culture.
