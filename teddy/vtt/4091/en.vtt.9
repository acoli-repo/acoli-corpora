Music should be safe 
and accessible for all to experience.

00:04:30.192 --> 00:04:33.049
As you can see, it's not about
losing the sex appeal or swag

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:34.278
that music has,

00:04:34.302 --> 00:04:38.049
it's about writing messages
that infuse tenderness and positivity

00:04:38.073 --> 00:04:41.023
into music that motivates us
and challenges us.

00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:45.178
And while we as musicians
absolutely have the responsibility

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:47.968
to make music that isn't disempowering,

00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:50.408
the consumers can be
part of the change, too.

00:04:50.432 --> 00:04:52.992
Firstly, we get to choose
which songs we want to mute

00:04:53.016 --> 00:04:54.912
and which songs we want to turn louder.

00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:58.839
We get to say, "I respect myself enough
to say I don't want to listen to this,

00:04:58.863 --> 00:05:01.735
and I don't want this to be
in anybody else's space, either."
