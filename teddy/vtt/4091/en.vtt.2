And while I have no problem
with male fantasy,

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.506
what I do have a problem with

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.290
is that, according to a recent study,
only 2.6 percent of all music producers

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:12.786
identify as women.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.003
That means an even smaller percentage
identify as trans or gender nonconforming.

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:19.497
And why does this matter?

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:22.930
Because, if we don't own
and control our own narrative,

00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:26.121
somebody else will
tell our stories for us,

00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:27.958
and they will get it wrong,

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:31.133
perpetuating the very myths
that hold us back.
