and I don't want this to be
in anybody else's space, either."

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.038
Secondly, we can simply ask ourselves:

00:05:04.062 --> 00:05:06.090
"Does this music or this message

00:05:06.114 --> 00:05:08.312
contribute to the oppression
of somebody else?

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:09.517
Why am I tolerating it?"

00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:13.696
And finally, we can all be choosing
to make playlists or DJ-ing music

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.274
that provides the right vibe or mood
that we're looking for in that moment

00:05:17.298 --> 00:05:19.216
without the problematic messaging.

00:05:19.683 --> 00:05:20.896
Why does this matter?

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.354
Because it's teaching algorithms

00:05:24.378 --> 00:05:27.420
exactly what it is that
we do want to listen to,

00:05:28.444 --> 00:05:31.335
creating long-term change
and a feedbacking mechanism
