00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:30.995
I want us to celebrate the authentic,

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.368
nuanced,

00:03:32.392 --> 00:03:35.757
multidimensional aspects
of our human existence,

00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:41.694
rather than perform false narratives
of degrading sexuality

00:03:41.718 --> 00:03:44.269
in order to feel accepted or loved.

00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:47.186
And another strategy
that I take in my music

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.126
to combat the misogyny
that exists on the airwaves

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.890
is to visually depict the very world
I wished we lived in.

00:03:53.914 --> 00:03:56.474
In the music video
for my song "See Me Thru,"

00:03:56.498 --> 00:04:00.755
which is like a vibe-y,
queer electronic R and B song,
