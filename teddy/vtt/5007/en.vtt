00:00:06.886 --> 00:00:11.216
Deep beneath the geysers and hot springs 
of Yellowstone Caldera

00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:16.184
lies a magma chamber produced by a 
hot spot in the earth’s mantle.

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:19.077
As the magma moves towards 
the Earth’s surface,

00:00:19.077 --> 00:00:23.337
it crystallizes to form young, 
hot igneous rocks.

00:00:23.337 --> 00:00:27.392
The heat from these rocks drives 
groundwater towards the surface.

00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:32.882
As the water cools, ions precipitate out 
as mineral crystals,
