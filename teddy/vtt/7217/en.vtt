I love cars. I really do.

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:06.627
But what we are currently doing
is a bit insane.

00:00:06.627 --> 00:00:09.088
Cars put smog in the air,

00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:11.758
create traffic and congestion

00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:13.468
and cause accidents.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.929
This might seem like
a crazy thing for me to say,

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:22.185
but I am hoping for a future
with fewer cars,

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:26.522
mostly smart EVs
and cars that can do more for us.

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:30.485
Some of the biggest changes
that ever took place in the auto industry
