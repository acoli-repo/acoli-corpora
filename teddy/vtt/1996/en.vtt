00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm an ecologist,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
mostly a coral reef ecologist.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I started out in Chesapeake Bay

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and went diving in the winter

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and became a tropical ecologist overnight.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And it was really a lot of fun

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for about 10 years.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I mean, somebody pays you

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to go around and travel

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and look at some of the most

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
beautiful places on the planet.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And that was what I did.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I ended up in Jamaica,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in the West Indies,
