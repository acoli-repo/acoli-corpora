00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.096
And what they came up with
was the school library,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.056
and they came up with this idea
called the Library Initiative.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.456
All the students
have to pass through the library.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.816
That's where the books are.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.176
That's where the heart
and soul of the school is.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.616
So let's fix these libraries.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.176
So they did this wonderful thing
where they brought in

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.296
first 10, then 20, then more architects,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.056
each one of whom was assigned a library
to rethink what a library was.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.136
They trained special librarians.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.216
So they started this mighty enterprise

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.256
to reform public schools
by improving these libraries.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.936
Then they called me up and they said,
"Could you make a little contribution?"
