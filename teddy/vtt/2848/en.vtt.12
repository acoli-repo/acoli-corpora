00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:01.496
"Here's your logo. Put it on both doors."

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.536
"Here's your logo.
Put it off to the side."

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.816
"Here's your logo
repeated all over to the top."

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.536
So everything was going swimmingly.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.216
I just was saying,
"Here's your logo. Here's your logo."

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.376
Then I got a call
from one of the architects,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.256
a guy named Richard Lewis,
and he says, "I've got a problem.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.296

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.536
And I said, OK, sure."

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.136
And he said, "The problem is
that there's a space

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.976
between the shelf and the ceiling."

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.336
So that sounds like
an architectural issue to me,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.456
not a graphic design issue,
so I'm, "Go on."

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.136
And Richard says, "Well,
the top shelf has to be low enough
