00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.456
and I said, "Dorothy, there's no budget,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.656
can you come to this school
in east New York, take these pictures?"

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.896
And she did,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.896
and if you go in Richard's library,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.776
which is one of the first that opened,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.896
it has this glorious frieze
of, like, the heroes of the school,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.616
oversized, looking down

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.656
into the little dollhouse
of the real library, right?

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.496
And the kids were great,
hand-selected by the principals

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.296
and the librarian.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.576
It just kind of created
this heroic atmosphere in this library,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.096
this very dignified setting below
and the joy of the children above.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.456
So naturally all the other librarians
in the other schools see this
