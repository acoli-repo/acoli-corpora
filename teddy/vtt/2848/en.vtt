00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.376
So there's this thing called
the law of unintended consequences.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.136
I thought it was just like a saying,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.736
but it actually exists, I guess.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.680
There's, like, academic papers about it.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.376
And I'm a designer.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.256
I don't like unintended consequences.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.856
People hire me because they have
consequences that they really intend,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.736
and what they intend is for me
to help them achieve those consequences.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.776
So I live in fear
of unintended consequences.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.480
And so this is a story about
consequences intended and unintended.
