00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.056
and like to think I can think through
the experience to that extent,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.296
but I can't.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.296
I was just focused on a foot ahead of me,
as far as I could reach with my own hands.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.896
Instead, way off in the distance

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.176
was a librarian

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.136
who was going to find
the chain of consequences

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.576
that we had set in motion,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.096
a source of inspiration

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.496
so that she in this case
could do her work really well.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.896
40,000 kids a year
are affected by these libraries.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.376
They've been happening
for more than 10 years now,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.936
so those librarians have kind of turned on
a generation of children to books
