00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.576
I like that, right?
Now, what does OWL stand for?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.496
Well, it could be One World Library,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.136
or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.656
Or it could be -- and I figure librarians
could figure out other things it could be

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.136
because they know about words.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.376
So other things, right?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.856
And then look at this.
It's like the eye of the owl.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.576
This is irresistible in my opinion.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.056
But there's even another idea.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.296
Option number three.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.936
Option number three
was based actually on language.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.256
It's the idea that "read"
is the past tense of "read,"

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.136
and they're both spelled the same way.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.096
So why don't we call
this place The Red Zone?
