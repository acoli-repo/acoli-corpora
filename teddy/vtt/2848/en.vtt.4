00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.936
Then they called me up and they said,
"Could you make a little contribution?"

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.976
I said, "Sure, what do you want me to do?"

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.856
And they said, "Well, we want you
to be the graphic designer

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.336
in charge of the whole thing."

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.936
And so I thought, I know what that means.
That means I get to design a logo.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.976
I know how to design that. I design logos.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.656
That's what people come to me for.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.776
So OK, let's design a logo for this thing.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.056
Easy to do, actually,
compared with architecture

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.336
and being a librarian.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.096
Just do a logo, make a contribution,
and then you're out,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.056
and you feel really good about yourself.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.856
And I'm a great guy and I like to feel
good about myself when I do these favors.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.456
So I thought, let's overdeliver.
