I say there's just one question
and the question should be,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.136
"How can I thank you, Mike?"

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.776
But in this case,
the question was more like,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.216
"Um, are you kidding?"

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.936
Because, they said,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.336
the premise of all this work

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.496
was that kids were bored
with old libraries, musty old libraries.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.736
They were tired of them.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.096
And instead, they said, these kids
have never really seen a library.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.936
The school libraries in these schools

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.376
are really so dilapidated,
if they're there at all,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.336
that they haven't bored anyone.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.336
They haven't even been there
to bore anyone at all.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.776
So the idea was, just forget
about giving it a new name.
