because you could type it any font,
you could write it by hand,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.176
and when they started
sending emails around,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.776
they just would use Shift and 1,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.376
they'd get their own logo
just right out of the thing.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.136
And I thought, well, that's fine.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.936
Feel free to use that logo.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.856
And then I embarked
on the real rollout of this thing --

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.816
working with every one of the architects

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.840
to put this logo on the front door
of their own library. Right?

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.736
So here's the big rollout.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.016
Basically I'd work
with different architects.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.256
First Robin Hood was my client.
Now these architects were my client.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.519
I'd say, "Here's your logo.
Put it on the door."

00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:01.496
"Here's your logo. Put it on both doors."
