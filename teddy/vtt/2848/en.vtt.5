00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.456
So I thought, let's overdeliver.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.416
I'm going to give you three logos,
all based on this one idea.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.776
So you have three options,
pick any of the three.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.096
They're all great, I said.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.336
So the basic idea was
these would be new school libraries

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.896
for New York schools,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.776
and so the idea is that it's a new thing,
a new idea that needs a new name.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.816
What I wanted to do was dispel the idea
that these were musty old libraries,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.456
the kind of places
that everyone is bored with,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.456
you know, not your grandparents' library.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.936
Don't worry about that at all.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.976
This is going to this new, exciting thing,
