00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.416
So I loved going to these things.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.416
I would stand there dressed like this,
obviously not belonging,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.107
and someone would say,
"What are you doing here, mister?"

00:09:37.131 --> 00:09:40.296
And I'd say, "Well, I'm part of the team
that designed this place."

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.225
And they'd said, "You do these shelves?"

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:44.656
And I said, "No."
"You took the pictures up above."

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.896
"No."

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.136
"Well, what did you do?"

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.616
"You know when you came in?
The sign over the door?"

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.056
"The sign that says library?"

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.096
(Laughter)

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.336
"Yeah, I did that!"

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.480
And then they'd sort of go,
"OK. Nice work if you can get it."

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.296
So it was so satisfying
going to these little openings
