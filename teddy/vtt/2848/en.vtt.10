00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.776
So the idea was, just forget
about giving it a new name.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.856
Just call it, one last try, a library.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.096
Right? OK.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.976
So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.216
Exclamation point?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.216
Then -- this is because I'm clever --

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.776
move that into the "i,"

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.056
make it red,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.256
and there you have it,
the Library Initiative.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.816
So I thought, mission accomplished,
there's your logo.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.896
So what's interesting about this logo,
an unintended consequence,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.056
was that it turned out that
they didn't really even need my design

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.056
because you could type it any font,
you could write it by hand,
