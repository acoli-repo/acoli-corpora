So why don't we call
this place The Red Zone?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.549
I'll meet you at the Red Zone.

00:04:02.573 --> 00:04:05.133
Are you Red? Get Red.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.096
I'm well Red.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.336
(Laughter)

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.696
I really loved this idea,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.056
and I somehow was not focused on the idea

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.976
that librarians as a class are sort of
interested in spelling and I don't know.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.935
(Laughter)

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.456
But sometimes cleverness
is more important than spelling,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.896
and I thought this would be
one of those instances.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.936
So usually when I make these presentations

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.736
I say there's just one question
and the question should be,
