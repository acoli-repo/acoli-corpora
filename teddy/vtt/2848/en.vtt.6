00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.976
This is going to this new, exciting thing,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.256
not a boring library.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.936
So option number one:

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.976
so instead of thinking of it as a library,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.176
think of it as a place where it is like:
do talk, do make loud noises.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.216
Right? So no shushing,
it's like a shush-free zone.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.416
We're going to call it the Reading Room.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.816
That was option number one.
OK, option number two.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.256
Option number two was, wait for it,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.536
OWL.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.896
I'll meet you at OWL.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.216
I'm getting my book from the OWL.
Meet you after school down at OWL.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.576
I like that, right?
Now, what does OWL stand for?
