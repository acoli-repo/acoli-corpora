00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.536
And they would go and install these.
It just was the greatest thing.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.856
But the greatest thing, actually, was --

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.096
Every once in a while,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.336
I'd get, like, an invitation in the mail
made of construction paper,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.656
and it would say, "You are invited
to the opening of our new library."

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.056
So you'd go to the library,
say, you'd go to PS10,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.296
and you'd go inside.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.096
There'd be balloons,
there'd be a student ambassador,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.256
there'd be speeches that were read,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.176
poetry that was written
specifically for the opening,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.136
dignitaries would present people
with certificates,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.776
and the whole thing
was just a delirious, fun party.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.416
So I loved going to these things.
