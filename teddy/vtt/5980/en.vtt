Let's get this out of the way.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.350
I'm here because I wrote
a book about civility,

00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:14.718
and because that book came out

00:00:14.742 --> 00:00:18.711
right around the 2016
American presidential election,

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:24.387
I started getting lots of invitations
to come and talk about civility

00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:28.356
and why we need more of it
in American politics.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.658
So great.
