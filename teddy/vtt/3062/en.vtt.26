"Please don't tell anyone."

00:13:02.738 --> 00:13:04.954
So I decided to tell everyone --

00:13:04.978 --> 00:13:06.209
(Laughter)

00:13:06.233 --> 00:13:07.731
right here on this stage,

00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:11.211
not because I'm untrustworthy,

00:13:11.867 --> 00:13:15.109
but because the fact
that we have so much in common

00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:18.619
feels especially important for us
all to hear, especially now,

00:13:18.643 --> 00:13:20.690
when so many of the world's problems

00:13:20.714 --> 00:13:24.701
seem to be because we keep focusing
on the things that make us different,

00:13:24.725 --> 00:13:26.608
not on what binds us together.

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:32.141
And look -- I am the first to admit
that I am not a statistician,
