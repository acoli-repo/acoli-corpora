00:12:02.602 --> 00:12:04.161
So by and large,

00:12:04.185 --> 00:12:06.573
all of these friends and strangers,

00:12:06.597 --> 00:12:09.951
regardless of their background,
race or religion,

00:12:10.762 --> 00:12:12.426
all asked for the same things,

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.212
and they were the same things
that I really wanted,

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:18.038
the simplified version
of the basic human needs

00:12:18.062 --> 00:12:22.683
identified by social scientists
like Abraham Maslow and Manfred Max-Neef.

00:12:23.668 --> 00:12:26.786
No one asked for answers
to the big existential questions

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.215
or for proof of God or the meaning of life
like I had set out to find.
