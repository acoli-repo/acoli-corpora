00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:01.698
The second commonality
was just as curious,

00:10:02.612 --> 00:10:03.998
but far more humbling.

00:10:05.784 --> 00:10:07.145
Virtually everyone --

00:10:07.925 --> 00:10:09.230
the stranger on the subway,

00:10:09.827 --> 00:10:11.135
the guy at the coffee shop,

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.853
the lawyer down the hall,

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.482
the Jew, the atheist,
the Muslim, the devout Catholic --

00:10:16.873 --> 00:10:20.085
all asked for essentially
the same three things.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.687
OK, there were a couple of outliers,
and yes, a few people asked for cash.

00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:29.093
But when I eliminated what were
ultimately a handful of anomalies,

00:10:29.527 --> 00:10:31.841
the similarities were staggering.
