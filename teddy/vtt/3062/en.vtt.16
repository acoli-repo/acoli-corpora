In the weeks leading up
to my trip to Brazil,

00:08:01.182 --> 00:08:03.951
I mentioned my upcoming plans
to some friends

00:08:03.975 --> 00:08:05.921
and to a couple of colleagues at Google,

00:08:05.945 --> 00:08:07.616
where I was a lawyer at the time.

00:08:08.028 --> 00:08:10.536
And I might have mentioned it
to a couple more people

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.751
because I'm chatty,

00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:12.983
including my neighbor,

00:08:13.672 --> 00:08:16.768
the guy who works at the local
coffee shop I go to each morning,

00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:18.915
the checkout lady at Whole Foods

00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:21.822
and a stranger who sat
next to me on the subway.

00:08:22.743 --> 00:08:24.959
I told each of them where I was going

00:08:24.983 --> 00:08:26.154
and why,

00:08:26.178 --> 00:08:30.599
and I offered to carry three wishes
of theirs down to Brazil,
