00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.953
We're just not sure who it is.

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.977
(Laughter)

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:35.826
So the first takeaway for me

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.911
when I realized I was a None
and had found that information out

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:41.743
was that I wasn't alone.

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.179
I was finally part of a group in America

00:03:44.203 --> 00:03:45.681
that had a lot of members,

00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:47.340
which felt really reassuring.

00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:50.422
But then the second,
not-so-reassuring takeaway

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:52.677
was that, oh, man, there are a lot of us.

00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:53.923
That can't be good,

00:03:53.947 --> 00:03:57.800
because if a lot of highly spiritual
people are currently godless,

00:03:57.824 --> 00:04:01.559
maybe finding God is not going to be
as easy as I had originally hoped.
