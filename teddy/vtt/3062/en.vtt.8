maybe finding God is not going to be
as easy as I had originally hoped.

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:04.907
So that is when I decided
that on my spiritual journey,

00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.005
I was going to avoid the obvious places

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:09.525
and skip the big-box religions altogether

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.207
and instead venture out
into the spiritual fringe

00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:14.540
of mediums

00:04:14.564 --> 00:04:15.746
and faith healers

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:17.543
and godmen.

00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:20.374
But remember, I'm a non-absolutist,

00:04:20.398 --> 00:04:24.317
which means I was pretty inclined
to keep a fairly open mind,

00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:26.429
which turned out to be a good thing,

00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:30.167
because I went to a witch's potluck dinner
