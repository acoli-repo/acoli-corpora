00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:31.441
So, I was raised in America
by Indian parents -- culturally Hindu,

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:35.807
but practicing a strict and relatively
unknown religion outside of India

00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:36.987
called Jainism.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.559
To give you an idea
of just how minority that makes me:

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:45.508
people from India represent
roughly one percent of the US population;

00:00:45.973 --> 00:00:48.159
Hindus, about 0.7 percent;

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:54.965
Jains, at most .00046 percent.

00:00:55.557 --> 00:00:57.122
To put that in context:

00:00:57.513 --> 00:01:00.692
