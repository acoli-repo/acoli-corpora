00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.628
who oddly included both
my deceased mother-in-law

00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:03.828
and the deceased manager
of the hip-hop group The Roots.

00:05:03.852 --> 00:05:04.935
(Laughter)

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:07.702
Yeah, my mother-in-law told me
she was really happy

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:09.732

00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:10.907
Duh! But --

00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:12.870

00:05:14.076 --> 00:05:16.165

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.505
said that maybe I should cut back
on all the pasta I was eating.

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.137
I think we can all agree

00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:24.199
that it was lucky for my husband
that it wasn't his dead mother

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:25.706
who suggested I lay off carbs.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.824
(Laughter)

00:05:26.848 --> 00:05:30.727
I also joined a laughing yoga group
out of South Africa;
