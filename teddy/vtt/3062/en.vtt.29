WEBVTT

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:31.824
or which religion, if any, we call home.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.904
I then also note

00:14:34.928 --> 00:14:38.295
that apparently some of us
want these things so badly

00:14:38.821 --> 00:14:40.598
that we would email a None,

00:14:41.319 --> 00:14:44.606
a spiritually confused None like me --

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.738
some might say otherwise
confused as well --

00:14:47.742 --> 00:14:52.523
and that we would seek out this stranger
and email her our deepest wishes,

00:14:52.547 --> 00:14:55.892
just in case there is
the remote possibility

00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:59.557
that they might be granted
by someone who is not a god,

00:14:59.581 --> 00:15:01.970
much less our god,
