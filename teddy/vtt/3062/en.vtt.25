00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:38.482
Even when they could have asked
for absolutely anything,

00:12:38.506 --> 00:12:41.541
they all asked for health,
happiness and love.

00:12:43.418 --> 00:12:46.166
So now those emails had
a third commonality as well.

00:12:47.444 --> 00:12:50.572
Each of them ended in the exact same way.

00:12:51.597 --> 00:12:55.363
Instead of thanking me for carting
their wishes all the way to Brazil,

00:12:56.427 --> 00:12:57.642
everyone said,

00:12:59.285 --> 00:13:00.757
"Please don't tell anyone."
