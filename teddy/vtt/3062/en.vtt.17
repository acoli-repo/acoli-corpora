00:08:26.178 --> 00:08:30.599
and I offered to carry three wishes
of theirs down to Brazil,

00:08:30.623 --> 00:08:33.392
explaining that anyone going
to see John of God

00:08:33.416 --> 00:08:35.226
could act as a proxy for others

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.422
and save them the trip.

00:08:37.795 --> 00:08:40.930
And to my surprise, my in-box overflowed.

00:08:41.906 --> 00:08:43.807
Friends told friends who told friends,

00:08:43.831 --> 00:08:46.067
and those friends
apparently told more friends,

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:48.501
other strangers
and the guys at their coffee shops,

00:08:48.525 --> 00:08:50.929
until it seemed that days
before I left for Brazil

00:08:50.953 --> 00:08:53.888
that there was no one who did not
have my email address.

00:08:54.765 --> 00:08:59.115
And at the time, all I could conclude
was that I had offered too much

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:00.296
to too many.
