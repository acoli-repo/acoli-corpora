00:10:58.536 --> 00:11:01.858
but more often than not, they just
asked for good health in general.

00:11:03.222 --> 00:11:04.498
When it came to happiness,

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:07.207
they each phrased it slightly differently,

00:11:08.052 --> 00:11:12.648
but they all asked for the same
specific subtype of happiness, too --

00:11:14.282 --> 00:11:16.363
the kind of happiness that sinks in

00:11:16.832 --> 00:11:18.775
and sets down roots in your soul;

00:11:20.521 --> 00:11:22.857
the kind of happiness
that could sustain us,

00:11:23.922 --> 00:11:26.848
even if we were to lose
absolutely everything else.

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:29.739
And for love,
