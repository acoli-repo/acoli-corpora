00:02:59.081 --> 00:03:00.263
there are a lot of us,

00:03:00.287 --> 00:03:01.773
and we skew young.

00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:09.286
In 2014, there were over 56 million
religiously unaffiliated Nones

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.487
in the United States.

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:15.165
And Nones account
for over one-third of adults

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.951
between the ages of 18 to 33.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.442
But the most interesting thing
to me about Nones

00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:23.768
is that we're often spiritual.

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:28.012
In fact, 68 percent of us believe,
with some degree of certainty,

00:03:28.036 --> 00:03:29.416
that there is a God.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.953
We're just not sure who it is.
