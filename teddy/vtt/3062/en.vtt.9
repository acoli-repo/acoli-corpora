at the LGBT Center in New York City,

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:34.839
where I befriended two witches;

00:04:35.814 --> 00:04:39.555

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:40.959
with a shaman in Peru;

00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:44.593
got a hug from a saint
in the convention center --

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:45.962

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.997
on the beaches of Mexico;

00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.246
worked with a tequila-drinking medium
to convene with the dead,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.628
who oddly included both
my deceased mother-in-law
