00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:32.141
And look -- I am the first to admit
that I am not a statistician,

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.710
and that the data I presented to you
that I just accumulated in my in-box

00:13:36.734 --> 00:13:41.835
is more anecdotal than scientific,
more qualitative than quantitative.

00:13:42.394 --> 00:13:45.616
It is, as anyone who works
with data would tell you,

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.464
hardly a statistically significant
or demographically balanced sample.

00:13:49.488 --> 00:13:53.549
But nonetheless, I find myself
thinking about those emails

00:13:53.573 --> 00:13:57.125
every time I reflect back
on the bias and prejudice

00:13:57.149 --> 00:13:58.666
that I've faced in my life,

00:13:59.131 --> 00:14:02.025
or when there's another hate crime
or a senseless tragedy
