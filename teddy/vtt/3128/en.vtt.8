00:03:57.164 --> 00:04:00.863
And the lock, which encodes
and decodes the document.

00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:03.506
We call this an encryption algorithm.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.498
Using the key, it encodes
the text in the documents

00:04:08.522 --> 00:04:09.918
to random numbers.

00:04:09.942 --> 00:04:12.704
A good algorithm will encode in such a way

00:04:12.728 --> 00:04:16.461
that without the key
it's very difficult to unscramble.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.522
What makes encryption so important

00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:23.282
is that if someone were to capture
the briefcase and cut it open

00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:26.568
without the encryption key
and the encryption algorithm,

00:04:26.592 --> 00:04:29.108
they wouldn't be able
to read the documents.

00:04:29.132 --> 00:04:33.282
They would look like nothing more
than a bunch of random numbers.
