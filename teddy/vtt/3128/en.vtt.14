00:06:58.784 --> 00:07:00.336
The less random the numbers are,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.704
or in scientific terms,
the less entropy they contain,

00:07:03.728 --> 00:07:05.795
the easier they are to predict.

00:07:06.917 --> 00:07:10.839
Recently, several casinos
have been victims of a creative attack.

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:15.212
The output of slot machines
was recorded over a period of time

00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:16.593
and then analyzed.

00:07:16.982 --> 00:07:18.950
This allowed the cyber criminals

00:07:18.974 --> 00:07:22.641
to reverse engineer
the pseudo-random number generator

00:07:22.665 --> 00:07:24.664
behind the spinning wheels.

00:07:24.688 --> 00:07:29.995
And allowed them, with high accuracy,
to predict the spins of the wheels,
