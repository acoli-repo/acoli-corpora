00:04:29.132 --> 00:04:33.282
They would look like nothing more
than a bunch of random numbers.

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:39.424
Most security systems rely
on a secure method for key exchange

00:04:39.448 --> 00:04:43.915
to communicate the encryption key
to the right place.

00:04:44.862 --> 00:04:47.838
However, rapid increases
in computational power

00:04:47.862 --> 00:04:52.227
are putting at risk a number
of the key exchange methods we have today.

00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:57.236
Consider one of the very
widely used systems today -- RSA.

00:04:57.855 --> 00:05:01.156
When it was invented, in 1977,
