00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:32.204
you've just sent
an encoded message to James Bond.

00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:33.283
(Laughter)

00:03:33.966 --> 00:03:38.456
A fun example, but it does illustrate
three things important for encryption.

00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:41.617
The code -- we call this
an encryption key.

00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:43.743
You can think of it as a password.

00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:48.942
The call to James to give him
the code for the combination lock.

00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:50.997
We call this key exchange.

00:03:51.442 --> 00:03:52.935
This is how you ensure

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.728
you get the encryption key
securely to the right place.

00:03:57.164 --> 00:04:00.863
And the lock, which encodes
and decodes the document.
