00:07:58.053 --> 00:08:01.204
But the quantum world is truly random.

00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:06.537
So it makes sense to take advantage
of this intrinsic randomness.

00:08:08.165 --> 00:08:10.077
Devices that can measure quantum effects

00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:14.031
can produce an endless stream
of random numbers at high speed.

00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:17.421
Foiling all those
would-be casino criminals.

00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:22.062
A select group of universities
and companies around the world

00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:25.508
are focused on building
true random number generators.

00:08:25.895 --> 00:08:29.553
At my company, our quantum
random number generator

00:08:29.577 --> 00:08:33.364
started life on a two meter
by one meter optic table.
