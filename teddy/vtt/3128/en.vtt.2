00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:03.334
and the theft of emails from the US
Democratic National Committee.

00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:09.094
The cyber threat is now affecting
our democratic processes.

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:11.645
And it's likely to get worse.

00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:15.879
As computer technology
is becoming more powerful,

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:20.061
the systems we use to protect our data
are becoming more vulnerable.

00:01:21.093 --> 00:01:24.641
Adding to the concern
is a new type of computing technology,

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:26.656
called quantum computing,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.633
which leverages microscopic
properties of nature

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:33.566
to deliver unimaginable increases
in computational power.
