00:09:55.974 --> 00:10:00.132
Except this time, instead of a call
to give James the code,

00:10:00.156 --> 00:10:04.204
we're going to use quantum effects
on a laser to carry the code

00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:08.137
and send it over standard
optic fiber to James.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:13.123
We assume that Dr. No
is trying to hack the exchange.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:19.773
Luckily, Dr. No's attempt to intercept
the quantum keys while in transit

00:10:19.797 --> 00:10:23.463
will leave fingerprints
that James and you can detect.

00:10:24.043 --> 00:10:27.511
This allows those intercepted keys
to be discarded.

00:10:28.026 --> 00:10:29.783
The keys which are then retained

00:10:29.807 --> 00:10:33.152
can be used to provide
very strong data protection.
