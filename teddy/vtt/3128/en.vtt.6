00:02:56.122 --> 00:03:01.297
Because the documents are top secret,
we're going to use an advanced briefcase.

00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:03.385
It has a special combination lock

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.974
which, when closed,

00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:08.410
converts all the text
in the documents to random numbers.

00:03:08.434 --> 00:03:12.150
So you put your documents inside,
close the lock --

00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:15.656
at which point in time the documents
get converted to random numbers --

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.080
and you send the briefcase to James.

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:21.966
While it's on its way,
you call him to give him the code.

00:03:22.387 --> 00:03:25.323
When he gets the briefcase,
he enters the code,

00:03:25.347 --> 00:03:28.331
the documents get unscrambled, and voilà,

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:32.204
you've just sent
an encoded message to James Bond.
