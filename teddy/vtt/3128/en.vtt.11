00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:34.862
As you can see, code makers and breakers
are engaged in an ongoing battle

00:05:34.886 --> 00:05:36.680
to outwit each other.

00:05:38.553 --> 00:05:42.649
And when quantum computers arrive
in the next 10 to 15 years,

00:05:42.673 --> 00:05:46.859
they will even more rapidly
crack the complex mathematics

00:05:46.883 --> 00:05:50.573
that underlies many
of our encryption systems today.

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:56.442
Indeed, the quantum computer is likely
to turn our present security castle

00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:59.053
into a mere house of cards.
