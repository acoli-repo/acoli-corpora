00:06:00.815 --> 00:06:04.315
We have to find a way
to defend our castle.

00:06:05.474 --> 00:06:08.077
There's been a growing
body of research in recent years

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:11.322
looking at using quantum effects
to make encryption stronger.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.027
And there have been
some exciting breakthroughs.

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:18.403
Remember those three things
important for encryption --

00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:23.320
high-quality keys, secure key exchange
and a strong algorithm?

00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:26.498
Well, advances in science and engineering

00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:29.759
are putting two of those
three elements at risk.
