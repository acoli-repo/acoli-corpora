When it was invented, in 1977,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.680
it was estimated that it would take
40 quadrillion years

00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:09.240
to break a 426-bit RSA key.

00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:14.339
In 1994, just 17 years later,

00:05:14.363 --> 00:05:15.894
the code was broken.

00:05:17.355 --> 00:05:19.926
As computers have become
more and more powerful,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.617
we've had to use larger and larger codes.

00:05:23.117 --> 00:05:29.115
Today we routinely use 2048 or 4096 bits.

00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:34.862
As you can see, code makers and breakers
are engaged in an ongoing battle
