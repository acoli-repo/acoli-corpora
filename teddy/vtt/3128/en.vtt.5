Today, a select groups of companies
and labs around the world, including mine,

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:35.890
are maturing this technology
for practical applications.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.411
That's right.

00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:40.902
We are now preparing
to fight quantum with quantum.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.600
So how does this all work?

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:47.235
Well, first, let's take a quick tour
of the world of encryption.

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.306
For that, you'll need a briefcase,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.321
some important documents that you want
to send your friend, James Bond,

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:55.412
and a lock to keep it all safe.

00:02:56.122 --> 00:03:01.297
Because the documents are top secret,
we're going to use an advanced briefcase.
