Recently, we've seen the effects
of cyber attacks on the business world.

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:10.656
Data breaches at companies like JP Morgan,
Yahoo, Home Depot and Target

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.371
have caused losses of hundreds of millions

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:16.242
and in some cases, billions of dollars.

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:20.493
It wouldn't take many large attacks
to ravage the world economy.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:24.379
And the public sector
has not been immune, either.

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:28.474
In 2012 to 2014,

00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:32.777
there was a significant data breach
at the US Office of Personnel Management.
