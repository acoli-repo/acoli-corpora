00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:33.566
to deliver unimaginable increases
in computational power.

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.482
It's so powerful that it will crack
many of the encryption systems

00:01:38.506 --> 00:01:39.706
that we use today.

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.855
So is the situation hopeless?

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:46.085
Should we start packing
our digital survival gear

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.109
and prepare for an upcoming
data apocalypse?

00:01:50.283 --> 00:01:51.941
I would say, not yet.

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:54.411
Quantum computing is still in the labs,

00:01:54.435 --> 00:01:57.925
and it will take a few years
until it's put to practical applications.

00:01:58.347 --> 00:01:59.553
More important,

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:03.063
there have been major breakthroughs
in the field of encryption.
