The quantum solution to this problem

00:09:31.818 --> 00:09:35.518
is called quantum key distribution or QKD,

00:09:35.893 --> 00:09:40.228
which leverages a fundamental,
counterintuitive characteristic

00:09:40.252 --> 00:09:41.652
of quantum mechanics.

00:09:42.077 --> 00:09:46.984
The very act of looking
at a quantum particle changes it.

00:09:48.173 --> 00:09:50.492
Let me give you an example
of how this works.

00:09:50.927 --> 00:09:55.634
Consider again exchanging the code
for the lock with James Bond.

00:09:55.974 --> 00:10:00.132
Except this time, instead of a call
to give James the code,
