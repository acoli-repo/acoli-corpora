00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:33.486
enabling them to make big financial gains.

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:38.280
Similar risks apply to encryption keys.

00:07:38.815 --> 00:07:43.975
So having a true random number generator
is essential for secure encryption.

00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:51.069
For years, researchers have been looking
at building true random number generators.

00:07:51.093 --> 00:07:54.466
But most designs to date
are either not random enough,

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.223
fast enough or aren't easily repeatable.

00:07:58.053 --> 00:08:01.204
But the quantum world is truly random.
