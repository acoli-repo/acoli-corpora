00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:03.063
there have been major breakthroughs
in the field of encryption.

00:02:03.497 --> 00:02:06.498
For me, this is
a particularly exciting time

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:09.189
in the history of secure communications.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.188
About 15 years ago,

00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:13.538
when I learned of our new-found ability

00:02:13.562 --> 00:02:17.347
to create quantum effects
that don't exist in nature,

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.790
I was excited.

00:02:18.814 --> 00:02:22.101
The idea of applying
the fundamental laws of physics

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:23.856
to make encryption stronger

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.307
really intrigued me.

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.260
Today, a select groups of companies
and labs around the world, including mine,
