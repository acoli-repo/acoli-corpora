First of all, those keys.

00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:37.236
Random numbers are the foundational
building blocks of encryption keys.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.839
But today, they're not truly random.

00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:43.379
Currently, we construct encryption keys

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:47.212
from sequences of random numbers
generated from software,

00:06:47.236 --> 00:06:49.799
so-called pseudo-random numbers.

00:06:50.712 --> 00:06:54.029
Numbers generated by a program
or a mathematical recipe

00:06:54.053 --> 00:06:57.814
will have some, perhaps subtle,
pattern to them.

00:06:58.784 --> 00:07:00.336
The less random the numbers are,
