00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Actually, I think it'll eventually

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
be seen as probably the single biggest idea

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that's emerged in the past century.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's the idea of computation.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, of course, that idea has brought us

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
all of the computer technology we have today and so on.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But there's actually a lot more to computation than that.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's really a very deep, very powerful, very fundamental idea,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
whose effects we've only just begun to see.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, I myself have spent the past 30 years of my life

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
working on three large projects
