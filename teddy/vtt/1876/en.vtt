00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.499
I'm a bug lover, myself --

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:04.276
not from childhood, by the way,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.870
but rather late.

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:08.276
When I bachelored,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.993
majoring in zoology
at Tel Aviv University,

00:00:11.017 --> 00:00:13.154
I kind of fell in love with bugs.

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:14.916
And then, within zoology,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.080
I took the course
or the discipline of entomology,

00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:20.355
the science of insects.

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:23.942
And then I thought to myself,
how can I be practical

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.942
or help in the science of entomology?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.533
And then I moved to the world
of plant protection --
