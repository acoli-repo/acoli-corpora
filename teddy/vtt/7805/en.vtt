When I was six,

00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:06.502
my father told me that I was made
out of tiny cells filled with chromosomes

00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:08.171
that would control my fate.

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:09.922
I thought, "That's amazing.

00:00:09.964 --> 00:00:13.676
There are so many mysterious things
in there, and I want to know more.”

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:17.930
I read about Galileo and Darwin,
and I became a scientist.

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:20.224
At that time, hardly anything was known.

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:25.063
We did not yet know that the chemical
elements came from exploded stars,

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:28.983
that everything you see around you
was recycled from inside of stars.

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:31.986
So we did not know we are recycled stars.
