00:11:29.794 --> 00:11:31.207
How do drugs work?

00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:34.067
This will create and has created
a new ecosystem

00:11:34.091 --> 00:11:37.358
for understanding how drugs work
and to optimize their use.

00:11:38.303 --> 00:11:40.962
Nick went on; he's a professor
at Columbia now.

00:11:40.986 --> 00:11:45.058
He did this in his PhD
for hundreds of pairs of drugs.

00:11:45.082 --> 00:11:47.599
He found several
very important interactions,

00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:48.837
and so we replicated this

00:11:48.861 --> 00:11:51.435
and we showed that this
is a way that really works

00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:53.798
for finding drug-drug interactions.

00:11:54.282 --> 00:11:56.016
However, there's a couple of things.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.086
We don't just use pairs
of drugs at a time.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.579
As I said before, there are patients
on three, five, seven, nine drugs.
