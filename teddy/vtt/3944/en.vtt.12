00:05:57.796 --> 00:06:00.121
you walk around normally,
if you're not diabetic,

00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:01.504
with a glucose of around 90.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.604
And if it gets up to 120, 125,

00:06:03.628 --> 00:06:07.078
your doctor begins to think
about a potential diagnosis of diabetes.

00:06:07.102 --> 00:06:10.093
So a 20 bump -- pretty significant.

00:06:10.601 --> 00:06:12.505
I said, "Nick, this is very cool.

00:06:13.616 --> 00:06:15.669
But, I'm sorry, we still
don't have a paper,

00:06:15.693 --> 00:06:18.272
because this is 10 patients
and -- give me a break --

00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:19.541
it's not enough patients."

00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:20.871
So we said, what can we do?

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:23.871
And we said, let's call our friends
at Harvard and Vanderbilt,

00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:26.482
who also -- Harvard in Boston,
Vanderbilt in Nashville,

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:29.327
who also have electronic
medical records similar to ours.

00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:31.371
Let's see if they can find
similar patients
