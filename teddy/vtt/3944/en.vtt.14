00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:01.127
More interestingly,
we had left out diabetics,

00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:03.468
because diabetics already
have messed up glucose.

00:07:03.492 --> 00:07:05.730
When we looked
at the glucose of diabetics,

00:07:05.754 --> 00:07:09.189
it was going up 60 milligrams
per deciliter, not just 20.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.212
This was a big deal, and we said,
"We've got to publish this."

00:07:13.236 --> 00:07:14.415
We submitted the paper.

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:16.550
It was all data evidence,

00:07:16.574 --> 00:07:19.057
data from the FDA, data from Stanford,

00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:21.027
data from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard.

00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:23.447
We had not done a single real experiment.

00:07:24.495 --> 00:07:25.791
But we were nervous.

00:07:26.201 --> 00:07:29.931
So Nick, while the paper
was in review, went to the lab.

00:07:29.955 --> 00:07:32.417
We found somebody
who knew about lab stuff.
