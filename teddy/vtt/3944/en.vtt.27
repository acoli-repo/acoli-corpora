00:13:29.124 --> 00:13:30.275
perhaps not together,

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:32.639
make different choices
when you're prescribing.

00:13:32.663 --> 00:13:34.509
But there was another possibility.

00:13:34.533 --> 00:13:36.877
We could have found
two drugs or three drugs

00:13:36.901 --> 00:13:39.162
that were interacting in a beneficial way.

00:13:39.616 --> 00:13:42.328
We could have found new effects of drugs

00:13:42.352 --> 00:13:44.512
that neither of them has alone,

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:47.029
but together, instead
of causing a side effect,

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:49.478
they could be a new and novel treatment

00:13:49.502 --> 00:13:51.384
for diseases that don't have treatments

00:13:51.408 --> 00:13:53.415
or where the treatments are not effective.

00:13:53.439 --> 00:13:55.834
If we think about drug treatment today,

00:13:55.858 --> 00:13:57.610
all the major breakthroughs --

00:13:57.634 --> 00:14:01.931
for HIV, for tuberculosis,
for depression, for diabetes --
