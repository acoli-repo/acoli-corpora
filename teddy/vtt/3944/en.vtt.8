00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:04.421
and I looked for signals similar,
glucose-changing signals,

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:06.069
for people taking two drugs,

00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:11.662
where each drug alone
did not change glucose,

00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:14.146
but together I saw a strong signal."

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.319
And I said, "Oh! You're clever.
Good idea. Show me the list."

00:04:17.343 --> 00:04:19.597
And there's a bunch of drugs,
not very exciting.

00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:23.553
But what caught my eye
was, on the list there were two drugs:

00:04:23.577 --> 00:04:26.970
paroxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant;

00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:31.326
and pravastatin, or Pravachol,
a cholesterol medication.
