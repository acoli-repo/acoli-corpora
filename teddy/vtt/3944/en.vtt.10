00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:00.547
with the machine learning,

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:04.435
but it's not really standard-of-proof
evidence that we have."

00:05:05.618 --> 00:05:07.207
So we have to do something else.

00:05:07.231 --> 00:05:10.107
Let's go into the Stanford
electronic medical record.

00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:12.195
We have a copy of it
that's OK for research,

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.265
we removed identifying information.

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:17.084
And I said, "Let's see if people
on these two drugs

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.877
have problems with their glucose."

00:05:19.242 --> 00:05:21.449
Now there are thousands
and thousands of people

00:05:21.473 --> 00:05:24.932
in the Stanford medical records
that take paroxetine and pravastatin.

00:05:24.956 --> 00:05:26.755
But we needed special patients.

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.376
We needed patients who were on one of them
and had a glucose measurement,
