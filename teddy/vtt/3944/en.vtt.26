00:12:59.784 --> 00:13:03.190
But we can't have a system
that closes that data off,

00:13:03.214 --> 00:13:05.966
because it is too rich of a source

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.961
of inspiration, innovation and discovery

00:13:09.985 --> 00:13:11.563
for new things in medicine.

00:13:12.494 --> 00:13:14.288
And the final thing I want to say is,

00:13:14.312 --> 00:13:17.669
in this case we found two drugs
and it was a little bit of a sad story.

00:13:17.693 --> 00:13:19.614
The two drugs actually caused problems.

00:13:19.638 --> 00:13:21.113
They increased glucose.

00:13:21.137 --> 00:13:23.583
They could throw somebody into diabetes

00:13:23.607 --> 00:13:25.901
who would otherwise not be in diabetes,

00:13:25.925 --> 00:13:29.100
and so you would want to use
the two drugs very carefully together,

00:13:29.124 --> 00:13:30.275
perhaps not together,
