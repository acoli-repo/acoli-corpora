Ask your favorite person
who has several diagnoses

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:31.981
how many medications they're on.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.110
Why do I care about this problem?

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:35.291
I care about it deeply.

00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:39.619
I'm an informatics and data science guy
and really, in my opinion,

00:01:39.643 --> 00:01:43.388
the only hope -- only hope --
to understand these interactions

00:01:43.412 --> 00:01:46.468
is to leverage lots
of different sources of data

00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:50.048
in order to figure out
when drugs can be used together safely

00:01:50.072 --> 00:01:51.849
and when it's not so safe.

00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:54.666
So let me tell you a data science story.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.844
And it begins with my student Nick.

00:01:56.868 --> 00:01:59.248
Let's call him "Nick,"
because that's his name.

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:00.864
(Laughter)
