00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:31.371
Let's see if they can find
similar patients

00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:34.671
with the one P, the other P,
the glucose measurements

00:06:34.695 --> 00:06:36.295
in that range that we need.

00:06:36.787 --> 00:06:41.742
God bless them, Vanderbilt
in one week found 40 such patients,

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:42.955
same trend.

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:47.424
Harvard found 100 patients, same trend.

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:51.729
So at the end, we had 150 patients
from three diverse medical centers

00:06:51.753 --> 00:06:55.050
that were telling us that patients
getting these two drugs

00:06:55.074 --> 00:06:57.777
were having their glucose bump
somewhat significantly.

00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:01.127
More interestingly,
we had left out diabetics,
