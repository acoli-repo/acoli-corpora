"I've created a classifier that can
look at the side effects of a drug

00:03:03.487 --> 00:03:05.538
based on looking at this database,

00:03:05.562 --> 00:03:09.833
and can tell you whether that drug
is likely to change glucose or not."

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.873
He did it. It was very simple, in a way.

00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:14.532
He took all the drugs
that were known to change glucose

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:16.945
and a bunch of drugs
that don't change glucose,

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.857
and said, "What's the difference
in their side effects?

00:03:19.881 --> 00:03:24.733
Differences in fatigue? In appetite?
In urination habits?"

00:03:24.757 --> 00:03:27.717
All those things conspired
to give him a really good predictor.

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:30.289
He said, "Russ, I can predict
with 93 percent accuracy
