Well, wait a minute.

00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:08.105
How much have we studied

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.930
Well, it's very hard to do that.

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:13.084
In fact, it's not traditionally done.

00:01:13.108 --> 00:01:18.626

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:25.225
between two medications?

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:27.279
Three? Five? Seven?

00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:30.123
