As I said before, there are patients
on three, five, seven, nine drugs.

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:07.623
Have they been studied with respect
to their nine-way interaction?

00:12:07.647 --> 00:12:11.855
Yes, we can do pair-wise,
A and B, A and C, A and D,

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:16.165
but what about A, B, C,
D, E, F, G all together,

00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:17.951
being taken by the same patient,

00:12:17.975 --> 00:12:20.093
perhaps interacting with each other

00:12:20.117 --> 00:12:23.895
in ways that either makes them
more effective or less effective

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:26.251
or causes side effects
that are unexpected?

00:12:26.275 --> 00:12:28.102
We really have no idea.

00:12:28.126 --> 00:12:31.882
It's a blue sky, open field
for us to use data
