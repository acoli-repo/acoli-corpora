00:12:28.126 --> 00:12:31.882
It's a blue sky, open field
for us to use data

00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:34.408
to try to understand
the interaction of drugs.

00:12:34.848 --> 00:12:36.218
Two more lessons:

00:12:36.242 --> 00:12:40.441
I want you to think about the power
that we were able to generate

00:12:40.465 --> 00:12:45.176
with the data from people who had
volunteered their adverse reactions

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.469
through their pharmacists,
through themselves, through their doctors,

00:12:48.493 --> 00:12:52.160
the people who allowed the databases
at Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt,

00:12:52.184 --> 00:12:53.611
to be used for research.

00:12:53.929 --> 00:12:55.374
People are worried about data.

00:12:55.398 --> 00:12:58.585
They're worried about their privacy
and security -- they should be.

00:12:58.609 --> 00:12:59.760
We need secure systems.

00:12:59.784 --> 00:13:03.190
But we can't have a system
that closes that data off,
