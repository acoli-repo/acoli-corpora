You have a little more
of a conversation with your physician

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:36.669
and the physician is a little worried
because you've been blue,

00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:37.986
haven't felt like yourself,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.741
you haven't been able to enjoy things
in life quite as much as you usually do.

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:44.951
Your physician says, "You know,
I think you have some depression.

00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:48.107
I'm going to have to give
you another pill."

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:51.417
So now we're talking
about two medications.

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:54.545
This pill also -- millions
of people have taken it,

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.200
the company did studies,
the FDA looked at it -- all good.

00:00:58.823 --> 00:01:00.880
Think things should go OK.
