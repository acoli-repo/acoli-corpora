He said, "Russ, I can predict
with 93 percent accuracy

00:03:30.313 --> 00:03:31.885
when a drug will change glucose."

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.325
I said, "Nick, that's great."

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.245
He's a young student,
you have to build his confidence.

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.659
"But Nick, there's a problem.

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:41.643
It's that every physician in the world
knows all the drugs that change glucose,

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:43.705
because it's core to our practice.

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.451
So it's great, good job,
but not really that interesting,

00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:49.006
definitely not publishable."

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.044
(Laughter)

00:03:50.068 --> 00:03:52.618
He said, "I know, Russ.
I thought you might say that."

00:03:52.642 --> 00:03:53.794
Nick is smart.

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.023
"I thought you might say that,
so I did one other experiment.

00:03:57.047 --> 00:03:59.975
I looked at people in this database
who were on two drugs,

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:04.421
and I looked for signals similar,
glucose-changing signals,
