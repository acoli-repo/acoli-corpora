00:09:28.647 --> 00:09:31.316
You are at critical juncture
now in the ceiling.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.423
You are exactly at the point
where you and I can go

00:09:34.447 --> 00:09:35.902
no further into the church.

00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:39.282
The gated enclosure keeps us
out of the inner sanctum,

00:09:39.306 --> 00:09:41.819
and we are cast out
much like Adam and Eve.

00:09:41.843 --> 00:09:43.599
The remaining scenes in the ceiling,

00:09:43.623 --> 00:09:46.467
they mirror the crowded chaos
of the world around us.

00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:48.715
You have Noah and his Ark and the flood.

00:09:48.739 --> 00:09:52.329
You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice
and a covenant with God.

00:09:52.353 --> 00:09:53.639
Maybe he's the savior.

00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:57.763
Oh, but no, Noah is the one
who grew grapes, invented wine,

00:09:57.787 --> 00:09:59.945
got drunk and passed out
naked in his barn.
