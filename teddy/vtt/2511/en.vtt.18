00:08:57.329 --> 00:09:02.737
And for me, an American art historian
from the 21st century,

00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:05.613
this was the moment
that the painting spoke to me.

00:09:05.637 --> 00:09:08.985
Because I realized that this
representation of the human drama

00:09:09.009 --> 00:09:11.922
was always about men and women --

00:09:11.946 --> 00:09:15.736
so much so, that the dead center,
the heart of the ceiling,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.174
is the creation of woman, not Adam.

00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:22.122
And the fact is, that when you see them
together in the Garden of Eden,

00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:23.683
they fall together

00:09:23.707 --> 00:09:28.099
and together their proud posture
turns into folded shame.

00:09:28.647 --> 00:09:31.316
You are at critical juncture
now in the ceiling.
