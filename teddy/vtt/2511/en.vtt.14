00:06:57.236 --> 00:07:01.252
And whether in scientific inquiry
or in biblical tradition,

00:07:01.276 --> 00:07:04.596
we think in terms of a primal spark.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.753
Michelangelo gave us an initial energy

00:07:06.777 --> 00:07:09.518
when he gave us the separation
of light and dark,

00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:12.931
a churning figure blurry in the distance,

00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:15.439
compressed into a tight space.

00:07:15.463 --> 00:07:17.792
The next figure looms larger,

00:07:17.816 --> 00:07:21.243
and you see a figure hurtling
from one side to the next.

00:07:21.267 --> 00:07:26.253
He leaves in his wake
the sun, the moon, vegetation.

00:07:26.277 --> 00:07:30.284
Michelangelo didn't focus
on the stuff that was being created,
