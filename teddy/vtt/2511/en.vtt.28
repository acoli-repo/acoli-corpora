complaints about the nudity
spread all over the place,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.016
and soon his masterpiece of human drama
was labeled pornography,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.215
at which point he added
two more portraits,

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:11.723
one of the man who criticized him,
a papal courtier,

00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:15.879
and the other one of himself
as a dried up husk, no athlete,

00:14:15.903 --> 00:14:18.324
in the hands of a long-suffering martyr.

00:14:18.348 --> 00:14:22.016
The year he died he saw
several of these figures covered over,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.659
a triumph for trivial distractions
over his great exhortation to glory.

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.931
And so now we stand

00:14:29.955 --> 00:14:31.685
in the here and now.
