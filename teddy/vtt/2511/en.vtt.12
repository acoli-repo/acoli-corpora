00:05:57.612 --> 00:06:02.600
The encounter between these two giants,
Michelangelo and Julius II,

00:06:02.624 --> 00:06:05.061
that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.

00:06:05.641 --> 00:06:08.428
Michelangelo was so committed
to this project,

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:12.835
that he succeeded in getting the job done
in three and a half years,

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:17.128
using a skeleton crew and spending
most of the time, hours on end,

00:06:17.152 --> 00:06:20.843
reaching up above his head
to paint the stories on the ceiling.

00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:23.474
So let's look at this ceiling

00:06:23.498 --> 00:06:26.329
and see storytelling gone global.

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:30.765
No more familiar artistic references
to the world around you.
