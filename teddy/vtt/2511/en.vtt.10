to reveal the figure within.

00:05:00.777 --> 00:05:02.945
Michelangelo was an essentialist;

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.355
he would tell his story
in massive, dynamic bodies.

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:12.146
This plan was embraced
by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.791
a man who was unafraid
of Michelangelo's brazen genius.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.697
He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,

00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:21.828
and he had been steeped in art
for 30 years and he knew its power.

00:05:21.852 --> 00:05:24.916
And history has handed down the moniker
of the Warrior Pope,

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.730
but this man's legacy to the Vatican --
it wasn't fortresses and artillery,

00:05:28.754 --> 00:05:30.070
it was art.
