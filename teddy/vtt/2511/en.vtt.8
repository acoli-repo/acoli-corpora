00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.863
lured to Rome by the prospect
of a great sculptural project,

00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:03.468
and that project had fallen through.

00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:06.621
And he had been left with a commission
to paint 12 apostles

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:09.566
against a decorative background
in the Sistine Chapel ceiling,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.128
which would look like
every other ceiling in Italy.

00:04:13.615 --> 00:04:15.446
But genius rose to the challenge.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.968
In an age when a man dared
to sail across the Atlantic Ocean,

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:22.520
Michelangelo dared to chart
new artistic waters.

00:04:23.027 --> 00:04:25.263
He, too, would tell a story --

00:04:25.287 --> 00:04:28.819
no Apostles -- but a story
of great beginnings,

00:04:28.843 --> 00:04:30.515
the story of Genesis.
