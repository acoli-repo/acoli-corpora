00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:01.924
Michelangelo gave you a series of figures

00:12:01.948 --> 00:12:05.103
who are wearing these
strikingly beautiful bodies.

00:12:05.127 --> 00:12:07.849
They have no more covers,
no more portraits

00:12:07.873 --> 00:12:09.110
except for a couple.

00:12:09.134 --> 00:12:11.852
It's a composition only out of bodies,

00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:15.262
391, no two alike,

00:12:15.286 --> 00:12:17.740
unique like each and every one of us.

00:12:17.764 --> 00:12:21.506
They start in the lower corner,
breaking away from the ground,

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.252
struggling and trying to rise.

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:26.732
Those who have risen
reach back to help others,

00:12:26.756 --> 00:12:28.593
and in one amazing vignette,

00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:31.709
you have a black man and a white man
pulled up together
