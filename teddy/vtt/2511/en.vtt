00:00:00.782 --> 00:00:02.687
Imagine you're in Rome,

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:05.914
and you've made your way
to the Vatican Museums.

00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:09.544
And you've been shuffling
down long corridors,

00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:14.008
past statues, frescoes,
lots and lots of stuff.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.725
You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:22.125
At last -- a long corridor,
a stair and a door.

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:25.147
You're at the threshold
of the Sistine Chapel.

00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:26.935
So what are you expecting?

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.483
Soaring domes? Choirs of angels?

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:31.665
We don't really have any of that there.
