00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:00.595
a story that encompasses the whole world

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.684
and that came to unfold
in the three stages

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:05.950
of the painting in the Sistine Chapel.

00:01:06.382 --> 00:01:09.743
Now, this building started out
as a space for a small group

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:12.109
of wealthy, educated Christian priests.

00:01:12.528 --> 00:01:15.205
They prayed there.
They elected their pope there.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.381
Five hundred years ago,

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:18.912
it was the ultimate
ecclesiastical man cave.

00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:25.419
So, you may ask, how can it be
that today it attracts and delights

00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:28.109
five million people a year,

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.372
from all different backgrounds?
