00:04:28.843 --> 00:04:30.515
the story of Genesis.

00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:34.018
Not really an easy sell,
stories on a ceiling.

00:04:34.042 --> 00:04:38.850
How would you be able to read
a busy scene from 62 feet below?

00:04:38.874 --> 00:04:41.729
The painting technique that had been
handed on for 200 years

00:04:41.753 --> 00:04:45.067
in Florentine studios was not equipped
for this kind of a narrative.

00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:48.662
But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter,

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:50.970
and so he played to his strengths.

00:04:50.994 --> 00:04:54.476
Instead of being accustomed
to filling space with busyness,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.299
he took a hammer and chisel
and hacked away at a piece of marble

00:04:58.323 --> 00:05:00.753
to reveal the figure within.
