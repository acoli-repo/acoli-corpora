00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:00.838
that come from all over the world.

00:02:01.222 --> 00:02:03.976
This evolution took place in three stages,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.111
each one linked
to a historical circumstance.

00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:09.166
The first one was rather limited in scope.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.723
It reflected the rather
parochial perspective.

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:16.350
The second one took place after
worldviews were dramatically altered

00:02:16.374 --> 00:02:19.065
after Columbus's historical voyage;

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.496
and the third,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.496
when the Age of Discovery
was well under way

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.029
and the Church rose to the challenge

00:02:26.053 --> 00:02:27.456
of going global.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.342
The original decoration of this church
reflected a smaller world.
