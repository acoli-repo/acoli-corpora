00:07:26.277 --> 00:07:30.284
Michelangelo didn't focus
on the stuff that was being created,

00:07:30.308 --> 00:07:32.352
unlike all the other artists.

00:07:32.376 --> 00:07:35.719
He focused on the act of creation.

00:07:35.743 --> 00:07:40.117
And then the movement stops,
like a caesura in poetry

00:07:40.141 --> 00:07:41.393
and the creator hovers.

00:07:41.417 --> 00:07:42.696
So what's he doing?

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.575
Is he creating land? Is he creating sea?

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:50.290
Or is he looking back over his handiwork,
the universe and his treasures,

00:07:50.314 --> 00:07:52.045
just like Michelangelo must have,

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:54.666
looking back over his work in the ceiling

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.484
and proclaiming, "It is good."

00:07:58.388 --> 00:08:00.493
So now the scene is set,
