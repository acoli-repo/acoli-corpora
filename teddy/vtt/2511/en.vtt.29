00:14:29.955 --> 00:14:31.685
in the here and now.

00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:34.029
We are caught in that space

00:14:34.053 --> 00:14:36.318
between beginnings and endings,

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:40.574
in the great, huge totality
of the human experience.

00:14:40.598 --> 00:14:44.569
The Sistine Chapel forces us
to look around as if it were a mirror.

00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:45.890
Who am I in this picture?

00:14:45.914 --> 00:14:47.220
Am I one of the crowd?

00:14:47.244 --> 00:14:48.617
Am I the drunk guy?

00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:50.097
Am I the athlete?

00:14:50.121 --> 00:14:52.381
And as we leave this haven
of uplifting beauty,

00:14:52.405 --> 00:14:56.349
we are inspired to ask ourselves
life's biggest questions:

00:14:56.373 --> 00:15:01.211
Who am I, and what role do I play
in this great theater of life?
