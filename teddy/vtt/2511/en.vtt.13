00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:30.765
No more familiar artistic references
to the world around you.

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.432
There's just space
and structure and energy;

00:06:35.456 --> 00:06:40.053
a monumental painted framework
which opens onto nine panels,

00:06:40.077 --> 00:06:44.010
more driven by sculptural form
than painterly color.

00:06:44.034 --> 00:06:47.811
And we stand in the far end
by the entrance,

00:06:47.835 --> 00:06:51.941
far from the altar and from the gated
enclosure intended for the clergy

00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:57.212
and we peer into the distance,
looking for a beginning.

00:06:57.236 --> 00:07:01.252
And whether in scientific inquiry
or in biblical tradition,
