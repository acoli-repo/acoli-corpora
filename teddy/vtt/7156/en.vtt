00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.496
As a small child, I was lucky
to be at the launch of Apollo 17,

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:06.663
the last manned mission to the Moon,

00:00:06.704 --> 00:00:09.371
and I've remained enamored
with space ever since.

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:11.204
And fortunate as a physician

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:14.038
to have contributed
to NASA life sciences research

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:15.829
and to practice aerospace medicine,

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.746

00:00:18.788 --> 00:00:20.871

00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:23.454

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:26.954
through the lens of seeing our planet
as one without borders.

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:29.204
Now, just as the historic
Apollo moon landings

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:32.079
were transformational
inflection points in history,
