00:00:00.836 --> 00:00:04.436
I used to love waking up
at exactly 7:00am.

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:06.796
When I lived in San Francisco,

00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:08.676
I would wake up right at 7:00am

00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:11.316
and immediately go
to my favorite coffee shop.

00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:15.476
It was my favorite coffee shop,
because it was the best coffee shop.

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.716
I had done the research,
it was five stars, it was great.

00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:20.356
And I would drink my coffee

00:00:20.396 --> 00:00:23.076
and get onto my bicycle
and ride into work.

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:27.316
And I had optimized
my schedule to be perfect.

00:00:27.676 --> 00:00:30.996
I was constantly, like,
shaving off one or two seconds
