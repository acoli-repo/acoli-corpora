00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:02.769
So it's 2006.

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.899
My friend Harold Ford calls me.

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.564
He's running for U.S. Senate in Tennessee,

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:13.151
and he says, "Mellody, I desperately need some national press. Do you have any ideas?"

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:15.130
So I had an idea. I called a friend

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.282
who was in New York

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.671
at one of the most successful
media companies in the world,

00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:21.757
and she said, "Why don't we host

00:00:21.757 --> 00:00:24.003
an editorial board lunch for Harold?

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:25.598
You come with him."

00:00:25.598 --> 00:00:27.343
Harold and I arrive in New York.

00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:29.358
We are in our best suits.

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:31.573
We look like shiny new pennies.
