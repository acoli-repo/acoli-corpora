00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:10.821
Imagine an airplane flying
one millimeter above the ground

00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:14.029
and circling the Earth
once every 25 seconds

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.335
while counting every blade of grass.

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:20.551
Shrink all that down so that it fits
in the palm of your hand,

00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:24.305
and you'd have something equivalent
to a modern hard drive,

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:28.455
an object that can likely hold
more information than your local library.

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:32.906
So how does it store so much information
in such a small space?
