WEBVTT

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and Russia and elsewhere.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
through the Web,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
we can see in real time

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
just some kind of idea of how many viruses,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
how many new examples of malware we find every single day.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Here's the latest virus we've found,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
in a file called Server.exe.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And we found it right over here three seconds ago --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the previous one, six seconds ago.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And if we just scroll around,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
it's just massive.
