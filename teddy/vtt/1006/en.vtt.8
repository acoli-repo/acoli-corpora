00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
let's go with the Centipede virus first.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And you can see at the top of the screen,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
there's a centipede scrolling across your computer

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
when you get infected by this one.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
You know that you're infected

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
because it actually shows up.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
invented in Russia in 1992.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(Siren noise)

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And the last example,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
guess what the Walker virus does?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen
