Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
once you get infected.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So it used to be fairly easy to know

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that you're infected by a virus,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
when the viruses were written by hobbyists

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and teenagers.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Today, they are no longer being written

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
by hobbyists and teenagers.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Today, viruses are a global problem.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
What we have here in the background

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is an example of our systems that we run in our labs,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
where we track virus infections worldwide.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So we can actually see in real time

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan
