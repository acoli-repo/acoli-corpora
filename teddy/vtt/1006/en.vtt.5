Here's a typical street view.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And here's the street or road leading to this building,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And I knocked on the door.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
(Laughter)

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You want to guess who opened the door?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Basit and Amjad; they are still there.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
(Laughter)

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
(Applause)

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So here standing up is Basit.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Sitting down is his brother Amjad.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.
