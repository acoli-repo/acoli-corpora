00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
a U.S. citizen.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
These guys were running an operation called I.M.U.,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They are both right now on the run.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Nobody knows where they are.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
froze a Swiss bank account

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
belonging to Mr. Jain,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So the amount of money online crime generates

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
is significant.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And that means that the online criminals

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
can actually afford to invest into their attacks.
