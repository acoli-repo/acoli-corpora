00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
All right.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That's the boot sector of an infected floppy,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and if we take a closer look inside,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
we'll see that right there,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it says, "Welcome to the dungeon."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And then it continues,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
saying, 1986, Basit and Amjad.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And Basit and Amjad are first names,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Pakistani first names.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
(Laughter)
