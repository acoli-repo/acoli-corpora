00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So what happens when online criminals are caught?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Well in most cases it never gets this far.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
The vast majority of the online crime cases,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And even if we are able to find online criminals,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
quite often there is no outcome.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
or for some reason we can't take them down.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I wish it would be easier;

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
unfortunately it isn't.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But things are also changing

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
at a very rapid pace.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
You've all heard about things like Stuxnet.
