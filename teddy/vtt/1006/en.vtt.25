that's his Mercedes --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
ends in 78RUS.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And if you actually take a look at the scene picture,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
you can see that the plate of the Mercedes

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
is O600KO78RUS.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Now I'm not a lawyer,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
but if I would be,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
this is where I would say, "I rest my case."

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
(Laughter)

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So what happens when online criminals are caught?
