(Laughter)

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I've spent my life

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
defending the Net,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
we are running a risk of losing it all.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
We have to do this globally,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and we have to do it right now.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
What we need

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
is more global, international law enforcement work

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
to find online criminal gangs --

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
these organized gangs

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that are making millions out of their attacks.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
That's much more important
