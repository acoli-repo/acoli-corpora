and do online purchases in any online store.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Because when you do purchases in online stores,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
you will be typing in your name, the delivery address,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
your credit card number and the credit card security codes.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000

you can just go online and buy whatever you want

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
with this information.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And that, obviously, is a problem.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We now have a whole underground marketplace
