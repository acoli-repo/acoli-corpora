WEBVTT

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We now have a whole underground marketplace

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and business ecosystem

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
built around online crime.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
One example of how these guys

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
actually are capable of monetizing their operations:

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and search for wanted persons.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and his partner in crime,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
a U.S. citizen.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
These guys were running an operation called I.M.U.,
