These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I asked them why.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I asked them how they feel about what they started.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And I got some sort of satisfaction

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
from learning that both Basit and Amjad

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
had had their computers infected dozens of times

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
by completely unrelated other viruses

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
over these years.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So there is some sort of justice

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
in the world after all.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Now, the viruses that we used to see
