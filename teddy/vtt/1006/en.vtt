00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I love the Internet.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's true.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Think about everything it has brought us.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Think about all the services we use,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
all the connectivity,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
all the entertainment,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
all the business, all the commerce.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it's happening during our lifetimes.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm pretty sure that one day

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we'll be writing history books

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
hundreds of years from now. This time

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
our generation will be remembered
