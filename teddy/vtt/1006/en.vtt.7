00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Now, the viruses that we used to see

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in the 1980s and 1990s

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
obviously are not a problem any more.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So let me just show you a couple of examples

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
of what they used to look like.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
What I'm running here

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
is a system that enables me

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to run age-old programs on a modern computer.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So let me just mount some drives. Go over there.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
What we have here is a list of old viruses.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So let me just run some viruses on my computer.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
For example,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
let's go with the Centipede virus first.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And you can see at the top of the screen,
