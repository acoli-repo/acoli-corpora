00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And if you just go and take a look

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
at what's happening in the online world,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
here's a video built by Clarified Networks,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
moves around from one country to another

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
as soon as the website is tried to shut down.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So you just can't shut these guys down.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
They will switch from one country to another,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
from one jurisdiction to another --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
moving around the world,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
using the fact that we don't have the capability

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
to globally police operations like this.
