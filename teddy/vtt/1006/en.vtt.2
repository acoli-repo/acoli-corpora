00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This here

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is Brain.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is a floppy disk

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
-- five and a quarter-inch floppy disk

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
infected by Brain.A.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's the first virus we ever found

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
for PC computers.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And we actually know

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
where Brain came from.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We know because it says so

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
inside the code.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Let's take a look.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
All right.
