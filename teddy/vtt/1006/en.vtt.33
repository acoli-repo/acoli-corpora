00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that are making millions out of their attacks.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
That's much more important

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
than running anti-viruses or running firewalls.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
What actually matters

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
is actually finding the people behind these attacks,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and even more importantly,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
we have to find the people

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
who are about to become

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
part of this online world of crime,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
but haven't yet done it.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
We have to find the people with the skills,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
but without the opportunities

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and give them the opportunities

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
to use their skills for good.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:13.000
