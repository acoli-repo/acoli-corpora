00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
70 years ago, it took one man

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
to infect an entire nation

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
with the power of "We can."

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So, today who is it going to take

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to spread the infection from 100,000 children

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
to the 200 million children in India?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So, if not us, then who?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
If not now, then when?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Like I said, contagious is a good word.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Thank you.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:10.000
