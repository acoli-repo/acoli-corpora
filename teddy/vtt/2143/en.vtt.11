00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So, on August 15th,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
again, Independence Day, 2009,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
empowered with the same process,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
How? We designed a simple toolkit,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
converted it into eight languages,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and reached 32,000 schools.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
We basically gave children a very simple challenge.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
We said, take one idea,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
anything that bothers you,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
choose one week,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and change a billion lives.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And they did. Stories of change

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
poured in from all over India,
