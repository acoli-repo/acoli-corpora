00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Now it was not about Riverside school.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It was about all children. So, we were shameless.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the press, businesses,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and basically said, "When are you going to wake up

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and recognize the potential that resides in every child?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
When will you include the child in the city?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So, how did the city respond?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Since 2007 every other month
