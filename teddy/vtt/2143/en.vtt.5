00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
because he's been able to understand that he

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
has shifted that man's mindset.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And that can't happen in a classroom.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So, when Ragav experienced that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
he went from "teacher told me,"

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But we had parents who said,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but what about math and science and English?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Show us the grades."
