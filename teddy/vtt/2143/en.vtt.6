00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And we did. The data was conclusive.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
When children are empowered,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
not only do they do good,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
they do well, in fact very well,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
taken by over 2,000 schools in India,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
in math, English and science.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.
