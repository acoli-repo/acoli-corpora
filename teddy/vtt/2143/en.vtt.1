In a country of a billion people and some,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
why so few?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Is it luck? Is it chance?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Can we all not systematically and consciously

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
get infected?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I got infected when I was 17,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
when, as a student of the design college,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and how contagious that feeling was.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
