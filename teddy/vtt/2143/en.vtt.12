00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And they did. Stories of change

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
poured in from all over India,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
from Nagaland in the east,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
to Jhunjhunu in the west,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
to alcoholism,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
in Rajasthan.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I mean, it was incredible.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and say, "You can," then they will.
