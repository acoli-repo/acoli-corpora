I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
a lab to prototype and refine a design process

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And I uncovered

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that if learning is embedded in real-world context,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that if you blur the boundaries between school and life,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
then children go through a journey of "aware,"

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
where they can see the change,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
"enable," be changed,
