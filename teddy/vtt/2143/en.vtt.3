"enable," be changed,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and then "empower," lead the change.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And that directly increased student wellbeing.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Children became more competent,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and less helpless.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But this was all common sense.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
they were made to roll incense sticks,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
agarbattis, for eight hours

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to experience what it means to be a child laborer.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It transformed them. What you will see is their journey,
