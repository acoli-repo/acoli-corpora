00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.456
Be their best selves when she was around.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.016
If they knew her,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.896
knew she was the glue to their revolution,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.456
the life flow of blood
through their veins.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.336
If they knew her,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.640
she would know,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.536
she would feel

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.816
that her body is more than battlefield.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.056
More than bone break and bleeding bigotry.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.136
More than bridge
over your troubled conscience.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.816
More than used up, walked on,
driven through, shot up.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.056
More than your "Selma, Lord, Selma"
Edmund Pettus.
