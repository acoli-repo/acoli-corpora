00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.136
Oh, wild women, they fly free.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.536
Just watch their ways,
how they rip and shred.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.416
Oh, who can understand her,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.376
this winding Niger river of a woman

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.096
one who is unafraid to tear away

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.656
only to roam and then become the wind.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.176
She who speaks in gusts and cyclones

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.016
blasting us back to high ground,
high consciousness,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.016
she turns and so does the world.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.416
Feel her spinning,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.456
spanning several lifetimes.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.856
Hear her speaking, sparking alarm.
