00:05:58.512 --> 00:06:00.842
their reaction was, "Really? You?"

00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:02.249
(Laughter)

00:06:02.273 --> 00:06:04.429
"A perfect match for her?"

00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:06.983
Which is pretty typical for siblings.

00:06:07.488 --> 00:06:10.197
In a sibling society,
there's lots of things.

00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:14.418
There's love and there's friendship
and there's protection.

00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:16.098
But there's also jealousy

00:06:16.603 --> 00:06:17.887
and competition

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.033
and rejection and attack.

00:06:21.867 --> 00:06:27.805
In siblinghood, that's where we start
assembling many of those first layers

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:29.316
that cover our soul.
