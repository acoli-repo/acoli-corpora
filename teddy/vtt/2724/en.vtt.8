00:03:57.732 --> 00:04:01.885
At the end of his life,
Albert Einstein concluded

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.059
that our normal, hamster-wheel
experience of life

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:07.430
is an illusion.

00:04:07.843 --> 00:04:10.236
We run round and round, faster and faster,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.883
trying to get somewhere.

00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:14.439
And all the while,

00:04:15.218 --> 00:04:18.647
underneath surface time
is this whole other dimension

00:04:19.288 --> 00:04:23.987
where the past and the present
and the future merge

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:26.940
and become deep time.

00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:30.109
And there's nowhere to get to.
