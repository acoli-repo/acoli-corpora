00:10:59.963 --> 00:11:02.604
Open to what's scary and painful.

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:04.484
Look for the sacred awe.

00:11:05.872 --> 00:11:09.137
Here I am with my marrow cells
after the harvest.

00:11:09.161 --> 00:11:11.061
That's they call it -- "harvest,"

00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:14.285
like it's some kind of bucolic
farm-to-table event --

00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:15.467
(Laughter)

00:11:15.491 --> 00:11:17.983
Which I can assure you it is not.

00:11:19.522 --> 00:11:22.857
And here is my brave, brave sister

00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:24.577
receiving my cells.

00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:29.706
After the transplant, we began to spend
more and more time together.
