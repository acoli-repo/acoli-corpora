When I discovered I was my sister's match,

00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:34.850
I went into research mode.

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:36.784
And I discovered that

00:06:38.028 --> 00:06:40.762
the premise of transplants
is pretty straightforward.

00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:44.046
You destroy all the bone marrow
in the cancer patient

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.806
with massive doses of chemotherapy,

00:06:47.293 --> 00:06:49.703
and then you replace that marrow

00:06:49.727 --> 00:06:53.567
with several million healthy
marrow cells from a donor.

00:06:53.937 --> 00:06:55.743
And then you do everything you can

00:06:55.767 --> 00:07:00.052
to make sure that those new cells
engraft in the patient.
