00:08:33.272 --> 00:08:34.698
Could we forgive?

00:08:35.116 --> 00:08:36.556
Could we merge?

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.051
Would that teach our cells to do the same?

00:08:41.431 --> 00:08:46.244
To woo my skeptical sister,
I turned to my parents' holy text:

00:08:46.268 --> 00:08:47.869
the New Yorker Magazine.

00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:49.809
(Laughter)

00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:53.404
I sent her a cartoon from its pages

00:08:53.428 --> 00:08:57.053
as a way of explaining
why we should visit a therapist

00:08:57.077 --> 00:09:02.443
before having my bone marrow harvested
and transplanted into her body.
