00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.374
and ancestry and mystery.

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:34.031
And then that baby grows up,

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:36.170
and in order to fit into the family,

00:01:36.194 --> 00:01:38.235
to conform to the culture,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.529
to the community, to the gender,

00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:44.116
that little one begins to cover its soul,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.654
layer by layer.

00:01:46.197 --> 00:01:47.911
We're born this way,

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:49.563
but --

00:01:49.587 --> 00:01:51.179
(Laughter)

00:01:51.203 --> 00:01:54.192
But as we grow, a lot
of things happen to us

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.050
that make us ...

00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:02.959
want to hide our soulful
eccentricities and authenticity.
