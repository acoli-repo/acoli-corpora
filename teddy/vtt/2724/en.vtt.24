00:11:58.411 --> 00:12:00.100
Our fast-paced society

00:12:00.124 --> 00:12:05.284
does not support or even value
this kind of work.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:08.941
We see it as a disruption
of real life and important work.

00:12:09.426 --> 00:12:13.654
We worry about the emotional drain
and the financial cost --

00:12:13.678 --> 00:12:17.253
and, yes, there is a financial cost.

00:12:17.277 --> 00:12:18.951
But I was paid

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:24.457
in the kind of currency our culture
seems to have forgotten all about.

00:12:25.132 --> 00:12:27.271
I was paid in love.

00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:29.374
I was paid in soul.

00:12:29.398 --> 00:12:31.568
I was paid in my sister.
