00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:02.794
Like many of us,

00:00:02.818 --> 00:00:05.190
I've had several careers in my life,

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:07.365
and although they've been varied,

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:11.276
my first job set the foundation
for all of them.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.313
I was a home-birth midwife
throughout my 20s.

00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:20.747
Delivering babies taught me
valuable and sometimes surprising things,

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.541
like how to start a car at 2am.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.363
when it's 10 degrees below zero.

00:00:25.387 --> 00:00:26.388
(Laughter)

00:00:26.412 --> 00:00:30.747
Or how to revive a father
who's fainted at the sight of blood.
