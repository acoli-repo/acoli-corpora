00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:02.959
want to hide our soulful
eccentricities and authenticity.

00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:04.350
We've all done this.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:07.213
Everyone in this room is a former baby --

00:02:07.237 --> 00:02:08.259
(Laughter)

00:02:08.283 --> 00:02:10.768
with a distinctive birthright.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.776
But as adults, we spend so much
of our time uncomfortable in our own skin,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.778
like we have ADD:
authenticity deficit disorder.

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.057
But not those babies --

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:24.323
not yet.

00:02:24.347 --> 00:02:26.125
Their message to me was:

00:02:26.453 --> 00:02:28.704
uncover your soul

00:02:28.728 --> 00:02:31.921
and look for that soul-spark
