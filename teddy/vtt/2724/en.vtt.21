00:10:26.175 --> 00:10:30.363
People have said I was brave
to undergo the bone marrow harvest,

00:10:30.387 --> 00:10:31.657
but I don't think so.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.190
What felt brave to me

00:10:34.214 --> 00:10:37.399
was that other kind
of harvest and transplant,

00:10:37.423 --> 00:10:39.319
the soul marrow transplant,

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:43.750
getting emotionally naked
with another human being,

00:10:43.774 --> 00:10:47.243
putting aside pride and defensiveness,

00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:48.903
lifting the layers

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:53.650
and sharing with each other
our vulnerable souls.

00:10:54.416 --> 00:10:57.215
I called on those midwife lessons:

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:58.865
uncover your soul.

00:10:59.963 --> 00:11:02.604
Open to what's scary and painful.
