00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:30.109
And there's nowhere to get to.

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:35.065
Albert Einstein called
this state, this dimension,

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:36.750
"only being."

00:04:36.774 --> 00:04:38.730
And he said when he experienced it,

00:04:38.754 --> 00:04:41.061
he knew sacred awe.

00:04:41.818 --> 00:04:43.467
When I was delivering babies,

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:45.386
I was forced off the hamster wheel.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.189
Sometimes I had to sit for days,
hours and hours,

00:04:49.213 --> 00:04:51.799
just breathing with the parents;

00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:53.159
just being.

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.615
And I got a big dose of sacred awe.

00:04:57.156 --> 00:05:01.810
So those are the three lessons
I took with me from midwifery.
