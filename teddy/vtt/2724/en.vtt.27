00:13:27.214 --> 00:13:30.129
After that best year of my sister's life,

00:13:30.153 --> 00:13:32.154
the cancer came roaring back,

00:13:32.702 --> 00:13:35.974
and this time there was nothing more
the doctors could do.

00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:38.664
They gave her just
a couple of months to live.

00:13:40.196 --> 00:13:42.573
The night before my sister died,

00:13:43.163 --> 00:13:45.871
I sat by her bedside.

00:13:45.895 --> 00:13:48.178
She was so small and thin.

00:13:48.766 --> 00:13:51.289
I could see the blood pulsing in her neck.

00:13:51.869 --> 00:13:55.414
It was my blood, her blood, our blood.

00:13:56.462 --> 00:13:59.314
When she died, part of me would die, too.
