00:04:57.156 --> 00:05:01.810
So those are the three lessons
I took with me from midwifery.

00:05:02.253 --> 00:05:04.698
One: uncover your soul.

00:05:05.376 --> 00:05:11.544
Two: when things get difficult
or painful, try to stay open.

00:05:11.568 --> 00:05:15.501
And three: every now and then,
step off your hamster wheel

00:05:15.928 --> 00:05:17.550
into deep time.

00:05:18.946 --> 00:05:22.133
Those lessons have served me
throughout my life,

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:25.314
but they really served me recently,

00:05:25.338 --> 00:05:29.926
when I took on the most
important job of my life thus far.
