00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:10.308
If my sister made it
through the near-lethal chemotherapy,

00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:13.918
she still would face other challenges.

00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:16.252
My cells

00:07:16.863 --> 00:07:19.370

00:07:25.315 --> 00:07:26.941
and both could kill her.

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:29.575
Rejection. Attack.
