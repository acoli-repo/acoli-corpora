"Oh, I'm not in the mood".

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:08.087
Who here has ever
told a partner that before?

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.714
(Laughter and murmuring)

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:14.093
We've all done this.

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:17.305
And if you haven't said it,
then you've probably heard it.

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:19.640
Intuitively, we understand

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:22.393
that our minds matter
when it comes to sex,

00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:26.272
but weâ€™re quick to focus
on bodies, touch and sensation

00:00:26.272 --> 00:00:28.524
as the most crucial elements.

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:32.528
We're less likely to consider
the role of our imaginations.
