00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:04.231
I'm an immigrant from Venezuela,

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:07.246
and I've lived in the US for six years.

00:00:07.884 --> 00:00:10.782
If you ask me about my life
as an expatriate,

00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:12.658
I would say that I've been lucky.

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:13.982
But it hasn't been easy.

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:18.314
Growing up, I never thought
that I was going to leave my homeland.

00:00:18.338 --> 00:00:22.710
I participated in my first
student protest in 2007,

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:26.652
when the president shut down
one of the most important news networks.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:29.959
I was getting my bachelor's degree
in communications,

00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:34.938
and that was the first time I realized
I couldn't take free speech for granted.
