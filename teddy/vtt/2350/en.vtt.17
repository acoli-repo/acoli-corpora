WEBVTT

00:08:28.831 --> 00:08:32.183
we are creating the solutions
that people want and need.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.541
What is so great about this

00:08:34.565 --> 00:08:37.022
is that we are using
our professional skills,

00:08:37.046 --> 00:08:39.360
so it comes easily and naturally.

00:08:39.384 --> 00:08:42.451
It's not that hard for us
to make a difference.

00:08:42.816 --> 00:08:44.939
If someone from San Francisco

00:08:44.963 --> 00:08:47.381
were to hire professionals
to create solutions

00:08:47.405 --> 00:08:49.676
like MediTweet or Blackout Tracker,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.923
it would cost a small fortune.

00:08:51.947 --> 00:08:53.362
By donating our services,

00:08:53.386 --> 00:08:57.920
we are making a bigger impact
than if we were just to donate money.

00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:00.333
And you can do the same thing --
