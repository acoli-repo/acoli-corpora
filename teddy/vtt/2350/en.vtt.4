00:01:58.062 --> 00:02:00.958
to create solutions
for people on the ground.

00:02:00.982 --> 00:02:05.950
But first, we needed to find some experts
actually living inside Venezuela

00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:07.365
to guide us.

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:09.360
We'd see so many other hackathons

00:02:09.384 --> 00:02:13.517
that came up with wily, ambitious,
incredible technological solutions

00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:17.359
that sounded great in theory
but ultimately failed to work

00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:20.398
in the actual countries
they were intended to help.

00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:23.678
Many of us have been
living abroad for years,

00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:26.773
and we are detached
from the day-to-day problems

00:02:26.797 --> 00:02:28.898
that people are facing in Venezuela.

00:02:28.922 --> 00:02:32.445
So we turned to the experts
actually living inside of the country.
