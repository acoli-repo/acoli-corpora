The government won't report
blackouts on the news.

00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:03.090
When the power goes out,

00:07:03.114 --> 00:07:08.612
many Venezuelans, we quickly tweet out
the location with the hashtag #SinLuz,

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.915
meaning "without electricity,"

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:13.394
before their phones ran out of battery,

00:07:13.418 --> 00:07:16.370
so people around the country
know what is happening.

00:07:17.245 --> 00:07:19.041
Like MediTweet,

00:07:19.065 --> 00:07:23.382
Blackout Tracker scans Twitter
for the hashtag #SinLuz

00:07:23.406 --> 00:07:27.402
and creates a map using
the location data of those users.

00:07:27.426 --> 00:07:28.946
You can quickly see

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.239
where the blackouts are happening today
