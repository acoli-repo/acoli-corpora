00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:00.333
And you can do the same thing --

00:09:00.357 --> 00:09:01.864
not in Venezuela, necessarily,

00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:03.700
but in your own community.

00:09:04.415 --> 00:09:07.032
In a world that is more
connected than ever,

00:09:07.056 --> 00:09:12.909
we still see how specialized communities
can be living isolated or in silos.

00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:16.000
There are so many great ways to help,

00:09:16.024 --> 00:09:19.176
but I believe that you can use
your professional skills

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.657
to connect diverse communities
and create effective solutions

00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:24.595
through those relationships.

00:09:25.524 --> 00:09:29.674
Anyone with knowledge
and professional skills

00:09:29.698 --> 00:09:33.812
has a powerful force
to bring hope to a community.
