00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:34.938
and that was the first time I realized
I couldn't take free speech for granted.

00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:39.445
We knew things were getting bad,
but we never saw what was coming:

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.772
an economic crisis,
infrastructure breaking down,

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:45.254
citywide electrical blackouts,

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:49.307
the decline of public health care
and shortage of medicines,

00:00:49.331 --> 00:00:51.532
disease outbreaks and starvation.

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:55.729
I moved to Canada with my husband in 2013,

00:00:55.753 --> 00:00:59.745
and we always thought we'd move back home
when the crisis improved.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.305
But we never did.
