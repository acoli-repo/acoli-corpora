It's my parents, and I'm 4,000 miles away.

00:01:30.712 --> 00:01:34.773
Today, I'm just one of more than
four million Venezuelans

00:01:34.797 --> 00:01:36.473
who have left their home country.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.193
A lot of my friends
are Venezuelan immigrants,

00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:41.754
and in the last few years,

00:01:41.778 --> 00:01:45.138
we've begun talking about
how we could make a difference

00:01:45.162 --> 00:01:47.157
when we live so far away.

00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:52.002
That is how Code for Venezuela
was born in 2019.

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:55.424
It began with a hackathon,
because we are experts in tech,

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:58.038
and we thought we could use
our tech skills

00:01:58.062 --> 00:02:00.958
to create solutions
for people on the ground.
