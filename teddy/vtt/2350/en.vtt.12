WEBVTT

00:05:56.824 --> 00:06:00.407
and connects users who are asking
for specific medicines

00:06:00.431 --> 00:06:04.163
with those who are selling
their private leftovers.

00:06:04.187 --> 00:06:07.491
We also pool the location data
of those Twitter users

00:06:07.515 --> 00:06:10.379
and use it for a visualization tool.

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:14.322
It gives local organizations
like Médicos por la Salud

00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:17.180
a sense of where they have a shortage.

00:06:17.204 --> 00:06:20.307
We can also apply
machine learning algorithms

00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:22.718
to detect clusters of disease.

00:06:22.742 --> 00:06:24.628
If they've received humanitarian aid,

00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:27.482
this could help them
to make better decisions

00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:30.108
about the distributions of the supplies.
