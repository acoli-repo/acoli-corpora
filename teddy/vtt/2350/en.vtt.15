00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.239
where the blackouts are happening today

00:07:31.263 --> 00:07:34.792
and how many blackouts
have happened over time.

00:07:35.887 --> 00:07:38.155
People want to know what is happening,

00:07:38.179 --> 00:07:39.654
and this is our answer.

00:07:39.678 --> 00:07:43.403
But it's also a way of holding
the government accountable.

00:07:43.427 --> 00:07:46.073
It's easy for them to deny
that the problem exists

00:07:46.097 --> 00:07:47.352
or make excuses,

00:07:47.376 --> 00:07:49.909
because there is no official data on it.

00:07:49.933 --> 00:07:54.056
Blackout Tracker shows how bad
the problem really is.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.478
Now, some people in Silicon Valley
may look at these projects

00:07:58.502 --> 00:08:01.870
and say that there are no major
technological innovations.
