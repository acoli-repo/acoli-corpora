00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.305
But we never did.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.367
Nearly all my childhood friends
have left the country,

00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:06.320
but my parents are still there.

00:01:06.843 --> 00:01:09.213
There have been moments
where I've called my mom,

00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:13.497
and I could hear people screaming
and crying in the background

00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:16.517
as teargas bombs exploded in the streets.

00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:20.769
And my mom, as if I couldn't
hear it, would always tell me,

00:01:20.793 --> 00:01:23.565
(Speaking Spanish)

00:01:23.589 --> 00:01:25.535
"We're fine, don't worry."

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:26.921
But of course, I worry.

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:30.029
It's my parents, and I'm 4,000 miles away.
