00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:33.100
With their expert advice,
we came up with a series of challenges

00:03:33.124 --> 00:03:35.182
for hackathon participants.

00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:38.473
In that first hackathon,
we had 300 participants

00:03:38.497 --> 00:03:39.822
from seven countries

00:03:39.846 --> 00:03:43.370
come up with 16 different
project submissions.

00:03:43.394 --> 00:03:45.971
We picked the projects
with the most potential

00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:48.833
and continued working on them
after the event.

00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:52.929
Today, I'll share two of our most
successful projects

00:03:52.953 --> 00:03:56.126
to give you a taste of the impact
we are having so far.

00:03:56.524 --> 00:03:59.590
They're called MediTweet
and Blackout Tracker.
