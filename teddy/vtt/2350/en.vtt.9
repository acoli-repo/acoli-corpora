00:04:26.463 --> 00:04:30.922
My mom was diagnosed with cancer in 2015.

00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:33.024
She needed to have a lumbar puncture

00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:36.197
to get a final diagnosis
and treatment plan.

00:04:37.197 --> 00:04:39.603
But the needle for this procedure
wasn't available.

00:04:40.055 --> 00:04:42.542
I was in Venezuela at that time,

00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:46.490
and I was seeing my mom
getting worse in front of me every day.

00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:50.788
After looking everywhere,
we found the needle in a site

00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:53.348
that is like the eBay of Latin America.

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:55.706
I met the seller in a local bakery,

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.425
and it was like buying
something on the black market.

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.280
My mom brought the needle to her doctor,
and he did the procedure.
