00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:30.717
How should the three planes coordinate

00:01:30.717 --> 00:01:35.487
so the professor can fly continuously
for the whole trip and achieve his dream

00:01:35.487 --> 00:01:38.576
without anyone running out 
of fuel and crashing?

00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:42.246
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:42.246 --> 00:01:43.656
Answer in: 3

00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:44.656
Answer in: 2

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:46.118
Answer in: 1

00:01:46.118 --> 00:01:48.187
According to the professor's calculations,

00:01:48.187 --> 00:01:51.398
they should be able to pull it off
by a hair.

00:01:51.398 --> 00:01:55.457
The key is to maximize the support
each assistant provides,

00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:58.677
not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel.

00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:01.007
It also helps us to think symmetrically
