00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.243
There's just one problem:

00:00:30.243 --> 00:00:34.335
the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters
of fuel,

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:37.576
only enough for exactly half the journey.

00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:38.465
Let's be honest.

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:41.816
The professor probably could have
designed the plane to hold more fuel,

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:43.695
but where's the fun in that?

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:47.605
Instead, he's devised a slightly more
elaborate solution:

00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:51.575
building three identical planes
for the mission.

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:53.056
In addition to their speed,

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:56.525
the professor's equipped them
with a few other incredible features.

00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:59.046
Each of the planes can turn on a dime

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:04.026
and instantly transfer any amount
of its fuel to any of the others in midair
