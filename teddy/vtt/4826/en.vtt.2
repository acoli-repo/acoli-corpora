00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:05.415
without slowing down,

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:07.795
provided they're next to each other.

00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:09.876
The professor will pilot the first plane,

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:14.686
while his two assistants Fugōri
and Orokana will pilot each of the others.

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:18.237
However, only one airport,
located on the equator,

00:01:18.237 --> 00:01:20.787
has granted permission for the experiment,

00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:22.316
making it the starting point,

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:23.456
the finish line,

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:25.736
and the only spot where 
the planes can land,

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:26.855
takeoff,

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:28.816
or refuel on the ground.

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:30.717
How should the three planes coordinate
