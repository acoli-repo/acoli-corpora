00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:01.007
It also helps us to think symmetrically

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.810
so they can make shorter trips
in either direction

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.267
while setting the professor up for a long
unsupported stretch in the middle.

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:09.838
Here's his solution.

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:13.117
All three planes take off at noon
flying west,

00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:16.488
each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters.

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:19.850
After 45 minutes, or one-eighth
of the way around,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.314
each plane has 135 kiloliters left.

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:27.828
Orokana gives 45 to the professor
and 45 to Fugōri,

00:02:27.828 --> 00:02:29.989
fully refueling them both.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.441
With her remaining 45, 
Orokana returns to the airport
