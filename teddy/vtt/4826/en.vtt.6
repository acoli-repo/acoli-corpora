00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:01.459
In the meantime, Orokana has been
anxiously awaiting Fugōri's return,

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.009
her plane fully refueled and ready to go.

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:10.659
As soon as his plane touches the ground,
she takes off, this time flying east.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.059
At this point, exactly 180 minutes 
have passed

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.260
and the professor is at the halfway point
of his journey

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.069
with 90 kiloliters of fuel left.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.579
For the next 90 minutes,

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.749
the professor and Orokana's planes 
fly towards each other,

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.511
meeting at the three-quarter mark.

00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:29.990
Just as the professor's fuel 
is about the run out,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.110
he sees Orokana's plane.
