00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.110
he sees Orokana's plane.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.291
She gives him 45 kiloliters 
of her remaining 90,

00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.970
leaving them with 45 each.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.049
But that's just half of what they need
to make it to the airport.

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.680
Fortunately, this is exactly when Fugōri,
having refueled, takes off.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.280
45 minutes later, just as the other two
planes are about to run empty,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.240
he meets them at the 315 degree point

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.920
and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel
to each, leaving 45 for himself.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.620
All three planes land at the airport
just as their fuel gauges reach zero.
