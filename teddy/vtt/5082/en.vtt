00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:11.073
During World War I, one of the 
horrors of trench warfare

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:15.200
was a poisonous yellow cloud 
called mustard gas.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.090
For those unlucky enough to be exposed,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.982
it made the air impossible to breathe, 
burned their eyes,

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:26.034
and caused huge blisters on exposed skin.

00:00:26.034 --> 00:00:31.536
Scientists tried desperately to develop an
antidote to this vicious weapon of war.
