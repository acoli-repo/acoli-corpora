00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Cholera was reported in Haiti

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
for the first time in over 50 years

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
last October.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There was no way to predict

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
how far it would spread through water supplies

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and how bad the situation would get.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And not knowing where help was needed

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
always ensured that help was in short supply

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the areas that needed it most.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
before they take innocent lives

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and cause irreversible damage,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but we still can't do that with water,
