00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I would like to talk today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about what I think is one of the greatest adventures

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
human beings have embarked upon,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is the quest to understand the universe

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and our place in it.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
My own interest in this subject, and my passion for it,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
began rather accidentally.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I had bought a copy of this book,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
"The Universe and Dr. Einstein" --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
A few years after that, in Bangalore,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I picked up this book,
