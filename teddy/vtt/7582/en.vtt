Have you ever trodden
on a Lego brick in your bare feet?

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.670
You’re tiptoeing through
your lounge late at night,

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.339
and suddenly that stabbing pain,

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:11.340
the expletives

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.342
and the inevitable question:

00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:16.054
“Why do we have so much of this stuff
all over the place?”

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:17.722
Well, that’s really quite simple.

00:00:18.014 --> 00:00:19.849
Your kids love playing with it,

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:20.892
so you buy more.

00:00:21.768 --> 00:00:22.769
And a confession --

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.271
I love to watch my kids play with Lego.

00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:30.401
Especially good is when
I see them inventing their own rules
