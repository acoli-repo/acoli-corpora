"When the prisons and gates slam shut,

00:01:30.428 --> 00:01:33.030
prisoners do not lose
their human quality."

00:01:34.515 --> 00:01:39.182
Every prisoner I've interviewed
has said there are three flecks of light

00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:41.640
in the darkness of prison:

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:42.862
phone calls,

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:44.037
letters

00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:45.501
and visits from family.

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:50.069
CMUs aren't solitary confinement,
but they radically restrict all of these

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:53.992
to levels that meet or exceed the most
extreme prisons in the United States.

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:57.777
Their phone calls can be limited
to 45 minutes a month,

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:01.469
compared to the 300 minutes
other prisoners receive.
