and talked about books and movies.

00:08:01.334 --> 00:08:03.958
We did our best to find reasons to laugh.

00:08:04.554 --> 00:08:07.721
To fight boredom and amuse himself
while in the CMU,

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:11.825
McGowan had been spreading a rumor
that I was secretly the president

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:15.820
of a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC

00:08:15.844 --> 00:08:17.399
(Laughter)

00:08:17.836 --> 00:08:20.185
For the record, I'm not.

00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:21.449
(Laughter)

00:08:21.754 --> 00:08:25.352
But I kind of the hope the FBI
now thinks that Bella and Edward

00:08:25.376 --> 00:08:27.522
are terrorist code names.

00:08:27.546 --> 00:08:29.056
(Laughter)
