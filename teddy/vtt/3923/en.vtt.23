Those prisons were eventually shut down,

00:11:31.092 --> 00:11:35.493
of religious groups and human rights
advocates, like Amnesty International.

00:11:36.398 --> 00:11:40.324
Today, civil rights lawyers
with the Center for Constitutional Rights

00:11:40.348 --> 00:11:42.727
are challenging CMUs in court

00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:45.306
for depriving prisoners
of their due process rights

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.410
and for retaliating against them

00:11:47.434 --> 00:11:50.744
for their protected political
and religious speech.

00:11:51.296 --> 00:11:54.964

never come to light without this lawsuit.

and my message for you today
