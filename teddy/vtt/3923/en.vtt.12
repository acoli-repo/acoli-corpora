00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.554
That came as quite a shock.

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:07.579
First, because as I've discussed
on this stage before,

00:06:07.603 --> 00:06:10.900
I learned that the FBI has been
monitoring my work.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.459
Second, because it would make me the first
and only journalist to visit a CMU.

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:18.347
I had even learned

00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:21.577
through the Bureau of Prisons
Counterterrorism Unit,

00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:26.256
that they had been monitoring my speeches
about CMUs, like this one.

00:06:27.128 --> 00:06:30.590
So how could I possibly
be approved to visit?
