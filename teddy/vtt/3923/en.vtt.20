Prisoners are sent to a CMU
because of their race,

00:10:01.544 --> 00:10:04.191
their religion or their
political beliefs.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.591
Now, if you think that
characterization is too strong,

00:10:07.615 --> 00:10:10.432
just look at some
of the government's own documents.

00:10:10.456 --> 00:10:14.972
When some of McGowan's mail was rejected
by the CMU, the sender was told

00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:18.610
it's because the letters were intended
"for political prisoners."

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.228
When another prisoner, animal rights
activist Andy Stepanian,

00:10:23.252 --> 00:10:28.641
was sent to a CMU, it was because of his
anti-government and anti-corporate views.

00:10:29.722 --> 00:10:32.692
Now, I know all of this
may be hard to believe,
