They've included people like Yassin Aref.

00:03:02.892 --> 00:03:08.070
Aref and his family fled to New York
from Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees.

00:03:08.094 --> 00:03:11.887
He was arrested in 2004
as part of an FBI sting.

00:03:12.784 --> 00:03:16.258
Aref is an imam and he was asked
to bear witness to a loan,

00:03:16.282 --> 00:03:18.679
which is a tradition in Islamic culture.

00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:22.519
It turned out that one of the people
involved in the loan was trying to enlist

00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:24.907
someone else in a fake attack.

00:03:25.452 --> 00:03:26.822
Aref didn't know.

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:28.831
For that, he was convicted

00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:32.888
of conspiracy to provide material support
to a terrorist group.
