00:04:25.627 --> 00:04:30.198
a term the FBI uses repeatedly when
talking about environmental activists.

00:04:30.978 --> 00:04:34.749
Now, keep in mind there are about 400
prisoners in US prisons

00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:36.536
who are classified as terrorists,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.654
and only a handful of them
are in the CMUs.

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.792
In McGowan's case, he was previously
at a low-security prison

00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:45.939
and he had no communications violations.

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:48.990
So, why was he moved?

00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:51.510
Like other CMU prisoners,

00:04:51.534 --> 00:04:55.424
McGowan repeatedly asked
for an answer, a hearing,

00:04:55.448 --> 00:04:57.766
or some opportunity for an appeal.

00:04:58.434 --> 00:05:02.688
This example from another prisoner
shows how those requests are viewed.
