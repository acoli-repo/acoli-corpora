Their visits can be limited

compared to the 35 hours that people
like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:15.321
receive in the supermax.

00:02:16.215 --> 00:02:21.203
On top of that, CMU visits are non-contact
which means prisoners are not allowed

00:02:21.227 --> 00:02:23.141

except psychologically."
