00:11:56.398 --> 00:12:01.029
The message of these groups
and my message for you today

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:04.809
is that we must bear witness
to what is being done to these prisoners.

00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:09.876
Their treatment is a reflection
of the values held beyond prison walls.

00:12:10.339 --> 00:12:12.955
This story is not just about prisoners.

00:12:12.979 --> 00:12:15.003
It is about us.

00:12:15.027 --> 00:12:17.774
It is about our own commitment
to human rights.

00:12:17.798 --> 00:12:22.523
It is about whether we will choose to stop
repeating the mistakes of our past.

00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:28.109
If we don't listen to what Father Berrigan
described as the stories of the dead,

00:12:28.133 --> 00:12:30.596
they will soon become
the stories of ourselves.
