A memo from the Counterterrorism Unit
cited McGowan's "anti-government beliefs."

00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:39.844
While imprisoned, he continued writing
about environmental issues,

00:05:39.868 --> 00:05:42.686
saying that activists must
reflect on their mistakes

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.257
and listen to each other.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.021
Now, in fairness, if you've spent
any time at all in Washington, DC,

00:05:48.045 --> 00:05:52.384
you know this is really a radical
concept for the government.

00:05:52.408 --> 00:05:53.652
(Laughter)

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.747
I actually asked to visit
McGowan in the CMU.

00:05:58.328 --> 00:05:59.732
And I was approved.
