00:06:27.128 --> 00:06:30.590
So how could I possibly
be approved to visit?

00:06:31.222 --> 00:06:35.431
A few days before I went
out to the prison, I got an answer.

00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:40.836
I was allowed to visit McGowan
as a friend, not a journalist.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.601
Journalists are not allowed here.

00:06:42.972 --> 00:06:46.517
McGowan was told by CMU officials
that if I asked any questions

00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:48.460
or published any story,

00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:51.319
that he would be punished
for my reporting.

00:06:52.308 --> 00:06:54.772
When I arrived for our visit,
the guards reminded me

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:57.070
that they knew who I was
and knew about my work.

00:06:57.094 --> 00:06:59.674
And they said that if I attempted
to interview McGowan,

00:06:59.698 --> 00:07:01.375
the visit would be terminated.
