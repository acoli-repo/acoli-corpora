00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:12.276
But I think that's an Orwellian way

00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:13.957
When you visit a CMU,

00:07:13.981 --> 00:07:17.107
you go through all the security
checkpoints that you would expect.

00:07:17.131 --> 00:07:20.246
But then the walk
to the visitation room is silent.

00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:26.227
When a CMU prisoner has a visit,
the rest of the prison is on lockdown.

00:07:27.112 --> 00:07:28.938
I was ushered into a small room,

00:07:28.962 --> 00:07:32.450
so small my outstretched arms
could touch each wall.
