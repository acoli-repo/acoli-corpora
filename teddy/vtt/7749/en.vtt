00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:12.884
In the Egyptian Book of the Dead,
there’s a banishment spell that declares,

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:15.636
“Be far from me, 
O vile cockroach.”

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:21.642
More than 3,000 years later, 
we’re still trying to oust these insects.

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:25.313
But from poison traps 
to hastily brandished slippers,

00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:29.442
cockroaches seem to weather 
just about everything we throw at them.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:33.696
So what makes cockroaches so hard to kill?
