In the 1980s, a bonobo named Kanzi

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:13.637
learned to communicate with humans
to an unprecedented extent—

00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:15.587
not through speech or gestures,

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:20.798
but using a keyboard of abstract symbols
representing objects and actions.

00:00:20.798 --> 00:00:25.821
By pointing to several of these in order,
he created sequences to make requests,

00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:28.401
answer verbal questions 
from human researchers,

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:32.101
and refer to objects 
that weren’t physically present.
