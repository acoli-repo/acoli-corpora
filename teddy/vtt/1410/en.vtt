00:00:00.975 --> 00:00:04.011
The Kraken, a beast so terrifying

00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:07.108
it was said to devour men and ships and whales,

00:00:07.108 --> 00:00:11.035
and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.

00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:13.291
In assessing the merits of such tales,

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:16.176
it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw

00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:19.799
that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:22.436
is a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time,"

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:27.669
and a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit." (Laughter)

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.447
Every fish that gets away

00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:31.595
grows with every telling of the tale.
