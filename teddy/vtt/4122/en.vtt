00:00:00.197 --> 00:00:02.082
I would like to talk to you about a story

00:00:02.082 --> 00:00:04.563
about a small town kid.

00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:08.238
I don't know his name, but I do know his story.

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:11.314
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.

00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:15.344
His village is near Mogadishu.

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:17.518
Drought drives the small village into poverty

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.386
and to the brink of starvation.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.222
With nothing left for him there,

00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:23.049
he leaves for the big city,

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:26.454
in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:29.284
When he arrives, there are no opportunities,

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:32.272
no jobs, no way forward.
