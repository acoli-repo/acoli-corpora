00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.147
I believe he is selling hope.

00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:02.736
His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,

00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:04.908
when it's created, will actually transform

00:08:04.908 --> 00:08:06.980
the way people see their city.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.133
Aden hired street kids to help rent out

00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:10.995
and maintain those bikes for him.

00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:13.053
He gave them the opportunity to escape

00:08:13.053 --> 00:08:15.989
the paralysis of waithood.

00:08:15.989 --> 00:08:18.019
These young entrepreneurs are having

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:21.553
a tremendous impact in their cities.

00:08:21.553 --> 00:08:24.069
So my suggestion is,

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:26.585
turn youth into entrepreneurs,

00:08:26.585 --> 00:08:29.808
incubate and nurture their inherent innovation,

00:08:29.808 --> 00:08:33.647
and you will have more stories
of flowers and Peace Parks
