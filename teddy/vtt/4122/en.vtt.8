00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.549
unemployed, frustrated,

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.946
that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab

00:04:02.946 --> 00:04:05.998
and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.

00:04:05.998 --> 00:04:09.876
They sought people like him out.

00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:12.972
But his story takes a different route.

00:04:12.972 --> 00:04:14.909
In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.162
to getting from point A to point B are the roads.

00:04:18.162 --> 00:04:19.945
Twenty-three years of civil war

00:04:19.945 --> 00:04:22.176
have completely destroyed the road system,

00:04:22.176 --> 00:04:24.185
and a motorbike can be the easiest way

00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:25.815
to get around.

00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:29.056
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.

00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:31.181
He started a motorbike company.
