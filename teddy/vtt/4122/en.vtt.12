00:05:58.353 --> 00:06:01.661
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:03.717
and started growing tulips and lilies,

00:06:03.717 --> 00:06:05.423
which he said could survive

00:06:05.423 --> 00:06:08.134
the harsh Mogadishu climate.

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:11.832
And he began delivering flowers to weddings,

00:06:11.832 --> 00:06:13.765
creating gardens at homes

00:06:13.765 --> 00:06:16.369
and businesses around the city,

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:18.106
and he's now working on creating

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:21.731
Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years.

00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:23.830
There's no public park in Mogadishu.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.159
He wants to create a space where families,

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:27.810
young people, can come together,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.448
and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.
