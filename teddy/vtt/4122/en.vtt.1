00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:32.272
no jobs, no way forward.

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:34.296
He ends up living in a tent city

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:37.000
on the outskirts of Mogadishu.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.009
Maybe a year passes, nothing.

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:43.309
One day, he's approached by a gentleman

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.507
who offers to take him to lunch,

00:00:45.507 --> 00:00:48.583
then to dinner, to breakfast.

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:51.602
He meets this dynamic group of people,

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:53.107
and they give him a break.

00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:54.426
He's given a bit of money

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:56.528
to buy himself some new clothes,

00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:59.064
money to send back home to his family.

00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:01.037
He is introduced to this young woman.
