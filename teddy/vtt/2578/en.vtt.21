00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.480
of these three segments
of the leg as pantograph.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.056
Now, what's interesting
is that this quite dynamic gait

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.976
is obtained purely in open loop,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.136
meaning no sensors,
no complex feedback loops.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.576
And that's interesting, because it means

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.616
that just the mechanics
already stabilized this quite rapid gait,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.816
and that really good mechanics
already basically simplify locomotion.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.136
To the extent that we can even
disturb a bit locomotion,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.816
as you will see in the next video,

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.736
where we can for instance do some exercise
where we have the robot go down a step,

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.376
and the robot will not fall over,
