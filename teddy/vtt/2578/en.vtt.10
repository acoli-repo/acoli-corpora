00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.016
is the fact that all this can be generated
just by the spinal cord and the body.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.040
So if you take
a decerebrated salamander --

00:05:06.064 --> 00:05:08.080
it's not so nice
but you remove the head --

00:05:08.104 --> 00:05:10.776
and if you electrically
stimulate the spinal cord,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.056
at low level of stimulation
this will induce a walking-like gait.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.536
If you stimulate a bit more,
the gait accelerates.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.456
And at some point, there's a threshold,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.016
and automatically,
the animal switches to swimming.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.416
This is amazing.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.936
Just changing the global drive,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.696
as if you are pressing the gas pedal

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.856
of descending modulation
to your spinal cord,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.880
makes a complete switch
between two very different gaits.
