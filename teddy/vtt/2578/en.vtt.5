00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.616
This is where biorobots like Pleurobot
and mathematical models

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.840
can really help.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.736
So what's biorobotics?

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.496
Biorobotics is a very active field
of research in robotics

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.976
where people want to
take inspiration from animals

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.456
to make robots to go outdoors,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.136
like service robots
or search and rescue robots

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.360
or field robots.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.576
And the big goal here
is to take inspiration from animals

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.936
to make robots that can handle
complex terrain --

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.576
stairs, mountains, forests,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.616
places where robots
still have difficulties

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.696
and where animals
can do a much better job.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.216
The robot can be a wonderful
scientific tool as well.
