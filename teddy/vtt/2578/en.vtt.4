00:01:58.937 --> 00:02:01.476
showing that just the lower part,
spinal cord and body,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.373
already solve a big part of locomotion.

00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:05.856
Now, understanding how this works
is very complex,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.176
because first of all,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.820
recording activity in the spinal cord
is very difficult.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:12.616
It's much easier to implant electrodes
in the motor cortex

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.696
than in the spinal cord,
because it's protected by the vertebrae.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.536
Especially in humans, very hard to do.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.336
A second difficulty is that locomotion
is really due to a very complex

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.416
and very dynamic interaction
between these four components.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.680
So it's very hard to find out
what's the role of each over time.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.616
This is where biorobots like Pleurobot
and mathematical models
