why not send in a robot
that can crawl around, swim, walk,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.416
with a camera onboard
to do inspection and identify survivors

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.216
and possibly create
a communication link with the survivor.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.816
BG: Of course, assuming the survivors
don't get scared by the shape of this.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.136
AI: Yeah, we should probably
change the appearance quite a bit,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.976
because here I guess a survivor
might die of a heart attack

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.536
just of being worried
that this would feed on you.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.416
But by changing the appearance
and it making it more robust,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.496
I'm sure we can make
a good tool out of it.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.806
BG: Thank you very much.
Thank you and your team.
