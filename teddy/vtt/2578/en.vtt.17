00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.816
For instance,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.416
when we stimulate at a low level,
we have the walking gait,

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.416
and at some point, if we stimulate a lot,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.600
very rapidly it switches
to the swimming gait.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.696
And finally, we can also
do turning very nicely

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.240
by just stimulating more one side
of the spinal cord than the other.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.816
And I think it's really beautiful

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.096
how nature has distributed control

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.976
to really give a lot of responsibility
to the spinal cord

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.656
so that the upper part of the brain
doesn't need to worry about every muscle.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.216
It just has to worry
about this high-level modulation,

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.816
and it's really the job of the spinal cord
to coordinate all the muscles.
