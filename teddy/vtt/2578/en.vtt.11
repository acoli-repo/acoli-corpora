00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.880
makes a complete switch
between two very different gaits.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.016
And in fact, the same
has been observed in cats.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.056
If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.296
you can switch between
walk, trot and gallop.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.056
Or in birds, you can make a bird
switch between walking,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.536
at a low level of stimulation,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.376
and flapping its wings
at high-level stimulation.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.416
And this really shows that the spinal cord

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.856
is a very sophisticated
locomotion controller.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.336
So we studied salamander locomotion
in more detail,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.456
and we had in fact access
to a very nice X-ray video machine

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.056
from Professor Martin Fischer
in Jena University in Germany.
