This is Pleurobot.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.016
Pleurobot is a robot that we designed
to closely mimic a salamander species

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.440
called Pleurodeles waltl.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.496
Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.560
and as you'll see later, it can also swim.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.471
So you might ask,
why did we design this robot?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.722
And in fact, this robot has been designed
as a scientific tool for neuroscience.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.896
Indeed, we designed it
together with neurobiologists

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.816
to understand how animals move,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.600
and especially how the spinal cord
controls locomotion.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.256
But the more I work in biorobotics,
