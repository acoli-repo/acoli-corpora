00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.536
that can generate, by themselves,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.296
very coordinated
rhythmic patterns of activity

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.696
while receiving
only very simple input signals.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.936
And these input signals

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.016
coming from descending modulation
from higher parts of the brain,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.736
like the motor cortex,
the cerebellum, the basal ganglia,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.896
will all modulate activity
of the spinal cord

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.376
while we do locomotion.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.616
But what's interesting is to what extent
just a low-level component,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.576
the spinal cord, together with the body,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.056
already solve a big part
of the locomotion problem.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.502
You probably know it by the fact
that you can cut the head off a chicken,

00:01:57.532 --> 00:01:58.913
it can still run for a while,

00:01:58.937 --> 00:02:01.476
showing that just the lower part,
spinal cord and body,
