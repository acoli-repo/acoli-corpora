00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.680
the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.616
So the salamander swims

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.136
by doing what's called
an anguilliform swimming gait,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.800
so they propagate a nice traveling wave
of muscle activity from head to tail.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.616
And if you place
the salamander on the ground,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.976
it switches to what's called
a walking trot gait.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.863
In this case, you have nice
periodic activation of the limbs

00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:50.496
which are very nicely coordinated

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.176
with this standing wave
undulation of the body,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.856
and that's exactly the gait
that you are seeing here on Pleurobot.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.856
Now, one thing which is very surprising
and fascinating in fact

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.016
is the fact that all this can be generated
just by the spinal cord and the body.
