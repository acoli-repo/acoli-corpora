00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.056
from Professor Martin Fischer
in Jena University in Germany.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.656
And thanks to that,
you really have an amazing machine

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.136
to record all the bone motion
in great detail.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.416
That's what we did.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.616
So we basically figured out
which bones are important for us

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.656
and collected their motion in 3D.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.376
And what we did is collect
a whole database of motions,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.056
both on ground and in water,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.564
to really collect a whole database
of motor behaviors

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:20.833
that a real animal can do.

00:06:20.858 --> 00:06:24.008
And then our job as roboticists
was to replicate that in our robot.

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:27.416
So we did a whole optimization process
to find out the right structure,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.096
where to place the motors,
how to connect them together,
