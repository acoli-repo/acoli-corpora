But the more I work in biorobotics,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.661
the more I'm really impressed
by animal locomotion.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.216
If you think of a dolphin swimming
or a cat running or jumping around,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.816
or even us as humans,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.656
when you go jogging or play tennis,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.920
we do amazing things.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.016
And in fact, our nervous system solves
a very, very complex control problem.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.136
It has to coordinate
more or less 200 muscles perfectly,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.840
because if the coordination is bad,
we fall over or we do bad locomotion.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.280
And my goal is to understand
how this works.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.000
There are four main components
behind animal locomotion.
