how it interacts with the body,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.040
and how the brain
communicates with the spinal cord.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.696
This is where the robots
and models that I've presented today

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.616
will hopefully play a key role

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.296
towards these very important goals.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.536
Thank you.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.120
(Applause)

Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen
in your lab other robots

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.216
that do things like swim in pollution

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.696
and measure the pollution while they swim.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.936
But for this one,
