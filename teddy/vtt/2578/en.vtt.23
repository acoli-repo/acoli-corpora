00:11:28.815 --> 00:11:33.495
saying don't underestimate to what extent
the body already helps locomotion.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.600
Now, how does this relate
to human locomotion?

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.600
Clearly, human locomotion is more complex
than cat and salamander locomotion,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.496
but at the same time, the nervous system
of humans is very similar

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.096
to that of other vertebrates.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.576
And especially the spinal cord

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.240
is also the key controller
for locomotion in humans.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.176
That's why, if there's a lesion
of the spinal cord,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.696
this has dramatic effects.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.496
The person can become
paraplegic or tetraplegic.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.896
This is because the brain
loses this communication
