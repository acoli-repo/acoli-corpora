WEBVTT

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.936
So for that we have a dry suit
that we put all over the robot --

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.056
(Laughter)

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.256
and then we can go in water
and start replaying the swimming gaits.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.616
And here, we were very happy,
because this is difficult to do.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.856
The physics of interaction are complex.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.296
Our robot is much bigger
than a small animal,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.376
so we had to do what's called
dynamic scaling of the frequencies

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.736
to make sure we had
the same interaction physics.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.176
But you see at the end,
we have a very close match,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.080
and we were very, very happy with this.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.696
So let's go to the spinal cord.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.016
So here what we did
with Jean-Marie Cabelguen

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.280
is model the spinal cord circuits.
