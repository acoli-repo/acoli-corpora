00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.680
which keeps the upper segment
and the lower segments always parallel.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.696
So a simple geometrical system
that kind of coordinates a bit

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.536
the internal movement of the segments.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.616
A second property of cat limbs
is that they are very lightweight.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.496
Most of the muscles are in the trunk,

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.416
which is a good idea,
because then the limbs have low inertia

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.216
and can be moved very rapidly.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.056
The last final important property is this
very elastic behavior of the cat limb,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.736
so to handle impacts and forces.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.096
And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.320
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.
