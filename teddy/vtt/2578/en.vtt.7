00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.896
and then gradually
go toward more complex locomotion,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.176
like in salamanders,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.696
but also in cats and in humans,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.920
in mammals.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.256
And here, a robot becomes
an interesting tool

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.216
to validate our models.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.256
And in fact, for me, Pleurobot
is a kind of dream becoming true.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.536
Like, more or less 20 years ago
I was already working on a computer

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.216
making simulations of lamprey
and salamander locomotion

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.776
during my PhD.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.176
But I always knew that my simulations
were just approximations.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.176
Like, simulating the physics in water
or with mud or with complex ground,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.856
it's very hard to simulate that
properly on a computer.
