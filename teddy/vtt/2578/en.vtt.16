00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.936
So what you see here
is a previous version of Pleurobot

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.056
that's completely controlled
by our spinal cord model

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.680
programmed on board of the robot.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.496
And the only thing we do

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.696
is send to the robot
through a remote control

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.216
the two descending signals
it normally should receive

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.840
from the upper part of the brain.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.176
And what's interesting is,
by playing with these signals,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.000
we can completely control
speed, heading and type of gait.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.816
For instance,
