The robot can be a wonderful
scientific tool as well.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.860
There are some very nice projects
where robots are used,

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:08.856
like a scientific tool for neuroscience,
for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.000
And this is exactly
the purpose of Pleurobot.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.536
So what we do in my lab
is to collaborate with neurobiologists

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.776
like Jean-Marie Cabelguen,
a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.840
and we want to make spinal cord models
and validate them on robots.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.096
And here we want to start simple.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.096
So it's good to start with simple animals

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.376
like lampreys, which are
very primitive fish,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.896
and then gradually
go toward more complex locomotion,
