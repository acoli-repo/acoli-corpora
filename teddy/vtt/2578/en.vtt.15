00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.280
is model the spinal cord circuits.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.176
And what's interesting
is that the salamander

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.820
has kept a very primitive circuit,

00:07:34.844 --> 00:07:37.496
which is very similar
to the one we find in the lamprey,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.496
this primitive eel-like fish,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.256
and it looks like during evolution,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.216
new neural oscillators
have been added to control the limbs,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.656
to do the leg locomotion.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.856
And we know where
these neural oscillators are

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.136
but what we did was to make
a mathematical model

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.776
to see how they should be coupled

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.736
to allow this transition
between the two very different gaits.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.320
And we tested that on board of a robot.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.880
And this is how it looks.
