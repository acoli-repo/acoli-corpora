There are four main components
behind animal locomotion.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.736
The first component is just the body,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.736
and in fact we should never underestimate

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.240
to what extent the biomechanics
already simplify locomotion in animals.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.376
Then you have the spinal cord,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.376
and in the spinal cord you find reflexes,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.856
multiple reflexes that create
a sensorimotor coordination loop

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360
between neural activity in the spinal cord
and mechanical activity.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.976
A third component
are central pattern generators.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.896
These are very interesting circuits
in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.536
that can generate, by themselves,
