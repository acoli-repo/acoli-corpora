00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.096
where to place the motors,
how to connect them together,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.000
to be able to replay
these motions as well as possible.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.040
And this is how Pleurobot came to life.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.616
So let's look at how close
it is to the real animal.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.456
So what you see here
is almost a direct comparison

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.176
between the walking
of the real animal and the Pleurobot.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.936
You can see that we have
almost a one-to-one exact replay

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.216
of the walking gait.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.840
If you go backwards and slowly,
you see it even better.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.896
But even better, we can do swimming.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.936
So for that we have a dry suit
that we put all over the robot --
