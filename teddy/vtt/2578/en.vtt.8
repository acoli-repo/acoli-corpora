00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.856
it's very hard to simulate that
properly on a computer.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.920
Why not have a real robot
and real physics?

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.736
So among all these animals,
one of my favorites is the salamander.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.216
You might ask why,
and it's because as an amphibian,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.096
it's a really key animal
from an evolutionary point of view.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.176
It makes a wonderful link
between swimming,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.096
as you find it in eels or fish,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.240
and quadruped locomotion,
as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.816
And in fact, the modern salamander

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.216
is very close to the first
terrestrial vertebrate,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.776
so it's almost a living fossil,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.736
which gives us access to our ancestor,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.680
the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.
