00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.896
This is because the brain
loses this communication

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.176
with the spinal cord.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.416
Especially, it loses
this descending modulation

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.360
to initiate and modulate locomotion.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.336
So a big goal of neuroprosthetics

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.736
is to be able to reactivate
that communication

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.200
using electrical or chemical stimulations.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.776
And there are several teams
in the world that do exactly that,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.016
especially at EPFL.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.536
My colleagues Grégoire Courtine
and Silvestro Micera,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.800
with whom I collaborate.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.056
But to do this properly,
it's very important to understand

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.816
how the spinal cord works,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.536
how it interacts with the body,
