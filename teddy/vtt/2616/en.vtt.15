00:07:26.444 --> 00:07:30.988
to try to understand and translate
the genome in a phenotype.

00:07:31.362 --> 00:07:34.702
What are those letters,
and what do they do?

00:07:34.726 --> 00:07:37.473
It's an approach that can
be used for everything,

00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:40.490
but using it in genomics
is particularly complicated.

00:07:40.514 --> 00:07:43.790
Little by little we grew and we wanted
to build different challenges.

00:07:43.814 --> 00:07:46.546
We started from the beginning,
from common traits.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.173
Common traits are comfortable
because they are common,

00:07:49.197 --> 00:07:50.381
everyone has them.

00:07:50.405 --> 00:07:52.899
So we started to ask our questions:

00:07:52.923 --> 00:07:54.303
Can we predict height?

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:57.162
Can we read the books
and predict your height?

00:07:57.186 --> 00:07:58.337
Well, we actually can,

00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:00.154
with five centimeters of precision.
