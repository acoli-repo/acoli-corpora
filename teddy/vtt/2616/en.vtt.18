00:08:58.123 --> 00:09:01.025
this October, we started
to see some signals.

00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:03.504
And it was a very emotional moment.

00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:07.273
What you see here is a subject
coming in our lab.

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:09.547
This is a face for us.

00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:13.202
So we take the real face of a subject,
we reduce the complexity,

00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:15.196
because not everything is in your face --

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.006
lots of features and defects
and asymmetries come from your life.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.499
We symmetrize the face,
and we run our algorithm.

00:09:23.245 --> 00:09:25.143
The results that I show you right now,

00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:28.539
this is the prediction we have
from the blood.

00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:31.120
