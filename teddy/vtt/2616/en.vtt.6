So I was thinking how
I could explain myself better

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:07.684
about how big and enormous this code is.

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:10.762
But there is -- I mean,
I'm going to have some help,

00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:14.013
and the best person to help me
introduce the code

00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:17.559
is actually the first man
to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:20.973
So welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.

00:03:20.997 --> 00:03:27.928

00:03:27.952 --> 00:03:30.208
Not the man in the flesh,
