WEBVTT

00:06:29.974 --> 00:06:31.344
with one mission:

00:06:31.368 --> 00:06:33.229
trying everything we can try

00:06:33.253 --> 00:06:36.012
and learning everything
we can learn from these books,

00:06:36.036 --> 00:06:37.741
with one target --

00:06:38.862 --> 00:06:41.663
making real the dream
of personalized medicine,

00:06:41.687 --> 00:06:45.454
understanding what things
should be done to have better health

00:06:45.478 --> 00:06:47.761
and what are the secrets in these books.

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:52.579
An amazing team, 40 data scientists
and many, many more people,

00:06:52.603 --> 00:06:53.953
a pleasure to work with.

00:06:53.977 --> 00:06:56.230
The concept is actually very simple.

00:06:56.254 --> 00:06:59.412
We're going to use a technology
called machine learning.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:03.975
On one side, we have genomes --
thousands of them.
