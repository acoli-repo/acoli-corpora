00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:32.116
and I realized that I actually
always knew a 3D printer.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.476
And everyone does.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.658
It was my mom.

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:35.683
(Laughter)

00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:38.121
My mom takes three elements:

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:42.118
a bit of information, which is between
my father and my mom in this case,

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:46.299
raw elements and energy
in the same media, that is food,

00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:48.831
and after several months, produces me.

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.667
And I was not existent before.

00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:54.453
So apart from the shock of my mom
discovering that she was a 3D printer,

00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:59.215
I immediately got mesmerized
by that piece,

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.956
the first one, the information.
