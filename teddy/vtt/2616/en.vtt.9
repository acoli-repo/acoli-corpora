00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:30.852
Let's get to a specific part.

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:32.933
Let me read it to you:

00:04:32.957 --> 00:04:33.978
(Laughter)

00:04:34.002 --> 00:04:38.008
"AAG, AAT, ATA."

00:04:38.965 --> 00:04:41.032
To you it sounds like mute letters,

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:45.097
but this sequence gives
the color of the eyes to Craig.

00:04:45.633 --> 00:04:47.565
I'll show you another part of the book.

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:49.683
This is actually a little
more complicated.

00:04:50.983 --> 00:04:53.630
Chromosome 14, book 132:

00:04:53.654 --> 00:04:55.744
(Laughter)

00:04:55.768 --> 00:04:57.045
As you might expect.

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.535
(Laughter)
