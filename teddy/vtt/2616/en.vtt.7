Not the man in the flesh,

00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:33.793
but for the first time in history,

00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:37.279
this is the genome of a specific human,

00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:41.063
printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter:

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:45.083
262,000 pages of information,

00:03:45.107 --> 00:03:49.471
450 kilograms, shipped
from the United States to Canada

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:54.338
thanks to Bruno Bowden,
Lulu.com, a start-up, did everything.

00:03:54.362 --> 00:03:55.825
It was an amazing feat.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.146
But this is the visual perception
of what is the code of life.
