00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.497
an amazing scientist, a woman,

00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:32.910
took a picture of it.

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:38.122
But it took us more than 40 years
to finally poke inside a human cell,

00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:39.748
take out this crystal,

00:02:39.772 --> 00:02:42.852
unroll it, and read it for the first time.

00:02:43.615 --> 00:02:46.856
The code comes out to be
a fairly simple alphabet,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.652
four letters: A, T, C and G.

00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:54.166
And to build a human,
you need three billion of them.

00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:56.112
Three billion.

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:57.715
How many are three billion?

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.501
It doesn't really make
any sense as a number, right?
