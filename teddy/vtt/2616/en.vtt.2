00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.956
the first one, the information.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.231
What amount of information does it take

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:05.191
to build and assemble a human?

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:06.789
Is it much? Is it little?

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:08.993
How many thumb drives can you fill?

00:01:09.017 --> 00:01:11.641
Well, I was studying physics
at the beginning

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:17.262
and I took this approximation of a human
as a gigantic Lego piece.

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:21.071
So, imagine that the building
blocks are little atoms

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:25.748
and there is a hydrogen here,
a carbon here, a nitrogen here.

00:01:25.772 --> 00:01:27.343
So in the first approximation,

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:31.710
if I can list the number of atoms
that compose a human being,
