For the next 16 minutes,
I'm going to take you on a journey

00:00:03.398 --> 00:00:06.484
that is probably
the biggest dream of humanity:

00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:08.523
to understand the code of life.

00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:11.815
So for me, everything started
many, many years ago

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.562
when I met the first 3D printer.

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:16.260
The concept was fascinating.

00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:18.306
A 3D printer needs three elements:

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.464
a bit of information, some
raw material, some energy,

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:25.822
and it can produce any object
that was not there before.

00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:28.654
I was doing physics,
I was coming back home

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:32.116
and I realized that I actually
always knew a 3D printer.
