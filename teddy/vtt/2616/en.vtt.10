00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.535
(Laughter)

00:05:02.857 --> 00:05:07.364
"ATT, CTT, GATT."

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:10.016
This human is lucky,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.557
because if you miss just
two letters in this position --

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.458
two letters of our three billion --

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:18.501
he will be condemned
to a terrible disease:

00:05:18.525 --> 00:05:19.965
cystic fibrosis.

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:23.402
We have no cure for it,
we don't know how to solve it,

00:05:23.426 --> 00:05:27.181
and it's just two letters
of difference from what we are.

00:05:27.585 --> 00:05:30.290
A wonderful book, a mighty book,
