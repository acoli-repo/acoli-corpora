00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:31.120
(Applause)

00:09:31.144 --> 00:09:32.579
Wait a second.

00:09:32.603 --> 00:09:37.295
In these seconds, your eyes are watching,
left and right, left and right,

00:09:37.319 --> 00:09:41.249
and your brain wants
those pictures to be identical.

00:09:41.273 --> 00:09:43.719
So I ask you to do
another exercise, to be honest.

00:09:43.743 --> 00:09:46.030
Please search for the differences,

00:09:46.054 --> 00:09:47.415
which are many.

00:09:47.439 --> 00:09:50.042
The biggest amount of signal
comes from gender,

00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:55.267
then there is age, BMI,
the ethnicity component of a human.

00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:59.002
And scaling up over that signal
is much more complicated.

00:09:59.026 --> 00:10:02.276
But what you see here,
even in the differences,
