00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:00.966
Southern European, Italians --
they never fit in models.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:06.120
And it's particular -- that ethnicity
is a complex corner case for our model.

00:12:06.144 --> 00:12:07.653
But there is another point.

00:12:07.677 --> 00:12:11.154
So, one of the things that we use
a lot to recognize people

00:12:11.178 --> 00:12:12.900
will never be written in the genome.

00:12:12.924 --> 00:12:15.241
It's our free will, it's how I look.

00:12:15.265 --> 00:12:18.494
Not my haircut in this case,
but my beard cut.

00:12:18.518 --> 00:12:22.071
So I'm going to show you, I'm going to,
in this case, transfer it --

00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:24.860
and this is nothing more
than Photoshop, no modeling --

00:12:24.884 --> 00:12:26.597
the beard on the subject.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:30.093
And immediately, we get
much, much better in the feeling.
