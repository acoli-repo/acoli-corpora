00:05:27.585 --> 00:05:30.290
A wonderful book, a mighty book,

00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:33.113
a mighty book that helped me understand

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:35.890
and show you something quite remarkable.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.915
Every one of you -- what makes
me, me and you, you --

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.893
is just about five million of these,

00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:45.145
half a book.

00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:47.678
For the rest,

00:05:47.702 --> 00:05:50.264
we are all absolutely identical.

00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:55.026
Five hundred pages
is the miracle of life that you are.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.581
The rest, we all share it.

00:05:57.605 --> 00:06:00.514
So think about that again
when we think that we are different.
