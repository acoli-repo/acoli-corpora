00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.622
But it is a particularly
complicated challenge,

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:37.644
because of all these books, as of today,

00:13:37.668 --> 00:13:40.310
we just know probably two percent:

00:13:41.027 --> 00:13:44.680
four books of more than 175.

00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:49.227
And this is not the topic of my talk,

00:13:50.145 --> 00:13:52.743
because we will learn more.

00:13:53.378 --> 00:13:56.047
There are the best minds
in the world on this topic.

00:13:57.048 --> 00:13:58.882
The prediction will get better,

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:01.159
the model will get more precise.
