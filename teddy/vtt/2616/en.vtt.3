00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:31.710
if I can list the number of atoms
that compose a human being,

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:33.121
I can build it.

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:35.174
Now, you can run some numbers

00:01:35.198 --> 00:01:38.475
and that happens to be
quite an astonishing number.

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:41.256
So the number of atoms,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.035
the file that I will save in my thumb
drive to assemble a little baby,

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:50.726
will actually fill an entire Titanic
of thumb drives --

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.468
multiplied 2,000 times.

00:01:53.957 --> 00:01:57.358
This is the miracle of life.

00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:59.994
Every time you see from now on
