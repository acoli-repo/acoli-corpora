00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:03.975
On one side, we have genomes --
thousands of them.

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:07.996
On the other side, we collected
the biggest database of human beings:

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.316
phenotypes, 3D scan, NMR --
everything you can think of.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.239
Inside there, on these two opposite sides,

00:07:15.263 --> 00:07:17.705
there is the secret of translation.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.201
And in the middle, we build a machine.

00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:23.186
We build a machine
and we train a machine --

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.420
well, not exactly one machine,
many, many machines --

00:07:26.444 --> 00:07:30.988
to try to understand and translate
the genome in a phenotype.
