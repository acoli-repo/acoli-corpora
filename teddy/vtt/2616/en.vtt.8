But this is the visual perception
of what is the code of life.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.648
And now, for the first time,
I can do something fun.

00:04:02.672 --> 00:04:05.219
I can actually poke inside it and read.

00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:09.868
So let me take an interesting
book ... like this one.

00:04:13.077 --> 00:04:15.611
I have an annotation;
it's a fairly big book.

00:04:15.635 --> 00:04:19.362
So just to let you see
what is the code of life.

00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:23.957
Thousands and thousands and thousands

00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:26.651
and millions of letters.

00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:29.071
And they apparently make sense.

00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:30.852
Let's get to a specific part.
