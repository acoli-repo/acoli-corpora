00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:01.724
in this vial of blood is the amount
of biological information

00:11:01.748 --> 00:11:04.025
that we need to do a full genome sequence.

00:11:04.049 --> 00:11:06.119
We just need this amount.

00:11:06.528 --> 00:11:09.733
We ran this sequence,
and I'm going to do it with you.

00:11:09.757 --> 00:11:13.736
And we start to layer up
all the understanding we have.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.110
In the vial of blood,
we predicted he's a male.

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:18.498
And the subject is a male.

00:11:18.996 --> 00:11:21.434
We predict that he's a meter and 76 cm.

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:23.850
The subject is a meter and 77 cm.

00:11:23.874 --> 00:11:27.984
So, we predicted that he's 76;
the subject is 82.

00:11:28.701 --> 00:11:31.333
We predict his age, 38.
