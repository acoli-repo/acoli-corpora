00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:31.666
Can we predict a human face?

00:08:33.014 --> 00:08:34.292
It's a little complicated,

00:08:34.316 --> 00:08:37.507
because a human face is scattered
among millions of these letters.

00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:40.160
And a human face is not
a very well-defined object.

00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:42.235
So, we had to build an entire tier of it

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:44.969
to learn and teach
a machine what a face is,

00:08:44.993 --> 00:08:47.030
and embed and compress it.

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:49.302
And if you're comfortable
with machine learning,

00:08:49.326 --> 00:08:51.610
you understand what the challenge is here.

00:08:52.108 --> 00:08:58.099
Now, after 15 years -- 15 years after
we read the first sequence --

00:08:58.123 --> 00:09:01.025
this October, we started
to see some signals.
