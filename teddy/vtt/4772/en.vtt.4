00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:00.803
400 tons of grain,

00:02:00.803 --> 00:02:03.470
10,000 jars of pickled fish,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.074
74 tons of drinking water,

00:02:06.074 --> 00:02:09.199
and 600 tons of wool.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.982
It would have carried well over
a thousand people on board,

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:15.393
including 600 soldiers.

00:02:15.393 --> 00:02:19.773
And it housed 20 horses 
in separate stalls.

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:21.430
To build something of this scale,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.132
only for that to sink 
on its maiden voyage?

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:26.107
Well, let's just say that failure

00:02:26.107 --> 00:02:29.432
wouldn't have been a pleasant 
option for Archimedes.

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:32.614
So he took on the problem: will it sink?
