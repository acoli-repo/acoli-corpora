Hundreds of workmen were to labor
for years on constructing the Syracusia

00:01:06.038 --> 00:01:09.728
out of beams of pine 
and fir from Mount Etna,

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:11.820
ropes from hemp grown in Spain,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.040
and pitch from France.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.379
The top deck, on which 
eight watchtowers were to stand,

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.621
was to be supported not by columns,

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:25.506
but by vast wooden images of Atlas
holding the world on his shoulders.

00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:27.053
On the ship's bow,

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:33.469
a massive catapult would be able 
to fire 180 pound stone missiles.
