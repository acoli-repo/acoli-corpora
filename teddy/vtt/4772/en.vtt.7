whatever is above the keel
will remain afloat above the waterline.

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:36.441
This sounds a lot like another story
involving Archimedes and a bathtub,

00:03:36.441 --> 00:03:39.691
and it's possible that's because
they're actually the same story,

00:03:39.691 --> 00:03:42.253
twisted by the vagaries of history.

00:03:42.253 --> 00:03:47.131
The classical story of Archimedes' Eureka!
and subsequent streak through the streets

00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:50.767
centers around a crown, 
or corona in Latin.

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:56.771
At the core of the Syracusia story
is a keel, or korone in Greek.

00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:58.951
Could one have been 
mixed up for the other?

00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:00.659
We may never know.
