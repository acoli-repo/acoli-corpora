00:02:58.243 --> 00:03:02.469
If it displaced 4,000 tons of water,
it would float with no problem.

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.895
Of course, if it only displaced 
1,000 tons of water,

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:09.752
well, Hieron wouldn't be too happy.

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:12.644
This is the law of buoyancy,

00:03:12.644 --> 00:03:16.085
and engineers still 
call it Archimedes' Principle.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:20.932
It explains why a steel supertanker
can float as easily as a wooden rowboat

00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:22.636
or a bathtub.

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:25.780
If the weight of water displaced
by the vessel below the keel

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.088
is equivalent to the vessel's weight,

00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:32.425
whatever is above the keel
will remain afloat above the waterline.
