00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:30.925
an engineering project 
of unprecedented scale.

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:33.010
Hieron commissioned a sailing vessel

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.219
50 times bigger than a standard
ancient warship,

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.759
named the Syracusia after his city.

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:42.745
Hieron wanted to construct
the largest ship ever,

00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:45.443
which was destined 
to be given as a present

00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:48.334
for Egypt's ruler, Ptolemy.

00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:51.845
But could a boat the size
of a palace possibly float?

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:55.752
In Archimedes's day, 
no one had attempted anything like this.

00:00:55.752 --> 00:00:58.994
It was like asking, "Can a mountain fly?"

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:01.895
King Hieron had a lot 
riding on that question.
