00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:32.614
So he took on the problem: will it sink?

00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:34.929
Perhaps he was sitting 
in the bathhouse one day,

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.853
wondering how a heavy bathtub can float,

00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:40.324
when inspiration came to him.

00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:44.952
An object partially immersed in a fluid
is buoyed up by a force

00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:49.711
equal to the weight of the fluid
displaced by the object.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:55.747
In other words, if a 2,000 ton Syracusia
displaced exactly 2,000 tons of water,

00:02:55.747 --> 00:02:58.243
it would just barely float.

00:02:58.243 --> 00:03:02.469
If it displaced 4,000 tons of water,
it would float with no problem.
