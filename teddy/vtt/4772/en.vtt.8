00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:00.659
We may never know.

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.507
On the day the Syracusia arrived in Egypt
on its first and only voyage,

00:04:05.507 --> 00:04:09.333
we can only imagine how residents
of Alexandria thronged the harbor

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:14.084
to marvel at the arrival 
of this majestic, floating castle.

00:04:14.084 --> 00:04:18.515
This extraordinary vessel was the Titanic
of the ancient world,

00:04:18.515 --> 00:04:23.240
except without the sinking,
thanks to our pal, Archimedes.
