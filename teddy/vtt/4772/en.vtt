When you think of 
Archimedes' "Eureka!" moment,

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.294
you probably think of this.

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:19.998
As it turns out, it may 
have been more like this.

00:00:19.998 --> 00:00:25.457
In the third century BC, Hieron,
king of the Sicilian city of Syracuse,

00:00:25.457 --> 00:00:26.907
chose Archimedes to supervise

00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:30.925
an engineering project 
of unprecedented scale.
