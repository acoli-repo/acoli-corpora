00:00:00.873 --> 00:00:02.817
Growing up in northern Wisconsin,

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:06.650
I've naturally developed a connection
to the Mississippi River.

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:08.341
When I was little,

00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:12.512
my sister and I would have contests
to see who could spell

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:16.250
"M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i" the fastest.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:18.679
When I was in elementary school,

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:23.244
I got to learn about the early explorers
and their expeditions,

00:00:23.268 --> 00:00:27.078
Marquette and Joliet, and how they used
the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River

00:00:27.102 --> 00:00:30.171
and its tributaries
to discover the Midwest,
