00:00:06.837 --> 00:00:12.949
London, 1928: a group of mold spores 
surf a breeze through a lab.

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.639
They drift onto a petri dish, 
and when they land,

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.550
they germinate a medical revolution.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.330
This lab belongs to Alexander Fleming, 
a Scottish scientist

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.643
investigating the properties 
of infectious bacteria.

00:00:25.643 --> 00:00:28.780
At this time, 
Fleming is away on vacation.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.690
When he returns, he finds 
a colony of mold growing on a petri dish
