The blocks are shredded
into tiny pieces,

00:03:32.183 --> 00:03:33.859
which are washed and melted,

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.896
so they become the raw materials
that can be used again.

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:42.038
As if by magic, bottle three
is now ready to be reborn

00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:44.486
as something completely new.

00:03:44.486 --> 00:03:47.908
For this bit of plastic
with such humble origins,

00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:50.902
suddenly the sky is the limit.
