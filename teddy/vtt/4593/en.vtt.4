He floats on a trickle 
that reaches a stream,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.558
a stream that flows into a river,

00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:06.674
and a river that reaches the ocean.

00:02:06.674 --> 00:02:08.465
After months lost at sea,

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:13.417
he's slowly drawn into a massive vortex,
where trash accumulates,

00:02:13.417 --> 00:02:17.722
a place known as 
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

00:02:17.722 --> 00:02:22.304
Here the ocean's currents have trapped
millions of pieces of plastic debris.

00:02:22.304 --> 00:02:27.342
This is one of five plastic-filled
gyres in the world's seas.

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:32.168
Places where the pollutants
turn the water into a cloudy plastic soup.
