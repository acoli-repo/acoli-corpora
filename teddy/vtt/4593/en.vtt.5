00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:32.168
Places where the pollutants
turn the water into a cloudy plastic soup.

00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:35.984
Some animals, like seabirds, 
get entangled in the mess.

00:02:35.984 --> 00:02:41.321
They, and others, mistake the brightly
colored plastic bits for food.

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:44.660
Plastic makes them feel full 
when they're not,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.581
so they starve to death

00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:50.343
and pass the toxins from the plastic
up the food chain.

00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:52.938
For example, it's eaten by lanternfish,

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:55.126
the lanternfish are eaten by squid,

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:57.114
the squid are eaten by tuna,

00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:00.133
and the tuna are eaten by us.
