00:00:29.688 --> 00:00:31.358
The plastic in their bodies

00:00:31.358 --> 00:00:35.692
was formed by chemically bonding 
oil and gas molecules together

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.495
to make monomers.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:43.112
In turn, these monomers were bonded
into long polymer chains to make plastic

00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:46.610
in the form of millions of pellets.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.692
Those were melted at manufacturing plants
and reformed in molds

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:55.228
to create the resilient material
that makes up the triplets' bodies.

00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:58.205
Machines filled the bottles
with sweet bubbily liquid

00:00:58.205 --> 00:01:02.288
and they were then wrapped, shipped,
bought, opened, consumed
