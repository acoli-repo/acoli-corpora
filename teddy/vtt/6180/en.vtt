Mark Miskin: This is a rotifer.

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:06.698
It's a microorganism
about a hair's width in size.

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:10.408
They live everywhere on earth --
saltwater, freshwater, everywhere --

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:12.673
and this one is out looking for food.

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.635
I remember the first time
I saw this thing,

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.389
I was like eight years old
and it completely blew me away.

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:20.676
I mean, here is this
incredible little creature,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.300
it's hunting, swimming,

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:23.589
going about its life,

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:27.063
but its whole universe fits
within a drop of pond water.

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:31.653
Paul McEuen: So this little rotifer
shows us something really amazing.
