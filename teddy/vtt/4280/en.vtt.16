00:07:59.564 --> 00:08:02.309
We are all, most of us, living to reach this point.

00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:04.197
You know, historically, we didn't do that.

00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:05.666
This is what happens to you

00:08:05.666 --> 00:08:08.189
when you live to be a great age,

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:10.078
and unfortunately, increasing longevity does mean

00:08:10.078 --> 00:08:12.005
more old age, not more youth.

00:08:12.005 --> 00:08:18.098
I'm sorry to say that. (Laughter)

00:08:18.098 --> 00:08:19.895
What we did, anyway, look, what we did,

00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:21.422
we didn't just take this lying down

00:08:21.422 --> 00:08:22.924
at John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere.

00:08:22.924 --> 00:08:24.546
We've started a whole series of projects

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:27.542
to try and look about whether we could, in fact, involve

00:08:27.542 --> 00:08:31.036
people much more in the way that things happen to them.
