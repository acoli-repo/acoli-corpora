00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:01.656
I actually think that,

00:12:01.656 --> 00:12:04.205
in places like Oregon,

00:12:04.205 --> 00:12:07.677
where you can have physician-assisted suicide,

00:12:07.677 --> 00:12:09.894
you take a poisonous dose of stuff,

00:12:09.894 --> 00:12:11.770
only half a percent of people ever do that.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.476
I'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent

00:12:14.476 --> 00:12:16.232
of people who don't want to do that.

00:12:16.232 --> 00:12:18.566
I think most people don't want to be dead,

00:12:18.566 --> 00:12:20.663
but I do think most people want to have some control

00:12:20.663 --> 00:12:23.405
over how their dying process proceeds.

00:12:23.405 --> 00:12:24.545
So I'm an opponent of euthanasia,

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:27.198
but I do think we have to give people back some control.

00:12:27.198 --> 00:12:30.671
It deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply.
