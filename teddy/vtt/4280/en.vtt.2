00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.138
starts pretty early in the piece.

00:01:00.138 --> 00:01:02.252
Anyway, the second thing I want to say about dying in the

00:01:02.252 --> 00:01:04.617
21st century, apart from it's going to happen to everybody,

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:07.233
is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.578
for most of us,

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:12.547
unless we do something to try and reclaim this process

00:01:12.547 --> 00:01:16.264
from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on.

00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:18.072
So there you go. That's the truth.

00:01:18.072 --> 00:01:19.503
No doubt that will piss you off, and now let's see

00:01:19.503 --> 00:01:22.479
whether we can set you free. I don't promise anything.

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.062
Now, as you heard in the intro, I work in intensive care,

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:28.166
and I think I've kind of lived through the heyday

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.173
of intensive care. It's been a ride, man.
