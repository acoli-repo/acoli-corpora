Why can't we have these kinds of conversations

00:10:30.849 --> 00:10:32.170
with our own elders

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.960
and people who might be approaching this?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.794
There are a couple of things you can do.

00:10:36.794 --> 00:10:38.925
One of them is, you can,

00:10:38.925 --> 00:10:41.839
just ask this simple question. This question never fails.

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:45.594
"In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself,

00:10:45.594 --> 00:10:48.527
who would you like to speak for you?"

00:10:48.527 --> 00:10:50.441
That's a really important question to ask people,

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.464
because giving people the control over who that is

00:10:52.464 --> 00:10:55.772
produces an amazing outcome.

00:10:55.772 --> 00:10:56.918
The second thing you can say is,

00:10:56.918 --> 00:10:58.416
"Have you spoken to that person

00:10:58.416 --> 00:11:00.336
about the things that are important to you
