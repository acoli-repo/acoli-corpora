00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.759
The ones you may know most about are the ones

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.605
that are becoming increasingly of historical interest:

00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:35.022
sudden death.

00:06:35.022 --> 00:06:36.467
It's quite likely in an audience this size

00:06:36.467 --> 00:06:39.018
this won't happen to anybody here.

00:06:39.018 --> 00:06:40.748
Sudden death has become very rare.

00:06:40.748 --> 00:06:43.203
The death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff

00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:44.876
just doesn't happen anymore.

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:47.293
The dying process of those with terminal illness

00:06:47.293 --> 00:06:48.325
that we've just seen

00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:49.940
occurs to younger people.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.790
By the time you've reached 80, this is unlikely to happen to you.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.205
Only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer.

00:06:56.205 --> 00:07:01.040
The big growth industry are these.
