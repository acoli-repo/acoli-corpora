00:10:58.416 --> 00:11:00.336
about the things that are important to you

00:11:00.336 --> 00:11:04.490
so that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do?"

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.012
So that's the little idea.

00:11:07.012 --> 00:11:08.506
The big idea, I think, is more political.

00:11:08.506 --> 00:11:10.457
I think we have to get onto this.

00:11:10.457 --> 00:11:13.519
I suggested we should have Occupy Death.

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:16.304
(Laughter)

00:11:16.304 --> 00:11:18.874
My wife said, "Yeah, right, sit-ins in the mortuary.

00:11:18.874 --> 00:11:21.453
Yeah, yeah. Sure." (Laughter)

00:11:21.453 --> 00:11:23.318
So that one didn't really run,

00:11:23.318 --> 00:11:24.988
but I was very struck by this.

00:11:24.988 --> 00:11:26.701
Now, I'm an aging hippie.

00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:29.198
I don't know, I don't think I look like that anymore, but

00:11:29.198 --> 00:11:31.698
I had, two of my kids were born at home in the '80s
