What we know is that obviously we are all going to die,

00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:34.678
but how we die is actually really important,

00:05:34.678 --> 00:05:38.233
obviously not just to us, but also to how that

00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:41.367
features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards.

00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:43.688
How we die lives on in the minds of everybody

00:05:43.688 --> 00:05:46.805
who survives us, and

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:50.537
the stress created in families by dying is enormous,

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:53.223
and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying

00:05:53.223 --> 00:05:55.960
in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.038
so dying in intensive care is not your top option

00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:01.496
if you've got a choice.
