00:09:59.545 --> 00:10:01.338
that's where we all want to end up,

00:10:01.338 --> 00:10:03.474
particularly as we become older and increasingly frail

00:10:03.474 --> 00:10:07.128
and ICU has less and less and less to offer us.

00:10:07.128 --> 00:10:09.458
There has to be a little side road

00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:13.933
off there for people who don't want to go on that track.

00:10:13.933 --> 00:10:16.569
And I have one small idea,

00:10:16.569 --> 00:10:21.018
and one big idea about what could happen.

00:10:21.018 --> 00:10:22.079
And this is the small idea.

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:24.860
The small idea is, let's all of us

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.796
engage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated.

00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:30.849
Why can't we have these kinds of conversations
