Jim was 94. (Laughter)

00:04:06.737 --> 00:04:09.271
And I realized that something wasn't happening here.

00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:10.595

that I imagined was happening.

00:04:13.248 --> 00:04:16.255
So a group of us started doing survey work,

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:18.475

residents in Newcastle, in the Newcastle area,

00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:24.762
and discovered that only one in a hundred of them

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:27.827

00:04:27.827 --> 00:04:28.966
One in a hundred.

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:32.307
And only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do
