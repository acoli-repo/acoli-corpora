00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:01.496
if you've got a choice.

00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:03.665
And, if that wasn't bad enough, of course,

00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:06.313
all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that

00:06:06.313 --> 00:06:08.665
many of you, in fact, about one in 10 of you at this point,

00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:10.115
will die in intensive care.

00:06:10.115 --> 00:06:11.449
In the U.S., it's one in five.

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.199
In Miami, it's three out of five people die in intensive care.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.264
So this is the sort of momentum

00:06:17.264 --> 00:06:19.552
that we've got at the moment.

00:06:19.552 --> 00:06:22.097
The reason why this is all happening is due to this,

00:06:22.097 --> 00:06:23.399
and I do have to take you through what this is about.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.364
These are the four ways to go.

00:06:25.364 --> 00:06:28.229
So one of these will happen to all of us.

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.759
The ones you may know most about are the ones
