00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.173
of intensive care. It's been a ride, man.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.373
This has been fantastic.

00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:32.528
We have machines that go ping.

00:01:32.528 --> 00:01:34.838
There's many of them up there.

00:01:34.838 --> 00:01:37.582
And we have some wizard technology which I think

00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:40.094
has worked really well, and over the course of the time

00:01:40.094 --> 00:01:42.166
I've worked in intensive care, the death rate

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.536
for males in Australia has halved,

00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:46.155
and intensive care has had something to do with that.

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:48.163
Certainly, a lot of the technologies that we use

00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:50.383
have got something to do with that.

00:01:50.383 --> 00:01:52.887
So we have had tremendous success, and we kind of

00:01:52.887 --> 00:01:55.241
got caught up in our own success quite a bit,

00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:58.865
and we started using expressions like "lifesaving."

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:00.999
I really apologize to everybody for doing that,
