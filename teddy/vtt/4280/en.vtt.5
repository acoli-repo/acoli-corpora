00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.340
in quite the way we did then.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.215
So what's happening now is there's been a big shift

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:35.022
in the way that people die,

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:37.293
and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable

00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:40.119
to what we can do as what it used to be like

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:44.030
when I was doing this in the '80s and '90s.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.894
So we kind of got a bit caught up with this,

00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:49.927
and we haven't really squared with you guys about

00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:53.982
what's really happening now, and it's about time we did.

00:02:53.982 --> 00:02:57.373
I kind of woke up to this bit in the late '90s

00:02:57.373 --> 00:02:59.467
when I met this guy.

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:03.824
This guy is called Jim, Jim Smith, and he looked like this.
