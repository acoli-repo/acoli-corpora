00:09:29.316 --> 00:09:31.289
all of those wishes came true, as it were.

00:09:31.289 --> 00:09:33.269
We were able to make that happen for them.

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:35.519
But then, when the funding ran out,

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.604
we went back to look six months later,

00:09:37.604 --> 00:09:39.871
and everybody had stopped again,

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.064
and nobody was having these conversations anymore.

00:09:43.064 --> 00:09:45.117
So that was really kind of heartbreaking for us,

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:47.834
because we thought this was going to really take off.

00:09:47.834 --> 00:09:51.805
The cultural issue had reasserted itself.

00:09:51.805 --> 00:09:52.960
So here's the pitch:

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.046
I think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway

00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:59.545
to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not

00:09:59.545 --> 00:10:01.338
that's where we all want to end up,
