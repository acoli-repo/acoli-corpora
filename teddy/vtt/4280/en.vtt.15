00:07:28.972 --> 00:07:31.222
and frailty's an inevitable part of aging,

00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:33.775
and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing

00:07:33.775 --> 00:07:34.824
that people die of now,

00:07:34.824 --> 00:07:36.952
and the last few years, or the last year of your life

00:07:36.952 --> 00:07:40.967
is spent with a great deal of disability, unfortunately.

00:07:40.967 --> 00:07:44.351
Enjoying it so far? (Laughs)

00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:47.504
(Laughter)

00:07:47.504 --> 00:07:50.932

00:07:50.932 --> 00:07:56.090
(Laughter)

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.149
What can I say that's positive? What's positive is

00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:59.564
that this is happening at very great age, now.

00:07:59.564 --> 00:08:02.309
We are all, most of us, living to reach this point.
