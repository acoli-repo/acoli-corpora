You can see his bones through the skin.

00:03:30.123 --> 00:03:31.661
He's very, very thin,

00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:35.043
and he is, indeed, very sick with pneumonia,

00:03:35.043 --> 00:03:36.524
and he's too sick to talk to me,

00:03:36.524 --> 00:03:41.674
so I talk to his daughter Kathleen, and I say to her,

00:03:41.674 --> 00:03:44.638
"Did you and Jim ever talk about

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:46.321
what you would want done

00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:48.335
if he ended up in this kind of situation?"

00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:52.064
And she looked at me and said, "No, of course not!"

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:57.124
I thought, "Okay. Take this steady."

00:03:57.124 --> 00:03:59.968
And I got talking to her, and after a while, she said to me,

00:03:59.968 --> 00:04:02.971
"You know, we always thought there'd be time."
