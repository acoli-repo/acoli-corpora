people much more in the way that things happen to them.

00:08:31.036 --> 00:08:32.268
But we realized, of course, that we are dealing

00:08:32.268 --> 00:08:34.612
with cultural issues,

00:08:34.612 --> 00:08:36.471
and this is, I love this Klimt painting,

00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:38.676
because the more you look at it, the more you kind of get

00:08:38.676 --> 00:08:40.695
the whole issue that's going on here,

00:08:40.695 --> 00:08:44.213
which is clearly the separation of death from the living,

00:08:44.213 --> 00:08:46.093
and the fear — Like, if you actually look,

00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:47.268
there's one woman there

00:08:47.268 --> 00:08:49.187
who has her eyes open.

00:08:49.187 --> 00:08:50.872
She's the one he's looking at,

00:08:50.872 --> 00:08:54.100
and [she's] the one he's coming for. Can you see that?

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.626
She looks terrified.

00:08:55.626 --> 00:08:57.319
It's an amazing picture.

00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:59.540
Anyway, we had a major cultural issue.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.524
Clearly, people didn't want us to talk about death,
