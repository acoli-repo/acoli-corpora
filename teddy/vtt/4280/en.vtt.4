00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:00.999
I really apologize to everybody for doing that,

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:02.229
because obviously, we don't.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.757
What we do is prolong people's lives,

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.858
and delay death,

00:02:06.858 --> 00:02:09.703
and redirect death, but we can't, strictly speaking,

00:02:09.703 --> 00:02:12.558
save lives on any sort of permanent basis.

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:14.543
And what's really happened over the period of time

00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:17.182
that I've been working in intensive care is that

00:02:17.182 --> 00:02:20.752
the people whose lives we started saving back in the '70s,

00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:25.230
'80s, and '90s, are now coming to die in the 21st century

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.830
of diseases that we no longer have the answers to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.340
in quite the way we did then.
