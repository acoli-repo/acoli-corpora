00:06:56.205 --> 00:07:01.040
The big growth industry are these.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.291
What you die of is increasing organ failure,

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:06.526
with your respiratory, cardiac, renal,

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.306
whatever organs packing up. Each of these

00:07:08.306 --> 00:07:10.909
would be an admission to an acute care hospital,

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:12.878
at the end of which, or at some point during which,

00:07:12.878 --> 00:07:15.054
somebody says, enough is enough, and we stop.

00:07:15.054 --> 00:07:17.622
And this one's the biggest growth industry of all,

00:07:17.622 --> 00:07:20.197
and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room

00:07:20.197 --> 00:07:22.759
will die in this form, which is

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.653
the dwindling of capacity

00:07:26.653 --> 00:07:28.972
with increasing frailty,

00:07:28.972 --> 00:07:31.222
and frailty's an inevitable part of aging,
