This guy is called Jim, Jim Smith, and he looked like this.

00:03:03.824 --> 00:03:06.127
I was called down to the ward to see him.

00:03:06.127 --> 00:03:08.372
His is the little hand.

00:03:08.372 --> 00:03:09.758
I was called down to the ward to see him

00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:10.852
by a respiratory physician.

00:03:10.852 --> 00:03:13.028
He said, "Look, there's a guy down here.

00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:14.628
He's got pneumonia,

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:17.133
and he looks like he needs intensive care.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.207
His daughter's here and she wants everything possible

00:03:19.207 --> 00:03:21.738
to be done."

00:03:21.738 --> 00:03:24.357
Which is a familiar phrase to us.

00:03:24.357 --> 00:03:26.188
So I go down to the ward and see Jim,

00:03:26.188 --> 00:03:27.873
and his skin his translucent like this.

00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:30.123
You can see his bones through the skin.
