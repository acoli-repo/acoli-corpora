00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.524
Clearly, people didn't want us to talk about death,

00:09:01.524 --> 00:09:03.019
or, we thought that.

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:04.966
So with loads of funding from the Federal Government

00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:06.386
and the local Health Service, we introduced a thing

00:09:06.386 --> 00:09:09.284
at John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices.

00:09:09.284 --> 00:09:12.133
We trained hundreds of people to go to the wards

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:15.276
and talk to people about the fact that they would die,

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:17.562
and what would they prefer under those circumstances.

00:09:17.562 --> 00:09:21.081
They loved it. The families and the patients, they loved it.

00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:23.541
Ninety-eight percent of people really thought

00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:24.995
this just should have been normal practice,

00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:27.378
and that this is how things should work.

00:09:27.378 --> 00:09:29.316
And when they expressed wishes,

00:09:29.316 --> 00:09:31.289
all of those wishes came true, as it were.
