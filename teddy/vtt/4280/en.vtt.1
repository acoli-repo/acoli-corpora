00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.659
is that all of us are, in fact, going to die

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:31.733
in the 21st century.

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.123
There will be no exceptions to that.

00:00:34.123 --> 00:00:36.780
There are, apparently, about one in eight of you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.304
who think you're immortal, on surveys, but --

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:41.482
(Laughter)

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:46.095
Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen.

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:47.748
While I give this talk, in the next 10 minutes,

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:51.244
a hundred million of my cells will die,

00:00:51.244 --> 00:00:53.838
and over the course of today, 2,000 of my brain cells

00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:55.979
will die and never come back,

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.060
so you could argue that the dying process

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.138
starts pretty early in the piece.
