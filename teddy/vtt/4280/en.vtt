00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:02.601
Look, I had second thoughts, really,

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.636
about whether I could talk about this

00:00:04.636 --> 00:00:07.676
to such a vital and alive audience as you guys.

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:10.266
Then I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem,

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.905
which goes,

00:00:11.905 --> 00:00:13.836
"The truth will set you free,

00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:17.795

00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:22.187
So with that in mind, I'm going to set about

00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:23.778
trying to do those things here,

00:00:23.778 --> 00:00:25.640
and talk about dying in the 21st century.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.040
Now the first thing that will piss you off, undoubtedly,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.659
is that all of us are, in fact, going to die
