Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.640
It shows how to do right,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.374
how to be heroically awkward.

00:04:37.374 --> 00:04:40.124
It is also an expression of faith

00:04:40.124 --> 00:04:43.649
in the political machine as a force of honor.

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:47.132
Shortly after "Mr. Smith" became a FILMCLUB classic,

00:04:47.132 --> 00:04:51.798
there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords.

00:04:51.798 --> 00:04:53.082
And it was with great delight

00:04:53.082 --> 00:04:55.733
that we found young people up and down the country

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:57.566
explaining with authority

00:04:57.566 --> 00:04:59.582
what filibustering was

00:04:59.582 --> 00:05:05.099
and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle.
