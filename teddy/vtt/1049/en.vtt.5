00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.198
with kids in age groups between five and 18

00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:33.230
watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.114
The films were curated and contextualized.

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:37.865
But the choice was theirs,

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:39.681
and our audience quickly grew

00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:43.914
to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide.

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.713
The outcome, immediate.

00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:52.299
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind.

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.631
In groups as large as 150 and as small as three,

00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:58.347
these young people discovered new places,

00:02:58.347 --> 00:03:00.264
new thoughts, new perspectives.
