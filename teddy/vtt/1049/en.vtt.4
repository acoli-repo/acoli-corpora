WEBVTT

00:01:57.364 --> 00:02:01.399
an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.481
followed by discussions.

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:07.214
If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film,

00:02:07.214 --> 00:02:09.282
maybe we could build a narrative

00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:10.830
that would deliver meaning

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.913
to the fragmented and restless world of the young.

00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:15.516
Given the access to technology,

00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:19.247
even a school in a tiny rural hamlet

00:02:19.247 --> 00:02:22.948
could project a DVD onto a white board.

00:02:22.948 --> 00:02:24.782
In the first nine months

00:02:24.782 --> 00:02:27.130
we ran 25 clubs across the U.K.,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.198
with kids in age groups between five and 18
