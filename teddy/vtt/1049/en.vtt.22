00:10:58.492 --> 00:11:00.060
We guessed that film,

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.059
whose stories are a meeting place

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:04.288
of drama, music, literature and human experience,

00:11:04.288 --> 00:11:08.793
would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.325
What we could not have foreseen

00:11:10.325 --> 00:11:11.958
was the measurable improvements

00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.676
in behavior, confidence and academic achievement.

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:19.958
Once-reluctant students now race to school, talk to their teachers,

00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.443
fight, not on the playground,

00:11:21.443 --> 00:11:23.576
but to choose next week's film --

00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:27.162
young people who have found self-definition, ambition

00:11:27.162 --> 00:11:31.409
and an appetite for education and social engagement
