00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:00.639
across national boundaries,

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:03.507
in as many languages, genres and philosophies

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:04.757
as one can imagine.

00:01:04.757 --> 00:01:07.389
Indeed, it is hard to find a subject

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:09.406
that film has yet to tackle.

00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:11.057
During the last decade

00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:13.473
we've seen a vast integration of global media,

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.857
now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster.

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:19.273
We are increasingly offered a diet

00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:22.757
in which sensation, not story, is king.

00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:25.190
What was common to us all 40 years ago --

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.989
the telling of stories between generations --

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:30.074
is now rarified.
