WEBVTT

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:30.074
is now rarified.

00:01:30.074 --> 00:01:32.322
As a filmmaker, it worried me.

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:36.189
As a human being, it puts the fear of God in me.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.606
What future could the young build

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:39.973
with so little grasp

00:01:39.973 --> 00:01:41.757
of where they've come from

00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:44.815
and so few narratives of what's possible?

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:46.463
The irony is palpable;

00:01:46.463 --> 00:01:49.964
technical access has never been greater,

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:53.031
cultural access never weaker.

00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:57.364
And so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB,

00:01:57.364 --> 00:02:01.399
an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools
