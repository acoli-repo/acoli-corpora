00:02:58.347 --> 00:03:00.264
new thoughts, new perspectives.

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:02.398
By the time the pilot had finished,

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:05.231
we had the names of a thousand schools

00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:09.050
that wished to join.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.671
The film that changed my life

00:03:10.671 --> 00:03:15.638
is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan."

00:03:15.638 --> 00:03:17.391
It's a remarkable comment

00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:20.721
on slums, poverty and aspiration.

00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:24.955
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's 50th birthday.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:28.917
Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema,

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.894
find and pay for the print and the projectionist.
