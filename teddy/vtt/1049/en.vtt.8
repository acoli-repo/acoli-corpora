00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:02.399
Sixty years after the film was made

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.600
and 30 years after I first saw it,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.150
I see young faces tilt up in awe,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.418
their incredulity matching mine.

00:04:09.418 --> 00:04:11.916
And the speed with which they associate it

00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:15.540
with "Slumdog Millionaire" or the favelas in Rio

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.488
speaks to the enduring nature.

00:04:18.488 --> 00:04:21.605
In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government,

00:04:21.605 --> 00:04:23.521
we screened "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."

00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:29.940
Made in 1939, the film is older than most of our members' grandparents.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.081
Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.
