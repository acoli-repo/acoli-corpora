Today I'm going to unpack for you

00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:05.401
three examples of iconic design,

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:06.686
and it makes perfect sense

00:00:06.686 --> 00:00:09.375
that I should be the one to do it

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.302
because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature.

00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:14.648
(Laughter)

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:16.071
But I'm also a famous

00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:18.132
minor television personality

00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:20.202
and an avid collector of

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:21.778
Design Within Reach catalogs,

00:00:21.778 --> 00:00:24.085
so I pretty much know

00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:25.605
everything there is.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:26.976
Now, I'm sure you

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:28.311
recognize this object;

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:30.005
many of you probably saw it
