00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.239
I'll just start talking
about the 17th century.

00:00:02.263 --> 00:00:03.976
I hope nobody finds that offensive.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.976
I -- you know, when I --
after I had invented PCR,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.976
I kind of needed a change.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.976
And I moved down to La Jolla
and learned how to surf.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.976
And I started living down there
on the beach for a long time.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.976
And when surfers are out waiting

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.976
for waves,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.976
you probably wonder, if you've never
been out there, what are they doing?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.976
You know, sometimes there's a 10-,
15-minute break out there

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
when you're waiting for a wave to come in.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.024
They usually talk about the 17th century.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.976
You know, they get a real
bad rap in the world.
