00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.175
Now, these are golden words

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:03.154
coming from someone who is speaking about

00:05:03.154 --> 00:05:05.573
their own experience,

00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:07.949
but when someone is telling you

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.342
how you are going to feel,

00:05:10.342 --> 00:05:12.388
it's instant crap.

00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:15.292
The only reason I did not kill him

00:05:15.292 --> 00:05:17.283
with my bare hands

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:21.378
was because I could not lift my right arm.

00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:25.596
But I did say a really bad word to him,

00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:28.497
followed by a regular word, that —

00:05:28.497 --> 00:05:29.720
(Laughter) —

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.238
made my husband say, "She's on narcotics."
