00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:30.211
because I'll see somebody go

00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.428
"Oh, I know it's this one."

00:02:32.428 --> 00:02:34.892
And then I'll move or I'll 
gesture and they'll go,

00:02:34.892 --> 00:02:37.445
"No, it's that one."

00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:39.616
So now you know.

00:02:39.616 --> 00:02:41.753
I learned a lot being a patient,

00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:43.275
and one of the surprising things was

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:47.382
that only a small part of the cancer experience

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:49.474
is about medicine.

00:02:49.474 --> 00:02:53.827
Most of it is about feelings and faith

00:02:53.827 --> 00:02:56.460
and losing and finding your identity

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.038
and discovering strength

00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:01.960
and flexibility you never even knew you had.
