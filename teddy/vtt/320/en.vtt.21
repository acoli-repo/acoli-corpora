00:10:25.128 --> 00:10:30.070
The confronting, not so much.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.064
One of the other things that I loved

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.522
about being a chaplain was

00:10:34.522 --> 00:10:38.995
seeing patients a year, or even several years

00:10:38.995 --> 00:10:40.836
after their treatment, because

00:10:40.836 --> 00:10:43.536
it was just really cool to see 
how they had changed

00:10:43.536 --> 00:10:45.752
and how their lives had evolved

00:10:45.752 --> 00:10:47.642
and what had happened to them.

00:10:47.642 --> 00:10:50.162
So I was thrilled one day

00:10:50.162 --> 00:10:52.610
to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.191
from a patient who I had seen the year before,

00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:58.665
and she was there with her two adult daughters,

00:10:58.665 --> 00:11:02.924
who I also knew, for her one year follow-up exam.
