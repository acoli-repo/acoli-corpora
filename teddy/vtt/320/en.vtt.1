00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:30.370
And what I'm wondering

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.659
is, of those three things,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.649
is any one of them

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.673
surviving some kind of trauma?

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:46.370
Cancer survivor, rape survivor,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.487
Holocaust survivor, incest survivor.

00:00:51.487 --> 00:00:54.931
Ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves

00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.462
by our wounds?

00:00:57.462 --> 00:01:01.938
And where I have seen this survivor identity
