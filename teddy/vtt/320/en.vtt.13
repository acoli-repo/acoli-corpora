00:06:27.194 --> 00:06:31.316
the way to cope with trauma, with loss,

00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:33.741
with any life-changing experience,

00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.891
is to find meaning.

00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:38.128
But here's the thing:

00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:39.795
No one can tell us

00:06:39.795 --> 00:06:42.531
what our experience means.

00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:45.820
We have to decide what it means.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.952
And it doesn't have to be some gigantic,

00:06:47.952 --> 00:06:49.959
extroverted meaning.

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.470
We don't all have to start a foundation

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.622
or an organization or write a book

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:57.502
or make a documentary.

00:06:57.502 --> 00:07:00.449
Meaning can be quiet
