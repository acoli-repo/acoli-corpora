00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:04.592
But we all know that with any resurrection story,

00:14:04.592 --> 00:14:07.220
you have to die first.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.043
The Christian story,

00:14:09.043 --> 00:14:12.315
Jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb

00:14:12.315 --> 00:14:14.810
before he was resurrected.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.648
And I believe that for us,

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:18.780
being in the tomb

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.766
means doing our own deep inner work

00:14:22.766 --> 00:14:25.470
around our wounds

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.943
and allowing ourselves to be healed.

00:14:29.943 --> 00:14:33.000
We have to let that crucified self die
