00:03:55.572 --> 00:04:00.090
We can talk about cancer and
we can support one another.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.176
But sometimes, it feels

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.574
like people go a little overboard

00:04:04.574 --> 00:04:09.779
and they start telling us how we're going to feel.

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:13.322
So about a week after my surgery,

00:04:13.322 --> 00:04:16.202
we had a houseguest.

00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:18.950
That was probably our first mistake.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.471
And keep in mind that

00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:22.141
at this point in my life

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:25.763
I had been a chaplain for over 20 years,

00:04:25.763 --> 00:04:28.086
and issues like dying and death

00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:29.642
and the meaning of life,

00:04:29.642 --> 00:04:32.820
these are all things I'd been 
yakking about forever.
