00:03:28.227 --> 00:03:30.195
as my identity,

00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:33.814
but, boy, are there powerful forces

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:37.360
pushing me to do just that.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.678
Now, don't, please, misunderstand me.

00:03:41.678 --> 00:03:43.637
Cancer organizations

00:03:43.637 --> 00:03:45.617
and the drive for early screening

00:03:45.617 --> 00:03:48.271
and cancer awareness and cancer research

00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:50.386
have normalized cancer,

00:03:50.386 --> 00:03:51.710
and this is a wonderful thing.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.794
We can now talk about cancer

00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:55.572
without whispering.

00:03:55.572 --> 00:04:00.090
We can talk about cancer and
we can support one another.
