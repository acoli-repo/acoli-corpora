00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.326
I received the news that I had breast cancer.

00:01:35.326 --> 00:01:37.959
My mother and I can be competitive —

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.747
(Laughter) —

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:44.179
but I was really not trying to
compete with her on this one.

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.204
And in fact, I thought, well,

00:01:46.204 --> 00:01:48.139

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:49.860

00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:54.068
But this is what I heard from 
a lot of outraged people.

00:01:54.068 --> 00:01:55.530
What?

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.450
You're the chaplain.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.740
You should be immune.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.817
Like, maybe I should have just gotten off
