00:00:57.462 --> 00:01:01.938
And where I have seen this survivor identity

00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:04.426
have the most consequences

00:01:04.426 --> 00:01:06.979
is in the cancer community.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.713
And I've been around this 
community for a long time,

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:12.907
because I've been a hospice 
and a hospital chaplain

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:16.204
for almost 30 years.

00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:21.937
And in 2005, I was working at a big cancer center

00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:24.242
when I received the news that

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:27.677
my mother had breast cancer.

00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:29.859
And then five days later,

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.326
I received the news that I had breast cancer.
