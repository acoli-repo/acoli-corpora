00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
When my brother called me in December of 1998,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
he said, "The news does not look good."

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is him on the screen.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
He'd just been diagnosed with ALS,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It paralyzes you. It starts by killing

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the motor neurons in your spinal cord.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And you go from being a healthy,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
robust 29-year-old male

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to someone that cannot breathe,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
cannot move, cannot speak.
