00:03:58.123 --> 00:04:01.877
what if we could design a hospital
that flips the hallways on the outside,

00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.219
and makes people walk in the exterior?

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:06.612
If mechanical systems rarely work,

00:04:06.636 --> 00:04:09.219
what if we could design a hospital
that could breathe

00:04:09.243 --> 00:04:11.119
through natural ventilation,

00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:14.285
and meanwhile reduce
its environmental footprint?

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:16.865
And what about the patients' experience?

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.205
Evidence shows
that a simple view of nature

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.388
can radically improve health outcomes,

00:04:21.752 --> 00:04:23.814
So why couldn't we design a hospital

00:04:23.838 --> 00:04:26.551
where every patient
had a window with a view?

00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:31.987
Simple, site-specific designs
can make a hospital that heals.
