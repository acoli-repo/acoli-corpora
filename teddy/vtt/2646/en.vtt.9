00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:31.987
Simple, site-specific designs
can make a hospital that heals.

00:04:32.764 --> 00:04:34.547
Designing it is one thing;

00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:36.797
getting it built, we learned,
is quite another.

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:40.303
We worked with Bruce Nizeye,

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:41.840
a brilliant engineer,

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.988
and he thought about
construction differently

00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:45.868
than I had been taught in school.

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.782
When we had to excavate
this enormous hilltop

00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:51.741
and a bulldozer was expensive
and hard to get to site,

00:04:51.765 --> 00:04:54.285
Bruce suggested doing it by hand,

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:57.983
using a method in Rwanda called "Ubudehe,"

00:04:58.007 --> 00:05:00.556
which means "community works
for the community."
