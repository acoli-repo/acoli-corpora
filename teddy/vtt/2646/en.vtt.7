00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:30.255
to help us build and design
hospitals that allow us to heal?

00:03:32.486 --> 00:03:34.126
That following summer,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.952
I was in the back of a Land Rover
with a few classmates,

00:03:36.976 --> 00:03:40.457
bumping over the mountainous
hillside of Rwanda.

00:03:40.964 --> 00:03:44.933
For the next year, I'd be living in Butaro
in this old guesthouse,

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:48.154
which was a jail after the genocide.

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:52.888
I was there to design and build
a new type of hospital

00:03:52.912 --> 00:03:55.106
with Dr. Farmer and his team.

00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:58.099
If hallways are making patients sicker,

00:03:58.123 --> 00:04:01.877
what if we could design a hospital
that flips the hallways on the outside,
