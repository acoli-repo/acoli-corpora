00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:30.097
we used the mud and the dirt
and the wood around us

00:08:30.121 --> 00:08:31.785
to construct a center

00:08:31.809 --> 00:08:36.557

00:08:37.526 --> 00:08:39.131
Even here in the US,

00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:40.418

in which we as humans all communicate,

00:08:53.907 --> 00:08:55.826
both verbally and nonverbally.

00:08:57.729 --> 00:09:00.263
