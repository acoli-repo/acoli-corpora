00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.068
the building process
we learned about in Rwanda.

00:13:31.562 --> 00:13:34.106
We wondered if we could fill
those very columns

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:38.029
with the soil from the sites
of where these killings occurred.

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:42.382
Brian and his team have begun
collecting that soil

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.724
and preserving it in individual jars

00:13:45.748 --> 00:13:49.207
with family members, community
leaders and descendants.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.992
The act of collecting soil itself

00:13:54.148 --> 00:13:56.818
has lead to a type of spiritual healing.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.032
It's an act of restorative justice.
