In this hospital in South Africa,

00:03:01.577 --> 00:03:03.761
patients that came in
with, say, a broken leg,

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:06.381
to wait in this unventilated hallway,

00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:10.932
walked out with a multidrug-resistant
strand of tuberculosis.

00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:14.918
Simple designs for infection control
had not been thought about,

00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:17.460
and people had died because of it.

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:21.164
"Where are the architects?" Paul said.

00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:23.693
If hospitals are making people sicker,

00:03:23.717 --> 00:03:25.621
where are the architects and designers

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:30.255
to help us build and design
hospitals that allow us to heal?
