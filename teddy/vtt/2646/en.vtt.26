00:12:56.973 --> 00:13:00.772
But these are temporary columns,
waiting in purgatory,

00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:04.619
to be placed in the very counties
where these lynchings occurred.

00:13:06.124 --> 00:13:08.496
Over the next few years,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.506
this site will bear witness,

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.298
as each of these markers is claimed

00:13:13.322 --> 00:13:15.581
and visibly placed in those counties.

00:13:16.258 --> 00:13:21.426
Our nation will begin to heal
from over a century of silence.

00:13:23.799 --> 00:13:25.852
When we think about
how it should be built,

00:13:25.876 --> 00:13:28.676
we were reminded of Ubudehe,

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.068
the building process
we learned about in Rwanda.
