Buildings are not simply
expressive sculptures.

00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:07.117
They make visible our personal
and our collective aspirations

00:15:07.141 --> 00:15:08.298
as a society.

00:15:09.177 --> 00:15:12.417
Great architecture can give us hope.

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:15.536
Great architecture can heal.

00:15:16.478 --> 00:15:17.695
Thank you very much.

00:15:17.719 --> 00:15:24.990
