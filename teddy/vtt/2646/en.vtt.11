Bruce was using
the process of building to heal,

00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:34.956
not just for those who were sick,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.678
but for the entire community as a whole.

00:05:39.086 --> 00:05:43.941
We call this the locally fabricated
way of building, or "lo-fab,"

00:05:43.965 --> 00:05:46.321
and it has four pillars:

00:05:46.984 --> 00:05:48.158
hire locally,

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:49.617
source regionally,

00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:51.531
train where you can

00:05:51.555 --> 00:05:53.119
and most importantly,

00:05:53.143 --> 00:05:56.705
think about every design decision
as an opportunity

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.645
to invest in the dignity
of the places where you serve.
