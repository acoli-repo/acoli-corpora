And even in Poughkeepsie, my hometown,

00:09:00.986 --> 00:09:03.826
we thought about old
industrial infrastructure.

00:09:04.196 --> 00:09:05.473
We wondered:

00:09:05.497 --> 00:09:10.060
Could we use arts and culture
and design to revitalize this city

00:09:10.084 --> 00:09:12.706
and other Rust Belt cities
across our nation,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.694
and turn them into centers
for innovation and growth?

00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:19.550
In each of these projects,
we asked a simple question:

00:09:20.045 --> 00:09:22.224
What more can architecture do?

00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:24.606
And by asking that question,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.372
we were forced to consider
how we could create jobs,

00:09:28.396 --> 00:09:30.807
how we could source regionally
