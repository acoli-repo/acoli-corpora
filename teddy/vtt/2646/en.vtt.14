and they formed them into this thick wall,

00:07:02.444 --> 00:07:06.434
made only in this place
with rocks from this soil.

00:07:08.107 --> 00:07:12.208
When you go outside today
and you look at your built world,

00:07:12.973 --> 00:07:14.154
ask not only:

00:07:14.178 --> 00:07:17.404
"What is the environmental footprint?" --
an important question --

00:07:17.428 --> 00:07:18.702
but what if we also asked,

00:07:18.726 --> 00:07:22.382
"What is the human handprint
of those who made it?"

00:07:23.427 --> 00:07:27.071
We started a new practice
based around these questions,

00:07:27.095 --> 00:07:29.644
and we tested it around the world.
