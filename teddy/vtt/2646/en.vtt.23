00:11:28.656 --> 00:11:31.677
the many markers that have
been placed all over the city

00:11:31.701 --> 00:11:34.145
to the history of the Confederacy,

00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:38.396
and the very few that mark
the history of slavery.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.247
And then he walked me to a hill.

00:11:40.828 --> 00:11:42.330
It overlooked the whole city.

00:11:42.934 --> 00:11:45.164
He pointed out the river
and the train tracks

00:11:45.188 --> 00:11:47.883
where the largest domestic
slave-trading port in America

and proclaimed, "Segregation forever."

00:11:56.205 --> 00:11:58.056
And then to the very hill below us.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.397

a new memorial
