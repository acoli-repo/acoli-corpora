00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:32.118
Scraping and re-scraping,
painting and repainting:

00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:35.632
the work of an old house
is never meant to be done.

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.921
The day my father turned 52,
I got a phone call.

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:42.367
My mother was on the line

00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:46.129
to tell me that doctors had found
a lump in his stomach --

00:00:46.153 --> 00:00:48.172
terminal cancer, she told me,

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:50.790
and he had been given
only three weeks to live.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.790
I immediately moved home
to Poughkeepsie, New York,

00:00:55.814 --> 00:00:58.222
to sit with my father on death watch,

00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:00.638
not knowing what the next days
would bring us.
