00:04:58.007 --> 00:05:00.556
which means "community works
for the community."

00:05:01.082 --> 00:05:04.406
Hundreds of people came
with shovels and hoes,

00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:06.795
and we excavated that hill

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:10.428
in half the time and half
the cost of that bulldozer.

00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:14.268
Instead of importing furniture,
Bruce started a guild,

00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:16.699
and he brought in
master carpenters to train others

00:05:16.723 --> 00:05:18.477
in how to make furniture by hand.

00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:20.071
And on this job site,

00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:23.584
15 years after the Rwandan genocide,

00:05:24.326 --> 00:05:27.931
Bruce insisted that we bring on
labor from all backgrounds,

00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:29.867
and that half of them be women.
