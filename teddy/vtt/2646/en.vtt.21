00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.049
and, of course, Rwanda,

00:10:31.073 --> 00:10:34.145
have found it necessary to build memorials

00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:37.008
to reflect on the atrocities
of their past,

00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:40.020
in order to heal their national psyche.

00:10:40.044 --> 00:10:43.212
We have yet to do this
in the United States.

00:10:44.679 --> 00:10:51.314
So I sent a cold email
to info@equaljusticeintiative.org:

00:10:51.338 --> 00:10:53.287
"Dear Bryan," it said,

00:10:54.102 --> 00:10:55.738
"I think your building project

00:10:55.762 --> 00:10:58.717
is maybe the most important
project we could do in America

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.731
and could change the way
we think about racial injustice.
