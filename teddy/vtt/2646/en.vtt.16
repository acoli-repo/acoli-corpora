00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:00.386
in the world.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.733
Using a simple strategy
to be replicated nationally,

00:08:03.757 --> 00:08:05.977
we designed a birthing center

00:08:06.001 --> 00:08:08.309
that would attract women
and their attendants

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:12.166
to come to the hospital earlier
and therefore have safer births.

00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:14.243
Or in the Congo, where we asked

00:08:14.267 --> 00:08:16.515
if an educational center
could also be used

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:18.721
to protect endangered wildlife.

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:20.330
Poaching for ivory and bushmeat

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:23.901
is leading to global epidemic,
disease transfer and war.

00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:27.147
In one of the hardest-to-reach
places in the world,

00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:30.097
we used the mud and the dirt
and the wood around us
