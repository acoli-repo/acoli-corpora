00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:00.638
not knowing what the next days
would bring us.

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:02.896
To keep myself distracted,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.674
I rolled up my sleeves,

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:08.603
and I went about finishing
what he could now no longer complete --

00:01:08.627 --> 00:01:11.019
the restoration of our old home.

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.707
When that looming three-week deadline came

00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.889
and then went,

00:01:15.913 --> 00:01:17.544
he was still alive.

00:01:17.904 --> 00:01:19.386
And at three months,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.576
he joined me.

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:23.576
We gutted and repainted the interior.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.894
At six months, the old windows
were refinished,

00:01:26.918 --> 00:01:28.213
and at 18 months,

00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:30.886
the rotted porch was finally replaced.
