Every weekend for as long
as I can remember,

00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:07.953
my father would get up on a Saturday,

00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:10.443
put on a worn sweatshirt

00:00:11.163 --> 00:00:12.318
and he'd scrape away

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:15.165
at the squeaky old wheel
of a house that we lived in.

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.469
I wouldn't even call it restoration;

00:00:17.493 --> 00:00:19.428
it was a ritual, catharsis.

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:23.266
He would spend all year
scraping paint with this old heat gun

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.534
and a spackle knife,

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.635
and then he would repaint
where he scraped,

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.028
only to begin again the following year.

00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:32.118
Scraping and re-scraping,
painting and repainting:
