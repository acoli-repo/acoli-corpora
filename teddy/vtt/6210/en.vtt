Simone George: I met Mark
when he was just blind.

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:07.389
I had returned home to live in Dublin

00:00:07.413 --> 00:00:10.815
after the odyssey that was my 20s,

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.156
educating my interest in human rights
and equality in university,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.380
traveling the world,
like my nomad grandmother.

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.514
And during a two-year stint
working in Madrid,

00:00:22.538 --> 00:00:26.283
dancing many nights
till morning in salsa clubs.

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:30.887
When I met Mark, he asked me
to teach him to dance.
