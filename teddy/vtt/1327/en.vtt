00:00:00.883 --> 00:00:04.863
This is our life with bees,

00:00:04.863 --> 00:00:08.586
and this is our life without bees.

00:00:08.586 --> 00:00:11.054
Bees are the most important pollinators

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:13.863
of our fruits and vegetables and flowers

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:17.522
and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:20.210
More than one third of the world's crop production

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.992
is dependent on bee pollination.

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:25.829
But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.746
pollinating our food intentionally.

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:31.617
They're out there because they need to eat.
