As a matter of fact,

00:00:02.015 --> 00:00:05.287
I was trying to think about my career
since I left the White House,

00:00:05.287 --> 00:00:09.583
and the best example I have is a cartoon
in The New Yorker a couple of years ago.

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:11.742
This little boy is looking up
at his father,

00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:15.787
and he says, "Daddy, when I grow up,
I want to be a former president."

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:17.477
(Laughter)

00:00:17.477 --> 00:00:21.193
Well, I have had a great blessing
as a former president,

00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:23.620
because I have had an access

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.277
that very few other people
in the world have ever had

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:29.923
to get to know so many people
around this whole universe.

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:33.545
Not only am I familiar
with the 50 states in the United States,
