Left untreated,

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:05.389
anxiety in early childhood
can lead to depression by adolescence.

00:05:06.146 --> 00:05:10.512
It can also contribute
to substance abuse and to suicidality.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:14.239
My parents were not therapists.

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:16.166
They didn't know any psychologists.

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:22.572
All they knew is that these situations
may have been uncomfortable for me,

00:05:22.596 --> 00:05:24.185
but they were not harmful.

00:05:25.112 --> 00:05:30.380
My excessive anxiety would harm me
more over the long term
