00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.647
and by adolescence, one in 12 youths
are severely impaired

00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:07.815
in their ability to function at home,
in school and with peers.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.628
These kids are so frightened,

00:03:11.652 --> 00:03:12.808
worried,

00:03:12.832 --> 00:03:16.371
literally physically uncomfortable
due to their anxiety.

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:19.985
It's difficult for them
to pay attention in school,

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:21.620
relax and have fun,

00:03:21.644 --> 00:03:22.797
make friends

00:03:22.821 --> 00:03:25.319
and do all the things
that kids should be doing.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.454
Anxiety can create misery for the child,

00:03:29.478 --> 00:03:34.276
and the parents are front and center
in witnessing their child's distress.
