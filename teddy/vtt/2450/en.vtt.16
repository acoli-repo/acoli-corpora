00:08:00.628 --> 00:08:01.788
What do you do?

00:08:02.646 --> 00:08:08.075
The natural parenting instinct
is to comfort that child, soothe them,

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:10.928
protect them and fix the situation.

00:08:12.164 --> 00:08:16.779
Calling the teacher to intervene
or the other parents to arrange playdates,

00:08:16.803 --> 00:08:18.984
that may be fine at age five.

00:08:19.359 --> 00:08:24.517
But what do you do if your child
keeps coming home day after day in tears?

00:08:25.182 --> 00:08:30.006
Do you still fix things for them
at age eight, 10, 14?
