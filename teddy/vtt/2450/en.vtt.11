00:05:25.112 --> 00:05:30.380
My excessive anxiety would harm me
more over the long term

00:05:30.404 --> 00:05:33.720
if they let me avoid
and escape these situations

00:05:33.744 --> 00:05:37.496
and not learn how to tolerate
occasional distress.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.706
So in essence, mom and dad were doing
their own homegrown version

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.307
of exposure therapy,

00:05:44.236 --> 00:05:47.528
which is the central and key component

00:05:47.552 --> 00:05:50.426
of cognitive behavioral
treatment for anxiety.

00:05:51.446 --> 00:05:56.450
My colleagues and I conducted
the largest randomized controlled study

00:05:56.474 --> 00:06:00.426
of the treatments of anxiety
in children ages seven to 17.
