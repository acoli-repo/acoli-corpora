problem-solving skills,

00:09:30.518 --> 00:09:33.792
including the ability
to resolve conflicts with others;

00:09:34.631 --> 00:09:36.523
delay of gratification,

00:09:36.547 --> 00:09:38.775
or the ability to keep your efforts going

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:42.387
despite the fact that you have
to wait over time to see what happens.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.361
These and many other skills
are developing in children

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:48.523
who take risks and engage.

00:09:49.325 --> 00:09:52.455
And self-efficacy takes shape,

00:09:52.479 --> 00:09:55.863
which, simply put,
is the belief in oneself

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:59.306
that you can overcome
challenging situations.
