00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.101
and each day, I'd go into school crying
and come home crying,

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:08.428
to which my mother would give me an update
from some cardinal or bishop

00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:11.810
to "Keep her going to school
while we find her a spot."

00:02:12.714 --> 00:02:14.612
Was I naive or what?

00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:15.842
(Laughter)

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:20.180
Well, after a couple of weeks,
one day, while waiting for the school bus,

00:02:20.204 --> 00:02:22.332
I met a girl named Debbie,

00:02:22.356 --> 00:02:24.426
and she introduced me to her friends.

00:02:25.222 --> 00:02:27.680
And they became my friends,

00:02:27.704 --> 00:02:30.207
and, well, the Pope was off the hook.
