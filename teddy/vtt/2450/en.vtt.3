00:01:29.168 --> 00:01:30.855
My parents listened

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:35.972
and told me that they would investigate
with the monsignor back in New York,

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:40.133
but that I had to keep going in each day
so I'd have the attendance record

00:01:40.157 --> 00:01:42.893
to transfer to ninth grade
on Staten Island.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.952
All of this was before
email and cell phones,

00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:50.731
so over the next several weeks,

00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:56.589
supposedly, there were letters being sent
between the Archdiocese of Manhattan

00:01:56.613 --> 00:01:57.858
and Miami

00:01:57.882 --> 00:01:59.575
and with the Vatican,

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.101
and each day, I'd go into school crying
and come home crying,
