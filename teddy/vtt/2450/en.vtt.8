00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.044

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.655
while we waited for you
to get used to the situation

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.206
with time and with more experience.

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:19.780
You had to get vaccinated.

00:04:19.804 --> 00:04:21.526
You had to go to school."

00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:35.328
They were also inoculating me
from a lifetime of anxiety disorders.
