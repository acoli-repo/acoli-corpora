I was all fight-or-flight back then,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.683
and holding me down for a simple vaccine
took three or four adults,

00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:36.307
including my parents.

00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:41.553

00:00:41.577 --> 00:00:43.801
just as I was starting high school,

00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:46.356

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.533

00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:49.849

00:00:49.873 --> 00:00:51.744

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:55.637
a teacher takes roll and calls out
"Anne Marie Albano,"

00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:58.236
to which I respond,
[In a Staten Island accent] "Here!"

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.940
She laughs and says,
"Oh, precious, stand up.
