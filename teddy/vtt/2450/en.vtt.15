00:07:26.776 --> 00:07:30.915
well-meaning parents
are often inadvertently drawn into

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:32.660
the cycle of anxiety.

00:07:33.361 --> 00:07:36.798
They give in, and they make
too many accommodations for their child,

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:41.287
and they let their children
escape challenging situations.

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:44.055
I want you to think about it like this:

00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:48.920
Your child comes into the house
to you crying, in tears.

00:07:48.944 --> 00:07:51.191
They're five or six years of age.

00:07:51.215 --> 00:07:54.134
"Nobody at school likes me!
These kids are mean.

00:07:54.158 --> 00:07:55.941
No one would play with me."

00:07:57.023 --> 00:07:59.509
How do you feel seeing
your child so upset?
