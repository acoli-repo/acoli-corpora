are effective for
60 percent of treated youth.

00:06:14.962 --> 00:06:20.349
And their combination gets 80 percent
of kids well within three months.

00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.698
This is all good news.

00:06:22.722 --> 00:06:24.845
And if they stay on the medication

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:28.742
or do monthly exposure treatments
as we did in the length of the study,

00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:31.347
they could stay well
for upwards of a year.
