00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:05.856
For kids with anxiety
who escape and avoid these situations

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.732
and get other people to do them for them,

00:10:08.756 --> 00:10:11.809
they become more and more
anxious with time

00:10:11.833 --> 00:10:14.455
while less confident in themselves.

00:10:15.328 --> 00:10:19.368
Contrary to their peers
who don't suffer with anxiety,

00:10:19.392 --> 00:10:24.239
they come to believe that they are
incapable of managing these situations.

00:10:24.768 --> 00:10:28.631
They think that they need someone,
someone like their parents,

00:10:28.655 --> 00:10:30.214
to do things for them.
