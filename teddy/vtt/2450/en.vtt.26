We teach parents now
to be mindful in the moment

00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:07.420
and think about their reaction
to their child's anxiety.

00:13:08.613 --> 00:13:10.138
We ask them,

00:13:10.162 --> 00:13:14.220
"Look at the situation and ask,
'What is this situation at hand?

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.121
How threatening is it to my child?

00:13:17.145 --> 00:13:20.120
And what do I ultimately
want them to learn from it?'"

00:13:20.812 --> 00:13:23.904
Now of course, we want parents
to listen very carefully,

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:27.847
because if a child is being bullied
seriously or put in harm's way,

00:13:27.871 --> 00:13:29.448
we want parents to intervene,

00:13:29.472 --> 00:13:30.761
absolutely.
