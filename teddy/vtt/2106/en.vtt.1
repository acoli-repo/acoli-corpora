for the city to create a shared vision for its future.

00:00:31.774 --> 00:00:33.245
I come to this work

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:35.062
as an architect and an urban planner,

00:00:35.062 --> 00:00:37.668

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.556
Washington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey.

00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:56.187
Now by 2010, as well,

00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:58.202
popular design magazines were also beginning

00:00:58.202 --> 00:01:00.915
to take a closer look at cities like Detroit,
