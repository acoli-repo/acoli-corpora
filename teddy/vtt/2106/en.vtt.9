00:04:27.986 --> 00:04:30.336
Many tell us that they're one of only a few homes

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.879
on their block that are occupied,

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.486
and that they can see several abandoned homes

00:04:35.486 --> 00:04:37.733
from where they sit on their porches.

00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:42.072
Citywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes.

00:04:42.072 --> 00:04:45.087
They can also see vacant property.

00:04:45.087 --> 00:04:46.944
They're beginning to see illegal activities

00:04:46.944 --> 00:04:49.168
on these properties, like illegal dumping,

00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:53.473
and they know that because the city
has lost so much population,

00:04:53.473 --> 00:04:58.640
their costs for water, electricity, gas are rising,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.472
because there are not enough people
to pay property taxes
