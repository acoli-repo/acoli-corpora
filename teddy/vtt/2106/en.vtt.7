00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.311
for many the first piece of property
that they would ever know,

00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.174
and a community with other first-time

00:03:32.174 --> 00:03:34.303
African-American home buyers.

00:03:34.303 --> 00:03:36.683
The first couple of decades of their life in the North

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.727
is quite well, up until about 1950,

00:03:39.727 --> 00:03:42.335

00:03:54.408 --> 00:03:57.343
the region grows by 30 percent.

00:03:57.343 --> 00:03:59.242
