00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:32.158
a sense of hopefulness that our profession

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:35.076
could play a role in helping the city to think about

00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:39.140
how it would recover from its severe crisis.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.412
So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon

00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:43.093
and tell you a little bit about our process

00:01:43.093 --> 00:01:45.769
for fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit,

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:48.883
and I want to do that through
the voices of Detroiters.

00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:54.880
It's just after a special mayoral election,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.921
and word has gotten out that there is going to be

00:01:56.921 --> 00:01:58.465
this citywide planning process,

00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:00.814
which brings a lot of anxiety and fears
