00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:00.814
which brings a lot of anxiety and fears

00:02:00.814 --> 00:02:02.597
among Detroiters.

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:06.842
We had planned to hold a number
of community meetings in rooms like this

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:09.226
to introduce the planning process,

00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:11.222
and people came out from all over the city,

00:02:11.222 --> 00:02:14.073
including areas that were stable neighborhoods,

00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:15.849
as well as areas that were beginning to see

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.843
a lot of vacancy.

00:02:17.843 --> 00:02:19.941
And most of our audience was representative

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:22.494
of the 82 percent African-American population

00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:24.759
in the city at that time.

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:28.247
So obviously, we have a Q&amp;A portion of our program,

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:31.144
and people line up to mics to ask questions.
