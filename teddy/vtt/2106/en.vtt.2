00:00:58.202 --> 00:01:00.915
to take a closer look at cities like Detroit,

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:04.552
and devoting whole issues to "fixing the city."

00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:06.928
I was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein,

00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:08.903
to do an interview for the October issue

because obviously, it's completely absurd

00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:25.565
that a single person, let alone a planner,

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:27.023
could save a city.

00:01:27.023 --> 00:01:29.524
But I'm also smiling because I thought it represented

00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:32.158
a sense of hopefulness that our profession
