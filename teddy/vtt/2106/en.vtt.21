WEBVTT

00:10:27.507 --> 00:10:30.523
by using surface lakes and retention ponds,

00:10:30.523 --> 00:10:32.283
that created neighborhood amenities,

00:10:32.283 --> 00:10:33.975
places of recreation,

00:10:33.975 --> 00:10:35.792
and actually helped to elevate

00:10:35.792 --> 00:10:37.479
adjacent property levels.

00:10:37.479 --> 00:10:39.339
Or we could use it as research plots,

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:42.647
where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils,

00:10:42.647 --> 00:10:46.613
or we could use it to generate energy.

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:49.811
So the descendants of the Great Migration

00:10:49.811 --> 00:10:53.055
could either become precision
watchmakers at Shinola,

00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:56.366
like Willie H., who was featured
in one of their ads last year,

00:10:56.366 --> 00:10:58.758
or they can actually grow a business

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:01.483
that would service companies like Shinola.
