00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.311
return to the way that their
grandparents had found them.

00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:03.754
Now there's been a lot of speculation since 2010

00:06:03.754 --> 00:06:06.430
about what to do with the vacant property,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.150
and a lot of that speculation has
been around community gardening,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.382
or what we call urban agriculture.

00:06:11.382 --> 00:06:12.960
So many people would say to us,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.668
"What if you just take all that vacant land
and you could make it farmland?

00:06:15.668 --> 00:06:17.771
It can provide fresh foods,

00:06:17.771 --> 00:06:20.476
and it can put Detroiters back to work too."

00:06:20.476 --> 00:06:21.921
When I hear that story,

00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:24.537
I always imagine the folks from the Great Migration

00:06:24.537 --> 00:06:26.791
rolling over in their graves,

00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:30.108
because you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice
