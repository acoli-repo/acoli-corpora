00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:01.483
that would service companies like Shinola.

00:11:01.483 --> 00:11:03.485
The good news is, there is a future

00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:06.044
for the next generation of Detroiters,

00:11:06.044 --> 00:11:09.208
both those there now and those that want to come.

00:11:09.208 --> 00:11:11.339
So no thank you, Mayor Menino,

00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:12.982
who recently was quoted as saying,

00:11:12.982 --> 00:11:15.597
"I'd blow up the place and start over."

00:11:15.597 --> 00:11:17.948
There are very important people,

00:11:17.948 --> 00:11:20.349
business and land assets in Detroit,

00:11:20.349 --> 00:11:22.145
and there are real opportunities there.

00:11:22.145 --> 00:11:24.768
So while Detroit might not be what it was,

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:26.387
Detroit will not die.

00:11:26.387 --> 00:11:28.410
Thank you.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.838
