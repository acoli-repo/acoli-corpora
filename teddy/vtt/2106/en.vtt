00:00:00.544 --> 00:00:03.571
By 2010, Detroit had become the poster child

00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:05.712
for an American city in crisis.

00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:07.584
There was a housing collapse,

00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:09.542
an auto industry collapse,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:12.094
and the population had plummeted by 25 percent

00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:14.516
between 2000 and 2010,

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:16.733
and many people were beginning to write it off,

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:20.459
as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities.

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:22.846
By 2010, I had also been asked by

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:25.046
the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:28.300
to join them in leading a citywide planning process

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.774
for the city to create a shared vision for its future.
