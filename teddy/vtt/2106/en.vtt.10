00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.472
because there are not enough people
to pay property taxes

00:05:01.482 --> 00:05:04.816
to help support the services that they need.

00:05:04.816 --> 00:05:09.069
Citywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels.

00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:11.067
Now, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale,

00:05:11.067 --> 00:05:12.417
because I know that sounds like a big number,

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:14.955
but I don't think you quite understand
until you look at the city map.

00:05:14.955 --> 00:05:17.661
So the city is 139 square miles.

00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:19.707
You can fit Boston, San Francisco,

00:05:19.707 --> 00:05:21.267
and the island of Manhattan

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:22.943
within its footprint.

00:05:22.943 --> 00:05:25.333
So if we take all of that vacant
and abandoned property

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:27.529
and we smush it together,

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.365
it looks like about 20 square miles,

00:05:29.365 --> 00:05:31.333
and that's roughly equivalent to the size
