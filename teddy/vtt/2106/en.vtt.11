WEBVTT

00:05:29.365 --> 00:05:31.333
and that's roughly equivalent to the size

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:33.040
of the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.490
at 22 square miles.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.090
So it's a lot of vacancy.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.266
Now some of our audience members

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:42.384
also tell us about some of the positive things

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.429
that are happening in their communities,

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:46.016
and many of them are banding together

00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:48.122
to take control of some of the vacant lots,

00:05:48.122 --> 00:05:49.991
and they're starting community gardens,

00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:52.666
which are creating a great sense
of community stewardship,

00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:54.661
but they're very, very clear to tell us

00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:56.452
that this is not enough,

00:05:56.452 --> 00:05:57.958
that they want to see their neighborhoods

00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.311
return to the way that their
grandparents had found them.
