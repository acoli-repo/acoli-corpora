00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Planetary systems outside our own

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but whose streets we can't walk.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
By studying those twinkling lights though,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we can learn about how stars and planets interact

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to form their own ecosystem

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and make habitats that are amenable to life.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In this image of the Tokyo skyline,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I've hidden data

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the Kepler Mission.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Can you see it?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There we go.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at,
