00:00:00.964 --> 00:00:04.501
I’m a middle child,
and I was born leaning in.

00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:06.003
For as long as I can remember,

00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:10.274
I've had this insatiable desire
to compete, to accomplish

00:00:10.274 --> 00:00:11.808
and to prove myself.

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:14.478
My energy isn’t easily contained,

00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:17.147
and I've been called
by both men and women

00:00:17.147 --> 00:00:19.983
intense, high-octane,

00:00:19.983 --> 00:00:21.718
aggressive.

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:24.588
These words don't feel
like compliments to me.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.691
I try to control my eagerness.

00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:30.093
I try to be softer.
