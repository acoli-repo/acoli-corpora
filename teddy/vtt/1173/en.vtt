00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:03.111
Everyone is both a learner

00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:04.623
and a teacher.

00:00:04.623 --> 00:00:07.079
This is me being inspired

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:08.270
by my first tutor,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.215
my mom,

00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:11.838
and this is me teaching

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:13.791
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:15.031
to 200 students

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:16.303
at Stanford University.

00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:17.759
Now the students and I

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:18.935
enjoyed the class,

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.351
but it occurred to me

00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:22.062
that while the subject matter

00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:23.351
of the class is advanced

00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:24.039
and modern,

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.358
the teaching technology isn't.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.694
In fact, I use basically

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:31.064
the same technology as
