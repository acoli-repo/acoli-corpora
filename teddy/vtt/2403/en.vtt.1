00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
♫ With a body like a greyhound ♫

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
♫ and a mind so sharp and keen ♫

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
♫ But his heart, just like laurel ♫

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
♫ grew twisted around itself ♫

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
♫ Till almost everything he did ♫

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
♫ brought pain to someone else ♫

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
♫ It's not just what you're born with ♫

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
♫ It's what you choose to bear ♫

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ It's not how big your share is ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
♫ It's how much you can share ♫
