00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ It's not how big your share is ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
♫ It's how much you can share ♫

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
♫ It's not the fights you dreamed of ♫

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
♫ It's those you really fought ♫

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
♫ It's not what you've been given ♫

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
♫ It's what you do with what you've got ♫

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
♫ What's the use of two strong legs ♫

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
♫ if you only run away? ♫

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
♫ And what's the use of the finest voice ♫

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
♫ if you've nothing good to say? ♫
