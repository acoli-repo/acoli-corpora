00:00:00.142 --> 00:00:00.972
Coming out.

00:00:01.016 --> 00:00:02.263
Typically we think of this

00:00:02.307 --> 00:00:04.885
as being an experience
specific to the queer community.

00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:07.574
But we all have things that
we're keeping in our closets.

00:00:07.598 --> 00:00:10.071
It could be something
about our home and family life,

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:11.841
about our mental or physical health.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.704
Maybe you're not allergic
to cats, you just don't like them.

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:15.840
I feel you on that one.

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:18.231
Whatever it is that you're
keeping in your closet,

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.173
it shapes the way
you navigate the world.

00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:21.741
That can include your work life.

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:24.813
So how do we go about
disclosing these important,

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:27.664
but sometimes difficult to talk about
aspects of who we are?

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:29.286
And when someone comes out to us,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.498
what can we best do to
listen and support them?
