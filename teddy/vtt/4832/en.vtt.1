00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:32.188
the most enduring one is 
that of the Great Race.

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:36.358
As the story goes, Yù Dì, or Jade Emperor,
Ruler of the Heavens,

00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:41.348
wanted to devise a way to measure time,
so he organized a race.

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:43.928
The first twelve animals to make it
across the river

00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:48.028
would earn a spot on the zodiac calendar
in the order they arrived.

00:00:48.028 --> 00:00:50.679
The rat rose with the sun
to get an early start,

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.078
but on the way to the river,

00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:54.989
he met the horse, the tiger, and the ox.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.809
Because the rat was small
and couldn't swim very well,

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.168
he asked the bigger animals for help.
