00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.168
he asked the bigger animals for help.

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:01.909
While the tiger and horse refused,

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.389
the kind-hearted ox agreed
to carry the rat across.

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:08.370
Yet, just as they were about
to reach the other side,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.109
the rat jumped off the ox's head
and secured first place.

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.509
The ox came in second,

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.979
with the powerful tiger right behind him.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.129
The rabbit, 
too small to battle the current,

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:22.541
nimbly hopped across stones and logs
to come in fourth.

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:25.619
Next came the dragon,
who could have flown directly across,

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.199
but stopped to help some creatures
she had encountered on the way.

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:32.609
After her came the horse,
galloping across the river.
