00:02:59.853 --> 00:03:02.032
are matched with the five elements

00:03:02.032 --> 00:03:04.693
plus the yīn or the yáng
of the Heavenly Stems,

00:03:04.693 --> 00:03:07.614
it creates 60 years 
of different combinations,

00:03:07.614 --> 00:03:11.424
known as a sexagenary cycle, or gānzhī.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:16.390
So someone born in 1980 would have
the sign of yáng metal monkey,

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.903
while someone born in 2007 
would be yīn fire pig.

00:03:20.903 --> 00:03:24.913
In fact, you can also have an inner animal
based on your birth month,

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:27.962
a true animal based on your birth date,

00:03:27.962 --> 00:03:31.773
and a secret animal based on 
your birth hour.
