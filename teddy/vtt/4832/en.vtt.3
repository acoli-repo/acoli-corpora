00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:32.609
After her came the horse,
galloping across the river.

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.100
But just as she got across,
the snake slithered by.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.480
The startled horse reared back,
letting the snake sneak into sixth place.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.400
The Jade Emperor looked out at the river

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.420
and spotted the sheep, the monkey,
and the rooster all atop a raft,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.060
working together to push it 
through the weeds.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.391
When they made it across,

00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.020
the trio agreed to give eighth place
to the sheep,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.660
who had been the most comforting
and harmonious of them,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.330
followed by the monkey and the rooster.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.391
Next came the dog, 
scrambling onto the shore.
