00:03:27.962 --> 00:03:31.773
and a secret animal based on 
your birth hour.

00:03:31.773 --> 00:03:34.196
It was the great race 
that supposedly determined

00:03:34.196 --> 00:03:37.213
which animals were enshrined 
in the Chinese zodiac,

00:03:37.213 --> 00:03:39.094
but as the system spread through Asia,

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:42.463
other cultures made changes
to reflect their communities.

00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:44.803
So if you consult the Vietnamese zodiac,

00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:47.684
you may discover that you're a cat,
not a rabbit,

00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:49.353
and if you're in Thailand,

00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:53.284
a mythical snake called a Naga
replaces the dragon.

00:03:53.284 --> 00:03:55.844
So whether or not you place stock 
in what the zodiac says

00:03:55.844 --> 00:03:57.744
about you as an individual,

00:03:57.744 --> 00:04:00.644
it certainly reveals much about
the culture it comes from.
