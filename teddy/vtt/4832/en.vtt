00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:10.516
What's your sign?

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:12.006
In Western astrology,

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:16.386
it's a constellation determined by
when your birthday falls in the calendar.

00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:19.897
But according to the Chinese zodiac,
or shēngxiào,

00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:24.387
it's your shǔxiàng, meaning the animal
assigned to your birth year.

00:00:24.387 --> 00:00:28.458
And of the many myths explaining
these animal signs and their arrangement,

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:32.188
the most enduring one is 
that of the Great Race.
