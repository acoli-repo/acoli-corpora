00:08:29.114 --> 00:08:33.012
I really would have just thought 
my period was late that month,

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:34.820
but we actually had data to show

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.447
that we had miscarried this baby,

00:08:37.447 --> 00:08:39.280
and even though this data revealed a really

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.064
unfortunate event in our lives,

00:08:41.064 --> 00:08:43.531
it was information that we could then take to our doctor.

00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:46.159
So if there was a fertility issue or some problem,

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.414
I had data to show:

00:08:47.414 --> 00:08:49.761
Look, we got pregnant, our temperature shifted,

00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:51.445
we somehow lost this baby.

00:08:51.445 --> 00:08:54.805
What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem?

00:08:54.805 --> 00:08:58.326
And it's not just about temperatures

00:08:58.326 --> 00:09:01.067
and it's not just about fertility;
