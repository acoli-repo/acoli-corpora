00:04:28.973 --> 00:04:30.225
And then I said,

00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:33.105
"And I really don't think my due date is accurate."

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:35.705
(Laughter)

00:04:35.705 --> 00:04:38.445
And so this really stunned him

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.095
and he looked sort of puzzled

00:04:40.095 --> 00:04:42.227
and I said, "You may not know this,

00:04:42.227 --> 00:04:43.808
but pregnancy due dates are calculated

00:04:43.808 --> 00:04:46.346
assuming that you have a standard 28-day cycle,

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:47.748
and my cycle ranges —

00:04:47.748 --> 00:04:51.295
sometimes it's 27, sometimes it's up to 38 —

00:04:51.295 --> 00:04:54.449
and I have been collecting the data to prove it.

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.233
(Laughter)

00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:04.070
And so we ended up leaving the hospital 
that day without being induced.
