maybe we would have gotten a 
better diagnosis the first time.

00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:04.973
I want you to consider the following chart,

00:14:04.973 --> 00:14:06.927
of systolic blood pressure measurements

00:14:06.927 --> 00:14:10.999
from October 2010 to July 2012.

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:12.692
You'll see that these measurements start

00:14:12.692 --> 00:14:16.360
in the prehypertension/hypertension zone,

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.946
but over about the course of a year and a half

00:14:18.946 --> 00:14:21.591
they move into the normal zone.

00:14:21.591 --> 00:14:25.700
This is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.731
What story is this data telling you?

00:14:29.731 --> 00:14:32.612
Obviously it's the data from someone
