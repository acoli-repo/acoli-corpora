00:05:55.965 --> 00:06:00.119
as I stared into your father's eyes. (Laughter)

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:06.931
Oh, yeah. Twenty-two more years, we're telling that story.

00:06:06.931 --> 00:06:09.982
But we were confident to leave 
because we had been collecting data.

00:06:09.984 --> 00:06:11.590
Now, what does that data look like?

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.427
Here's a standard chart

00:06:14.427 --> 00:06:17.729
of a woman's waking body temperature

till the beginning of the next.

00:06:22.051 --> 00:06:24.872
You'll see that the temperature is not random.

00:06:24.872 --> 00:06:26.936
Clearly there is a low pattern

00:06:26.936 --> 00:06:28.935
at the beginning of her cycle

00:06:28.935 --> 00:06:31.434
and then you see this jump and then a higher
