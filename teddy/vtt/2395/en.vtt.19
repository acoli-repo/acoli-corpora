00:09:29.619 --> 00:09:33.416
That's exactly how your thyroid works in your body.

00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:36.116
Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature

00:09:36.116 --> 00:09:37.144
for your body.

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:39.626
If it gets too cold, your thyroid

00:09:39.626 --> 00:09:42.814
If it gets too hot, your thyroid cools you down.

00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:47.220
But what happens when your 
thyroid is not functioning well?

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.587
When it doesn't function, then it shows up

00:09:49.587 --> 00:09:50.773
in your body temperatures,

00:09:50.773 --> 00:09:53.428
they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic.

00:09:53.428 --> 00:09:54.698
And so by collecting this data

00:09:54.698 --> 00:09:57.685
you can find out information about your thyroid.

00:09:57.685 --> 00:10:01.249
Now, what is it, if you had a thyroid 
problem and you went to the doctor,
