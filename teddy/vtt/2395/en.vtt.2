00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:00.951
And at this point in the process

00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:03.144
we had to come in every couple of days

00:01:03.144 --> 00:01:04.952
to do a stress test on the baby,

00:01:04.952 --> 00:01:06.134
and this is just routine,

00:01:06.134 --> 00:01:10.720
it tests whether or not the baby 
is feeling any type of undue stress.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.113
And you are rarely, if ever, seen by your actual doctor,

00:01:14.113 --> 00:01:17.280
just whoever happens to be 
working at the hospital that day.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.026
So we go in for a stress test and after 20 minutes

00:01:20.026 --> 00:01:23.524
the doctor comes out and he says,

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:29.079
"Your baby is under stress, we need to induce you."

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.698
Now, as a statistician, what's my response?
