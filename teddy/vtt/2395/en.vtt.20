Now, what is it, if you had a thyroid 
problem and you went to the doctor,

00:10:01.249 --> 00:10:03.682
your doctor would actually test the amount of

00:10:03.682 --> 00:10:06.620
thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.803
Fine. But the problem with that test is

00:10:10.803 --> 00:10:13.568
it doesn't tell you how active the hormone is in your body.

00:10:13.568 --> 00:10:15.617
So you might have a lot of hormone present,

00:10:15.617 --> 00:10:17.365
but it might not be actively working to regulate

00:10:17.365 --> 00:10:18.613
your body temperature.

00:10:18.613 --> 00:10:20.362
So just by collecting your temperature every day,

00:10:20.362 --> 00:10:23.982
you get information about the condition of your thyroid.

00:10:23.982 --> 00:10:26.463
So, what if you don't want to take 
your temperature every day?

00:10:26.463 --> 00:10:28.021
I advocate that you do,

00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:29.876
but there are tons of other things you could take.

00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:32.681
You could take your blood pressure, 
you could take your weight —
