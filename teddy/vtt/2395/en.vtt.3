00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.698
Now, as a statistician, what's my response?

00:01:33.698 --> 00:01:37.370
Show me the data!

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.072
So then he proceeds to tell us

00:01:40.072 --> 00:01:42.497
the baby's heart rate trace went from 18 minutes,

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:44.468
the baby's heart rate was in the normal zone

00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:47.421
and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be

00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:51.131
my heart rate zone and I said,

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:53.497
"Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate?

00:01:53.497 --> 00:01:55.492
I was moving around a little bit,

00:01:55.492 --> 00:01:57.790
it's hard to lay still on your back,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.308
41 weeks pregnant for 20 minutes.
