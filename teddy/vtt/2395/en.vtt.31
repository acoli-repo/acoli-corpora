00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:30.836
You don't have to have a Ph.D. in statistics

00:15:30.836 --> 00:15:32.168
to be an expert in yourself.

00:15:32.168 --> 00:15:33.609
You don't have to have a medical degree

00:15:33.609 --> 00:15:35.735
to be your body's expert.

00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:39.154
Medical doctors, they're experts on the population,

00:15:39.154 --> 00:15:41.432
but you are the expert on yourself.

00:15:41.432 --> 00:15:43.342
And so when two of you come together,

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:45.312
when two experts come together,

00:15:45.312 --> 00:15:48.107
the two of you are able to make a better decision

00:15:48.107 --> 00:15:50.107
than just your doctor alone.

00:15:50.107 --> 00:15:53.874
Now that you understand the power of information

00:15:53.874 --> 00:15:55.745
that you can get through personal data collection,

00:15:55.745 --> 00:15:59.414
I'd like you all to stand and raise your right hand.

00:15:59.414 --> 00:16:01.973
