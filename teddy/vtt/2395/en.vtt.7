00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.582

00:03:37.582 --> 00:03:43.089
I said, "Okay, out of 1,000 full-term pregnant women,

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:45.616
how many of them are going to miscarry

00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:47.411

00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:57.792
I said, "Okay, so of those 1,000 women, how many

00:03:57.792 --> 00:04:02.650
are going to miscarry just after their due date?"
