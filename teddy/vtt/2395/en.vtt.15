00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:30.511
But if you do get pregnant, sometimes you

00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:33.055
actually see another shift in your temperatures

00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:36.342
and it stays elevated for those whole nine months.

00:07:36.342 --> 00:07:39.667
That's why you see those pregnant 
women just sweating and hot,

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:43.045
because their temperatures are high.

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:47.414
Here's a chart that we had about three or four years ago.

00:07:47.414 --> 00:07:49.434
We were really very excited about this chart.

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:51.970
You'll see the low temperature level

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.012
and then a shift and for about five days,

00:07:55.012 --> 00:07:57.471
that's about the time it takes for the egg to travel

00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.918
down the fallopian tube and implant,

00:07:59.918 --> 00:08:03.559
and then you see those temperatures 
start to go up a little bit.
