00:06:28.935 --> 00:06:31.434
and then you see this jump and then a higher

00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:33.712
set of temperatures at the end of her cycle.

00:06:33.712 --> 00:06:35.133
So what's happening here?

00:06:35.133 --> 00:06:37.739
What is that data telling you?

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:40.438
Well, ladies, at the beginning of our cycle,

00:06:40.438 --> 00:06:43.780
the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.589
causes a suppression of your body temperature.

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:51.126
And at ovulation, your body releases an egg

00:06:51.126 --> 00:06:56.141
and progesterone takes over, pro-gestation.

00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:58.493
And so your body heats up in anticipation

00:06:58.493 --> 00:07:02.279
of housing this new little fertilized egg.
