And I roll over and I look, and I said, 
"Well, can you breath out of your mouth?"

00:11:02.582 --> 00:11:04.060
(Laughter)

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:11.140
And he goes, "Yes, but I can't breath out of my nose!"

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.160
And so like any good wife, I rush him

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.995
to the emergency room

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:18.427
at 2 o'clock in the morning.

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:21.897
And the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking,

00:11:21.897 --> 00:11:24.746
you can't die on me now.

00:11:24.746 --> 00:11:26.916
We just got married,

00:11:26.916 --> 00:11:31.374
people will think I killed you! (Laughter)
