00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.739
As a kid I always loved information

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:05.587
that I could get from data

00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:08.629
and the stories that could be told with numbers.

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.913
I remember, growing up, I'd be frustrated at

00:00:10.913 --> 00:00:16.459
how my own parents would lie to me using numbers.

00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:21.443
"Talithia, if I've told you once 
I've told you a thousand times."

00:00:21.443 --> 00:00:25.335
No dad, you've only told me 17 times

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:28.497
and twice it wasn't my fault. (Laughter)

00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:31.661
I think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics.
