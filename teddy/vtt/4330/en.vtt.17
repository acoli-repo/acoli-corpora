00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.176
And at the last study
that we do at the molecular level,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.456
we look at the lipidome --

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.535
the lipid changes in response to drying.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.816
And that's also important

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.655
because all biological membranes
are made of lipids.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.256
They're held as membranes
because they're in water.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.520
Take away the water,
those membranes fall apart.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.280
Lipids also act as signals
to turn on genes.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.896
Then we use physiological
and biochemical studies

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.136
to try and understand
the function of the putative protectants

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.096
that we've actually discovered
in our other studies.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.296
And then use all of that
to try and understand

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.640
how the plant copes
with its natural environment.
