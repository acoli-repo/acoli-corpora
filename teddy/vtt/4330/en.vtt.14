00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.856
And I work on a variety
of different resurrection plants,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.296
shown here in the hydrated and dry states,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.776
for a number of reasons.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.656
One of them is that each
of these plants serves as a model

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.056
for a crop that I'd like
to make drought-tolerant.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.016
So on the extreme top left,
for example, is a grass,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.296
it's called Eragrostis nindensis,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.696
it's got a close relative
called Eragrostis tef --

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.736
a lot of you might know it as "teff" --

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.496
it's a staple food in Ethiopia,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.776
it's gluten-free,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.816
and it's something we would like
to make drought-tolerant.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.256
The other reason for looking
at a number of plants,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.656
is that, at least initially,
