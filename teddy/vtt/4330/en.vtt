00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.056
I believe that the secret to producing
extremely drought-tolerant crops,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.296
which should go some way
to providing food security in the world,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.016
lies in resurrection plants,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.176
pictured here, in an extremely
droughted state.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.056
You might think
that these plants look dead,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.376
but they're not.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.856
Give them water,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.320
and they will resurrect, green up,
start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.616
Now, why would I suggest

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.080
that producing drought-tolerant crops
will go towards providing food security?
