00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.280
the ones with the genes
do a hell of a lot better.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.056
Now to the final approach.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.616
My research has shown
that there's considerable similarity

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.056
in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance
in seeds and resurrection plants.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.496
So I ask the question,

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.960
are they using the same genes?

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.736
Or slightly differently phrased,

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.256
are resurrection plants using genes
evolved in seed desiccation tolerance

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.536
in their roots and leaves?

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.616
Have they retasked these seed genes

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.680
in roots and leaves
of resurrection plants?

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.616
And I answer that question,

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.056
as a consequence of a lot
of research from my group
