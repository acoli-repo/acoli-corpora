most of that's going
to have to come from plants.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.056
That percentage of 70 percent

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.296
does not take into consideration
the potential effects of climate change.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.560
This is taken from a study by Dai
published in 2011,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.176
where he took into consideration

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.576
all the potential effects
of climate change

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.736
and expressed them --
amongst other things --

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.376
increased aridity due to lack of rain
or infrequent rain.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.176
The areas in red shown here,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.256
are areas that until recently

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.456
have been very successfully
used for agriculture,
