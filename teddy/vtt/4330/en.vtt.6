00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.440
that they grow extremely slowly.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.016
Examples of avoidance of water loss
are found in trees and shrubs.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.616
They send down very deep roots,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.336
mine subterranean water supplies

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.816
and just keep flushing
it through them at all times,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.696
keeping themselves hydrated.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.696
The one on the right is called a baobab.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.776
It's also called the upside-down tree,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.576
simply because the proportion
of roots to shoots is so great

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.296
that it looks like the tree
has been planted upside down.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.560
And of course the roots are required
for hydration of that plant.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.280
And probably the most common strategy
of avoidance is found in annuals.
