00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.120
But back to annuals
as our major form of food supplies.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.520
Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent
of our plant food supplies.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.016
And it's been a great strategy

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.216
because in a short space of time
you can produce a lot of seed.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.860
Seeds are energy-rich
so there's a lot of food calories,

00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:47.804
you can store it in times of plenty
for times of famine,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.720
but there's a downside.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.936
The vegetative tissues,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.136
the roots and leaves of annuals,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.416
do not have much

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.536
by way of inherent resistance,
avoidance or tolerance characteristics.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.856
They just don't need them.
