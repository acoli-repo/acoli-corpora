00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.576
Resurrection plants
switch on the same genes

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.256
when they dry out.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.056
All modern crops, therefore,

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.136
have these genes
in their roots and leaves,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.896
they just never switch them on.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.880
They only switch them on in seed tissues.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.176
So what we're trying to do right now

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.816
is to understand the environmental
and cellular signals

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.280
that switch on these genes
in resurrection plants,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.040
to mimic the process in crops.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.416
And just a final thought.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.656
What we're trying to do very rapidly

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.496
is to repeat what nature did
in the evolution of resurrection plants
