00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.016
All of the crops that we eat today,
wheat, rice and maize,

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.256
are highly genetically modified
from their ancestors,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.256
but we don't consider them GM

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.920
because they're being produced
by conventional breeding.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.656
If you mean, am I going to put
resurrection plant genes into crops,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.976
your answer is yes.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.136
In the essence of time,
we have tried that approach.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.016
More appropriately,
some of my collaborators at UCT,

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.976
Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.616
have spearheaded that approach

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.593
and I'm going to show you some data soon.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.216
But we're about to embark
upon an extremely ambitious approach,
