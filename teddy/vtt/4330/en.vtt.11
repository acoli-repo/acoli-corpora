00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.096
These plants can lose 95 percent
of their cellular water,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.976
remain in a dry, dead-like state
for months to years,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.736
and give them water,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.640
they green up and start growing again.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.856
Like seeds, these are
desiccation-tolerant.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.000
Like seeds, these can withstand extremes
of environmental conditions.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.776
And this is a really rare phenomenon.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.176
There are only 135 flowering
plant species that can do this.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.616
I'm going to show you a video

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.256
of the resurrection process
of these three species
