00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.656
is that, at least initially,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.936
I wanted to find out:
do they do the same thing?

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.656
Do they all use the same mechanisms

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.256
to be able to lose
all that water and not die?

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.976
So I undertook what we call
a systems biology approach

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.176
in order to get
a comprehensive understanding

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.216
of desiccation tolerance,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.696
in which we look at everything

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.632
from the molecular to the whole plant,
ecophysiological level.

00:07:48.657 --> 00:07:50.291
For example we look at things like

00:07:50.316 --> 00:07:52.513
changes in the plant anatomy
as they dried out

00:07:52.537 --> 00:07:53.776
and their ultrastructure.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.976
We look at the transcriptome,
which is just a term for a technology

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.416
in which we look at the genes

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.856
that are switched on or off,
in response to drying.
