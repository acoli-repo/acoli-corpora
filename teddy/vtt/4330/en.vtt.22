So what's typically done
in biotech studies

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.136
is that we use an inducible promoter,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.736
we know how to switch it on.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.776
We couple that to genes of interest

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.480
and put that into a plant
and see how the plant responds.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.696
In the study that I'm going
to talk to you about,

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.176
my collaborators used
a drought-induced promoter,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.616
which we discovered
in a resurrection plant.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.776
The nice thing about this promoter
is that we do nothing.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.880
The plant itself senses drought.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.696
And we've used it to drive antioxidant
genes from resurrection plants.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.576
Why antioxidant genes?
