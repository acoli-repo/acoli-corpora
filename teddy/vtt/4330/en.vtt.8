00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.696
And anything that is
that dry and still alive,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.200
we call desiccation-tolerant.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.256
In the desiccated state,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.936
what seeds can do
is lie in extremes of environment

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.616
for prolonged periods of time.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.856
The next time the rainy season comes,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.376
they germinate and grow,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.280
and the whole cycle just starts again.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.176
It's widely believed that the evolution
of desiccation-tolerant seeds

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.376
allowed the colonization and the radiation

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.920
of flowering plants,
or angiosperms, onto land.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.120
But back to annuals
as our major form of food supplies.
