00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.976
And the reason for this is water.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.136
Water is essential to life on this planet.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.295
All living, actively
metabolizing organisms,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.376
from microbes to you and I,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.736
are comprised predominately of water.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.296
All life reactions happen in water.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.336
And loss of a small amount
of water results in death.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.416
You and I are 65 percent water --

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.160
we lose one percent of that, we die.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.560
But we can make behavioral
changes to avoid that.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.496
Plants can't.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.136
They're stuck in the ground.
