00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.136
They're stuck in the ground.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.536
And so in the first instance they have
a little bit more water than us,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.816
about 95 percent water,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.936
and they can lose
a little bit more than us,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.920
like 10 to about 70 percent,
depending on the species,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.360
but for short periods only.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.856
Most of them will either try
to resist or avoid water loss.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.816
So extreme examples of resistors
can be found in succulents.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.656
They tend to be small, very attractive,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.416
but they hold onto their water
at such great cost

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.440
that they grow extremely slowly.
