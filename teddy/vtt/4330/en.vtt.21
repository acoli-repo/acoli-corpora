00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.480
that are present in every cell
of your body or in a plant's body.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.160
If you unwind that DNA, you get genes.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.296
And each gene has a promoter,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.696
which is just an on-off switch,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.136
the gene coding region,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.416
and then a terminator,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.040
which indicates that this is the end
of this gene, the next gene will start.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.616
Now, promoters are not
simple on-off switches.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.336
They normally require
a lot of fine-tuning,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.400
lots of things to be present and correct
before that gene is switched on.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.296
So what's typically done
