00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.456
have been very successfully
used for agriculture,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.880
but cannot anymore
because of lack of rainfall.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.560
This is the situation
that's predicted to happen in 2050.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.016
Much of Africa,
in fact, much of the world,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.936
is going to be in trouble.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.616
We're going to have to think of some
very smart ways of producing food.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.936
And preferably among them,
some drought-tolerant crops.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.016
The other thing
to remember about Africa is

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.840
that most of their agriculture is rainfed.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.536
Now, making drought-tolerant crops
is not the easiest thing in the world.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.976
And the reason for this is water.
