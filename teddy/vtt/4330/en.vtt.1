00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.080
that producing drought-tolerant crops
will go towards providing food security?

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.936
Well, the current world population
is around 7 billion.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.456
And it's estimated that by 2050,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.176
we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.080
with the bulk of this growth
happening in Africa.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.336
The food and agricultural
organizations of the world

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.496
have suggested that we need
a 70 percent increase

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.696
in current agricultural practice

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.960
to meet that demand.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.416
Given that plants
are at the base of the food chain,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.760
most of that's going
to have to come from plants.
