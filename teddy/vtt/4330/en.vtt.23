00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.576
Why antioxidant genes?

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.656
Well, all stresses,
particularly drought stress,

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.976
results in the formation of free radicals,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.336
or reactive oxygen species,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.080
which are highly damaging
and can cause crop death.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.280
What antioxidants do is stop that damage.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.256
So here's some data from a maize strain
that's very popularly used in Africa.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.576
To the left of the arrow
are plants without the genes,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.856
to the right --

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.936
plants with the antioxidant genes.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.776
After three weeks without watering,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.280
the ones with the genes
do a hell of a lot better.
