00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.216
But we're about to embark
upon an extremely ambitious approach,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.696
in which we aim to turn on
whole suites of genes

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.416
that are already present in every crop.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.345
They're just never turned on
under extreme drought conditions.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.256
I leave it up to you to decide

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.233
whether those should be called GM or not.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.016
I'm going to now just give you
some of the data from that first approach.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.296
And in order to do that

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.976
I have to explain a little bit
about how genes work.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.256
So you probably all know

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.336
that genes are made
of double-stranded DNA.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.296
It's wound very tightly into chromosomes

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.480
that are present in every cell
of your body or in a plant's body.
