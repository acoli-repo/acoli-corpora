00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.856
that are switched on or off,
in response to drying.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.096
Most genes will code for proteins,
so we look at the proteome.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.520
What are the proteins made
in response to drying?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.376
Some proteins would code for enzymes
which make metabolites,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.976
so we look at the metabolome.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.296
Now, this is important
because plants are stuck in the ground.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.416
They use what I call
a highly tuned chemical arsenal

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.856
to protect themselves from all
the stresses of their environment.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.376
So it's important that we look

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.840
at the chemical changes
involved in drying.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.176
And at the last study
that we do at the molecular level,
