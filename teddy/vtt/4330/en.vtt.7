00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.280
And probably the most common strategy
of avoidance is found in annuals.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.016
Annuals make up the bulk
of our plant food supplies.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.736
Up the west coast of my country,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.296
for much of the year
you don't see much vegetation growth.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.976
But come the spring rains, you get this:

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.240
flowering of the desert.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.856
The strategy in annuals,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.240
is to grow only in the rainy season.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.256
At the end of that season
they produce a seed,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.096
which is dry, eight to 10 percent water,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.776
but very much alive.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.696
And anything that is
that dry and still alive,
