00:00:00.378 --> 00:00:02.271
I have a question:

00:00:02.271 --> 00:00:05.648
Who here remembers when they first realized

00:00:05.648 --> 00:00:09.071
they were going to die?

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:11.573
I do. I was a young boy,

00:00:11.573 --> 00:00:14.628
and my grandfather had just died,

00:00:14.628 --> 00:00:18.546
and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:22.180
trying to make sense of what had happened.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.815
What did it mean that he was dead?

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:26.599
Where had he gone?

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.021
It was like a hole in reality had opened up
