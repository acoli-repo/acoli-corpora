we set ourselves a goal to end poverty.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.069
After some success,

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.123
we've hit a big hurdle.

00:00:15.123 --> 00:00:17.644
The aftermath of the financial crisis

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:20.369
has begun to hit aid payments,

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.133
which have fallen for two consecutive years.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:29.112
