00:06:56.457 --> 00:07:01.703
we're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes.

00:07:01.703 --> 00:07:04.185
This last project is also of components.

00:07:04.185 --> 00:07:08.042
The influence -- and if you have noticed, one of my

00:07:08.042 --> 00:07:11.618
spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper.

00:07:11.618 --> 00:07:14.225
And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:17.627
They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles,

00:07:17.627 --> 00:07:21.117
and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down,

00:07:21.117 --> 00:07:24.499
and so in this project, I'm trying to look at how we can

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:26.681
consider that in architecture too, how we can bring

00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:29.347
air through holes in the sides of a building.

00:07:29.347 --> 00:07:32.320
And so you see here some early studies of blocks,
