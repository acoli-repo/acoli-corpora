and currently have this installation at the Materials &amp; Applications gallery

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.705
in Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it.

00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:07.603
It's called "Bloom," and the surface is made completely

00:04:07.603 --> 00:04:11.643
out of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy

00:04:11.643 --> 00:04:15.460
that does two things. One, it's a sun-shading device, so that

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.470
when the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through,

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.839
and in other areas, it's a ventilating system,

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:24.992
so that hot, trapped air underneath can actually

00:04:24.992 --> 00:04:28.870
move through and out when necessary.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.001
