00:00:59.154 --> 00:01:01.745
it limited the amount of temperature transfer

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:04.212
between the interior and exterior.

00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:08.084
Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass,

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:11.480
rolled steel and mass production, we were able

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.930
to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.656
and with that came the irreversible reliance on

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:25.237
mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces.

00:01:25.237 --> 00:01:28.341
Over time, the buildings got taller and bigger,

00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:30.982
our engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems
