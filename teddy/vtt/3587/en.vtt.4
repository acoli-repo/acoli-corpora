Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings

move towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:11.159
just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.937
We need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut.

00:02:14.937 --> 00:02:19.188
So what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig us

00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:22.039
out of this hole that we've dug?

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.948
If we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know,

00:02:24.948 --> 00:02:28.604
I was a biology major before I went into architecture,

00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:32.993
the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates
