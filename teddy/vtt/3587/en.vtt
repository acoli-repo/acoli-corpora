00:00:00.737 --> 00:00:04.088
I was one of those kids that, every time I got in the car,

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:07.031
I basically had to roll down the window.

00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:11.243
It was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly,

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.597
and my father would not let us use the air conditioner.

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:16.354
He said that it would overheat the engine.

00:00:16.354 --> 00:00:18.002
And you might remember, some of you,

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:19.902
how the cars were back then, and it was

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:22.268
a common problem of overheating.

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:26.288
But it was also the signal that capped the use,

00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:30.710
or overuse, of energy-consuming devices.
