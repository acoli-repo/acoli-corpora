the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates

00:02:32.993 --> 00:02:36.429
the temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing.

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.044
That's the first line of defense for the body.

00:02:39.044 --> 00:02:42.253
It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things

00:02:42.253 --> 00:02:45.671
that work together very dynamically and very efficiently,

00:02:45.671 --> 00:02:48.175
and so what I propose is that our building skins

00:02:48.175 --> 00:02:51.824
should be more similar to human skin,

00:02:51.824 --> 00:02:55.936
and by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive

00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:59.192
and differentiated, depending on where it is.

00:02:59.192 --> 00:03:01.125
And this gets me back to my research.
