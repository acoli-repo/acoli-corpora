00:07:58.642 --> 00:08:00.954
it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine

00:08:00.954 --> 00:08:03.681
that air could potentially be coming through the walls

00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:06.562
instead of opening windows.

00:08:06.562 --> 00:08:09.250
So I want to leave you with one last impression about

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.630
the project, or this kind of work and using smart materials.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.810
When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.803
day after day, when you're on vacation

00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:23.842
and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls,

00:08:23.842 --> 00:08:26.197
or when there's a power outage, and you have

00:08:26.197 --> 00:08:29.218
no electricity to rely on, these thermo-bimetals

00:08:29.218 --> 00:08:33.216
will still be working tirelessly, efficiently
