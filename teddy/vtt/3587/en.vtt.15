00:07:29.347 --> 00:07:32.320
And so you see here some early studies of blocks,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.833
where those holes are actually coming through,

00:07:34.833 --> 00:07:38.553
and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied,

00:07:38.553 --> 00:07:41.252
and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:44.460
hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.638
On the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal

00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:51.240
is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.280
and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.826
and allows that air to pass through, so those are two different

00:07:56.826 --> 00:07:58.642
components that I'm working on, and again,

00:07:58.642 --> 00:08:00.954
it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine
