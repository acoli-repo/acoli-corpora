00:05:57.551 --> 00:06:00.040
and so here you see a pretty typical

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.771
double-glazed window panel, and in that panel,

00:06:04.771 --> 00:06:07.698
between those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing,

00:06:07.698 --> 00:06:09.875
I'm trying to work on making

00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:11.944
a thermo-bimetal pattern system

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:14.616
so that when the sun hits that outside layer

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:19.260
and heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.036
will begin to curl, and what actually will happen then

00:06:22.036 --> 00:06:24.339
is it'll start to block out the sun

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:26.213
in certain areas of the building,

00:06:26.213 --> 00:06:28.154
and totally, if necessary.

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:30.662
And so you can imagine, even in this application, that
