00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:02.740
So this kind of proof of concept project

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.704
has a lot of implications

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:08.404
to actual future application in architecture,

00:05:08.404 --> 00:05:10.909
and in this case, here you see a house,

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.342
that's for a developer in China,

00:05:13.342 --> 00:05:16.086
and it's actually a four-story glass box.

00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:19.923
It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access,

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:23.805
but now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer,

00:05:23.805 --> 00:05:26.270
it's a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actually

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.298
open and close as that sun moves around on that surface.
