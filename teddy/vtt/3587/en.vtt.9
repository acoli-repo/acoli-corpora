You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun,

00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:35.747
as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade,

00:04:35.747 --> 00:04:38.223
each of the tiles moves individually.

00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:40.735
Keep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today,

00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:43.748
this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces

00:04:43.748 --> 00:04:48.477
and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different.

00:04:48.477 --> 00:04:50.989
And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:54.988
each one to be very, very specific to its location,

00:04:54.988 --> 00:04:59.934
to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls.

00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:02.740
So this kind of proof of concept project
