00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:30.662
And so you can imagine, even in this application, that

00:06:30.662 --> 00:06:33.339
in a high-rise building where the panel systems go

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:38.106
from floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surface

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.296
could be differentiated at different times of day

00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:45.755
depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface.

00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:48.574
And these are some later studies that I'm working on

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.838
right now that are on the boards, where you can see,

00:06:50.838 --> 00:06:54.179
in the bottom right-hand corner, with the red, it's actually

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:56.457
smaller pieces of thermometal, and it's actually going to,

00:06:56.457 --> 00:07:01.703
we're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes.
