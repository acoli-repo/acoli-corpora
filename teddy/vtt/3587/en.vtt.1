or overuse, of energy-consuming devices.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.749
Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country.

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:36.910
We blast the air conditioning the entire way,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.486
and we never experience overheating.

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:41.473
So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop.

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:47.091
Great, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings.

In the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls.

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:53.236

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:56.754
very cool during the summertime, and warm during the wintertime,

00:00:56.754 --> 00:00:59.154

00:00:59.154 --> 00:01:01.745
it limited the amount of temperature transfer
