00:02:59.192 --> 00:03:01.125
And this gets me back to my research.

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:06.435
What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:09.346
I presently, or currently, work with smart materials,

00:03:09.346 --> 00:03:11.065
and a smart thermo-bimetal.

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:13.977
First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires

00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:16.707
no controls and it requires no energy,

00:03:16.707 --> 00:03:19.370
and that's a very big deal for architecture.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.184
What it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.

00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:26.058
You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.

00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:29.533
And because it has two different coefficients of expansion,

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:32.830
when heated, one side will expand faster than the other
