00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:30.982
our engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems

00:01:30.982 --> 00:01:34.856
were massive. They require a huge amount of energy.

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:37.615
They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere,

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:40.815
and for some of you may understand the heat island effect

00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:44.325
in cities, where the urban areas are much more warm

00:01:44.325 --> 00:01:47.275
than the adjacent rural areas,

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:50.529
but we also have problems that, when we lose power,

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:53.290
we can't open a window here, and so

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.104
the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant

00:01:56.104 --> 00:01:59.752
until that air conditioning system can start up again.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:03.807
Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings
