00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:32.830
when heated, one side will expand faster than the other

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.367
and result in a curling action.

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:40.073
So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see

00:03:40.073 --> 00:03:44.266
how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:47.371
air to ventilate through the system,

00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:50.600
and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.081
of having these strips together can try to make

00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:57.155
bigger movement happen when also heated,

00:03:57.155 --> 00:04:01.219
and currently have this installation at the Materials &amp; Applications gallery
