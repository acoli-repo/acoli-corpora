00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.050
who lived there had built 
with their own hands,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.600
without a master plan

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.500
and like a giant work in progress.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.374
Where we're from, in Holland,

00:01:07.374 --> 00:01:09.457
everything is planned.

00:01:09.457 --> 00:01:12.121
We even have rules for 
how to follow the rules.

00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:13.677
(Laughter)

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:15.795
DU: So the last day of 
filming, we ended up

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:17.944
in Vila Cruzeiro, and 
we were sitting down

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:19.332
and we had a drink,

00:01:19.332 --> 00:01:21.007
and we were overlooking this hill

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:22.617
with all these houses,

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:24.952
and most of these houses looked unfinished,

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:26.382
and they had walls of bare brick,

00:01:26.382 --> 00:01:28.132
but we saw some of these houses

00:01:28.132 --> 00:01:30.074
which were plastered and painted,
