He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.805
His name was Nanko,

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:04.866
and he also liked the idea.

00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:06.538
He said, "You know, everybody here

00:02:06.538 --> 00:02:08.411
would pretty much love 
to have their houses

00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:09.862
plastered and painted.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:12.097
It's when a house is finished."

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:14.066
So he introduced us to the right people,

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:17.097
and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew.

00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:20.014
We picked three houses in
the center of the community

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:22.494
and we start here. We made a few designs,

00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:24.114
and everybody liked this design

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:26.527
of a boy flying a kite the best.

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:28.668
So we started painting, 
and the first thing we did

00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:31.059
was to paint everything blue,
