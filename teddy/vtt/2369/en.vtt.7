JK: So, encouraged by this success,

00:03:32.182 --> 00:03:35.710
we went back to Rio for a second project,

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.336
and we stumbled upon this street.

00:03:38.336 --> 00:03:41.609
It was covered in concrete 
to prevent mudslides,

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.960
and somehow we saw a sort of river in it,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.444
and we imagined this river
to be a river in Japanese style

00:03:48.444 --> 00:03:51.190
with koi carp swimming upstream.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.291
So we decided to paint that river,

00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:55.913
and we invited Rob Admiraal,

00:03:55.913 --> 00:03:57.313
who is a tattoo artist,

00:03:57.313 --> 00:04:00.333
and he specialized in the Japanese style.
