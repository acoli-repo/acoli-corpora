00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:31.392
where our story begins.

00:00:31.392 --> 00:00:34.165
Jeroen Koolhaas: Ten years 
ago, we first came to Rio

00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:37.792
to shoot a documentary 
about life in the favelas.

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:40.694
Now, we learned that favelas 
are informal communities.

00:00:40.694 --> 00:00:41.911
They emerged over the years

00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:43.771
when immigrants from the countryside

00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:45.783
came to the cities looking for work,

00:00:45.783 --> 00:00:48.029
like cities within the cities,

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:50.595
known for problems like crime, poverty,

00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:52.356
and the violent drug war between

00:00:52.356 --> 00:00:53.768
police and the drug gangs.

00:00:53.768 --> 00:00:57.013
So what struck us was that

00:00:57.013 --> 00:00:58.570
these were communities that the people

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.050
who lived there had built 
with their own hands,
