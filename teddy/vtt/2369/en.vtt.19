00:09:29.128 --> 00:09:31.703
with no master plan.

00:09:31.703 --> 00:09:34.800
JK: So we went back, 
and we employed Angelo,

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.722
and he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro,

00:09:36.722 --> 00:09:39.518
very talented guy, and he
knows almost everybody there,

00:09:39.518 --> 00:09:41.940
and then we employed Elias, our former landlord

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.537
who invited us into his house,

00:09:43.537 --> 00:09:45.551
and he's a master of construction.

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:47.992
Together with them, we decided where to start.

00:09:47.992 --> 00:09:49.678
We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro,

00:09:49.678 --> 00:09:52.491
and houses are being plastered as we speak.

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:54.071
And the good thing about them is that

00:09:54.071 --> 00:09:56.066
they are deciding which houses go next.

00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:57.752
They're even printing t-shirts,

00:09:57.752 --> 00:09:59.318
they're putting up banners

00:09:59.318 --> 00:10:01.302
explaining everything to everybody,
