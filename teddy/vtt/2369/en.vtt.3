00:01:28.132 --> 00:01:30.074
which were plastered and painted,

00:01:30.074 --> 00:01:31.770
and suddenly we had this idea:

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.450
what would it look like if all these houses

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.625
would be plastered and painted?

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:39.667
And then we imagined one big design,

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:42.767
one big work of art.

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:44.423
Who would expect something like that

00:01:44.423 --> 00:01:46.289
in a place like this?

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.452
So we thought, would that even be possible?

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:52.140
So first we started to count the houses,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.038
but we soon lost count.

00:01:54.038 --> 00:01:57.234
But somehow the idea stuck.

00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:58.909
JK: We had a friend.

He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro.
