00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:00.243
and started barbecuing.

00:07:00.243 --> 00:07:05.102
(Laughter)

00:07:05.102 --> 00:07:08.871
So the project took almost two years to complete,

00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:10.761
and we made individual designs

00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:13.304
for every single house on 
the avenue that we painted,

00:07:13.304 --> 00:07:14.908
and we made these designs together

00:07:14.908 --> 00:07:17.521
with the local store owners, 
the building owners,

00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:22.459
and a team of about a dozen 
young men and women.

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:25.958
They were hired, and then
they were trained as painters,

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.523
and together they transformed
their own neighborhood,

00:07:29.523 --> 00:07:34.340
the whole street, into a 
giant patchwork of color.
