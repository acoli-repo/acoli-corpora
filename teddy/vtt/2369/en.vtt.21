00:10:28.342 --> 00:10:31.468
to work without a master plan,

00:10:31.468 --> 00:10:33.538
because these communities are informal —

00:10:33.538 --> 00:10:34.977
this was the inspiration —

00:10:34.977 --> 00:10:37.577
and in a communal effort, 
together with the people,

00:10:37.577 --> 00:10:39.488
you can almost work like in an orchestra,

00:10:39.488 --> 00:10:41.062
where you can have a hundred instruments

00:10:41.062 --> 00:10:43.415
playing together to create a symphony.

00:10:43.415 --> 00:10:45.372
DU: So we want to thank everybody who

00:10:45.372 --> 00:10:46.990
wanted to become part of this dream

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.174
and supported us along the way,

00:10:49.174 --> 00:10:51.885
and we are looking at continuing.

00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:53.696
JK: Yeah. And so one day pretty soon,

00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:56.205
when the colors start 
going up on these walls,

00:10:56.205 --> 00:10:58.184
we hope more people will join us,

00:10:58.184 --> 00:11:00.997
and join this big dream,
