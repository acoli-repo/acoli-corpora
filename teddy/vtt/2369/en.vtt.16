00:07:57.679 --> 00:08:00.920
but instead, we just ran into questions,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.339
like, how many houses 
are you going to paint?

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:06.495
How many square meters is that?

00:08:06.495 --> 00:08:08.546
How much paint are you going to use,

00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:11.189
and how many people are you going to employ?

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.900
And we did try for years to write plans

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.219
for the funding and answer 
all those questions,

00:08:17.219 --> 00:08:18.759
but then we thought,

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:20.672
in order to answer all those questions,

00:08:20.672 --> 00:08:23.259
you have to know exactly 
what you're going to do

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:26.443
before you actually get there and start.

00:08:26.443 --> 00:08:29.694
And maybe it's a mistake 
to think like that.

00:08:29.694 --> 00:08:32.222
It would lose some of the 
magic that we had learned
