00:08:57.805 --> 00:09:00.207
And instead of looking for funding,

00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:03.097
we started a crowdfunding campaign,

00:09:03.097 --> 00:09:04.680
and in a little over a month,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.852
more than 1,500 people put together

00:09:06.852 --> 00:09:10.127
and donated over 100,000 dollars.

00:09:10.127 --> 00:09:13.730
So for us, this was an amazing 
moment, because now —

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.246
(Applause) —

00:09:17.246 --> 00:09:20.295
because now we finally had the freedom

00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:22.466
to use all the lessons that we had learned

00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:25.562
and create a project that was built

00:09:25.562 --> 00:09:27.474
the same way that the favela was built,

00:09:27.474 --> 00:09:29.128
from the ground on up, bottom up,

00:09:29.128 --> 00:09:31.703
with no master plan.
