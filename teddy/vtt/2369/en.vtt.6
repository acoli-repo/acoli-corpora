00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.131
and they said, "You know, 
there's a boy flying the kite,

00:03:01.131 --> 00:03:03.178
but where is his kite?"

00:03:03.178 --> 00:03:05.293
We said, "Uh, it's art.

00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:07.810
You know, you have to imagine the kite."

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.862
(Laughter)

00:03:08.862 --> 00:03:12.526
And they said, "No, no, no, 
we want to see the kite."

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:14.423
So we quickly installed a kite

00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:15.788
way up high on the hill,

00:03:15.788 --> 00:03:17.920
so that you could see 
the boy flying the kite

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.333
and you could actually see a kite.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.188
So the local news started writing about it,

00:03:22.188 --> 00:03:23.501
which was great,

00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:25.088
and then even The Guardian wrote about it:

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:29.264
"Notorious slum becomes open-air gallery."

00:03:29.264 --> 00:03:32.182
JK: So, encouraged by this success,
