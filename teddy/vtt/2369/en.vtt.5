00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:31.059
was to paint everything blue,

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:33.650
and we thought that looked 
already pretty good.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.181
But they hated it. The people
who lived there really hated it.

00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:37.824
They said, "What did you do?

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.713

we were really happy, but still,

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.069
it wasn't good because the little
kids started coming up to us,

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.131
