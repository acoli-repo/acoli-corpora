00:04:59.361 --> 00:05:00.574
so we decided to throw one

00:05:00.574 --> 00:05:01.797
almost every other week,

00:05:01.797 --> 00:05:04.806
and we got to know everybody 
in the neighborhood.

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:06.831
JK: We still had this 
idea of the hill, though.

00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:08.191
DU: Yeah, yeah, we were talking about

00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:10.137
the scale of this, because this painting

00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:12.398

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:23.480
But we figured that maybe, 
during this process,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.651
all the time that we had 
spent in the neighborhood

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:27.225
was maybe actually even more important

00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:29.926
than the painting itself.

00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:31.444
JK: So after all that time,
