00:00:00.871 --> 00:00:04.603
Some days, it feels like
the only thing we can agree on

00:00:04.627 --> 00:00:06.960
is that we can't agree on anything.

00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:10.357
Public discourse is broken.

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:12.760
And we feel that everywhere --

00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:15.204
panelists on TV
are screaming at each other,

00:00:15.228 --> 00:00:18.697
we go online to find
community and connection,

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:22.121
and we end up leaving
feeling angry and alienated.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.689
In everyday life, probably
because everyone else is yelling,

00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:29.768
we are so scared to get into an argument

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:32.458
that we're willing not to engage at all.
