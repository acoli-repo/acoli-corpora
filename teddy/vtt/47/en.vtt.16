00:07:56.531 --> 00:08:00.209
sticky, well-studied
public policy problems.

00:08:00.543 --> 00:08:03.117
So exactly as I described,
right at the beginning,

00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:06.541
potential solutions were captured
from everywhere.

00:08:06.942 --> 00:08:08.776
We aggregated them,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.434
each of them was produced
on an identical template.

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:14.863
At this point, they all look the same,
they have no separate identity.

00:08:15.252 --> 00:08:18.990
And then, of course,
they are discussed, picked over,

00:08:19.014 --> 00:08:20.561
refined, finalized.

00:08:21.022 --> 00:08:24.775
And at the end of that process,
more than 20 of those new ideas

00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:28.653
are presented to the cabinet ministers
responsible for consideration.

00:08:29.982 --> 00:08:35.506
But more than half of those,
the originator of those ideas
