00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:31.506
People who disagree the most productively
start by finding common ground,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.506
no matter how narrow it is.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.458
They identify the thing
that we can all agree on

00:04:36.482 --> 00:04:38.117
and go from there:

00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:42.977
the right to an education,
equality between all people,

00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:45.643
the importance of safer communities.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.759
What they're doing is inviting us

00:04:47.783 --> 00:04:51.366
into what psychologists
call shared reality.

00:04:52.263 --> 00:04:57.141
And shared reality
is the antidote to alternative facts.

00:04:58.438 --> 00:05:01.184
The conflict, of course, is still there.
