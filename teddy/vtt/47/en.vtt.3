that four-year-old Julia might benefit

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:33.783
they decided that I might benefit

00:01:33.807 --> 00:01:37.418

to argue where they were not.

00:01:37.442 --> 00:01:39.421
(Laughter)

00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:40.993
For the uninitiated,

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.783
the premises of formal debate
are really straightforward:

00:01:43.807 --> 00:01:45.856

00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:53.649
and one group of people
who speaks in favor of that idea,

00:01:53.673 --> 00:01:55.061
and one against.

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:57.876
My first debate

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.847
in the cavernous auditorium
of Canberra Girls Grammar School
