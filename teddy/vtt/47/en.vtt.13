from the identity
of the person discussing them.

00:06:33.014 --> 00:06:37.395
So in formal debate, nothing is a topic
unless it is controversial:

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:41.646
that we should raise
the voting age, outlaw gambling.

00:06:42.575 --> 00:06:46.395
But the debaters don't choose their sides.

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:50.474
So that's why it makes no sense
to do what 10-year-old Julia did.

00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:55.197
Attacking the identity of the person
making the argument is irrelevant,

00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:57.196
because they didn't choose it.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.632
