00:04:58.438 --> 00:05:01.184
The conflict, of course, is still there.

00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:02.875
That's why it's a debate.

00:05:03.212 --> 00:05:07.612
Shared reality just gives us
a platform to start to talk about it.

00:05:08.465 --> 00:05:12.156
But the trick of debate
is that you end up doing it directly,

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.180
face to face, across the table.

00:05:14.656 --> 00:05:17.954
And research backs up
that that really matters.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.098
Professor Juliana Schroeder
at UC Berkeley and her colleagues

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:26.051
have research that suggests
that listening to someone's voice

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:28.519
as they make a controversial argument

00:05:28.543 --> 00:05:30.503
is literally humanizing.
