And despite this very shaky entry
into the world of debate, I loved it.

00:02:33.538 --> 00:02:37.982
I saw the possibility, and over many years
worked really hard at it,

00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:41.982
became really skilled
at the technical craft of debate.

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:45.632
I went on to win the World Schools
Debating Championships three times.

00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:48.601
I know, you're just finding out
that this is a thing.

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:52.133
(Laughter)

00:02:52.157 --> 00:02:55.585
But it wasn't until
I started coaching debaters,

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.069
persuaders who are really
at the top of their game,

00:02:59.093 --> 00:03:00.627
that I actually got it.
