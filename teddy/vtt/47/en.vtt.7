00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.633
at your next family dinner;

00:03:30.657 --> 00:03:34.498
reorganizing the way in which your team
debates new proposals;

00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:37.783
thinking about how we change
our public conversation.

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:40.752
And so, as an entry point into that:

00:03:40.776 --> 00:03:45.133
debate requires that we engage
with the conflicting idea,

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:48.656
directly, respectfully, face to face.

00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:51.584
The foundation of debate is rebuttal.

00:03:51.608 --> 00:03:55.371
The idea that you make a claim
and I provide a response,

00:03:55.395 --> 00:03:57.461
and you respond to my response.

00:03:58.022 --> 00:04:01.419
Without rebuttal, it's not debate,
it's just pontificating.
