00:07:30.815 --> 00:07:32.082
But it is possible.

00:07:32.482 --> 00:07:36.823
When I work with teams,
trying to come up with the next big idea,

00:07:36.847 --> 00:07:39.371
or solve a really complex problem,

00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:44.850
I start by asking them, all of them,
to submit ideas anonymously.

00:07:45.355 --> 00:07:47.758
So by way of illustration, two years ago,

00:07:47.782 --> 00:07:50.474
I was working with multiple
government agencies

00:07:50.498 --> 00:07:54.416
to generate new solutions
to reduce long-term unemployment.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.507
Which is one of those really wicked,

00:07:56.531 --> 00:08:00.209
sticky, well-studied
public policy problems.
