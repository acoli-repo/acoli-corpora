All attributes that we want in our bosses,

00:11:02.573 --> 00:11:05.736
colleagues, discussion partners,
decision-makers,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.427
all virtues that we would like
to claim for ourselves.

00:11:10.688 --> 00:11:14.252
And so, as we're embracing
that humility of uncertainty,

00:11:14.276 --> 00:11:18.123
we should be asking each other,
all of us, a question.

00:11:18.696 --> 00:11:22.125
Our debate moderators, our news anchors
should be asking it

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:25.341
of our elective representatives
and candidates for office, too.

00:11:26.355 --> 00:11:31.171
"What is it that you have changed
your mind about and why?"
