00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.847
in the cavernous auditorium
of Canberra Girls Grammar School

00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:04.006
was kind of a bundle
of all of the worst mistakes

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.061
that you see on cable news.

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:10.425
It felt easier to me to attack
the person making the argument

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.315
rather than the substance
of the ideas themselves.

00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:17.093
When that same person challenged my ideas,

00:02:17.117 --> 00:02:20.569
it felt terrible, I felt
humiliated and ashamed.

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:24.744
And it felt to me like
the sophisticated response to that

00:02:24.768 --> 00:02:27.196
was to be as extreme as possible.

00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:33.514
And despite this very shaky entry
into the world of debate, I loved it.
