that we're willing not to engage at all.

Contempt has replaced conversation.

00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:42.378
My mission in life is to help us
disagree productively.

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:47.299
To find ways to bring truth to light,
to bring new ideas to life.

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:49.991
I think -- I hope --

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.855
that there is a model
for structured disagreement

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.188
that's kind of mutually respectful

00:00:56.212 --> 00:01:00.037
and assumes a genuine desire
to persuade and be persuaded.
