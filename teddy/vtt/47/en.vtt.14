00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.632
Your only winning strategy

00:07:00.656 --> 00:07:06.831
is to engage with the best, clearest,
least personal version of the idea.

00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:12.173
And it might sound impossible
or naive to imagine

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:16.380
that you could ever take that notion
outside the high school auditorium.

00:07:16.946 --> 00:07:22.829
We spend so much time dismissing ideas
as democrat or republican.

00:07:23.216 --> 00:07:26.918
Rejecting proposals
because they came from headquarters,

00:07:26.942 --> 00:07:29.958
or from a region
that we think is not like ours.
