00:00:00.985 --> 00:00:03.768
At Free America, we've done
a listening and learning tour.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.834
We visited not only with prosecutors

00:00:07.858 --> 00:00:09.604
but with legislators,

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:14.489
with inmates in our state
and local prisons.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.932
We've gone to immigration
detention centers.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:19.675
We've met a lot of people.

00:00:21.174 --> 00:00:27.398
And we've seen that redemption
and transformation can happen

00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:32.109
in our prisons, our jails
and our immigration detention centers,
