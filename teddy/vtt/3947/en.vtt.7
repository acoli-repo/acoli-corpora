00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.649
And just because you're free,

00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:34.470
doesn't mean that you have freedom.

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:38.242
Many of us, for years,
have been battling our inner demons.

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:41.607
We walk around smiling
when inside we're really screamin':

00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:42.781
freedom!

00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:45.321
Don't you get it?

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:47.503
We're all serving time;

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.099
we're just in different places.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.931
As for me,

00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:53.535
I choose to be free
from the prisons I've created.

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:54.710
The key:

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:55.885
forgiveness.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.060
Action's my witness.

00:03:57.084 --> 00:03:58.234
If we want freedom,

00:03:59.122 --> 00:04:00.669
then we gotta think different.
