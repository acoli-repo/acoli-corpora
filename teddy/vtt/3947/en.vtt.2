00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:04.539
James served 12 years
in the San Quentin State Prison

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:07.213
and is being released in 18 months.

00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:09.774
Now James, like you and me,

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:12.714
is more than the worst thing he's done.

00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:16.608
He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet.

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:18.882
He committed a crime;

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:20.523
he's paying his debt,

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.011
and working hard to build the skills

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:26.122
to make the transition back
to a productive life

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:29.783
when he enters the civilian
population again.

00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:32.461
Now James, like millions
of people behind bars,
