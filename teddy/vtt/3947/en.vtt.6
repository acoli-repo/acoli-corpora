00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.989
I live in a world that
has been called "hell on Earth"

00:03:04.013 --> 00:03:05.723
by those trapped inside.

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:08.969
But I've come to the stark realization

00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:10.197
that prison --

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.316
it really is what you make it.

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:15.907
You see, in spite
of the harshness of my reality,

00:03:15.931 --> 00:03:17.391
there is a silver lining.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.288
I knew that my freedom was gonna come,

00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:21.701
it was just a matter of time.

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:25.117
And so I treated my first steps
as if they were my last mile,

00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:28.098
and I realized that you
don't have to be free

00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:29.791
in order to experience freedom.
