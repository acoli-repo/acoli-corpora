Now James, like millions
of people behind bars,

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:34.520
is an example of what happens

00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:38.995
if we believe that our failings
don't define who we are,

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:41.321
that we are all worthy of redemption

00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:45.582
and if we support those impacted
by mass incarceration,

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.233
we can all heal together.

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:50.320
I'd like to introduce you
to James right now,

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.828
and he's going to share
his journey of redemption

00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:54.002
through spoken word.

00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:57.782
James Cavitt: Thanks, John.
