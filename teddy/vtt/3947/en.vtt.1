00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:32.109
in our prisons, our jails
and our immigration detention centers,

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.150
giving hope to those
who want to create a better life

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:36.842
after serving their time.

00:00:38.028 --> 00:00:41.596
Imagine if we also considered
the front end of this prison pipeline.

00:00:41.964 --> 00:00:43.905
What would it look like
if we intervened,

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.882
with rehabilitation as a core value --

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:49.940
with love and compassion as core values?

00:00:50.523 --> 00:00:52.822
We would have a society that is safer,

00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:53.997
healthier

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:55.870
and worthy of raising our children in.

00:00:56.864 --> 00:00:59.536
I want to introduce you to James Cavitt.
