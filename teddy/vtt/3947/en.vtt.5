00:02:28.218 --> 00:02:31.852
I live in a world where most people
are too afraid to go.

00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:34.777
Surrounded by tall, concrete walls,

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:35.952
steel bars,

00:02:35.976 --> 00:02:37.270
where razor wire have a way

00:02:37.294 --> 00:02:40.380
of cutting away at the hopes
for a brighter tomorrow.

00:02:41.697 --> 00:02:42.848
I live in a world

00:02:42.872 --> 00:02:44.405
that kill people who kill people

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:45.580
in order to teach people

00:02:45.604 --> 00:02:47.000
that killing people is wrong.

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:49.577
Imagine that.

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:51.262
Better yet,

00:02:51.286 --> 00:02:54.356
imagine a world where healed people
helped hurt people heal

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.633
and become strong.

00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:59.618
Maybe then we would all
be singin' "Redemption Song."
