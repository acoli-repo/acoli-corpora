00:00:01.083 --> 00:00:02.851
I have two teenage boys.

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:05.143
One is 16 and one is 13.

00:00:05.167 --> 00:00:07.351
And like most families
with multiple children,

00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:09.143
they are completely different.

00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:12.393
Both are wonderful and have
many great qualities about them,

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:14.143
however what really sets them apart

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:17.143
is that my older son
knows when to bite his tongue

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:19.809
and my young son, not so much.

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:23.143
You see, my younger son
really struggles with having a filter,

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:25.101
especially when it comes to speaking up

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.226
and saying exactly what's on his mind.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.518
About three years ago,

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:31.601
a bunch of kids and adults
in the neighborhood had come together
