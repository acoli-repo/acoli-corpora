00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is actually a painting

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In the front, you see, actually, Joe Murray

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
getting the patient ready for the transplant,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the Chief of Urology at Harvard,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
actually harvesting the kidney.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The kidney was indeed the first organ

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
ever to be transplanted to the human.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That was back in 1954,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
55 years ago.
