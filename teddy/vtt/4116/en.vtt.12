but it's also kind of a nervous habit.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.887
Like if I smoked, I'd probably just smoke instead.

00:06:04.887 --> 00:06:07.305
I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler.

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:10.726
You know, I'd be like --

00:06:10.726 --> 00:06:12.801
But in this case, you know, I whip this out

00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.829
and I sit there and look as if I have something

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:17.642
very important to do or attend to.

00:06:17.642 --> 00:06:20.866
But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:25.271
I spent just secluding away,

00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:28.483
be it email or social posts or whatnot,

00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:29.930
even though it wasn't really --

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.911
there's nothing really that important or that pressing.
