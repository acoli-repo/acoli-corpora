00:04:56.745 --> 00:05:00.501
talking to people and so forth.

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:04.047
This project has lasted now, been just over two years.

00:05:04.047 --> 00:05:06.557
We've learned an amazing amount.

00:05:06.557 --> 00:05:09.573
It's been really important to make it comfortable.

00:05:09.573 --> 00:05:13.652
So our first prototypes we built were huge.

00:05:13.652 --> 00:05:15.861
It was like cell phones strapped to your head.

00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:18.920
It was very heavy, pretty uncomfortable.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.121
We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.925
until she actually accepted the job,

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:27.209
and then she almost ran away screaming.

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.781
But we've come a long way.

00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:32.869
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.
