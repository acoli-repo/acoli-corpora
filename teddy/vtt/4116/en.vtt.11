And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:35.366
Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all,

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:38.531
but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments

00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:41.093
spent with my family, my kids.

00:05:41.093 --> 00:05:43.726
I just never would have dug out a camera

00:05:43.726 --> 00:05:46.285
or a phone or something else to take that moment.

00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:51.334
And lastly I've realized, in experimenting with this device,

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:55.399
that I also kind of have a nervous tic.

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:59.443
The cell phone is -- yeah, you have to look down on it and all that,

00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:01.940
but it's also kind of a nervous habit.
