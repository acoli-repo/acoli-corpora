He needs help getting 10 million dollars.

00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:31.278
I like to pay attention to these

00:02:31.278 --> 00:02:33.946
because that's how we originally funded the company,

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:38.067
and it's gone pretty well.

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:39.793
Though in all seriousness,

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:42.985
this position that you just saw me in,

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:45.417
looking down at my phone,

00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:49.609
that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass.

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.191
Because we ultimately questioned

00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.707
whether this is the ultimate future

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.697
of how you want to connect to other people in your life,

00:02:57.697 --> 00:03:00.051
how you want to connect to information.
