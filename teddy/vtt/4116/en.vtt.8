00:03:57.032 --> 00:04:00.087
and that's how we got that footage.

00:04:00.087 --> 00:04:03.186
And also you want something that frees your eyes.

00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:05.908
That's why we put the display up high,

00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:07.357
out of your line of sight,

00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:10.084
so it wouldn't be where you're looking

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:11.184
and it wouldn't be where you're making

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.305
eye contact with people.

00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:16.183
And also we wanted to free up the ears,

00:04:16.183 --> 00:04:20.189
so the sound actually goes through,

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.686
conducts straight to the bones in your cranium,

00:04:23.686 --> 00:04:27.230
which is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.693
And ironically, if you want to hear it better,

00:04:29.693 --> 00:04:32.334
you actually just cover your ear,
