In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself

00:03:31.282 --> 00:03:33.839
when you're out and about looking at your phone,

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:38.697
it's kind of, is this what you're meant to do with your body?

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:40.330
You're standing around there

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.698
and you're just rubbing

00:03:41.698 --> 00:03:43.531
this featureless piece of glass.

00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:46.255
You're just kind of moving around.

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:49.724
So when we developed Glass, we thought really about,

00:03:49.724 --> 00:03:52.921
can we make something that frees your hands?

00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:54.404
You saw all of the things people are doing

00:03:54.404 --> 00:03:55.947
in the video back there.

00:03:55.947 --> 00:03:57.032
They were all wearing Glass,

00:03:57.032 --> 00:04:00.087
and that's how we got that footage.
