00:04:29.693 --> 00:04:32.334
you actually just cover your ear,

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:37.446
which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works.

00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:40.487
My vision when we started Google 15 years ago

00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:41.804
was that eventually you wouldn't

00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:45.277
have to have a search query at all.

00:04:45.277 --> 00:04:48.567
You'd just have information come to you as you needed it.

00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:50.965
And this is now, 15 years later,

00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:53.405
sort of the first form factor

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:55.070
that I think can deliver that vision

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.745
when you're out and about on the street

00:04:56.745 --> 00:05:00.501
talking to people and so forth.
