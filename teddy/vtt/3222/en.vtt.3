00:01:26.454 --> 00:01:30.454
can follow a news feed
for each day of 1917

00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:34.621
and read what people
like Stravinsky or Trotsky,

00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:38.163
Lenin or Pavlova
and others thought and felt.

00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:43.621
We watch all those personalities
being ordinary people like you and me,

00:01:43.663 --> 00:01:45.579
not demigods,

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:52.579
and we see that history consists
of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.371
not only their "genius ideas."

00:01:56.621 --> 00:01:58.829
Our project was a shock for many Russians,

00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:04.454
who used to think that our country
has always been an autocratic empire
