00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:05.454
So last year, we built
a social network for dead people,

00:01:05.454 --> 00:01:07.871
named Project1917.com.

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:12.663
My team and I created our software,

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:17.996
digitized and uploaded
all possible real diaries and letters

00:01:17.996 --> 00:01:21.121
written by more than 3,000 people

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:22.663
100 years ago.

00:01:22.704 --> 00:01:26.413
So any user of our website or application

00:01:26.454 --> 00:01:30.454
can follow a news feed
for each day of 1917
