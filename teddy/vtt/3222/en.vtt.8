00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.163
By exposing history
in such a democratic way,

00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:03.579
through social media,

00:04:04.746 --> 00:04:09.996
we show that people in power
are not the only ones making choices.

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.329
That gives any user a possibility
of reclaiming history.

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:16.454
Ordinary people matter.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.329
They have an impact.

00:04:19.454 --> 00:04:20.621
Ideas matter.

00:04:21.454 --> 00:04:25.829
Journalists, scientists,
philosophers matter.

00:04:26.538 --> 00:04:27.913
We shape society.

00:04:28.788 --> 00:04:30.538
We all make history.
