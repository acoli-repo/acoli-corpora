Many Russians today do not believe
that Russia could ever have been

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:35.996
or ever will be a truly democratic nation,

00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:38.996
and this is due to the way
history has been framed

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:40.579
to the citizens of Russia.

00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:42.162
And this is not true.

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:48.787
To prove it, I spent two years
of my life trying to go 100 years back,

00:00:48.787 --> 00:00:51.121
to the year 1917,

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:53.621
the year of the Russian Revolution.

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:59.329
I asked myself, what if the internet
and Facebook existed 100 years ago?
