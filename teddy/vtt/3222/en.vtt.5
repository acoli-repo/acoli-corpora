and a democratic future,
as any other country could or still can.

00:02:33.246 --> 00:02:37.079
Reading the posts from 1917,

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.038
you learn that Russia
was the first country in the world

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.996
to abolish the death penalty,

00:02:42.038 --> 00:02:46.204
or one of the first ones
to grant women voting rights.

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.538
Knowing history and understanding
how ordinary people influenced history

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.454
can help us create a better future,

00:02:55.454 --> 00:02:59.204
because history is just a rehearsal
of what's happening right now.
