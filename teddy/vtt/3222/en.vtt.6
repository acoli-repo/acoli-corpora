00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:03.413
We do need new ways of telling history,

00:03:03.413 --> 00:03:04.996
and this year, for example,

00:03:05.038 --> 00:03:10.871
we started a new online project
that is called 1968Digital.com,

00:03:11.663 --> 00:03:16.496
and that is an online documentary series

00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:20.454
that gives you an impression
of that year, 1968,

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:24.038
a year marked by global social change

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:27.788
that, in many ways,
created the world as we know it now.

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.413
But we are making that history alive
