00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:04.454
who used to think that our country
has always been an autocratic empire

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:07.913
and the ideas of freedom and democracy
could never have prevailed,

00:02:07.913 --> 00:02:10.579
just because democracy
was not our destiny.

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:13.454
But if we take a broader look,

00:02:14.288 --> 00:02:15.871
it's not that black and white.

00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:22.454
Yes, 1917 led to 70 years
of communist dictatorship.

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.246
But with this project, we see that Russia
could have had a different history

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:32.288
and a democratic future,
as any other country could or still can.
