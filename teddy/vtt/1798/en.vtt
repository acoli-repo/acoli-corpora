00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.277
This is the first of two
rather extraordinary photographs

00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:04.651
I'm going to show you today.

00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:06.253
It was taken 18 years ago.

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:07.778
I was 19 years old at the time.

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:08.953
I had just returned

00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:11.763
from one of the deepest dives
I'd ever made at that time --

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:12.945
a little over 200 feet.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.914
And I had caught this little fish.

00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:17.708
It turns out that particular one
was the first of its kind

00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:18.886
ever taken alive.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.584
I'm not just an ichthyologist,
I'm a bona fide fish nerd.

00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:24.305
And to a fish nerd,
this is some pretty exciting stuff.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.250
More exciting was the fact
that the person who took this photo

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:28.610
is a guy named Jack Randall,

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:31.417
the greatest living
ichthyologist on earth --
