"Do you play basketball?"

00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:08.629
(Laughter)

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:13.342
From the neighbor across the street --

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:15.094
"Hey, do you hoop?" --

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:20.058

at TSA PreCheck --

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.184
(Laughter)

00:00:21.184 --> 00:00:23.519

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.855
(Laughter)

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.611
I despise fitting
