00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.276
It's time for humankind
to recognize a disturbing truth:

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.423
we have colonized the future.

00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:09.555
In wealthy countries, especially,

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.816
we treat it like a distant
colonial outpost

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.471
where we can freely dump ecological damage

00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:19.028
and technological risk
as if there was nobody there.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.971
The tragedy is that tomorrow's
generations aren't here

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:24.936
to challenge this pillaging
of their inheritance.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.916
They can't leap in front
of the king's horse like a suffragette

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.270
or stage a sit-in
like a civil rights activist
