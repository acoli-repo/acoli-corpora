to see through that uncertainty.

00:03:14.664 --> 00:03:17.276
I must add to this,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.228
I very much hope that when we go
on the other side in the recovery,

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:26.729
we can use a new term
and call it "the Great Transformation."

00:03:27.754 --> 00:03:29.754
