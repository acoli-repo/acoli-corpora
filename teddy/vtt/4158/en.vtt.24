00:12:06.244 --> 00:12:10.910
make sure that in the center
of the financial safety net is an IMF

00:12:10.934 --> 00:12:12.534
with financial strength.

00:12:13.252 --> 00:12:17.486
We have four times
more money to lend today

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.232
than we had then.

00:12:19.256 --> 00:12:23.359
From 250 billion to one trillion dollars.

00:12:23.383 --> 00:12:24.559
And of course,

00:12:24.583 --> 00:12:26.712
we are deploying these funds

00:12:26.736 --> 00:12:30.061
exactly for the countries
that need us the most.
