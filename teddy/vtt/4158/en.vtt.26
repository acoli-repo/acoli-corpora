Amazing, we had the Paris Club, China,

00:13:05.297 --> 00:13:06.693
the Gulf countries,

00:13:06.717 --> 00:13:12.569
all agreeing that we should not
suffocate the poorest countries

00:13:12.593 --> 00:13:14.903
by asking them to pay their debts

00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:17.712
when their economies are standing still.

00:13:19.307 --> 00:13:22.355

that some developing countries

00:13:22.379 --> 00:13:25.593
are overdoing the lockdown policy?

00:13:25.617 --> 00:13:29.655
I mean, if large numbers of your citizens
are already struggling to stay alive,

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:33.979
isn't it almost like a death sentence
to order them not to leave their homes?
