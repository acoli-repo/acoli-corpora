00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:33.466
as we are receiving incoming data,

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.180
not very many, but there are still
some positive surprises,

00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:40.990
and they come from countries
that have built stronger buffers,

00:10:41.014 --> 00:10:42.481
stronger fundamentals,

00:10:42.505 --> 00:10:45.324
have been more disciplined
during good times.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.992
But indeed, we do see

00:10:48.016 --> 00:10:51.976
quite a number of emerging markets,
developing countries,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.675
faced with multiple pressures.

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:58.356
They had the hit from the coronavirus,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.983
many of them with weak health systems.
