00:06:58.848 --> 00:07:01.292
Not a full recovery, unfortunately,

00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:03.249
but coming to a better place.

00:07:03.641 --> 00:07:06.164
Now, what helps us

00:07:06.188 --> 00:07:10.283
is something that I
don't particularly love,

00:07:10.307 --> 00:07:14.379
but I see it as a positive feature --

00:07:14.403 --> 00:07:17.149
very low interest rates,

00:07:17.173 --> 00:07:19.442
in some cases, negative --

00:07:19.466 --> 00:07:26.442
that allows this injection
of fiscal measures and liquidity

00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:29.791
to be sustained over a number of years.

00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:33.331
And for now, we do not see on the horizon
