00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.102
we predicted 160 countries
to have positive income per capita growth.

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:38.418
Now it is 170 countries
with negative income per capita growth.

00:02:38.974 --> 00:02:42.490
Now this, we call "the Great Reversal."

00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:44.480
Very painful.

00:02:44.782 --> 00:02:47.615
And three, uncertainty.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.441
We always live with uncertainty, Chris,

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:52.085
but this time,

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.212
it is the uncertainty
of a novel coronavirus

00:02:57.236 --> 00:03:00.725
that policymakers have to integrate.
