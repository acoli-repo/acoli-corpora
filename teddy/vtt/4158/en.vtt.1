How are you doing?

00:00:42.712 --> 00:00:46.831
KG: Well, I find strength in action.

00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:48.855
And at the Fund,

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.379
we have been, from day one on this crisis,

00:00:52.403 --> 00:00:55.871
leaning forward with everything we have

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:59.014
to provide lifelines to countries,

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:03.421
and that means to people and businesses.
