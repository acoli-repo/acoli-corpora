00:12:26.736 --> 00:12:30.061
exactly for the countries
that need us the most.

00:12:30.085 --> 00:12:31.720
And we did one more thing.

00:12:31.744 --> 00:12:35.783
With David Malpass,
the president of the World Bank,

00:12:35.807 --> 00:12:41.506
we called for a debt moratorium
for the poorest countries

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.053
to their official bilateral creditors.

00:12:45.077 --> 00:12:48.760
And people tend to say,
"Oh, we don't work together,

00:12:48.784 --> 00:12:50.117
it's not good enough."

00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:56.260
But here is an area
where we made this call in late March,

00:12:56.284 --> 00:12:57.918
and in mid-April,

00:12:57.942 --> 00:13:01.365
the G20 agreed on this moratorium.
