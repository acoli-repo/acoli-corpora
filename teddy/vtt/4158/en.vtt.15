00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:33.331
And for now, we do not see on the horizon

00:07:33.355 --> 00:07:36.934
any return to increase in interest rates.

00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.371
So low for longer,

00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:44.359
and that is, in that environment,
a helpful feature.

00:07:46.748 --> 00:07:50.597
CA: I mean, the financial crisis of 2008

00:07:50.621 --> 00:07:53.648
came perilously close to breaking
the entire financial system --

00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:55.507
arguably, it did that.

00:07:55.531 --> 00:07:57.849
By most people's calculation,

00:07:57.873 --> 00:08:01.667
this is a far worse impact
to the economy overall.
