00:00:00.954 --> 00:00:03.287
I am a linguist.

00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:05.704
Linguists study language.

00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:08.621
And we do this in a lot of different ways.

00:00:08.663 --> 00:00:11.704
Some linguists study
how we pronounce certain sounds.

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:14.246
Others look at how we build sentences.

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:17.704
And some study how language varies
from place to place,

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:19.246
just to name a few.

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:21.663
But what I'm really interested in

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:25.329
is what people think
and believe about language

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.329
and how these beliefs affect
the way we use it.

00:00:29.288 --> 00:00:32.912
All of us have deeply held
beliefs about language
