00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.080
where all parts of the bag
expand during inhalation

00:04:00.104 --> 00:04:02.577
and contract during exhalation.

00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:05.878
Inside of the bag, there's a series
of branching tubes,

00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:08.385
and these tubes are called
the bronchial tree.

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:15.014
These tubes deliver the inhaled oxygen
to, ultimately, the alveolus.

00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:20.080
They cross over a thin membrane
into the bloodstream by diffusion.

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.750
Now, this part is critical.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.925
The entire mammalian lung is mobile.

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.967
That means it's moving
during the entire respiratory process,
