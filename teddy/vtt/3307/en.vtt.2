00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:02.805
how the specialized dinosaur lung
helped them take over the planet.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:07.498
So we are going to jump back
over 200 million years

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:09.275
to the Triassic period.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.691
The environment was extremely harsh,

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:13.355
there were no flowering plants,

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.634
so this means that there was no grass.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:20.056
So imagine a landscape
filled with all pine trees and ferns.

00:01:20.587 --> 00:01:24.040
At the same time,
there were small lizards,

00:01:24.064 --> 00:01:26.455
mammals, insects,

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.793
and there were also carnivorous
and herbivorous reptiles --
