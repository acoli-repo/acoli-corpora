00:04:59.955 --> 00:05:04.172
air passes through the lung,
but the lung does not expand or contract.

00:05:04.707 --> 00:05:06.648
The lung is immobilized,

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:08.964
it has the texture of a dense sponge

00:05:08.988 --> 00:05:14.195
and it's inflexible and locked into place
on the top and sides by the ribcage

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:17.313
and on the bottom
by a horizontal membrane.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.386
It is then unidirectionally ventilated

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.398
by a series of flexible,
bag-like structures

00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:28.210
that branch off of the bronchial tree,

00:05:28.234 --> 00:05:29.822
beyond the lung itself,

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:31.716
and these are called air sacs.
