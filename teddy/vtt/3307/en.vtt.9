00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.967
That means it's moving
during the entire respiratory process,

00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:34.577
so that thin membrane,
the blood-gas barrier,

00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:37.636
cannot be too thin or it will break.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.202
Now, remember the blood-gas barrier,
because we will be returning to this.

00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:43.206
So, you're still with me?

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.858
Because we're going to start birds
and it gets crazy,

00:04:45.882 --> 00:04:47.322
so hold on to your butts.

00:04:47.346 --> 00:04:48.951
(Laughter)

00:04:49.648 --> 00:04:52.903
The bird is completely different
from the mammal.

00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:55.888
And we are going to be
using birds as our model

00:04:55.912 --> 00:04:58.343
to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs.

00:04:58.367 --> 00:04:59.931
So in the bird,

00:04:59.955 --> 00:05:04.172
air passes through the lung,
but the lung does not expand or contract.
