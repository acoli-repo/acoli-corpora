00:08:58.904 --> 00:09:02.378
means that they had
the capability to evolve a lung

00:09:02.402 --> 00:09:04.140
that would have been able to breathe

00:09:04.164 --> 00:09:09.283
under the hypoxic, or low-oxygen,
atmosphere of the Triassic period.

00:09:09.981 --> 00:09:15.078
This rigid skeletal setup in dinosaurs
would have given them

00:09:15.102 --> 00:09:20.585
a significant adaptive advantage
over other animals, particularly mammals,

00:09:20.609 --> 00:09:23.310
whose flexible lung couldn't have adapted

00:09:23.334 --> 00:09:27.129
to the hypoxic, or low-oxygen,
atmosphere of the Triassic.

00:09:27.664 --> 00:09:32.734
This anatomy may have been
the secret weapon of dinosaurs
