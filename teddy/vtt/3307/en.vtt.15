00:07:29.393 --> 00:07:31.928
and we apply that to the fossil record?

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:36.814
So, clue number one
was the forked ribs of modern birds.

00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:41.249
Well, we find that in pretty much
the majority of dinosaurs.

00:07:41.734 --> 00:07:46.531
So that means that the top surface
of the lungs of dinosaurs

00:07:46.555 --> 00:07:48.869
would be locked into place,

00:07:48.893 --> 00:07:51.845
just like modern birds.

00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:55.406
Clue number two is vertebral pneumaticity.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.237
We find this in sauropod dinosaurs
and theropod dinosaurs,
