00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:31.426
who are their closest living relatives,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.443
and then we would look at
the anatomy of lizards and turtles,

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:37.072
who we can think of like their cousins.

00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:40.532
And then we apply these anatomical data
to the fossil record,

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:44.199
and then we can use that
to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs.

00:02:44.223 --> 00:02:46.267
And in this specific instance,

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:51.205
the skeleton of dinosaurs most closely
resembles that of modern birds.

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:56.462
So, because dinosaurs were competing with
early mammals during this time period,

00:02:56.486 --> 00:03:00.145
it's important to understand
the basic blueprint of the mammalian lung.
