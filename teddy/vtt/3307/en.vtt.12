00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:02.474
And this is called
"vertebral pneumaticity."

00:06:02.498 --> 00:06:05.740
The forked ribs and
the vertebral pneumaticity

00:06:05.764 --> 00:06:09.281
are two clues that we can hunt for
in the fossil record,

00:06:09.305 --> 00:06:11.894
because these two skeletal traits

00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:16.637
would indicate that regions
of the respiratory system of dinosaurs

00:06:16.661 --> 00:06:18.335
are immobilized.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.806
This anchoring of the respiratory system

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.737
facilitated the evolution
of the thinning of the blood-gas barrier,

00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:33.860
that thin membrane over which oxygen
was diffusing into the bloodstream.
