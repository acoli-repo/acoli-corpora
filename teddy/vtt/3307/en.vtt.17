00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:31.245
and locking regions
of the respiratory system into place,

00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:32.869
immobilizing them.

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:35.923
The forked ribs

00:08:35.947 --> 00:08:38.791
and the vertebral pneumaticity together

00:08:38.815 --> 00:08:43.722
were creating an immobilized,
rigid framework

00:08:43.746 --> 00:08:46.688
that locked the respiratory
system into place

00:08:46.712 --> 00:08:52.486
that permitted the evolution of that
superthin, superdelicate blood-gas barrier

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.366
that we see today in modern birds.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.880
Evidence of this straightjacketed
lung in dinosaurs

00:08:58.904 --> 00:09:02.378
means that they had
the capability to evolve a lung
