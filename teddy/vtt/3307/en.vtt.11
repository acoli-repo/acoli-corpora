00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:31.716
and these are called air sacs.

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:37.607
Now, this entire extremely delicate setup
is locked into place

00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:40.820
by a series of forked ribs

00:05:40.844 --> 00:05:43.549
all along the thoracic ceiling.

00:05:43.573 --> 00:05:46.655
Also, in many species of birds,

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:49.103
extensions arise from the lung

00:05:49.127 --> 00:05:50.673
and the air sacs,

00:05:50.697 --> 00:05:53.305
they invade the skeletal tissues --

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:56.031
usually the vertebrae,
sometimes the ribs --

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:59.014
and they lock the respiratory
system into place.

00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:02.474
And this is called
"vertebral pneumaticity."
