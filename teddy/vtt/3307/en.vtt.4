00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:02.716
since all that remains of a dinosaur
generally is its fossilized skeleton?

00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:08.349
The method that we use is called
"extant phylogenetic bracketing."

00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:13.130
This is a fancy way of saying
that we study the anatomy --

00:02:13.154 --> 00:02:16.730
specifically in this case,
the lungs and skeleton --

00:02:16.754 --> 00:02:20.732
of the living descendants of dinosaurs
on the evolutionary tree.

00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:24.199
So we would look at the anatomy of birds,

00:02:24.223 --> 00:02:27.081
who are the direct
descendants of dinosaurs,

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.454
and we'd look at
the anatomy of crocodilians,

00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:31.426
who are their closest living relatives,
