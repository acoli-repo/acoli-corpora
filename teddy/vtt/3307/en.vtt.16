00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.237
We find this in sauropod dinosaurs
and theropod dinosaurs,

00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:03.536
which is the group that contains
predatory dinosaurs

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.782
and gave rise to modern birds.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:11.589
And while we don't find evidence
of fossilized lung tissue in dinosaurs,

00:08:11.613 --> 00:08:16.162
vertebral pneumaticity gives us evidence
of what the lung was doing

00:08:16.186 --> 00:08:18.638
during the life of these animals.

00:08:19.211 --> 00:08:24.556
Lung tissue or air sac tissue
was invading the vertebrae,

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.087
hollowing them out
just like a modern bird,

00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:31.245
and locking regions
of the respiratory system into place,
