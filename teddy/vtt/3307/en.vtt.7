00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:36.025

This is our thoracic ceiling.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.399
This is where the top surface of the lungs

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.748
with the ribs and vertebrae.

00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:49.863
This interface is where

00:03:50.398 --> 00:03:53.433

the lungs of a dog.

00:03:53.457 --> 00:03:56.645
On the outside, it's like
a giant inflatable bag

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.080
where all parts of the bag
expand during inhalation
