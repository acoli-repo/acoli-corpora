00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.793
and there were also carnivorous
and herbivorous reptiles --

00:01:30.817 --> 00:01:33.104
all competing for the same resources.

00:01:33.454 --> 00:01:34.995
Critical to this story

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:40.347
is that oxygen levels have been estimated
to have been as low as 15 percent,

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:42.524
compared to today's 21 percent.

00:01:42.932 --> 00:01:46.519
So it would have been crucial
for dinosaurs to be able to breathe

00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:48.418
in this low-oxygen environment,

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:50.297
not only to survive

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:53.010
but to thrive and to diversify.

00:01:54.462 --> 00:01:57.559
So, how do we know
what dinosaur lungs were even like,

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:02.716
since all that remains of a dinosaur
generally is its fossilized skeleton?
