When people think about
why dinosaurs were so amazing,

00:00:31.438 --> 00:00:35.243
they usually think about the biggest
or the smallest dinosaur,

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.712
or who was the fastest,

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.304
or who had the most feathers,

00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:41.234
the most ridiculous armor,
spikes or teeth.

00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:46.110
But perhaps the answer had to do
with their internal anatomy --

00:00:46.134 --> 00:00:48.326
a secret weapon, so to speak.

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:52.423
My colleagues and I,
we think it was their lungs.

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.403
I am both a paleontologist
and a comparative anatomist,

00:00:57.427 --> 00:00:59.372
and I am interested in understanding

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:02.805
how the specialized dinosaur lung
helped them take over the planet.
