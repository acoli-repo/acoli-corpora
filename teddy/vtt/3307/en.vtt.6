00:02:56.486 --> 00:03:00.145
it's important to understand
the basic blueprint of the mammalian lung.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.431
Also, to reintroduce you
to lungs in general,

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:06.090
we will use my dog Mila of Troy,

00:03:06.114 --> 00:03:08.154
the face that launched a thousand treats,

00:03:08.178 --> 00:03:09.397
as our model.

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:11.004
(Laughter)

00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:14.764
This story takes place
inside of a chest cavity.

00:03:14.788 --> 00:03:17.985
So I want you to visualize
the ribcage of a dog.

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.466
Think about how
the spinal vertebral column

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.759
is completely horizontal to the ground.

00:03:23.783 --> 00:03:26.358
This is how the spinal
vertebral column is going to be

00:03:26.382 --> 00:03:28.788
in all of the animals
that we'll be talking about,

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:30.310
whether they walked on two legs
