00:06:57.536 --> 00:07:03.627
and a thin membrane is one way
of enhancing respiration

00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:05.987
under low-oxygen conditions --

00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:10.592
low-oxygen conditions
like that of the Triassic period.

00:07:11.425 --> 00:07:16.130
So, if dinosaurs did indeed
have this type of lung,

00:07:16.154 --> 00:07:20.211
they'd be better equipped to breathe
than all other animals,

00:07:20.235 --> 00:07:22.369
including mammals.

00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:26.466
So do you remember the extant
phylogenetic bracket method

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.369
where we take the anatomy
of modern animals,

00:07:29.393 --> 00:07:31.928
and we apply that to the fossil record?
