Hello everyone.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I'm going to be folding one of Robert Lang's models.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And this is the piece of paper it will be made from,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And Rufus is going to be doing some improvisation

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
on his custom, five-string electric cello,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and it's very exciting to listen to him.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Are you ready to go? OK.
