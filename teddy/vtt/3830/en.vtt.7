00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:30.438
but in the storm, the waves were
the size of a seven-story building.

00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:32.614
Her boat kept capsizing.

00:03:32.614 --> 00:03:35.818
Some of them were pitchpole capsizes,
flipping her end over end,

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:38.303
and rowing became impossible.

00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:40.536
(Video) TMM: It's 6:30 a.m.

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:45.060
I'm in something big, bad and ugly.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.660
Two capsizes.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.477
Last capsize, I took the rib
off the top of my ceiling with my back.

00:03:56.356 --> 00:03:59.839
I've had about six capsizes now.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.346
The last one was a pitchpole.
