00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:34.667
The waves

00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:37.024
are tearing the boat to shreds.

00:04:38.556 --> 00:04:40.042
I keep praying because

00:04:40.042 --> 00:04:42.550
I'm not sure I'm going
to make it through this.

00:04:43.128 --> 00:04:45.447
DL: Tori set off her distress beacon

00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:48.341
and was rescued
by a passing container ship.

00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:52.325
They found her abandoned boat
two months later adrift near France.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.506
I read about it in the newspaper.

00:04:55.506 --> 00:04:59.779
In 1998, I was a high school student
living in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.333
Now, I live in New York City.
I'm a songwriter.
