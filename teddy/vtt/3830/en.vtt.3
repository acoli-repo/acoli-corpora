00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.409
following a storm that disabled
all her long-range communications systems

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.123
just five days in.

00:01:33.123 --> 00:01:35.144
Most days looked like this.

00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:38.905
At this point, she'd rowed
over 200,000 strokes,

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:41.227
fighting the current and the wind.

00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:44.710
Some days, she traveled
as little as 15 feet.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.219
Yeah.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.866
And as frustrating as those days were,

00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:51.908
other days were like this.

00:01:51.908 --> 00:01:55.019
(Video) TMM: And I want to show you
my little friends.

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:59.930
DL: She saw fish, dolphins,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.461
whales, sharks,
