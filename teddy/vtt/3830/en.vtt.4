00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.461
whales, sharks,

00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:05.340
and even some sea turtles.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.615
After two weeks with no human contact,

00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:09.937
Tori was able to contact
a local cargo ship

00:02:09.937 --> 00:02:12.863
via VHF radio.

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:16.648
(Video) TMM: Do you guys
have a weather report, over?

00:02:16.648 --> 00:02:19.782
Man: Heading up to a low

00:02:19.782 --> 00:02:22.267
ahead of you but it's heading,

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.147
and you're obviously going northeast

00:02:24.147 --> 00:02:26.051
and there's a high behind us.

00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:27.909
That'd be coming

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.416
east-northeast also.
