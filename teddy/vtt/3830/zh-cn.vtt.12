00:05:57.211 --> 00:06:00.601
肯塔基的繁星，
and stars of Kentucky

00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:03.875
全被月光燃尽，
burned in the moonlight,

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:07.451
让我心醉神迷。
making me smile.

00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:10.484
但我此刻惊醒，
And when I awoke here,

00:06:10.484 --> 00:06:14.161
空中布满乌云。
the sky was so cloudy.

00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:17.534
聚会仍在进行，
I walked to a party

00:06:17.534 --> 00:06:20.995
旧时知心好友
where people I know

00:06:20.995 --> 00:06:24.222
纷纷表示关心，
try hard to know me

00:06:24.222 --> 00:06:27.426
问我去了哪里，
and ask where I've been,

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:30.514
让我如何回应，
but I can't explain
