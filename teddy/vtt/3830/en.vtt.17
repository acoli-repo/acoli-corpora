One day, at lunch with her new boss,

00:08:32.558 --> 00:08:34.926
Tori shares the news
that two other women

00:08:34.926 --> 00:08:37.689
are setting out to row
across the mid-Atlantic,

00:08:37.689 --> 00:08:41.381
to do something that she
almost died trying to do.

00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:44.502
His response was classic Ali:

00:08:44.502 --> 00:08:46.418
"You don't want to go through life

00:08:46.418 --> 00:08:50.175
as the woman who almost
rowed across the ocean."

00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:52.172
He was right.

00:08:52.172 --> 00:08:53.890
Tori rebuilt the American Pearl,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.678
and in December of 1999,

00:08:55.678 --> 00:08:57.954
she did it.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.995
