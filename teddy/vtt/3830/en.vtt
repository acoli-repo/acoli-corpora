00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:02.807
In June of 1998,

00:00:02.807 --> 00:00:08.147
Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head,
North Carolina for France.

00:00:08.147 --> 00:00:10.469
That's her boat, the American Pearl.

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.913
It's 23 feet long and just six feet across

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:14.881
at its widest point.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:19.873
The deck was the size of a cargo bed
of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.

00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:22.357
Tori and her friends built it by hand,

00:00:22.357 --> 00:00:25.051
and it weighed about 1,800 pounds.

00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.414
Her plan was to row it alone

00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:29.364
across the Atlantic Ocean --

00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:31.500
no motor, no sail --
