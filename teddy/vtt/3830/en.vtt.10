00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.333
Now, I live in New York City.
I'm a songwriter.

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:05.630
And her bravery stuck with me,
and I'm adapting her story

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.252
into a musical called "Row."

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.639
When Tori returned home,

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.473
she was feeling disheartened,

00:05:16.473 --> 00:05:17.667
she was broke.

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:19.956
She was having a hard time
making the transition

00:05:19.956 --> 00:05:22.115
back into civilization.

00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:26.718
In this scene, she sits at home.

00:05:26.718 --> 00:05:28.965
The phone is ringing,
her friends are calling,

00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:31.171
but she doesn't know how to talk to them.
