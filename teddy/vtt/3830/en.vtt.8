00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.346
The last one was a pitchpole.

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:05.295
I have the Argus beacon with me.

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:07.083
I would set off the distress signal,

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:11.309
but quite frankly, I don't think they'd
ever be able to find this little boat.

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:13.120
It's so far underwater right now,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.299
the only part that's showing
pretty much is the cabin.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.434
It's about 10 a.m.

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:23.127
I've lost track of the number of capsizes.

00:04:23.127 --> 00:04:26.169
I seem to capsize about
every 15 minutes.

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.582
I think I may have broken my left arm.
