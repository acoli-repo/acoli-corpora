00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:01.286
It's blowing about.

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:04.165
It's blowing!

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.859
After 12 days of storm

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.693
I get to row for four hours

00:03:08.693 --> 00:03:10.837
without a flagging wind.

00:03:10.837 --> 00:03:12.527
I'm not very happy right now.

00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:14.196
As happy as I was this morning,

00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:18.050
I am unhappy now, so ...

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.195
DL: After nearly three months at sea,

00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:24.888
she'd covered over 3,000 miles.

00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:26.908
She was two thirds of the way there,

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:30.438
but in the storm, the waves were
the size of a seven-story building.
