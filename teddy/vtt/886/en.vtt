00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's a great honor today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to share with you

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The Digital Universe,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which was created for humanity

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to really see where we are

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
in the universe.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And so I think we can roll the video that we have.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
[The Himalayas.]

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
(Music)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The flat horizon that we've evolved with

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
has been a metaphor for the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
infinite: unbounded resources

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and unlimited capacity

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
for disposal of waste.
