Usually I like working in my shop,

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:06.958
but when it's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river,

00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:08.998
then I just love it.

00:00:08.998 --> 00:00:12.329
And I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water,

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.208
and maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers.

00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:18.140
You have no idea how much time I spend.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.167
This is the "Double Raindrop."

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:23.292
Of all my sculptures, it's the most talkative.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.442
It adds together the interference pattern
