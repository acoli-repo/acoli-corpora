So, what I am is a historian of medicine.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.392
So I started to research
the history of chronic pain.

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:43.978
Turns out, UCLA has an entire
history of pain collection

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.166
in their archives.

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:50.045
And I found a story --
a fantastic story --

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:55.865
of a man who saved -- rescued --
millions of people from pain;

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.277
people like my mom.

00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:00.232
Yet, I had never heard of him.
