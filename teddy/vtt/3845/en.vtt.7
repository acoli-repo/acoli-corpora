00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:31.310
He was a heel;

00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:32.491
he was a hero.

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:34.834
He inflicted pain,

00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:36.016
and he treated it.

00:03:37.242 --> 00:03:40.744
And he didn’t know it at the time,
but over the next five decades,

00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:43.586
he'd draw on these dueling identities

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.923
to forge a whole new way
to think about pain.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.750
It'd change modern medicine
so much so, that decades later,

00:03:51.774 --> 00:03:56.276
Time magazine would call him
pain relief's founding father.

00:03:57.351 --> 00:03:58.844
But that all happened later.
