00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:00.232
Yet, I had never heard of him.

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:03.888
There were no biographies
of him, no Hollywood movies.

00:01:04.483 --> 00:01:08.272
His name was John J. Bonica.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.618
But when our story begins,

00:01:10.642 --> 00:01:14.755
he was better known as
Johnny "Bull" Walker.

00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:18.951
It was a summer day in 1941.

00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:25.017
The circus had just arrived
in the tiny town of Brookfield, New York.

00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:29.407
Spectators flocked to see
the wire-walkers, the tramp clowns --

00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:32.166
if they were lucky, the human cannonball.
