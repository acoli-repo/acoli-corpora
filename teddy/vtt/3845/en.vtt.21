00:10:27.423 --> 00:10:30.962
On a business trip to Florida
in the early 1980s,

00:10:30.986 --> 00:10:36.318
Bonica got a former student to drive
him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa.

00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:41.482
They drove past palm trees
and pulled up to an old mansion,

00:10:41.506 --> 00:10:46.116
with giant silver howitzer cannons
hidden in the garage.

00:10:46.895 --> 00:10:49.834
The house belonged to the Zacchini family,

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:52.830
who were something like
American circus royalty.

00:10:54.229 --> 00:10:56.802
Decades earlier, Bonica had watched them,

00:10:56.826 --> 00:10:59.713
clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles,

00:10:59.737 --> 00:11:03.505
doing the act they pioneered --
the Human Cannonball.
