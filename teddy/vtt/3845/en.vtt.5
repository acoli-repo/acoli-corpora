Now, the strongman hadn't told anyone,

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:36.175
but he was actually
a third-year medical student.

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:40.450
He toured with the circus
during summers to pay tuition,

00:02:40.474 --> 00:02:43.184
but kept it a secret
to protect his persona.

00:02:43.787 --> 00:02:47.191
He was supposed to be
a brute, a villain --

00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:49.437
not a nerdy do-gooder.

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:53.132
His medical colleagues didn't
know his secret, either.

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:57.235
As he put it, "If you were
an athlete, you were a dumb dodo."

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.320
So he didn't tell them about the circus,
