He was running out of air;

00:02:01.312 --> 00:02:03.479
the crowd watched in horror

00:02:03.503 --> 00:02:06.407
as he struggled and then passed out.

00:02:06.788 --> 00:02:10.049
When the lion finally did relax its jaws,

00:02:10.073 --> 00:02:14.527
the lion tamer just slumped
to the ground, motionless.

00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:18.182
When he came to a few minutes later,

00:02:18.206 --> 00:02:20.346
he saw a familiar figure hunched over him.

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.169
It was Bull Walker.

00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:29.049
The strongman had given the lion tamer
mouth-to-mouth, and saved his life.
