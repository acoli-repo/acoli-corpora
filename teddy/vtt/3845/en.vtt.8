00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:05.791
In 1942, Bonica graduated
medical school and married Emma,

00:04:05.815 --> 00:04:09.491
his sweetheart, whom he had met
at one of his matches years before.

00:04:10.505 --> 00:04:13.321
He still wrestled in secret -- he had to.

00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:18.428
His internship at New York's
St. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing.

00:04:19.101 --> 00:04:22.853
With his championship belt,
he wrestled in big-ticket venues,

00:04:22.877 --> 00:04:24.814
like Madison Square Garden,

00:04:24.838 --> 00:04:26.514
against big-time opponents,

00:04:26.538 --> 00:04:29.387
like Everett "The Blonde Bear" Marshall,

00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:33.053
or three-time world champion,
Angelo Savoldi.
