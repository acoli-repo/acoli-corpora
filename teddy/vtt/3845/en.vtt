00:00:00.825 --> 00:00:02.723
A few years ago,

00:00:02.747 --> 00:00:06.293
my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis.

00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:13.088
Her wrists, knees and toes swelled up,
causing crippling, chronic pain.

00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:16.081
She had to file for disability.

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:18.734
She stopped attending our local mosque.

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:22.913
Some mornings it was too painful
for her to brush her teeth.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:25.516
I wanted to help.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.266
But I didn't know how.

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:29.941
I'm not a doctor.
