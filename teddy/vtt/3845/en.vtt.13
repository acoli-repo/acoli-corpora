00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.764
Treating so many patients,
Bonica started noticing cases

00:06:31.788 --> 00:06:34.283
that contradicted everything
he had learned.

00:06:34.976 --> 00:06:39.822
Pain was supposed to be
a kind of alarm bell -- in a good way --

00:06:39.846 --> 00:06:43.446
a body's way of signaling an injury,
like a broken arm.

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:46.150
But in some cases,

00:06:46.174 --> 00:06:49.649
like after a patient had a leg amputated,

00:06:49.673 --> 00:06:53.694
that patient might still complain
of pain in that nonexistent leg.

00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:58.223
But if the injury had been treated, why
would the alarm bell keep ringing?

00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:02.990
There were other cases in which there
was no evidence of an injury whatsoever,
