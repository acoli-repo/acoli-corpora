Her father was at work
when he had fallen from the fourth floor

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.256
and really hurt his back.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.416
And he talked a lot about what it was like
to be flat on your back

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.880
and not get the kind
of care that you need.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.160
And that propelled Bridget
to go into the profession of nursing.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.616
Now, as a nurse in the Bronx,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.056
she has a really diverse group
of patients that she cares for,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.976
from all walks of life,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.960
and from all different religions.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.576
And she's devoted her career
to understanding the impact

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.200
of our cultural differences
when it comes to our health.
