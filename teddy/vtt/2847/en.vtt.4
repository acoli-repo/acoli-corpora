It's that you're worried that everybody's

Joanne made me feel normal
for the first time in six months.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.175
We talked about her boyfriends,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.936
we talked about looking
for apartments in New York City,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.816
and we talked about my reaction
to the chemotherapy --

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.800
all kind of mixed in together.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.336
And I always wondered,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.000
how did she so instinctively
know just how to talk to me?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.896
Joanne Staha and my admiration for her

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.720
marked the beginning of my journey
into the world of nurses.
