00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.096
dealing with some of the biggest
public health issues facing our nation --

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.200
aging, war, poverty, prisons.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.096
And then we went places

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.976
where we would find
the largest concentration of patients

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.520
dealing with those issues.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.336
Then we asked hospitals and facilities
to nominate nurses

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.880
who would best represent them.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.640
One of the first nurses I met
was Bridget Kumbella.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.816
Bridget was born in Cameroon,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.680
the oldest of four children.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.256
Her father was at work
when he had fallen from the fourth floor
