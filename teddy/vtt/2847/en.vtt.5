00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.720
marked the beginning of my journey
into the world of nurses.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.776
A few years later,
I was asked to do a project

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.480
that would celebrate
the work that nurses do.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.616
I started with Joanne,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.640
and I met over 100 nurses
across the country.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.376
I spent five years interviewing,
photographing and filming nurses

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.560
for a book and a documentary film.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.776
With my team,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.136
we mapped a trip across America
that would take us to places

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.096
dealing with some of the biggest
public health issues facing our nation --
