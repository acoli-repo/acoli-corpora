00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.056
But then my chemo was scheduled to begin

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.816
and that terrified me

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.376
because I knew that I was going to lose
every single hair on my body

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.960
because of the kind of chemo
that I was going to have.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.776
I wasn't going to be able
to pretend anymore

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.600
as though everything was normal.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.736
I was scared.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.336
I knew what it felt like to have
everybody treating me with kid gloves,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.736
and I just wanted to feel normal.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.936
I had a port installed in my chest.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.736
I went to my first day of chemotherapy,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.096
and I was an emotional wreck.
