As a nurse in the Appalachian mountains,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.056
Jason goes places
that an ambulance can't even get to.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.520
In this photograph,
he's standing in what used to be a road.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.896
Top of the mountain mining
flooded that road,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.216
and now the only way
for Jason to get to the patient

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.136
living in that house
with black lung disease

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.480
is to drive his SUV
against the current up that creek.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.440
The day I was with him,
we ripped the front fender off the car.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.376
The next morning he got up,
put the car on the lift,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.656
fixed the fender,
