00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.080
and I said, "Really? Hair?"

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.976
And with a shrug
of her shoulders she said,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.360
"It's gonna grow back."

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.536
And in that moment she said
the one thing I had overlooked,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.376
and that was that at some point,
my life would get back to normal.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.096
She really believed that.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.800
And so I believed it, too.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.296
Now, worrying about losing your hair
when you're fighting cancer

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.936
may seem silly at first,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.096
but it's not just that you're worried
about how you're going to look.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.040
It's that you're worried that everybody's
going to treat you so carefully.
