00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.096
and I was an emotional wreck.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.135
My nurse, Joanne, walked in the door,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.136
and every bone in my body was telling
me to get up out of that chair

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.656
and take for the hills.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.440
But Joanne looked at me and talked
to me like we were old friends.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.656
And then she asked me,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.776
"Where'd you get your highlights done?"

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.896
(Laughter)

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.856
And I was like, are you kidding me?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.736
You're going to talk to me about my hair
when I'm on the verge of losing it?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.496
I was kind of angry,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.080
and I said, "Really? Hair?"
