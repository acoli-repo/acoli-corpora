00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.256
My mother was devastated,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.240
and she couldn't imagine
her world without him in it.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.296
Four days later she fell,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.176
she broke her hip,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.696
she needed surgery

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.640
and she found herself
fighting for her own life.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.616
Once again I found myself

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.616
on the receiving end
of the care of nurses --

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.080
this time for my mom.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.736
My brother and my sister and I
stayed by her side

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.200
for the next three days in the ICU.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.096
And as we tried
to make the right decisions
