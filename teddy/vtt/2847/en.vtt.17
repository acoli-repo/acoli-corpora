These technologies often save lives,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.080
but they can also prolong pain
and the dying process.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.816
How in the world are we supposed
to navigate these waters?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.888
We're going to need
all the help we can get.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.336
Nurses have a really unique
relationship with us

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.840
because of the time spent at bedside.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.976
During that time,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.520
a kind of emotional intimacy develops.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.216
This past summer, on August 9,

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.160
my father died of a heart attack.
