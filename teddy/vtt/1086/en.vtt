00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I am going to talk about myself,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which I rarely do, because I --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
well for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I didn't know I was a narcissist actually.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And then someone told me there is a flip side to it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So it's actually drearier than self-love;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it's unrequited self-love.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
(Laughter)
