00:16:29.128 --> 00:16:31.236
I think we're lacking this
at the moment --

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.865
(Laughter)

00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:34.237
but we can do it.

00:16:34.261 --> 00:16:36.279
The technology is certainly there.

00:16:36.303 --> 00:16:39.554
In addition to that, I think we need
another type of infrastructure.

00:16:39.578 --> 00:16:41.757
It would be good if we could
all get together.

00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:45.100
I think if we've learned anything
through the TED experience,

00:16:45.124 --> 00:16:47.860
it's that there is power
when we bring people together,

00:16:47.884 --> 00:16:51.297
and I think we need to bring people
together at the local level as well.

00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:54.519
And I think we can take some inspiration
from a previous movement,

00:16:54.543 --> 00:16:55.980
which was the grange movement,

00:16:56.004 --> 00:17:00.557
a rural movement which brought farmers
together in a single building
