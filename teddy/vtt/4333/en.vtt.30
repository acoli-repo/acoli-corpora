00:14:59.008 --> 00:15:01.242
and I'm happy to say, as a Mainer,

00:15:01.266 --> 00:15:03.629
that we are leading the way in this area.

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:06.110
Earlier this year, a number of Maine towns

00:15:06.134 --> 00:15:08.525
passed local food sovereignty laws

00:15:08.549 --> 00:15:11.485
that allow town residents
to not only grow food

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:12.830
where they want to grow it

00:15:12.854 --> 00:15:15.727
but to also sell it
the way they want to sell it

00:15:15.751 --> 00:15:17.838
and to the people they want to sell it to.

00:15:17.862 --> 00:15:19.689
I think that's an incentive.

00:15:19.713 --> 00:15:21.547
There are a lot of gardeners out there

00:15:21.571 --> 00:15:24.928
that would be interested in scaling up
their production if they could,

00:15:24.952 --> 00:15:26.803
if they had a financial incentive.

00:15:27.247 --> 00:15:29.428
I also think that we need to examine

00:15:29.452 --> 00:15:32.454
the composition of the movement right now.
