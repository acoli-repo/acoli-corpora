00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.817
Now, that's a funny little clip,

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:03.286
but it'd be even funnier
if it weren't so tragic

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.626
and if it weren't so true.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.533
The reality is that we are in the midst
of an obesity epidemic,

00:04:08.557 --> 00:04:10.980
and it's not simply
limited to our country.

00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:13.182
It's spreading around the world right now.

00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:15.137
And in a sort of parallel universe,

00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:17.997
we're also seeing
that hunger is on the rise.

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:21.631
Over 900 million people
right now are affected by it.

00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:24.537
That's three times the population
of the United States.

00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:25.837
But at the same time,

00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:27.589
world food prices are rising

00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:33.247
and world population is rising
and is set to reach 10 billion people
