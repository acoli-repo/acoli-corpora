00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:33.016
That's what we transformed our yard into,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.371
and I think a really key
message is this one:

00:09:35.395 --> 00:09:37.824
gardens grow good food.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.906
And when I say good food,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.661
I mean a number of different things.

00:09:41.685 --> 00:09:43.133
I mean food that is safe,

00:09:43.157 --> 00:09:44.589
food that is healthy,

00:09:44.613 --> 00:09:46.554
food that is absolutely gorgeous

00:09:46.578 --> 00:09:47.764
and delicious.

00:09:48.319 --> 00:09:50.530
Another important message is this one:

00:09:50.554 --> 00:09:53.303
gardens grow healthy kids and families.

00:09:53.327 --> 00:09:55.831
Those happen to be my two youngest sons,

00:09:55.855 --> 00:09:58.155
and they look healthy
and they are healthy,

00:09:58.179 --> 00:10:02.147
and I think it has to do with the fact
that they grew up in gardens
