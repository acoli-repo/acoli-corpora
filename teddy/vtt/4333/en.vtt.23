WEBVTT

00:11:29.469 --> 00:11:32.821
And my organization tried
to sort of channel some of that energy

00:11:32.845 --> 00:11:33.998
of the movement

00:11:34.022 --> 00:11:36.309
and direct it towards the White House.

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:37.525
And we had a lot of luck

00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:40.185
in terms of getting our message
out there to the media.

00:11:40.209 --> 00:11:43.731
We had a petition on Facebook,
110,000 signatures.

00:11:43.755 --> 00:11:46.202
We had viral images and videos,

00:11:46.226 --> 00:11:50.064
and we did crazy things like
symbolically putting the White House lawn

00:11:50.088 --> 00:11:52.259
up for sale on eBay.

00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:54.528
But we need to do even more,

00:11:54.552 --> 00:11:56.763
and what we're trying to do
in my organization

00:11:56.787 --> 00:11:58.128
is to connect people online,

00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:00.308
but also to connect people in person.
