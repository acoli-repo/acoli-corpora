00:06:57.546 --> 00:07:01.285
That's the average amount of time
the American family spends

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:05.094
preparing, eating and cleaning up
after meals per day.

00:07:06.824 --> 00:07:08.032
31 minutes.

00:07:08.056 --> 00:07:12.410
So somewhere in there, we're going
to need to also fit in growing food.

00:07:12.434 --> 00:07:13.592
Alright?

00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:15.441
And I think we do need to do that,

00:07:15.465 --> 00:07:18.312
but that's also going to mean
that somewhere along the way,

00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:19.985
something's going to have to give.

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:22.983
So it sort of leaves us feeling like this.

00:07:23.007 --> 00:07:24.199
(Laughter)

00:07:24.223 --> 00:07:25.387
You know?

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.971
It's time to leave town
or even perhaps leave planets.

00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:29.546
But where do we go?

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.679
Where do we go
when we only have one planet?
