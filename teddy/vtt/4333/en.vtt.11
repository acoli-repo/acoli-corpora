I mean a number of things.

00:05:31.234 --> 00:05:32.971
Less oil, for example.

00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:36.356
Most reputable geologists believe
that we've already reached

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.294
peak oil production in the world.

00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:42.468
Now, you might not think in terms
of oil and food as being linked,

00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:44.766
but there's a very strong link, in fact.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.401
It takes 10 calories of fossil fuel energy

00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:50.723
in our highly industrialized food system

00:05:50.747 --> 00:05:53.357
in order to produce

We'll also need to grow

00:05:57.257 --> 00:06:00.544
These three images come from three
very different parts of the planet,
