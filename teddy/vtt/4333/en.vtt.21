00:10:28.005 --> 00:10:31.715
we had saved well over 2,000 dollars
by growing our own food.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.162
So you could be asking this question now:

00:10:35.186 --> 00:10:39.441
If gardens grow all of these great things,
how do we grow more gardens?

00:10:39.465 --> 00:10:42.126
That's, in fact, the question
that my organization,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.620
Kitchen Gardens International,

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:46.189
is both asking and answering.

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:48.254
And our answer is essentially this one:

00:10:48.278 --> 00:10:52.368
we're going to need to leverage
the resources and power that we have,

00:10:52.392 --> 00:10:55.041
the gardens and gardeners that we have,

00:10:55.065 --> 00:10:58.028
in order to grow and inspire even more.

00:10:58.492 --> 00:11:01.858
And as I said before, you never know
who you might inspire.
