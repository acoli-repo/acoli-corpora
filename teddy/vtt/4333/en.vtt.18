00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.406
and we have less confidence in the actors

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.584
that are putting those foods
on the shelves.

00:09:04.192 --> 00:09:06.583
I think we need to redefine
what good food is.

00:09:07.011 --> 00:09:09.515
This is an interesting image
from Berlin, Germany,

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:12.945
where somebody started planting
shopping carts and leaving them around.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.521
Those are potatoes, by the way.

00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:17.404

Instead of seeing this as a yard,

00:09:23.186 --> 00:09:26.742
we need to think of it more
as like a full-service greengrocer.

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:29.795
That's, in fact, my yard,
and that's how I look at it.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:33.016
That's what we transformed our yard into,
