00:04:57.595 --> 00:05:00.116
Now, I imagine that there are
some Stephen King fans

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.310
in the audience here,

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:02.939
and I'm one of them.

00:05:02.963 --> 00:05:07.318
But I can tell you, I haven't read
anything scarier than this here,

00:05:07.342 --> 00:05:08.668
and that's this statistic:

00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:12.356
in order to keep up
with the growing population,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.656
we're going to need to grow more food
over the course of the next 50 years

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.447
than we have grown over the course
of the past 10,000 years combined.

00:05:22.326 --> 00:05:24.385
What makes this even more challenging

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.433
is that we're going to need
to grow all this food with less,

00:05:28.457 --> 00:05:29.887
and when I say less,

00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:31.210
I mean a number of things.
