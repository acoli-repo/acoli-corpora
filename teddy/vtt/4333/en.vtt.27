we'd get this:

00:13:36.759 --> 00:13:39.726

going to support

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.258
just a handful of commodity crops

00:13:43.032 --> 00:13:46.795
with just that tiny little bit at the top
for fruits and vegetables.

00:13:46.819 --> 00:13:49.439
This is scandalous. This is scandalous.

00:13:49.463 --> 00:13:51.435

00:13:53.774 --> 00:13:57.493

is we could look at the tax code.

00:13:57.517 --> 00:14:01.291
We're already using the tax code
to encourage green transport
