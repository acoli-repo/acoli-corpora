Where do we go
when we only have one planet?

00:07:31.703 --> 00:07:34.324
And where do we go
where the going gets tough?

00:07:34.348 --> 00:07:38.239
Well, if we were to listen to a lot
of our political leaders over the years,

00:07:38.263 --> 00:07:39.719
we would simply go shopping.

00:07:39.743 --> 00:07:41.115
Right?

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:43.633
Because we have this unwavering belief,

00:07:43.657 --> 00:07:45.611
especially in American political culture,

00:07:45.635 --> 00:07:48.334
that we can shop our way
out of just about any problem.

00:07:49.114 --> 00:07:51.115
But the reality is something different.

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:54.634
We're not going to solve
our food problems and our health problems

00:07:54.658 --> 00:07:57.929
simply by switching from regular Coke

00:07:57.953 --> 00:08:01.383
to some future green iteration thereof.
