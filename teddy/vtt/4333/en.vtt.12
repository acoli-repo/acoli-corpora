00:05:57.257 --> 00:06:00.544
These three images come from three
very different parts of the planet,

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:04.402
but they all tell the same story
of catastrophic drought.

00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.729
We'll also need to grow
more food with less farmland.

00:06:07.753 --> 00:06:11.156
Here, the pressures differ
from one place to the next.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.087
In the Global South,
we're seeing desertification,

00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:16.598
whereas in the north,
we're seeing suburban sprawl.

00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:21.284
We'll also have to grow more food
with less climate stability

00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:23.599
and less genetic diversity.

00:06:23.623 --> 00:06:25.106
Now, this is really important.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.067
We need our genetic varieties

00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:31.990
because they're a sort of insurance policy
against climate change.
