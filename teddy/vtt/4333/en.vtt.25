00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:31.094
We've got a bike garden on the left

00:12:31.118 --> 00:12:33.160
and a map of the Netherlands on the right.

00:12:33.184 --> 00:12:35.172
I was in the Netherlands early this year

00:12:35.196 --> 00:12:39.168
and was absolutely amazed
by the amount of bikes on the road;

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:42.874
26 percent of all trips taken
in the Netherlands are by bicycle,

00:12:42.898 --> 00:12:44.250
and it's gotten me thinking:

00:12:44.274 --> 00:12:47.212
How do we get that happening
in terms of food and gardens?

00:12:47.236 --> 00:12:50.962
How would we get 26 percent of all produce
coming from backyard gardens?

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:52.657
That might sound like a lot,

00:12:52.681 --> 00:12:55.840
because we're probably at about
two percent at the most right now.

00:12:55.864 --> 00:12:57.537
But if you take into consideration

00:12:57.561 --> 00:13:00.842
that at the peak of the victory garden
movement last century,
