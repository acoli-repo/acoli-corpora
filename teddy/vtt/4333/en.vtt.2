Now, I would like to suggest to you all

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.151
that gardening is a subversive activity.

00:01:03.175 --> 00:01:04.696
(Laughter)

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.678
Think about this:
food is a form of energy.

00:01:08.578 --> 00:01:09.928
It's what our body runs on,

00:01:09.952 --> 00:01:11.769
but it's also a form of power.

00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:15.842
And when we encourage people
to grow some of their own food,

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:19.154
we're encouraging them
to take power into their hands,

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.153
power over their diet,

00:01:21.177 --> 00:01:23.024
power over their health

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:25.390
and some power over their pocketbooks.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.679
So I think that's quite subversive,
because we're also necessarily

00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:32.630
talking about taking that power away
