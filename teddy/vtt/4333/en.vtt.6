I think it sort of captures me well,

00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:03.834
not that I have any
divine connections whatsoever,

00:03:03.858 --> 00:03:06.619
but I like my facial expression there,

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:09.380
because, if I've got
a worried look on my face,

00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:13.072
it's not simply because I've got
20 pounds of squash over my head,

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:16.655
but it's because I've got some
pretty heavy topics on my mind.

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.207
And I want to share some of those
with you right now,

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:23.130
starting off in the form of a very
short video I've produced for you,

00:03:23.154 --> 00:03:27.541
which is my best effort
to sum up the history of gastronomy

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:29.135
in about 15 seconds.
