00:08:28.254 --> 00:08:30.428
MR: I went to Glaxo Wellcome

00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:35.907
and after three times being rejected
and having the door slammed in my face

00:08:35.907 --> 00:08:39.415
because they weren't going
to out-license the drug

00:08:39.415 --> 00:08:42.208
to a satellite communications expert,

00:08:42.208 --> 00:08:48.643
they weren't going to send the drug
out to anybody at all,

00:08:48.643 --> 00:08:51.682
and they thought
I didn't have the expertise,

00:08:51.682 --> 00:08:58.276
finally I was able to persuade
a small team of people to work with me

00:08:58.276 --> 00:09:00.644
and develop enough credibility.
