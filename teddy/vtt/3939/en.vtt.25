cystic fibrosis, emphysema,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.355
COPD, what Leonard Nimoy just died of,

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:38.863
is a lung transplant,

00:12:38.863 --> 00:12:43.623
but sadly, there are only enough
available lungs for 2,000 people

00:12:43.623 --> 00:12:46.525
in the U.S. a year
to get a lung transplant,

00:12:46.525 --> 00:12:49.822
whereas nearly a half
million people a year

00:12:49.822 --> 00:12:52.121
die of end-stage lung failure.

00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:54.815

00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:57.299
MR: So I conceptualize the possibility

00:12:57.299 --> 00:13:00.712
that just like we keep cars and planes
