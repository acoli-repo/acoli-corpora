working with satellites.

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:33.847
I think you had two successful companies,

00:01:33.847 --> 00:01:35.951
and then you started
addressing this problem

00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:40.162
of how could you use satellites
to revolutionize radio.

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:41.825
Tell us about that.

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:43.961
MR: Right. I always
loved space technology,

00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:47.862
and satellites, to me, are sort of
like the canoes that our ancestors

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:50.021
first pushed out into the water.

00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:53.388
So it was exciting for me
to be part of the navigation

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:55.826
of the oceans of the sky,

00:01:55.826 --> 00:02:00.354
and as I developed different types
of satellite communication systems,
