MR: Chris, the astonishing thing
is that this absolutely worthless

00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:33.654
piece of powder

00:10:33.654 --> 00:10:37.717
that had the sparkle of a promise
of hope for Jenesis

00:10:37.717 --> 00:10:42.964
is not only keeping Jenesis
and other people alive today,

00:10:42.964 --> 00:10:47.097
but produces almost a billion
and a half dollars a year in revenue.

00:10:47.097 --> 00:10:50.923
(Applause)

00:10:50.923 --> 00:10:53.454
CA: So here you go.

00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:57.007
So you took this company public, right?

00:10:57.007 --> 00:10:59.537
And made an absolute fortune.

00:10:59.537 --> 00:11:03.531
And how much have you paid Glaxo,
by the way, after that 25,000?
