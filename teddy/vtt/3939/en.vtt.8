00:03:57.377 --> 00:04:00.675
and I'm still his father today.

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:05.226
My youngest daughter did an absolutely
brilliant five-year-old thing.

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:10.287
She told people, "I love my dad
and she loves me."

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:16.432
So she had no problem
with a gender blending whatsoever.

00:04:16.432 --> 00:04:19.349
CA: And a couple years after this,
you published this book:

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.229
"The Apartheid of Sex."

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.458
What was your thesis in this book?

00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:27.800
MR: My thesis in this book is that there
are seven billion people in the world,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.117
and actually, seven billion unique ways
to express one's gender.
