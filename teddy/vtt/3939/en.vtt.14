00:06:56.739 --> 00:07:00.709
and Bina and I would tag team
to stay at the hospital

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:03.101
while the other watched
the rest of the kids,

00:07:03.101 --> 00:07:05.678
and when I was in the hospital
and she was sleeping,

00:07:05.678 --> 00:07:07.373
I went to the hospital library.

00:07:07.373 --> 00:07:12.221
I read every article that I could find
on pulmonary hypertension.

00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:15.680
I had not taken any biology,
even in college,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.307
so I had to go from a biology textbook
to a college-level textbook

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:25.572
and then medical textbook
and the journal articles, back and forth,

00:07:25.572 --> 00:07:29.635
and eventually I knew enough to think
that it might be possible

00:07:29.635 --> 00:07:31.400
that somebody could find a cure.
