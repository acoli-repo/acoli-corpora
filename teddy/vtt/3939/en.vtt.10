the way South Africa used to force people
into categories of black or white.

00:05:01.778 --> 00:05:05.980
We know from anthropological science
that race is fiction,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.782
even though racism is very, very real,

00:05:08.782 --> 00:05:11.382
and we now know from cultural studies

00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:15.140
that separate male or female genders
is a constructed fiction.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.335
The reality is a gender fluidity

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:22.225
that crosses the entire continuum
from male to female.

00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:25.784
CA: You yourself don't always
feel 100 percent female.

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:28.019
MR: Correct. I would say in some ways

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:31.920
I change my gender about as often
as I change my hairstyle.
