The most amazing thing about Jenesis

00:11:30.326 --> 00:11:33.228
is that while she could do
anything with her life,

00:11:33.228 --> 00:11:36.924
and believe me, if you grew up
your whole life with people

00:11:36.924 --> 00:11:39.846
in your face saying
that you've got a fatal disease,

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:44.559
I would probably run to Tahiti and just
not want to run into anybody again.

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:47.694
But instead she chooses to work
in United Therapeutics.

00:11:47.694 --> 00:11:51.304
She says she wants to do all she can
to help other people

00:11:51.304 --> 00:11:53.522
with orphan diseases get medicines,

00:11:53.522 --> 00:11:58.212
and today, she's our project leader
for all telepresence activities,

00:11:58.212 --> 00:12:01.741
where she helps digitally unite
the entire company to work together
