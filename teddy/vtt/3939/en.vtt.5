00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.350
and it would be possible to have
nationwide satellite radio,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.904
and that's Sirius XM today.

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:36.924
CA: Wow. So who here has used Sirius?

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:39.506
(Applause)

00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:41.684
MR: Thank you for
your monthly subscriptions.

00:02:41.684 --> 00:02:44.447
(Laughter)

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:48.649
CA: So that succeeded despite
all predictions at the time.

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:50.878
It was a huge commercial success,

00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:55.197
but soon after this, in the early 1990s,

00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:59.713
there was this big transition in your life
and you became Martine.

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:03.300
MR: Correct.
CA: So tell me, how did that happen?
