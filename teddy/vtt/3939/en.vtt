Chris Anderson: So I guess
what we're going to do is

00:00:02.807 --> 00:00:05.268
we're going to talk about your life,

00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:08.426
and using some pictures
that you shared with me.

00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:11.375
And I think we should start
right here with this one.

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:13.743
Okay, now who is this?

00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:19.492
Martine Rothblatt: This is me
with our oldest son Eli.

00:00:19.492 --> 00:00:21.382
He was about age five.

00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:23.495
This is taken in Nigeria

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:27.489
right after having taken
the Washington, D.C. bar exam.

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.064
CA: Okay. But this doesn't
really look like a Martine.
