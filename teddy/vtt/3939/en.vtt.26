that just like we keep cars and planes

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:03.104
and buildings going forever

00:13:03.104 --> 00:13:07.331
with an unlimited supply
of building parts and machine parts,

00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:10.521
why can't we create an unlimited supply
of transplantable organs

00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:13.459
to keep people living indefinitely,

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:16.106
and especially people with lung disease.

00:13:16.106 --> 00:13:21.632
So we've teamed up with the decoder
of the human genome, Craig Venter,

00:13:21.632 --> 00:13:23.444
and the company he founded

00:13:23.444 --> 00:13:26.950
with Peter Diamandis,
the founder of the X Prize,

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.016
to genetically modify

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:30.711
the pig genome
