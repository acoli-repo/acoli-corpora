00:01:55.826 --> 00:02:00.354
and as I developed different types
of satellite communication systems,

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:05.655
the main thing I did was to launch
bigger and more powerful satellites,

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:09.316
the consequence of which
was that the receiving antennas

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:11.290
could be smaller and smaller,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.144
and after going through
direct television broadcasting,

00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:18.678
I had the idea that if we could make
a more powerful satellite,

00:02:18.678 --> 00:02:21.418
the receiving dish could be so small

00:02:21.418 --> 00:02:24.710
that it would just be a section
of a parabolic dish,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.449
a flat little plate embedded
into the roof of an automobile,

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.350
and it would be possible to have
nationwide satellite radio,
