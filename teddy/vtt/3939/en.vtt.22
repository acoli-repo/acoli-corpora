00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:11.054

last year 100 million dollars.

00:11:11.054 --> 00:11:14.165
It's the best return on investment
they ever received. (Laughter)

00:11:14.165 --> 00:11:16.232

00:11:22.362 --> 00:11:24.985
She's alive, healthy today at 30.

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:27.447
You see me, Bina and Jenesis there.

00:11:27.447 --> 00:11:30.326
The most amazing thing about Jenesis
