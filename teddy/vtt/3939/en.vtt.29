It's long-lasting minds.

00:14:33.008 --> 00:14:38.848
And I think this graph for you
says something quite profound.

00:14:38.848 --> 00:14:40.032
What does this mean?

00:14:40.032 --> 00:14:43.680
MR: What this graph means,
and it comes from Ray Kurzweil,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.460
is that the rate of development
in computer processing

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.293

in earlier presentations today,

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.625
there will be information technology
