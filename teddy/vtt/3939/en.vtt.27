00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:30.711
the pig genome

00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:35.216
so that the pig's organs will not
be rejected by the human body

00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:38.327
and thereby to create an unlimited supply

00:13:38.327 --> 00:13:40.742
of transplantable organs.

00:13:40.742 --> 00:13:43.714
We do this through our company,
United Therapeutics.

00:13:43.714 --> 00:13:46.779
CA: So you really believe that within,
what, a decade,

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:51.260
that this shortage of transplantable lungs
maybe be cured, through these guys?

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.839
MR: Absolutely, Chris.

00:13:52.839 --> 00:13:56.531
I'm as certain of that as I was
of the success that we've had

00:13:56.531 --> 00:13:59.619
with direct television
broadcasting, Sirius XM.

00:13:59.619 --> 00:14:01.825
It's actually not rocket science.
