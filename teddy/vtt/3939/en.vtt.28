00:13:59.619 --> 00:14:01.825
It's actually not rocket science.

00:14:01.825 --> 00:14:05.284
It's straightforward engineering away
one gene after another.

00:14:05.284 --> 00:14:09.626
We're so lucky to be born in the time
that sequencing genomes

00:14:09.626 --> 00:14:12.285
is a routine activity,

00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:14.723
and the brilliant folks
at Synthetic Genomics

00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:16.929
are able to zero in on the pig genome,

00:14:16.929 --> 00:14:20.321
find exactly the genes
that are problematic, and fix them.

00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.360
CA: But it's not just bodies that --
though that is amazing.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.681
(Applause)

00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:30.976
It's not just long-lasting bodies
that are of interest to you now.
