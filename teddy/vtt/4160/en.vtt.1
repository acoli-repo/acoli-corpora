00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:33.480
My background is, I practiced
medicine for 20 years,

00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:36.739
though a part of my work
has always been in public health.

00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:39.501
In fact, my first job,
putting myself through college,

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:42.590
was working at the state laboratory
in Massachusetts.

00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:46.732
As the story will go with Joia [Mukherjee]
we're reconnected again,

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.287
a Massachusetts theme.

00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:53.210
And I, across the journey
of the work that I was doing

00:00:53.234 --> 00:00:54.528
for my patients

00:00:54.552 --> 00:00:56.264
to provide them information

00:00:56.288 --> 00:01:00.191
and the right care and meet them
where they were medically,
