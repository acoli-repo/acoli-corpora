00:09:28.876 --> 00:09:31.258
like we forget where we might have been,

00:09:31.282 --> 00:09:34.479
and there's also an amount
of anonymous contact.

00:09:34.503 --> 00:09:36.953
So there are times when
we're out in the world,

00:09:36.977 --> 00:09:39.291
on a bus or in a store,

00:09:39.315 --> 00:09:43.590
and we may have come into prolonged
and close contact with someone

00:09:43.614 --> 00:09:45.162
and wouldn't know who they were.

00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:46.678
And so the augmentation

00:09:46.702 --> 00:09:49.965
that the exposure
notification system provides

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:52.013
is designed to fill in those gaps

00:09:52.037 --> 00:09:55.121
and to expedite the notification
to public health

00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:56.637
of who has a positive test,

00:09:56.661 --> 00:09:58.577
because the person would have notified,

00:09:58.601 --> 00:10:01.050
they trigger something
that notifies public health,
