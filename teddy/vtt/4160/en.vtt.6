00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.413
So on the search page,
we put up "knowledge panels,"

00:03:00.437 --> 00:03:01.951
is the way that we describe it,

00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:04.175
and we did develop an SOS alert,

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.278
which is something
we've done for other crises,

00:03:07.302 --> 00:03:09.679
and in this particular historic crisis,

00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:13.418
we wanted to be certain
that when people went on to search,

00:03:13.442 --> 00:03:16.222
that there was authoritative information,

00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:19.362
which is always there but certainly
very prominently displayed,

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:22.512
and do that in partnership
with public health authorities.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:27.372
So we began our journey
really very much in an information way

00:03:27.396 --> 00:03:30.632
of making certain that people
knew how to get the right information
