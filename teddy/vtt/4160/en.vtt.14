00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:01.642
WPR: That's great. Thank you.

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:05.677
So, to talk more about
this contact tracing system

00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:07.935
and the exposure notification app,

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:10.145
we've read so much about this.

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.096
Could you describe this,
a little bit about how the app works,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.609
what exactly are users seeing,

00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:18.183
what information is being collected?

00:07:18.207 --> 00:07:21.753
Just give us sort of a broad sense
of what this app does.

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:23.429
KD: Yeah.

00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:25.996
Let me just start
by explaining what it is,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.683
and it's actually not even an app,

00:07:28.707 --> 00:07:30.318
it's just an API.
