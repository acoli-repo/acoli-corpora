00:04:29.515 --> 00:04:32.346
including some of
my colleagues here in the US,

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.525
could we help them have a better
evidence-based way to understand

00:04:35.549 --> 00:04:38.828
the policies around social distancing
or shelter in place?

00:04:38.852 --> 00:04:41.777
Which I think we'll talk about more later.

00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:46.206
In addition to that sort of work,
also been working to support public health

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.049
in this really essential work
they're doing for contact tracing,

00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:52.668
which is very human-resource intensive,

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.455
very complex,

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.808
incredibly important
to keep the curve flat

00:04:56.832 --> 00:04:58.680
and prevent future outbreaks,

00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:03.821
and give time and space for health care
and, importantly, science
