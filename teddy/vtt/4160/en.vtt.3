00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:31.877
is that having the right
information at the right time

00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:33.816
can make all the difference
in the world.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.265
It can literally save lives.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.580
And billions of people
come to Google every day

00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:39.074
asking for information,

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:44.092
and so it is a tremendous opportunity
to have that right information

00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:45.890
and those resources to people

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:47.981
so that they can make good choices,

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.110
so that they can have
the right information,

00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:52.481
so that they can participate
in their own health,

00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:54.944
but also, in the context
of this historic pandemic,

00:01:54.968 --> 00:01:57.272
be a part of the broader health
of the community,

00:01:57.296 --> 00:02:00.957
whether it's to flatten the curve
or keep the curve flat as we go forward.
