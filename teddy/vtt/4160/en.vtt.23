00:11:31.295 --> 00:11:33.288
and also is useful to public health.

00:11:33.312 --> 00:11:35.705
We're still on this journey with them,

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:38.483
and I really believe that
we're going to be able to help,

00:11:38.507 --> 00:11:41.398
and I'm looking forward
to being a part of the great work

00:11:41.422 --> 00:11:44.278
that public health's got to do
on the front lines every day,

00:11:44.302 --> 00:11:45.468

WPR: That's great, and thank you
for that really detailed explanation.

00:11:51.388 --> 00:11:55.269
And you know, we actually have Chris here
with some questions from our community,

00:11:55.293 --> 00:11:57.373
so why don't we turn there really quickly.

00:11:57.856 --> 00:12:00.654
Chris Anderson: Yep.
Questions pouring in, Karen.
