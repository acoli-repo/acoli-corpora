00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:03.821
and give time and space for health care
and, importantly, science

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:07.007
to do the work they need to do
to create treatments

00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:09.441
and, very importantly, a vaccine.

00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:14.906
So that work around providing
an additional set of digital tools,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.722
exposure notification
for the contact tracing community,

00:05:17.746 --> 00:05:21.218
is one of the other areas where we've
been supporting the public health.

00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:23.631
So we think, as we've thought
about this pandemic,

00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:26.542
it's support the users,
which is the consumer.

00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:29.463
There's also a health care system
and a scientific community

00:05:29.487 --> 00:05:31.015
where we've been partnering.
