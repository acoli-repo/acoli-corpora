WEBVTT

00:05:29.487 --> 00:05:31.015
where we've been partnering.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.741
And then, of course, public health.

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:38.391
And for me, I mean, Whitney,
this is just a wonderful opportunity

00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:42.499
for Big Tech to come together
with the public health infrastructure.

00:05:42.523 --> 00:05:45.344
Public health, as Joia was
sort of articulating before,

00:05:45.368 --> 00:05:47.599
is often an unsung hero.

00:05:47.623 --> 00:05:50.145
It saves your life every day,
but you didn't know it.

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.350
And it is also a pretty under-resourced
part of our health infrastructure,

00:05:55.374 --> 00:05:57.372
globally, but especially in the US.

00:05:57.396 --> 00:06:00.214
It's something I worked on a lot
before I came to Google.
