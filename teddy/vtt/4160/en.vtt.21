WEBVTT

00:10:29.423 --> 00:10:32.068
So we built this system
in response to some requests

00:10:32.092 --> 00:10:34.542
to help augment
the contact-tracing systems.

00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:37.160
We wanted to do it in a way
that was user-controlled

00:10:37.184 --> 00:10:38.629
and privacy-preserving

00:10:38.653 --> 00:10:41.486
and had technological features

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:46.626
that would allow public health
to augment the exposure log

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.337
in a way that would accelerate
the work that they needed to get done

00:10:50.361 --> 00:10:53.583
to interrupt transmission --
keep the R naught less than one --

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:58.757
and do that in a way that we would also
be able to partner with public health

00:10:58.781 --> 00:11:00.124
to think about risk scoring.
