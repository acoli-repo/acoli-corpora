00:00:56.288 --> 00:01:00.191
and the right care and meet them
where they were medically,

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:01.450
translated into the work

00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:04.298
that I did when I was
the Health Commissioner in New Orleans

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:07.606
and later when I had other roles

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.464

the best services that are
culturally and linguistically appropriate,

00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:20.990
meet them where they are.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.869
And when the opportunity arose
to join the team at Google,

00:01:23.893 --> 00:01:25.282
I was really thrilled,

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:28.830
because one of the things
that I have learned across my journey

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:31.877
is that having the right
information at the right time
