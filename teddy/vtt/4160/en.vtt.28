I think for us as a company, we want

00:14:10.696 --> 00:14:14.126
and so that for us means
continuing to encourage work-from-home

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.523
for our employees

00:14:15.547 --> 00:14:19.649
and really only be in if it's essential
that people are in the workplace.

00:14:19.673 --> 00:14:23.724
