A new virus emerges 
and spreads like wildfire.

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.481
In order to contain it,

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:17.777
researchers must first collect data 
about who’s been infected.

00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:20.794
Two main viral testing techniques 
are critical:

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:22.891
one tells you if you have the virus

00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.501
and the other shows 
if you’ve already had it.

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:28.891
So, how exactly do these tests work?

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.631
PCR, or polymerase chain 
reaction testing,
