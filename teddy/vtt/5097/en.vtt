In her Auntie An-mei’s home,

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:10.607
Jing-Mei reluctantly takes her seat

00:00:10.607 --> 00:00:12.837
at the eastern corner 
of the mahjong table.

00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:16.252
At the north, south, and west 
corners are her aunties,

00:00:16.252 --> 00:00:18.895
long-time members of the Joy Luck Club.

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:22.743
This group of immigrant families 
comes together weekly to trade gossip,

00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:26.765
feast on wonton and sweet chaswei, 
and play mahjong.

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:32.342
However, the club’s founder, Jing-Mei’s 
mother Suyuan, has recently passed away.
