00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Just a moment ago,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Her text said,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
"Mom, you will rock."

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I love this.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Getting that text

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
was like getting a hug.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And so there you have it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I embody

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the central paradox.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm a woman

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
who loves getting texts

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
who's going to tell you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that too many of them can be a problem.
