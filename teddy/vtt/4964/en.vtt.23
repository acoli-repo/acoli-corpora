to defeat their rivals.

00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:35.094
They will be more likely
to try to cheat or lie

00:11:35.118 --> 00:11:39.804
to get an advantage and to actually
end up outperforming the rival.

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:41.961
AG: I heard a version of this recently

00:11:41.985 --> 00:11:44.040
when I was onstage
with Sir Richard Branson,

00:11:44.064 --> 00:11:45.871
the billionaire founder of Virgin.

00:11:45.895 --> 00:11:49.809
Back in 1990, Branson was working
to get his airline, Virgin Atlantic,

00:11:49.833 --> 00:11:51.093
off the ground.

00:11:51.117 --> 00:11:53.379
So let's talk about airlines a little bit.

00:11:53.403 --> 00:11:57.149
You said if you want to be
a millionaire, it's really simple:

00:11:57.173 --> 00:11:59.446
First, be a billionaire,
then start an airline.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.470
