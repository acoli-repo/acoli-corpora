GK: I would say swallow your pride,

00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:06.442
and if you really want what's best
for Michigan going forward,

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:08.172
you want them to be inspired.

00:05:08.196 --> 00:05:09.585
AG: This is so weird, though,

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:14.643
because you're looking at athletes who are
at the very pinnacle of their sport.

00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:16.638
Part of what I'm puzzled by

00:05:16.662 --> 00:05:19.193
is shouldn't they already
be as motivated as possible?

00:05:19.217 --> 00:05:20.850
GK: Yeah, that's a great question,

00:05:20.874 --> 00:05:24.088
but we're not always completely in control
of our motivation, right?

00:05:24.112 --> 00:05:27.240
It's not a fully rational process.

00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:30.449
AG: Gavin led another study
of long-distance runners
