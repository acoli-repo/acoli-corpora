00:01:59.538 --> 00:02:00.689
AG: So who won?

00:02:00.713 --> 00:02:02.244
AC: I won. I ended up winning.

00:02:02.268 --> 00:02:04.480
(Clip) Amy Cragg! Redemption!

00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:07.354
Four years ago and now the winner.

00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:08.720
(Crowd cheers)

00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:11.364
AC: Shalane helped me
every step of the way

00:02:11.388 --> 00:02:15.180
to give me the best possible chance
of making that team.

00:02:15.204 --> 00:02:18.368
AG: They were vying to compete
on the biggest stage in the world.

00:02:18.392 --> 00:02:21.831
An opportunity that comes around
just once every four years.

00:02:21.855 --> 00:02:24.458
It's supposed to be
every runner for herself.

00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:27.709
And only the winners
get the big sponsorship dollars.

00:02:28.116 --> 00:02:31.814
So why did Shalane give up her advantage
to help her opponent win?
