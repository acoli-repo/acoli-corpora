00:09:58.863 --> 00:10:02.269
When it comes down to it,
I am a competitor, I'm there to race.

00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:04.498
That's kind of what it comes down to.

00:10:04.522 --> 00:10:08.442
But at that time, the goal
was to make that Olympic team together.

00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:11.068

00:10:11.092 --> 00:10:14.145
AG: Training intensively together
didn't just build a friendship.

00:10:14.169 --> 00:10:16.203
It created a rich supportive rivalry.

00:10:16.227 --> 00:10:18.680
They had a better shot
at running their best races,

00:10:18.704 --> 00:10:21.353
since they even helped one another
during competitions.

00:10:22.601 --> 00:10:25.736
The fuel Amy and Shalane are describing
isn't just in their heads.

00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:27.534
Gavin, the NYU researcher,

00:10:27.558 --> 00:10:29.876
found that when you're competing
against a rival,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.828
your body actually responds differently.
