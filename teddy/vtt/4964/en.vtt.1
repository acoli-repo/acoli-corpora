Amy's at the top of her field.

00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:32.832
She can run a mile
in less than six minutes

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:34.875
26 times in a row.

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:38.077
AC: My dream was to make
the Olympics in the marathon.

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:40.601
AG: For five years,
she'd been running professionally

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:42.228
in pursuit of that milestone.

00:00:42.252 --> 00:00:45.418

in the Olympic marathon trials

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:47.712
down to a lead pack of four at the moment.

00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:51.759
Only three comprise
the US Olympic marathon team.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.348
AG: In 2012, Amy missed
the Olympic marathon team by one spot.

00:00:56.686 --> 00:00:59.458
In a race that took her
nearly two and a half hours,

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:02.489
she was just one minute
and 12 seconds too slow.
