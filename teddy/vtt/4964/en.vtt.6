00:02:58.813 --> 00:03:00.680
Today: rivalry,

00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:04.101
and how it can bring out the best in us
rather than the worst in us.

00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:06.736
(Music)

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.061
Thanks to Accenture
for sponsoring this episode.

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:14.783
(Music)

00:03:15.188 --> 00:03:18.188
In any workplace,
competition is inevitable.

00:03:18.624 --> 00:03:20.712
Rivalry is a special form of competition

00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:23.180
where you're driven to beat
a particular opponent.

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.244
Think about your job.

00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:27.299
Odds are you have at least one rival.

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:29.903
That colleague who's vying
for the same promotion.

00:03:29.927 --> 00:03:32.045
The peer you're pushing to outperform.
