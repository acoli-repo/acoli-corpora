00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:31.766
It was just a little too much in my legs

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.385
for knowing I still had 13 miles left.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.761
I could completely bonk
and not be able to finish.

00:01:38.252 --> 00:01:40.133
AG: Then something wild happened.

00:01:40.157 --> 00:01:43.078
Amy was running neck and neck
with one of her toughest rivals,

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:44.284
Shalane Flanagan,

00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:47.061
Olympic medalist and holder
of three American records.

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:50.570
And Shalane actually
slowed down to help Amy.

00:01:51.204 --> 00:01:53.418
AC: And she was like,
"You know what, it's OK,

00:01:53.442 --> 00:01:55.133
we're going to stick to each other,

00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:57.426
we're going to cross
that finish line together."

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.514
I was like, "OK,
this is going to be good."

00:01:59.538 --> 00:02:00.689
AG: So who won?
