00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:30.449
AG: Gavin led another study
of long-distance runners

00:05:30.473 --> 00:05:34.244
and found that they actually ran faster
when their rivals were in the race.

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:36.993
GK: The models came out
such that you'd be expected to run

00:05:37.017 --> 00:05:39.514
about five seconds per kilometer faster

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:42.823
if one of your top rivals
showed up to the race,

00:05:42.847 --> 00:05:46.083
as compared to if none of them
were at the race.

00:05:46.107 --> 00:05:48.022

00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:50.410
AG: You can see an extreme
version of that dynamic

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.331
with Amy Cragg and Shalane Flanagan.

00:05:52.355 --> 00:05:55.418
Back in 2000, before Shalane came on
the marathon scene,

00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:58.331
only one American woman
qualified for the Olympics.

00:05:58.355 --> 00:06:01.533
She trained alone in her home
on a treadmill.
