Amy Cragg: You're on the road
for months on end,

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.278
you miss holidays,
you miss seeing your family,

00:00:05.302 --> 00:00:07.547
you're so tired on a daily basis

00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:11.553
that even talking on the phone
sounds just exhausting.

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:13.109
Adam Grant: Meet Amy Cragg.

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.163
I cannot imagine spending my days
the way she does.

00:00:16.187 --> 00:00:18.188
AC: I'm a professional distance runner.

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:19.363
AG: Is that a job?

00:00:19.387 --> 00:00:20.537
AC: Yes, it is.

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:25.827
I race marathons and road races
and track races, and that's my job.

00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:28.356
AG: It's not just a job for her.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.070
Amy's at the top of her field.
