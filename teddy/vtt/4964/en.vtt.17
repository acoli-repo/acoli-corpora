00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:30.759
I was starting to not be able
to see very well,

00:08:30.783 --> 00:08:33.861
I felt like, really weak,
I felt like I wanted to stop.

00:08:34.164 --> 00:08:37.765
And I told Amy, "You know,
you can keep going, I'm not feeling good."

00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:39.635
(Clip) They're both hurting.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:46.045

SF: But she refused to leave my side.

00:08:53.315 --> 00:08:55.331
And I'm like, "No, Amy, you can't do that.

00:08:55.355 --> 00:08:58.172
You can't sacrifice your race,
you need to get going."

00:08:58.196 --> 00:09:00.752
And part of me selfishly
was like, "Oh, thank God,"
