00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:33.625
with a team of people that was illegally
accessing our computer information

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:35.950
and finding out the names
of our passengers,

00:12:35.974 --> 00:12:38.839
ringing them up,
pretending to be from Virgin,

00:12:38.863 --> 00:12:40.212
and telling them that,

00:12:40.236 --> 00:12:43.565
"I'm so sorry, the flight
has been canceled today,"

00:12:43.589 --> 00:12:45.593
and then switching them to BA.

00:12:45.617 --> 00:12:48.593
AG: British Airways never directly
confirmed these allegations,

00:12:48.617 --> 00:12:51.283
but ended up calling
their actions "regrettable."

00:12:51.307 --> 00:12:53.641
The scandal brought them
tons of bad press,

00:12:53.665 --> 00:12:55.942
and created lots of publicity for Virgin,

00:12:55.966 --> 00:12:59.418
along with a settlement fee,
which Branson paid out to his staff.

00:12:59.442 --> 00:13:02.577
SRB: It was known as
the British Airways Christmas Bonus.
