00:03:29.927 --> 00:03:32.045
The peer you're pushing to outperform.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.652
Your counterpart at your company's
biggest competitor.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.085
Your rival is the person
you constantly compare yourself to.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.664
And that can be highly motivating.

00:03:40.688 --> 00:03:44.279
Throughout history, great achievements
have been fueled by great rivalries.

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:46.123
Think Edison and Tesla.

00:03:46.454 --> 00:03:48.039
Picasso and Matisse.

00:03:48.063 --> 00:03:49.213
Serena and Venus.

00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:51.549
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.

00:03:51.573 --> 00:03:54.220
Gavin Kilduff: You know,
rivals may not only motivate us

00:03:54.244 --> 00:03:56.054
when we compete against them directly,

00:03:56.078 --> 00:03:59.029
but we may be following
their success from afar

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:02.894
and using that as fuel
for our own motivation.
