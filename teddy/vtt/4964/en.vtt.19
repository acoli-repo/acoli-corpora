00:09:29.553 --> 00:09:31.823
And so I think I said
one more thing to Shalane,

00:09:31.847 --> 00:09:34.379
I said, "You've got this,
I'll be at the finish line,"

00:09:34.403 --> 00:09:35.653
and took off.

00:09:35.677 --> 00:09:38.359
AG: Amy took first place
and secured her spot.

00:09:38.383 --> 00:09:39.543
But what about Shalane?

00:09:39.567 --> 00:09:42.653
SF: I literally thought of Amy,
waiting at the finish line for me

00:09:42.677 --> 00:09:43.994
and that was my motivation.

00:09:44.018 --> 00:09:47.135
AG: Shalane took third,
and qualified for the Olympics, too.

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:49.999
But I wondered how Amy felt
about running ahead.

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:51.387
Did you feel bad about that,

00:09:51.411 --> 00:09:54.547
given that she had kind of
rescued you earlier in the race,

00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:56.307
and then here you are, beating her?

00:09:56.817 --> 00:09:58.839
AC: No, I don't feel bad
about that at all.

00:09:58.863 --> 00:10:02.269
When it comes down to it,
I am a competitor, I'm there to race.
