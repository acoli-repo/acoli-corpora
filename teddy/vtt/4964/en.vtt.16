00:07:56.726 --> 00:08:00.656
What's important here is that the way
Shalane and Amy compete is collaborative.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.331
And it goes both ways.

00:08:02.355 --> 00:08:04.664
You heard it when Shalane
slowed down to help Amy

00:08:04.688 --> 00:08:06.505
halfway through Olympic trials.

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:10.282
But later in that same race,
Amy turned around and did the same thing.

00:08:11.664 --> 00:08:14.171
That day, the weather
was uncomfortably hot.

00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:16.029
Shalane remembers it vividly.

00:08:16.053 --> 00:08:18.244
SF: Gosh, it was February in LA.

00:08:18.268 --> 00:08:20.561
We had heard it was
going to be a warm day.

00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:22.696
It was not ideal marathon weather.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.085
AG: Toward the end of the race,
it was Shalane who started to struggle.

00:08:26.109 --> 00:08:28.537
SF: Really, with 5K to go,
it got really bad,

00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:30.759
I was starting to not be able
to see very well,
