00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.828
your body actually responds differently.

00:10:31.852 --> 00:10:34.812
GK: People coming
face to face against a rival

00:10:34.836 --> 00:10:37.138
exhibited a spike
in their physiological arousal.

00:10:37.162 --> 00:10:39.677
So their heart rate,
specifically, went up,

00:10:39.701 --> 00:10:43.656
and that extra excitement,
physiologically,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.513
predicted greater risk-taking.

00:10:45.537 --> 00:10:46.918
AG: Risk-taking.

00:10:46.942 --> 00:10:50.188
It might lead you to a bold idea
or a creative new direction.

00:10:50.212 --> 00:10:53.626
But it could also guide you
down a destructive path.

00:10:54.599 --> 00:10:55.849
One of Gavin's experiments

00:10:55.873 --> 00:10:58.829
was with students
at the Ohio State University.

00:10:58.853 --> 00:11:02.171
He told them their pay for participating
in the study would be doubled
