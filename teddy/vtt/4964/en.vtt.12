00:05:58.355 --> 00:06:01.533
She trained alone in her home
on a treadmill.

00:06:02.938 --> 00:06:06.002
Since then, Shalane Flanagan has won
an Olympic silver medal

00:06:06.416 --> 00:06:10.783
and been the first American woman to win
the New York City marathon in 40 years.

00:06:10.807 --> 00:06:12.927
Shalane Flanagan:
My name is Shalane Flanagan

00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:15.427
and yeah, I was always competitive.

00:06:15.451 --> 00:06:16.514
(Laughs)

00:06:16.538 --> 00:06:18.498
AG: Shalane doesn't train alone.

00:06:18.522 --> 00:06:21.291
She's had 11 training partners,
including Amy Cragg,

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:24.514
and every single one of them
has made it to the Olympics.

00:06:24.538 --> 00:06:26.347
Shalane's at the top of her sport,

00:06:26.371 --> 00:06:28.799
but she brings her rivals
to new heights with her.

00:06:28.823 --> 00:06:31.283
And she knows exactly
what's at stake when she does.
