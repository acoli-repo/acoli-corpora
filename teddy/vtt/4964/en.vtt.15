But that doesn't stop them
from getting a little bloodthirsty.

00:07:32.696 --> 00:07:36.180
AC: There's no holding hands across
the finish line or anything like that.

00:07:36.204 --> 00:07:38.283
I will race you to the finish line.

00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:41.682
AG: Oh, so I'm hearing the competitive
edge come out a little bit.

00:07:41.706 --> 00:07:43.024
AC: I'm really competitive.

00:07:43.048 --> 00:07:45.950
When it comes down to it,
I'm a professional athlete,

00:07:45.974 --> 00:07:48.954
and I'm there to run
and place as high as I can.

00:07:50.665 --> 00:07:52.915
AG: There are different
flavors of competition,

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:54.598
from the friendly to the ruthless.

00:07:54.622 --> 00:07:56.702
And where you fall
on that spectrum matters.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:08:00.656
What's important here is that the way
Shalane and Amy compete is collaborative.
