00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, where are the robots?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We've been told for 40 years already that they're coming soon.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Very soon they'll be doing everything for us.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
They'll be cooking, cleaning, buying things, shopping, building. But they aren't here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Meanwhile, we have illegal immigrants doing all the work,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but we don't have any robots.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what can we do about that? What can we say?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So I want to give a little bit of a different perspective

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way.
