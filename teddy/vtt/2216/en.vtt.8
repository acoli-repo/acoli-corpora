00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:01.545
we were at once worried but also curious.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.720
Why?

00:04:02.744 --> 00:04:06.117
Why does false news travel
so much further, faster, deeper

00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:08.005
and more broadly than the truth?

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.300
The first hypothesis
that we came up with was,

00:04:11.324 --> 00:04:16.116
"Well, maybe people who spread false news
have more followers or follow more people,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.697
or tweet more often,

or maybe they're more often 'verified'
users of Twitter, with more credibility,

00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:24.053
or maybe they've been on Twitter longer."

00:04:24.077 --> 00:04:26.375
So we checked each one of these in turn.

00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:29.611
And what we found
was exactly the opposite.

00:04:29.635 --> 00:04:32.071
False-news spreaders had fewer followers,
