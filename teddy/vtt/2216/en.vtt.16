00:07:58.093 --> 00:08:00.656
This is a machine-learning model
with two networks:

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.227
a discriminator,

00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:06.451
whose job it is to determine
whether something is true or false,

00:08:06.475 --> 00:08:07.642
and a generator,

00:08:07.666 --> 00:08:10.816
whose job it is to generate
synthetic media.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.942
So the synthetic generator
generates synthetic video or audio,

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:20.641
and the discriminator tries to tell,
"Is this real or is this fake?"

00:08:20.665 --> 00:08:23.539
And in fact, it is the job
of the generator

00:08:23.563 --> 00:08:27.998
to maximize the likelihood
that it will fool the discriminator

00:08:28.022 --> 00:08:31.609
into thinking the synthetic
video and audio that it is creating
