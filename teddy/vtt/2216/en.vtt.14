bots were accelerating
the spread of false news online,

00:07:01.196 --> 00:07:03.847
but they were accelerating
the spread of true news

00:07:03.871 --> 00:07:06.276
at approximately the same rate.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.158
Which means bots are not responsible

00:07:09.182 --> 00:07:13.895
for the differential diffusion
of truth and falsity online.

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.768
We can't abdicate that responsibility,

00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:21.051
because we, humans,
are responsible for that spread.

00:07:22.472 --> 00:07:25.806
Now, everything
that I have told you so far,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.584
unfortunately for all of us,

00:07:27.608 --> 00:07:28.869
is the good news.
