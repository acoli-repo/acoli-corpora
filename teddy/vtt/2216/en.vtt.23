00:11:28.966 --> 00:11:31.466
Third, we can think about regulation,

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.815
and certainly, we should think
about this option.

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:35.450
In the United States, currently,

00:11:35.474 --> 00:11:40.322
we are exploring what might happen
if Facebook and others are regulated.

00:11:40.346 --> 00:11:44.147
While we should consider things
like regulating political speech,

00:11:44.171 --> 00:11:46.679
labeling the fact
that it's political speech,

00:11:46.703 --> 00:11:50.522
making sure foreign actors
can't fund political speech,

00:11:50.546 --> 00:11:53.093
it also has its own dangers.

00:11:53.522 --> 00:11:58.400
For instance, Malaysia just instituted
a six-year prison sentence

00:11:58.424 --> 00:12:01.158
for anyone found spreading misinformation.
