00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:30.426
And what we did in this paper

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.315
was we compared the spread of true news
to the spread of false news.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.022
And here's what we found.

00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:40.025
We found that false news
diffused further, faster, deeper

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.855
and more broadly than the truth

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.882
in every category of information
that we studied,

00:03:44.906 --> 00:03:47.405
sometimes by an order of magnitude.

00:03:47.842 --> 00:03:51.366
And in fact, false political news
was the most viral.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.537
It diffused further, faster,
deeper and more broadly

00:03:54.561 --> 00:03:57.363
than any other type of false news.

00:03:57.387 --> 00:03:58.680
When we saw this,

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:01.545
we were at once worried but also curious.
