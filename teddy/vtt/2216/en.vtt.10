00:04:57.022 --> 00:05:00.776
it is well known that human attention
is drawn to novelty,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.319
things that are new in the environment.

00:05:03.343 --> 00:05:05.328
And if you read the sociology literature,

00:05:05.352 --> 00:05:09.652
you know that we like to share
novel information.

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.514
It makes us seem like we have access
to inside information,

00:05:13.538 --> 00:05:17.323
and we gain in status
by spreading this kind of information.

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:24.244
So what we did was we measured the novelty
of an incoming true or false tweet,

00:05:24.268 --> 00:05:28.323
compared to the corpus
of what that individual had seen

00:05:28.347 --> 00:05:31.299
in the 60 days prior on Twitter.
