This is new and surprising,
and so we're more likely to share it.

00:06:31.092 --> 00:06:34.017
At the same time,
there was congressional testimony

00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:37.077
in front of both houses of Congress
in the United States,

00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:40.839
looking at the role of bots
in the spread of misinformation.

00:06:40.863 --> 00:06:42.217
So we looked at this too --

00:06:42.241 --> 00:06:45.839
we used multiple sophisticated
bot-detection algorithms

00:06:45.863 --> 00:06:48.937
to find the bots in our data
and to pull them out.

00:06:49.347 --> 00:06:52.006
So we pulled them out,
we put them back in

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.149
and we compared what happens
to our measurement.

00:06:55.173 --> 00:06:57.466
And what we found was that, yes indeed,

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.172
bots were accelerating
the spread of false news online,
