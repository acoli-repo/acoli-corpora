but they will need to thread this needle

00:13:07.449 --> 00:13:11.236
if we are to achieve the promise

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.902
while avoiding their peril.

00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:17.617
The final thing that we could think about
is algorithms and machine learning.

00:13:17.641 --> 00:13:22.918
Technology devised to root out
