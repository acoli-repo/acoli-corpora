that ever spread on Twitter,

00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:04.303
from its inception in 2006 to 2017.

00:03:04.612 --> 00:03:06.926
And when we studied this information,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.826
we studied verified news stories

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.768
that were verified by six
independent fact-checking organizations.

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:16.554
So we knew which stories were true

00:03:16.578 --> 00:03:18.704
and which stories were false.

00:03:18.728 --> 00:03:20.601
We can measure their diffusion,

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:22.276
the speed of their diffusion,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.395
the depth and breadth of their diffusion,

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.561
how many people become entangled
in this information cascade and so on.

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:30.426
And what we did in this paper
