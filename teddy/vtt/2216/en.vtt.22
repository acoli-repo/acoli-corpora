that didn't have any political motive

00:11:02.268 --> 00:11:04.728
but instead had an economic motive.

00:11:04.752 --> 00:11:06.900

because false news travels
so much farther, faster

00:11:10.472 --> 00:11:12.482
and more deeply than the truth,

00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:17.466
and you can earn advertising dollars

Third, we can think about regulation,
