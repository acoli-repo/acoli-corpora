surprise, disgust, fear, sadness,

00:06:02.815 --> 00:06:05.299
anticipation, joy and trust --

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:11.180
false news exhibited significantly more
surprise and disgust

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.010
in the replies to false tweets.

00:06:14.392 --> 00:06:18.181
And true news exhibited
significantly more anticipation,

00:06:18.205 --> 00:06:19.752
joy and trust

00:06:19.776 --> 00:06:22.323
in reply to true tweets.

00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:26.133
The surprise corroborates

00:06:26.157 --> 00:06:30.766
This is new and surprising,
and so we're more likely to share it.
