False-news spreaders had fewer followers,

00:04:32.095 --> 00:04:34.349
followed fewer people, were less active,

00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:35.833
less often "verified"

00:04:35.857 --> 00:04:38.817
and had been on Twitter
for a shorter period of time.

00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:40.030
And yet,

00:04:40.054 --> 00:04:45.087
false news was 70 percent more likely
to be retweeted than the truth,

00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:48.474
controlling for all of these
and many other factors.

00:04:48.498 --> 00:04:51.188
So we had to come up
with other explanations.

00:04:51.212 --> 00:04:54.679
And we devised what we called
a "novelty hypothesis."

00:04:55.038 --> 00:04:56.998
So if you read the literature,

00:04:57.022 --> 00:05:00.776
it is well known that human attention
is drawn to novelty,
