When President Ronald Reagan began
his first term in 1981,

00:00:11.674 --> 00:00:13.551
the US economy was struggling.

00:00:13.718 --> 00:00:16.345
Unemployment rates were high
and getting higher,

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:21.559
and in 1979, inflation had peaked 
at an all-time high for peacetime.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.437
In an effort to combat these issues,

00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:28.399
Reagan's administration introduced
a number of economic policies,

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:33.654
including tax cuts for large corporations
and high-income earners.
