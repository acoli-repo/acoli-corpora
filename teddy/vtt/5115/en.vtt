How do you get what you want
using just your words?

00:00:11.132 --> 00:00:15.653
Aristotle set out to answer exactly
that question over 2,000 years ago

00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:18.152
with the Treatise on Rhetoric.

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:19.993
Rhetoric, according to Aristotle,

00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:24.013
is the art of seeing the available
means of persuasion.

00:00:24.013 --> 00:00:27.143
And today we apply it to
any form of communication.

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:29.582
Aristotle focused on oration, though,

00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:33.623
and he described three types
of persuasive speech.
