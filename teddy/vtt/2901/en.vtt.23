00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.936
I think that we should
do it in the same way

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.536
the American Constitution works.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.816
When we have a situation

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.696
where we want to change
a law in the American Constitution,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.496
we don't erase the other one.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.736
Alongside that is an amendment,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.016
something that says,

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.800
"This is where we were,
but this is where we are right now."

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.896
I figure if we can do that,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.256
then that will help us
understand a little bit

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.480
about where we're going.
