00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.816
And because of the fact that I realized
that I was able to learn things visually

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.576
that I couldn't learn in other ways,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.456
this became my strategy,
this became my tactic

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.360
for understanding everything else.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.696
I wanted to stay in this relationship.
Things were going well.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.376
I decided, let me keep taking
these art history classes.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.976
One of the last art history classes,
I will not forget, I will never forget.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.216
It was one of those survey
art history classes.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.976
Anybody ever have one of those
survey art history classes,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.936
where they try to teach you
the entire history of art

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.416
in a single semester?

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.456
I'm talking about cave paintings
and Jackson Pollock
