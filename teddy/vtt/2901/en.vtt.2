"Dad, how come he gets to ride,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.360
and they have to walk?"

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.880
It stopped me in my tracks.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.576
It stopped me in my tracks.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.056
There was so much history

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.736
that we would have to go through
to try to explain that,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.800
and that's something
I try to do with them anyways.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.696
It's a question that I probably

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.896
But fundamentally what he was saying was,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.696
"That doesn't look fair.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.240
Dad, that doesn't look fair.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.616
And why is this thing that's so not fair
