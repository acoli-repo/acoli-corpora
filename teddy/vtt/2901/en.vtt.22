I'm trying to give you that opportunity.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.456
I'm trying to answer that question

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.920
that my son had.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.056
I want to make paintings,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.336
I want to make sculptures

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.880
that are honest,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.640
that wrestle with
the struggles of our past

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.960
but speak to the diversity
and the advances of our present.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.056
And we can't do that by taking an eraser
and getting rid of stuff.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.816
That's just not going to work.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.936
I think that we should
do it in the same way
