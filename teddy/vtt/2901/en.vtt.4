00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.456
My father was struggling
with his own things

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.680
for most of my life.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.856
If you really want to know the truth,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.680
the only reason I got into art
is because of a woman.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.816
There was this amazing, amazing,
fantastic, beautiful, smart woman,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.176
four years older than me,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.016
and I wanted to go out with her.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.536
But she said, "You're too young

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.776
and you're not thinking
about your future."

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.456
So I ran on down to the junior college,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.656
registered for some classes,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.336
ran on back,
