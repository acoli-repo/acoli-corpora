00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.176
So I ended up with an art history class,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.440
and I didn't know a thing
about art history.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.080
But something amazing happened
when I went into that class.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.496
For the first time in my academic career,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.896
my visual intelligence was required of me.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.536
For the first time.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.616
The professor would put up an image,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.776
bold strokes of blues and yellows,
and say, "Who's that?"

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.696
And I'd go, "That's Van Gogh.
Clearly that is Van Gogh.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.296
I got this."

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.256
