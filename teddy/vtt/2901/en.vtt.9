I'm talking about cave paintings
and Jackson Pollock

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.736
just crunched together all in the same --

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.040
It doesn't really work,
but they try anyway.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.176
Well, at the beginning of the semester,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.416
I looked at the book,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.376
and in this 400-page book
was about a 14-page section

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.496
that was on black people in painting.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.536
Now, this was a crammed in section

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.936
that had representations
of black people in painting

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.696
and black people who painted.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.016
It was poorly curated,
let's just put it that way.
