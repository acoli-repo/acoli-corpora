00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.816
I think of it in the same way

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.080
we think of --

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.856
Let me step back a second.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.216
You remember old-school cameras,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.536
where when you took a picture,
you actually had to focus. Right?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.816
You'd put the camera up,

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.816
and if I wanted you in focus,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.840
I would move the lens a little to the left

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:50.176
and you would come forward.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.296
I could move the lens
a little to the right,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.576
and you would go back and the folks
in the background would come out.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.616
I'm just trying to do that here.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.216
I'm trying to give you that opportunity.
