I love museums.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.016
Have you guys ever been
to the Natural History Museum?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.456
In New York City?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.136

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.856
So one of the things that I do
is I take my kids to the museum.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.456
Recently I took them
to the Natural History Museum.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.600
I had my two sons with me,
Sabian and Dabith.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.256
And we go into the front
entrance of the museum,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.400

of Teddy Roosevelt out there.

00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:29.936
You guys know which one I'm talking about.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.056
Teddy Roosevelt is sitting there
with one hand on the horse,
