00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.616
And why is this thing that's so not fair

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.720
sitting outside
of such an amazing institution."

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.296
And his question got me wondering,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.176
is there a way for us
to amend our public sculptures,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.560
our national monuments?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.520
Not erase them,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.892
but is there a way to amend them?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.056
Now, I didn't grow up going to museums.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.416
That's not my history.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.616
My mother was 15 years old
when I was born.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.960
She is amazing.
