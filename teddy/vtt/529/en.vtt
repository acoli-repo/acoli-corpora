00:00:00.641 --> 00:00:03.928
So, there's about
seven and a half billion of us.

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:08.506
The World Health Organization tells us
that 300 million of us are depressed,

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:12.089
and about 800,000 people
take their lives every year.

00:00:12.803 --> 00:00:16.877
A tiny subset of them choose
a profoundly nihilistic route,

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:21.116
which is they die in the act of killing
as many people as possible.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.479
These are some famous recent examples.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.052
And here's a less famous one.
It happened about nine weeks ago.

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:28.268
If you don't remember it,

00:00:28.292 --> 00:00:30.374
it's because there's
a lot of this going on.
