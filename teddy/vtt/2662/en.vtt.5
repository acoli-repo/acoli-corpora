Magd is a guide from the Church.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.936
He told me the only person I needed
to convince was Father Samaan,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.416
who is the leader of the community.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.656
But to convince Father Samaan,
I needed to convince Mario,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.736
who is a Polish artist
who moved to Cairo 20 years ago

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.576
and who created all the artwork
of the Cave Church.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.520
I am really grateful to Mario.
He was the key of the project.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.656
He managed to get me
a meeting with Father Samaan,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.416
and surprisingly, he loved the idea.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.696
He asked me about where I painted before

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.176
and how I will make it happen.
