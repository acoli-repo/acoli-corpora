00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.896
At the beginning of the project,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.576
I numbered all those
buildings on my sketch,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.096
and there was no real interaction
with the community.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.256
People didn’t get the point of all this.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.776
But fast enough, those building numbers
became family names.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.400
The first building
was the house of Uncle Ibrahim.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.176
Uncle Ibrahim is such
an enthusiastic person.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.256
He was always singing and making jokes,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.616
and his daughters and sons
saved me from his bull

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.096
who wanted to attack me
on the fourth floor.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.416
