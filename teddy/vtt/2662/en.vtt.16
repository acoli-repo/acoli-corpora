So at this exact point I realized actually

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.056
the Zaraeeb community
was the ideal context

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.680
to raise the topic of perception.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.536
We need to question
our level of misconception

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.216
and judgment we can have as a society

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.680
upon communities
based on their differences.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.416
I remember how we got delayed
on Uncle Ibrahim's house

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.576
when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.176
were eating the sand bags
that hold the lifts.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.760
(Laughter)

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.576
The house of Uncle Bakheet
and Aunty Fareeda
