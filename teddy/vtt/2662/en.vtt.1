00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.056
was in 2009 when the Egyptian authorities
under the regime of Hosni Mubarak

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.880
decided to slaughter 300,000 pigs
using the pretext of H1N1 virus.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.496
Originally, they are pig breeders.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.696
Their pigs and other animals
are fed with the organic waste

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.696
that they collect on a daily basis.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.480
This event killed their livelihood.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.536
The first time I entered Manshiyat Naser,
it felt like a maze.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.256
I was looking for the St. Simon Monastery
on the top of the Muqattam Mountain.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.456
So you go right, then straight,
then right again, then left

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.176
to reach all the way to the top.
