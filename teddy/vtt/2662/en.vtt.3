The Zaraeeb, that’s how
they call themselves,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.616
which means the pig breeders,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.016
have been collecting the garbage of Cairo

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.816
and sorting it in their own
neighborhood for decades.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.976
They have developed
one of the most efficient

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.296
and highly profitable systems
on a global level.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.936
Still, the place is perceived
as dirty, marginalized and segregated

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.040
because of their association
with the trash.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.936
So my initial idea
was to create an anamorphic piece,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.816
a piece that you can only see
from one vantage point.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.176
I wanted to challenge myself artistically
by painting over several buildings
