WEBVTT

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.256
a strong and solid team from France,
North Africa, Middle East and the US,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.736
and after a year of planning
and logistics, there we are,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.376
my team and some members
from the local community

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.896
creating a piece that will
spread over 50 buildings,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.816
some filling up the space
of the calligraphy

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.256
that I trace with colors.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.336
Here some blue, there some yellow,
there some orange.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.495
Some others carrying some sand bags

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.616
and putting them
on the top of the buildings

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.976
to hold those manual lifts,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.896
and some others assembling
and disassembling those same lifts

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.120
and moving them around
the different buildings.
