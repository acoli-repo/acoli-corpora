The house of Uncle Bakheet
and Aunty Fareeda

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.256
was this kind of meeting point.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.135
Everybody used to gather there.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.096
I think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.736
when he said that was
a project of peace and unity,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.559
because I really felt
that people were coming together.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.496
Everyone was greeting us
with a smile, offering us a drink

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.536
or inviting us into their
own house for lunch.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.576
Sometime, you are
at the first level of a building,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.136
and somebody opens his window
and offers you some tea.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.616
And then the same thing happens
on the second floor.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.656
And you keep going all the way to the top.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.896
