00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.896
(Laughter)

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.376
(Applause)

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.856
I think I never drink as much tea
as I did in Egypt.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.696
(Laughter)

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.456
And to be honest with you,
we could have finished earlier,

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.656
but I think it took us three weeks
because of all those tea breaks.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.480
(Laughter)

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.056
In Egypt, they have another expression,
which is "Nawartouna,"

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.200
which means, "You brought light to us."

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.096
In Manshiyat Naser
they were always telling us this.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.256
The calligraphy, actually --

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.336
I used a white glow-in-the-dark paint
for the calligraphy
