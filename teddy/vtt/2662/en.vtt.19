I used a white glow-in-the-dark paint
for the calligraphy

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.536
so at the end of the project,
we rented some black light projectors

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.936
and lit up the whole neighborhood,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.336
surprising everybody around.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.616
We wanted to tell them

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.840
that they are the ones
who brought light to us.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.560
(Applause)

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.056
The Zaraeeb community
