00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.176
I wanted to challenge myself artistically
by painting over several buildings

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.336
and having it only fully visible
from one point on the Muqattam Mountain.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.936
The Muqattam Mountain
is the pride of the community.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.416
This is where they built
the St. Simon Monastery,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.560
a 10,000-seat cave church
that they carved into the mountain itself.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.256
So, the first time
I stood on top of the mountain

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.896
and I looked at the neighborhood,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.816
I asked myself, how on earth
will I convince all those owners

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.016
to let me paint on their buildings?

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.416
And then Magd came.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.816
Magd is a guide from the Church.
