00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.936
and actually there is somebody
who is building a second floor

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.616
in front of Uncle Ibrahim's house,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.496
so it's covering part of the painting,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.656
so I might need to go back
and paint over it.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.296
(Laughter)

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.696
It was about the experience,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.136
about the story,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.440
about the moment.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.456
From the streets of the neighborhood,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.100
the painting appears in fragments,

00:10:48.124 --> 00:10:50.016
isolated from one another,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.296
standing alone.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.496
But connected with the sign of calligraphy

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.376
that today reveals the powerful message
that we should all think about

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.080
before we want to judge somebody.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.776
Anyone who wants to see
the sunlight clearly
