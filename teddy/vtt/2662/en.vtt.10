(Laughter)

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.736
Actually, the bull saw me from the window
and came out on the balcony.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.096
(Laughter)

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.320
Yeah.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.336
Uncle Ibrahim was always
hanging out on the balcony

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.336
and talking to me while I was painting.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.336
I remember him saying that he didn’t
go to the mountain for 10 years,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.176
and that he never takes a day off.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.976
He said that if he stopped working,
who will stop the garbage?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.416
But surprisingly,
at the end of the project,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.256
he came all the way to the mountain
to look at the piece.
