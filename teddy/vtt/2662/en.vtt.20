The Zaraeeb community
are strong, honest, hard workers,

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.816
and they know their value.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.976
The people of Cairo
call them "the Zabaleen,"

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.976
which means "the people of the garbage,"

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.736
but ironically,
the people of Manshiyat Naser

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.616
call the people of Cairo the Zabaleen.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.576
They say, they are the ones
who produce the garbage, not them.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.816
(Laughter)

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.216
(Applause)

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.616
The goal was to leave something
to this community,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.776
but I feel that they are the ones
who left something in our lives.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.896
You know, the art project
was just a pretext

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.576
for this amazing human experience.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.016
The art piece at some point
will disappear, vanish,

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.936
and actually there is somebody
who is building a second floor
