He said that it was a project
of peace and unity

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.040
and that it brought people together.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.896
So his perception
towards the project changed,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.816
and my perception towards
the community changed also,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.776
and towards what they do.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.416
All the garbage that everybody
is disgusted by is not theirs.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.936
They just work out of it.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.216
Actually, they don’t live in the garbage.
They live from the garbage.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.456
So I started doubting myself and wondering

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.256
what was the real purpose
of this whole project?

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.376
It was not about beautifying
a place by bringing art to it.
