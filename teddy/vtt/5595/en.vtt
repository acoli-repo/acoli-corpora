“A few dozen hours can affect the 
outcome of whole lifetimes/

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:14.257
And that when they do, 
those few dozen hours,

00:00:14.257 --> 00:00:17.187
like the salvaged remains 
of a burned clock…

00:00:17.187 --> 00:00:21.797
must be resurrected from the ruins 
and examined.”
