Hi.

00:00:02.944 --> 00:00:04.158
My name's Sarah,

00:00:05.087 --> 00:00:07.926
and I've been priced out
of the housing market.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:10.992
In fact,

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:15.967
I'm one of the majority of my generation

00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:18.079
who can't afford a home.

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:24.227
And in 2017, home ownership
amongst young Australians

00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:29.176
has fallen to the lowest level
in recorded history.
