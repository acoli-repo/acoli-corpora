00:09:30.488 --> 00:09:32.789
hammer of tomorrow, if you like.

00:09:32.813 --> 00:09:35.845
And the one common thread
that connects all these things

00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:38.281
is computer-aided design.

00:09:38.305 --> 00:09:43.078
We will need models
to build using these techniques,

00:09:43.434 --> 00:09:48.011
models like the ones being developed
by players in our game.

00:09:50.545 --> 00:09:54.571
I want to put every person that wants one

00:09:54.595 --> 00:09:56.779
in a home of their own design.

00:09:57.761 --> 00:10:00.070
And there are many
more applications still.
