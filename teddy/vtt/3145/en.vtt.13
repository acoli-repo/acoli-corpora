00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:31.617
but today, our current operating model

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.251
operates at a ten-to-one ratio.

00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:37.008
So for every 10 homes we build,

00:06:37.032 --> 00:06:40.264
we can build a home for someone in need.

00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:45.675
(Applause)

00:06:46.022 --> 00:06:49.760
This is made possible because today,

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.564
with design for manufacture and assembly,

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:58.029
which uses light gauge
steel frame construction,

00:06:58.053 --> 00:07:00.450
shipped and assembled on-site,
