And that led to me asking
one very simple question:

00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:37.919
What is building a house?

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.482
What is it?

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:45.109
Well, it turns out that building a house

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:50.617
is making a series of decisions,
some with physical consequences,

00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:54.092
within a defined set of parameters.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.728
Now, having worked in software
applications for some time now,

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:00.759
this all sounded very familiar to me.
