00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:30.371
and it's the beautiful chemical marriage
of magnesium oxide and local sand,

00:08:30.395 --> 00:08:34.163
which they can now use
to print solid stone walls.

00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:35.783
And in France,

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:39.362
they have a regulator-approved
although still experimental process

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:42.950
where they print two parallel
tracks of foam insulation

00:08:42.974 --> 00:08:46.057
and pour concrete in the middle
to create solid stone.

00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:52.942
And in Dubai, sitting at the foot
of those two glorious Emirates Towers,

00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:55.910
is a vision of the future
in the middle of the desert.

00:08:55.934 --> 00:08:59.513
They've got their experimental
office of the future,

00:08:59.537 --> 00:09:02.918
which is constructed
using 3-D printed concrete
