00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:36.085
I decided to build my own home.

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:40.116
But the prognosis
wasn't good there, either.

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:44.203
Architects cater for the one percent,

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:45.807
builders are scarce,

00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:49.378
so service is inconsistent
and prices are high.

00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:54.053

00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:57.810

00:00:58.704 --> 00:00:59.863
