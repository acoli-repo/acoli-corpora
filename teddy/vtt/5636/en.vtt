00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:13.887
participants recalled getting lost 
in a shopping mall as children.

00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:20.887
one even remembered that the old man
who rescued him

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.863
was wearing a flannel shirt.

00:00:23.863 --> 00:00:28.148

had actually gotten lost in a mall.
