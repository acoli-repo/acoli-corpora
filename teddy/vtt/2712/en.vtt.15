might have evolved
not to help us find out the truth,

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:36.133
but to help us manipulate each other,
defend our reputation ...

00:07:36.157 --> 00:07:39.123
We're really, really good
at justifying ourselves.

00:07:39.147 --> 00:07:41.514
And when you bring
group interests into account,

00:07:41.538 --> 00:07:44.275
so it's not just me,
it's my team versus your team,

00:07:44.299 --> 00:07:47.212
whereas if you're evaluating evidence
that your side is wrong,

00:07:47.236 --> 00:07:48.993
we just can't accept that.

00:07:49.017 --> 00:07:51.734
So this is why you can't win
a political argument.

00:07:51.758 --> 00:07:53.251
If you're debating something,

00:07:53.275 --> 00:07:56.322
you can't persuade the person
with reasons and evidence,

00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:58.691
because that's not
the way reasoning works.

00:07:58.715 --> 00:08:01.830
So now, give us the internet,
give us Google:
