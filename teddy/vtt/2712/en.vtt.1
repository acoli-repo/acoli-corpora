00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:33.385
that the degree to which we feel
that the other side is not just --

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:36.383
we don't just dislike them;
we strongly dislike them,

00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:39.883
and we think that they are
a threat to the nation.

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:41.871
Those numbers have been going up and up,

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:44.632
and those are over 50 percent
now on both sides.

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:45.807
People are scared,

00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:49.458
because it feels like this is different
than before; it's much more intense.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.002
Whenever I look
at any sort of social puzzle,

00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:55.143
I always apply the three basic
principles of moral psychology,

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:57.061
and I think they'll help us here.

00:00:57.085 --> 00:00:59.818
So the first thing that you
have to always keep in mind

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:01.578
when you're thinking about politics
