The question you have to look at is:

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.821
What aspects of our society
are making that more bitter,

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:34.375
and what are calming them down?

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.960
CA: That's a very dark proverb.

00:01:35.984 --> 00:01:40.157
You're saying that that's actually
baked into most people's mental wiring

00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:41.332
at some level?

00:01:41.356 --> 00:01:45.160
JH: Oh, absolutely. This is just
a basic aspect of human social cognition.

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:47.507
But we can also live together
really peacefully,

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:50.926
and we've invented all kinds
of fun ways of, like, playing war.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.332
I mean, sports, politics --

00:01:52.356 --> 00:01:56.051
these are all ways that we get
to exercise this tribal nature

00:01:56.075 --> 00:01:57.658
without actually hurting anyone.

00:01:57.682 --> 00:02:02.027
We're also really good at trade
and exploration and meeting new people.
