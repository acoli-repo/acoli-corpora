and saw two tweets next to each other.

00:11:03.335 --> 00:11:07.547
One, against a picture of racist graffiti:

00:11:08.007 --> 00:11:09.640
"This is disgusting!

00:11:09.664 --> 00:11:12.834
Ugliness in this country,
brought to us by #Trump."

00:11:13.424 --> 00:11:14.806
And then the next one is:

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:18.642
"Crooked Hillary
dedication page. Disgusting!"

00:11:19.176 --> 00:11:23.383
So this idea of "disgust"
is troubling to me.

00:11:23.407 --> 00:11:26.642
Because you can have an argument
or a disagreement about something,

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:28.227
you can get angry at someone.

00:11:29.094 --> 00:11:32.687
Disgust, I've heard you say,
takes things to a much deeper level.
