Empathy is a good thing, and empathy
for the preferred classes of victims.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.633
So it's important to empathize

00:17:04.657 --> 00:17:07.481
with the groups that we on the left
think are so important.

00:17:07.505 --> 00:17:10.036
That's easy to do,
because you get points for that.

00:17:10.442 --> 00:17:14.091
But empathy really should get you points
if you do it when it's hard to do.

00:17:14.513 --> 00:17:16.267
And, I think ...

00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:21.379

of dealing with our race problems

00:17:21.403 --> 00:17:23.658
and legal discrimination,

00:17:23.682 --> 00:17:25.869
and that was our top priority
for a long time

00:17:25.893 --> 00:17:27.143
and it still is important.

00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:28.696
But I think this year,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.124
I'm hoping it will make people see
