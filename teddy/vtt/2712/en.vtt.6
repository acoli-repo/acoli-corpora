00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.120
people who have much more
of a sense of being rooted,

00:03:00.144 --> 00:03:03.337
they care about their town,
their community and their nation.

00:03:03.824 --> 00:03:07.861
And then those who are
anti-parochial and who --

00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:11.285
whenever I get confused, I just think
of the John Lennon song "Imagine."

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.138
"Imagine there's no countries,
nothing to kill or die for."

00:03:14.162 --> 00:03:17.375
And so these are the people
who want more global governance,

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.073
they don't like nation states,
they don't like borders.

00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:21.922
You see this all over Europe as well.

00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:25.172
There's a great metaphor guy --
actually, his name is Shakespeare --

00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:26.777
writing ten years ago in Britain.

00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:27.968
He had a metaphor:

00:03:27.992 --> 00:03:31.265
"Are we drawbridge-uppers
or drawbridge-downers?"
