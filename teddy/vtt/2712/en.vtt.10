00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.983
a set of progressive
left-leaning values, which says,

00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:05.008
"Drawbridge down!
The world is a great place.

00:05:05.032 --> 00:05:08.064
People in Syria are suffering --
we must welcome them in."

00:05:08.088 --> 00:05:09.465
And it's a beautiful thing.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:12.517
But if, and I was in Sweden
this summer,

00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:15.724
if the discourse in Sweden
is fairly politically correct

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.985
and they can't talk about the downsides,

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.996
you end up bringing a lot of people in.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.712
That's going to cut social capital,

00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:23.681
it makes it hard to have a welfare state

00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:26.261
and they might end up,
as we have in America,

00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:29.898
with a racially divided, visibly
racially divided, society.

00:05:29.922 --> 00:05:32.182
So this is all very
uncomfortable to talk about.
