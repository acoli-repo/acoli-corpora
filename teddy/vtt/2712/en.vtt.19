00:09:28.504 --> 00:09:30.907
that says if your country was at war,

00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:32.488
especially when you were young,

00:09:32.512 --> 00:09:35.626
then we test you 30 years later
in a commons dilemma

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.979
or a prisoner's dilemma,

00:09:37.003 --> 00:09:38.294
you're more cooperative.

00:09:38.983 --> 00:09:41.856
Because of our tribal nature, if you're --

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.797
my parents were teenagers
during World War II,

00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.382
and they would go out
looking for scraps of aluminum

00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:48.595
to help the war effort.

00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:50.797
I mean, everybody pulled together.

00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:52.350
And so then these people go on,

00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:54.772
they rise up through business
and government,

00:09:54.796 --> 00:09:56.427
they take leadership positions.

00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:59.702
They're really good
at compromise and cooperation.

00:09:59.726 --> 00:10:01.661
They all retire by the '90s.
