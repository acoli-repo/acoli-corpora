00:01:57.682 --> 00:02:02.027
We're also really good at trade
and exploration and meeting new people.

00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:05.350
So you have to see our tribalism
as something that goes up or down --

00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:08.226
it's not like we're doomed
to always be fighting each other,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.100
but we'll never have world peace.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.202
CA: The size of that tribe
can shrink or expand.

00:02:14.226 --> 00:02:15.377
JH: Right.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.388
CA: The size of what we consider "us"

00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:19.833
and what we consider "other" or "them"

00:02:19.857 --> 00:02:21.987
can change.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.200
And some people believed that process
could continue indefinitely.

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:29.416
JH: That's right.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.646
CA: And we were indeed expanding
the sense of tribe for a while.
