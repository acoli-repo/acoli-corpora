JH: I think the big issue, especially
in Europe but also here,

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.399
is the issue of immigration.

00:04:02.423 --> 00:04:05.492
And I think this is where
we have to look very carefully

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:09.147
at the social science
about diversity and immigration.

00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:10.885
Once something becomes politicized,

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.933
once it becomes something
that the left loves and the right --

00:04:13.957 --> 00:04:17.058
then even the social scientists
can't think straight about it.

00:04:17.082 --> 00:04:19.039
Now, diversity is good in a lot of ways.

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:21.270
It clearly creates more innovation.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.771
The American economy
has grown enormously from it.

00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:26.177
Diversity and immigration
do a lot of good things.

00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:28.829
But what the globalists,
I think, don't see,

00:04:28.853 --> 00:04:30.360
what they don't want to see,
