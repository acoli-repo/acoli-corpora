00:08:28.502 --> 00:08:30.120
of human nature and left-right --

00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:32.610
that each side is right
about certain things,

00:08:32.634 --> 00:08:34.755
but then it goes blind to other things.

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:37.757
And so the left generally believes
that human nature is good:

00:08:37.781 --> 00:08:40.946
bring people together, knock down
the walls and all will be well.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.528
The right -- social conservatives,
not libertarians --

00:08:43.552 --> 00:08:47.805
social conservatives generally
believe people can be greedy

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:49.211
and sexual and selfish,

00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:51.655
and we need regulation,
and we need restrictions.

00:08:52.214 --> 00:08:54.616
So, yeah, if you knock down all the walls,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.869
allow people to communicate
all over the world,

00:08:56.893 --> 00:08:58.951
you get a lot of porn and a lot of racism.

00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:00.236
CA: So help us understand.
