00:16:24.963 --> 00:16:31.482
CA: So, are you saying
that we almost need a new type of empathy?

00:16:31.506 --> 00:16:33.676
Empathy is traditionally framed as:

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.391
"Oh, I feel your pain.
I can put myself in your shoes."

00:16:36.415 --> 00:16:39.344
And we apply it to the poor,
the needy, the suffering.

00:16:40.023 --> 00:16:43.846
We don't usually apply it
to people who we feel as other,

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.335
or we're disgusted by.

00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:46.510
JH: No. That's right.

00:16:46.534 --> 00:16:51.364
CA: What would it look like
to build that type of empathy?

00:16:52.268 --> 00:16:53.506
JH: Actually, I think ...

00:16:54.145 --> 00:16:56.450
Empathy is a very, very
hot topic in psychology,

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:59.132
and it's a very popular word
on the left in particular.

00:16:59.156 --> 00:17:03.156
Empathy is a good thing, and empathy
for the preferred classes of victims.
