00:14:56.836 --> 00:15:00.817
is that each side tries to make
the other side so horrible, so awful,

00:15:00.841 --> 00:15:02.882
that you'll vote for my guy by default.

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:06.289
And so as we more and more vote
against the other side

00:15:06.313 --> 00:15:07.644
and not for our side,

00:15:07.668 --> 00:15:13.175
you have to keep in mind
that if people are on the left,

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:16.109
they think, "Well, I used to think
that Republicans were bad,

00:15:16.133 --> 00:15:17.616
but now Donald Trump proves it.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.491
And now every Republican,
I can paint with all the things

00:15:20.515 --> 00:15:21.897
that I think about Trump."

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.514
And that's not necessarily true.

00:15:23.538 --> 00:15:26.230
They're generally not very happy
with their candidate.

00:15:26.254 --> 00:15:30.970
This is the most negative partisanship
election in American history.
