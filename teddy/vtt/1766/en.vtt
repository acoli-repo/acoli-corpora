00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:03.856
Over the past six months, I've spent my time

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:07.247
traveling. I think I've done 60,000 miles,

00:00:07.247 --> 00:00:10.169
but without leaving my desk.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.015
And the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people.

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:15.968
I look like one person but I'm two people. I'm Eddie who is here,

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:20.369
and at the same time, my alter ego is a big green boxy

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.049
avatar nicknamed Cyber Frank.

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:26.858
So that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start,

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:29.920
if it's possible, with a test, because I do business stuff,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.504
so it's important that we focus on outcomes.
