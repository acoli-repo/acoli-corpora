00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.736
Those people in relationships
that bought over teens online,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.816
we can do that with peer-to-peer security.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.376
Individuals have more power
than ever before

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.320
to affect national
and international security.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.616
And we can create those positive
peer-to-peer relationships

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.840
on and offline,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.056
we can support and educate the next
generation of hackers, like myself,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.640
instead of saying, "You can either be
a criminal or join the NSA."

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.720
That matters today.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.136
And it's not just individuals --
it's organizations, corporations even.
