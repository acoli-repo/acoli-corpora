00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.480
of one of the most powerful,
violent organizations in the world.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.496
And so we live in an era

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.056
that lacks the clarity
of the past in conflict,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.896
in who we're fighting,
in the motivations behind attacks,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.776
in the tools and techniques used,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.440
and how quickly they evolve.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.216
And the question still remains:

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.776
what can individuals,
organizations and governments do?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.616
For answers to these questions,
it starts with individuals,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.400
and I think peer-to-peer security
is the answer.
