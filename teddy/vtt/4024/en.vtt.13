00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.136
And it's not just individuals --
it's organizations, corporations even.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.696
They have an advantage
to act across more borders,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.256
more effectively and more rapidly
than governments can,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.160
and there's a set
of real incentives there.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.136
It's profitable and valuable

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.656
to be seen as trustworthy
in the digital age,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.656
and will only be more so
in future generations to come.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.496
But we still can't ignore government,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.856
because that's who we turn to
for collective action

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.640
to keep us safe and secure.
