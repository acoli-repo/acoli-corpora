And under all this is a vacuum of power

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.136
where non-state actors, individuals
and private organizations

military and intelligence agencies.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.016
And this is because,
in the digital age of conflict,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.296

platforms like the ones I mentioned,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.656
and more disruptive ones,
