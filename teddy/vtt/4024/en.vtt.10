for every bit of information you release."

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.520
And so it ended there because
it would become too gruesome to continue.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.600
But what was powerful about this

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.216
was that anonymous individuals,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.856
not federal policia,
not military, not politicians,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.056
could strike fear deep into the heart

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.480
of one of the most powerful,
violent organizations in the world.
