By banning encryption in favor
of mass surveillance and mass hacking,

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.680
sure, GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.595
But that doesn't mean
that they're the only ones that can.

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:39.776
Capabilities are cheap, even free.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.416
Technical ability
is rising around the world,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.960
and individuals and small groups
have the advantage.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.456
So today it might just be
the NSA and GCHQ,

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.242
but who's to say that the Chinese
can't find that backdoor?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.240
Or in another generation,
some kid in his basement in Estonia?

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.656
And so I would say that it's
not what governments can do,
