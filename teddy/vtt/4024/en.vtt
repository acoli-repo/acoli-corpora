In 2008, Burhan Hassan, age 17,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.896
boarded a flight from Minneapolis

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.216
to the Horn of Africa.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.656
And while Burhan was the youngest recruit,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.336
he was not alone.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.736
Al-Shabaab managed to recruit
over two dozen young men

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.336
in their late teens and early 20s

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.376
with a heavy presence
on social media platforms like Facebook.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.656
With the Internet and other technologies,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.376
they've changed our everyday lives,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.216
but they've also changed
recruitment, radicalization
