00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.216
but it was embedded with malware.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.216
And so when you downloaded this image,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.296
it hacked your system.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.360
It took six days to deploy
a global malware campaign.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.136
The divide between physical
and digital domains today

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.576
ceases to exist,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.536
where we have offline attacks
like those in Paris

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.800
appropriated for online hacks.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.776
And it goes the other way as well,
with recruitment.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.256
We see online radicalization of teens,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.560
who can then be deployed globally
for offline terrorist attacks.
