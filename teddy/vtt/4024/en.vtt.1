recruitment, radicalization

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.960
and the front lines of conflict today.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.136
What about the links connecting Twitter,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.096
Google and protesters
fighting for democracy?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.136
These numbers represent
Google's public DNS servers,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.696
effectively the only
digital border crossing

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.776
protesters had and could use

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.616

to reach the outside world

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.256
and to spread viral awareness

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.560
of what was happening
in their own country.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.376
Today, conflict is essentially borderless.
