and more disruptive ones,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.456
can be adapted, learned, and deployed
by individuals and organizations

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.000
faster than governments can react.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.936
To understand the pace
of our own government thinking on this,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.936
I like to turn to something aptly named

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.096
the Worldwide Threat Assessment,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.816
where every year the Director
of National Intelligence in the US

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.656
looks at the global threat landscape,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.936
and he says, "These are the threats,
these are the details,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.016
and this is how we rank them."
