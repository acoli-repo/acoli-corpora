00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.445
and the more motor units it rallies
to help you achieve your task.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:04.818
But what if the door 
is made of solid iron?

00:01:04.818 --> 00:01:06.773
At this point, your arm muscles alone

00:01:06.773 --> 00:01:10.394
won't be able to generate 
enough tension to pull it open,

00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:13.868
so your brain appeals 
to other muscles for help.

00:01:13.868 --> 00:01:17.795
You plant your feet, tighten your belly,
and tense your back,

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:20.439
generating enough force to yank it open.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.749
Your nervous system has just leveraged
the resources you already have,

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:26.387
other muscles,

00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:27.634
to meet the demand.

00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:28.973
While all this is happening,

00:01:28.973 --> 00:01:32.945
your muscle fibers undergo 
another kind of cellular change.
