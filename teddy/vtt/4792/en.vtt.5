they will shrink,

00:02:31.252 --> 00:02:34.325
a process known as muscular atrophy.

00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:37.700
In contrast, exposing the muscle
to a high-degree of tension,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.483
especially while 
the muscle is lengthening,

00:02:40.483 --> 00:02:42.861
also called an eccentric contraction,

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:46.526
generates effective conditions
for new growth.

00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:50.304
However, muscles rely on more than
just activity to grow.

00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:53.038
Without proper nutrition, 
hormones, and rest,

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:56.635
your body would never be able
to repair damaged muscle fibers.

00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:59.574
Protein in our diet preserves muscle mass


00:02:59.574 --> 00:03:02.465
by providing the building 
blocks for new tissue
