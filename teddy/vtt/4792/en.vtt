00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:08.087
Muscles.

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:10.404
We have over 600 of them.

00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:14.348
They make up between 
1/3 and 1/2 of our body weight,

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.016
and along with connective tissue,

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:20.261
they bind us together, hold us up,
and help us move.

00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:22.852
And whether or not body building
is your hobby,

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:25.265
muscles need your constant attention

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:27.579
because the way you treat 
them on a daily basis

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.048
determines whether 
they will wither or grow.
