00:01:59.114 --> 00:02:01.644
The resulting cycle of damage and repair

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:04.829
eventually makes muscles 
bigger and stronger

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.299
as they adapt to progressively 
greater demands.

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.983
Since our bodies have already adapted
to most everyday activities,

00:02:11.983 --> 00:02:14.682
those generally don't produce 
enough stress

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:17.213
to stimulate new muscle growth.

00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:20.565
So, to build new muscle,
a process called hypertrophy,

00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:25.247
our cells need to be exposed to higher
workloads than they are used to.

00:02:25.247 --> 00:02:29.615
In fact, if you don't continuously expose
your muscles to some resistance,

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:31.252
they will shrink,
