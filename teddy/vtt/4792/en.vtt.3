00:01:28.973 --> 00:01:32.945
your muscle fibers undergo 
another kind of cellular change.

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:37.538
As you expose them to stress,
they experience microscopic damage,

00:01:37.538 --> 00:01:40.333
which, in this context, is a good thing.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:45.808
In response, the injured cells release
inflammatory molecules called cytokines

00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:50.112
that activate the immune system
to repair the injury.

00:01:50.112 --> 00:01:53.524
This is when the muscle-building 
magic happens.

00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:55.895
The greater the damage 
to the muscle tissue,

00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:59.114
the more your body 
will need to repair itself.

00:01:59.114 --> 00:02:01.644
The resulting cycle of damage and repair
