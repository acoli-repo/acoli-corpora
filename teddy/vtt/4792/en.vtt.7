00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.482
have a leg up in the muscle building game.

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:34.631
Genetic factors also play a role
in one's ability to grow muscle.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:38.479
Some people have more robust 
immune reactions to muscle damage,

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:42.015
and are better able to repair
and replace damaged muscle fibers,

00:03:42.015 --> 00:03:44.901
increasing their 
muscle-building potential.

00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:47.596
The body responds to the demands
you place on it.

00:03:47.596 --> 00:03:52.370
If you tear your muscles up,
eat right, rest and repeat,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.185
you'll create the conditions to make your
muscles as big and strong as possible.

00:03:57.185 --> 00:03:59.566
It is with muscles as it is with life:

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:03.292
Meaningful growth requires challenge
and stress.
