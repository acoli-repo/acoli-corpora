00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.048
determines whether 
they will wither or grow.

00:00:31.048 --> 00:00:34.158
Say you're standing in front of a door,
ready to pull it open.

00:00:34.158 --> 00:00:39.077
Your brain and muscles are perfectly
poised to help you achieve this goal.

00:00:39.077 --> 00:00:43.121
First, your brain sends a signal
to motor neurons inside your arm.

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.937
When they receive this message,
they fire,

00:00:45.937 --> 00:00:49.051
causing muscles to contract and relax,

00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:53.414
which pull on the bones in your arm
and generate the needed movement.

00:00:53.414 --> 00:00:57.460
The bigger the challenge becomes,
the bigger the brain's signal grows,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.445
and the more motor units it rallies
to help you achieve your task.
