00:02:59.574 --> 00:03:02.465
by providing the building 
blocks for new tissue

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:04.389
in the form of amino acids.

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.020
Adequate protein intake,
along with naturally occurring hormones,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.097
like insulin-like growth factor
and testosterone,

00:03:11.097 --> 00:03:16.134
help shift the body into a state
where tissue is repaired and grown.

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:19.896
This vital repair process mainly occurs
when we're resting,

00:03:19.896 --> 00:03:22.110
especially at night while sleeping.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.255
Gender and age 
affect this repair mechanism,

00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:27.731
which is why young men 
with more testosterone

00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.482
have a leg up in the muscle building game.
