That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
For me, it's a very, very important thing.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Even on my journey up here --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
If you actually think, you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I'm sitting on a train.

Even though I know the chair is made of atoms

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and therefore actually in many ways empty space,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I find it comfortable.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I look out the window, and I realize

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that every single time we stop and I look out that window,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
framed in that window,
