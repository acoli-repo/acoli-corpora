Even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
for bad housework, for instance.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
You house is in a terrible state.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Your partner is about to return.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
You think, what should I do?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Do nothing.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
All you have to do

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
is, when she walks in, using a quantum interpretation,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
say, "I'm so sorry.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I stopped observing the house for a moment,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and when I started observing again,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
everything had happened."

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
(Laughter)

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming.
