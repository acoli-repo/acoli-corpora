00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
the universe itself is not wasteful.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We are all totally recyclable.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And when we die,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
we don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
This is a wonderful thing.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Understanding, to me,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
does not remove the wonder and the joy.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
For instance, my wife could turn to me and she may say,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
"Why do you love me?"

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And I can with all honesty

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
look her in the eye and say,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
"Because our pheromones

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
matched our olfactory receptors."
