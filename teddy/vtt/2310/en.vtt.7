00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Your consciousness, the you-ness of you, the me-ness of me --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that gets this one go.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
But every single thing that makes us,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
every atom in us,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
has already created a myriad of different things

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and will go on to create a myriad of new things.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We have been mountains

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and apples and pulsars

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and other people's knees.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Who knows, maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
That is a good thing.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Unlike the occupants of the universe,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
the universe itself is not wasteful.
