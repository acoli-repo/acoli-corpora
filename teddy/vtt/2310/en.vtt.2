Yes, they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and after a week, they only used it as a bathroom.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
(Laughter)

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So the main element though, the main complaint we get --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and one that I find most worrying --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is that people say, "Oh, why do you insist

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
on ruining the magic?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You bring in science, and it ruins the magic."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Now I'm an arts graduate;

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I love myth and magic

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and existentialism and self-loathing.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's what I do.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But I also don't understand

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
how it does ruin the magic.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
All of the magic, I think,
