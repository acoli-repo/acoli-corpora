00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
sometimes terrifying ideas

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
from the quantum interpretation --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is a wonderful thing.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
That every person here, every decision that you've made today,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
every decision you've made in your life,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
you've not really made that decision,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
but in fact, every single permutation of those decisions

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
is made, each one going off into a new universe.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
That is a wonderful idea.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
If you ever think that your life is rubbish,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
always remember

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
(Laughter)
