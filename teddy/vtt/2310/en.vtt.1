00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
every single week --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
complaints including one we get very often,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000

could never write the works of Shakespeare.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We know this because they did an experiment."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Yes, they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week,
