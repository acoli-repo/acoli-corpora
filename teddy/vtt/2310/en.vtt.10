00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But at no point can I react and go,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
"Ha! Is that the best momentum-to-energy fourth vector constant you've got?"

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
No, I just spit out a tooth.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Laughter)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And that is all of these different things -- the love for my child.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I have a son. His name is Archie.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I'm very lucky,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
because he's better than all the other children.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Now I know you don't think that.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
You may well have your own children

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and think, "Oh no, my child's best."

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
That's the wonderful thing about evolution --

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
the predilection to believe

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that our child is best.
