We can see predictions of galaxies forming,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
of galaxies colliding into each other, of new solar systems.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This is a wonderful thing.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
If the Sun could one day -- and indeed the Earth, in fact --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
if the Earth could read its own astrological, astronomical chart,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
one day it would say,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
"Not a good day for making plans.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You'll been engulfed by a red giant."

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And that to me as well,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that if you think I'm worried about losing worlds,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
well Many Worlds theory --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
one of the most beautiful, fascinating,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
sometimes terrifying ideas
