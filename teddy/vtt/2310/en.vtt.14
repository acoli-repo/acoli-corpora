00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that every single time we stop and I look out that window,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
framed in that window,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
wherever we are,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I am observing more life

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
than there is in the rest of the known universe

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
the most complex thing in the known universe.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
That, to me, is an incredible thing.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And do you know what, that might be enough.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
