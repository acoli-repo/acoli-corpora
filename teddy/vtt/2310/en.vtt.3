00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
All of the magic, I think,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that may well be taken away by science

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is then replaced by something as wonderful.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Astrology, for instance:

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
like many rationalists, I'm a Pisces.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
(Laughter)

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now astrology --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that your life could be predicted;

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that you'll, perhaps today, meet a lucky man

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
who's wearing a hat.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That is gone.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But if we want to look at the sky and see predictions, we still can.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We can see predictions of galaxies forming,
