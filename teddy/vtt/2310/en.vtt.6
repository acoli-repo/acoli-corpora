00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
(Laughter)

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
If you ever think, "Ah, I want to end it all,"

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
don't end it all.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Remember that in the majority of universes,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
you don't even exist in the first place.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
This to me, in its own strange way,

Science actually says

we will live forever.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Well, there is one proviso.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We won't actually live forever. You won't live forever.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Your consciousness, the you-ness of you, the me-ness of me --
