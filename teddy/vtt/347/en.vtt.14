So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
The issue is not that.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
The issue is how are we using what has been given back.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
How are we using it?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Is it being directed effectively?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I want to tell you a little story.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.
