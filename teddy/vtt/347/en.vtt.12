So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
We need to bring it back to say,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
what is the combination of all these factors

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that is going to yield what we want? (Applause)

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And I want to tell you something.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
For me, the issue about aid --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and feel bad about aid.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Africa has been giving the other countries aid.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
