00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
we couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We were going nowhere.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The economies were not growing.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We were having negative per capita growth.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
was not even there.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Creating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
building institutions, stabilizing the micro economy.
