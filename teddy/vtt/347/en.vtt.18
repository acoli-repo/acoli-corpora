00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I got there and I saw huge crowds.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Almost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I had to crawl in between the legs of these people

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
with my sister strapped on my back,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
find a way to a window.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And while they were trying to break down the door,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I climbed in through the window, and jumped in.
