to build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause)

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:39.000
When we ask them and tell them what we need,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Now we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and the EU.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money --

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
some of them in this audience, with private foundations.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And one day, these foundations have so much money,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
they will overtake the official aid that is being given.
