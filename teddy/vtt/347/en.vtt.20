And then they toweled her down because she started sweating,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
which was a good sign.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And then my sister woke up.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I strapped her on my back.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I was so happy -- (Applause) -- that my sister was alive!

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Today she's 41 years old, a mother of three,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and she's a physician saving other lives.
