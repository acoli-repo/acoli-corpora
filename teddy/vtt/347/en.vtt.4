00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Now this is a huge achievement.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because private investment flows have increased.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I want to remind you again --

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I know you saw these statistics before --

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.
