Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And I said, "Mo, you're right. We have -- no, but we've already been doing it!

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
(Applause)

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It is all the resources that were taken from Africa,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
including human, that built these countries today!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.
