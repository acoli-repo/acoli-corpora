00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We really do have it going right

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
After decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and it's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And inflation has come down.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
has come down dramatically.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You know, as you can see,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.
