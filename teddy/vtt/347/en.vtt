00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's very, very difficult

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to speak at the end of a conference like this,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
because everyone has spoken. Everything has been said.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
of some of the things that have gone on here,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and take forward and work on.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's what I'd like to try and do.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We came here saying we want to talk about "Africa: the Next Chapter."
