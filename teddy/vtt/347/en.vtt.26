00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
They used it to build an information superhighway,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
gain infrastructure that

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
enables them to participate in the

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
information technology revolution,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and to create jobs in their economy.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
They didn't say, "No, you know, we're not going to take this."

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Today, the European Union is busy transferring aid.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain --

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
which is roads, highways, other things that they can build --

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
to build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause)

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:39.000
When we ask them and tell them what we need,
