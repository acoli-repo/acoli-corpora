00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
People, children were dying of kwashiorkor.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I'm sure some of you who are not so young

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
will remember those pictures.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Well, I was in the middle of it.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
In the midst of all this, my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We thought she was going to die.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
My father was not there.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
He was in the army.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So I was the oldest person in the house.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
My sister fell very ill with malaria.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
She was three years old and I was 15.
