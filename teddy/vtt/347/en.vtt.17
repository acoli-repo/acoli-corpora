She was three years old and I was 15.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And she had such a high fever. We tried everything.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It didn't look like it was going to work.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
looking at people and giving them meds.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Now I put my sister on my back -- burning --

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
It was really hot. I was very hungry.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.
