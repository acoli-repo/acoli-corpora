00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We came here saying we want to talk about "Africa: the Next Chapter."

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But we are talking about "Africa: the Next Chapter"

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we're looking at,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and saying it's not such a good thing.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and disease

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
is what we usually see.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What we want to look at is "Africa: the Next Chapter,"

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard
