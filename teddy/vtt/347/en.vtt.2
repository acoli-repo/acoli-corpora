00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
through the conference right from the first day,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
where I heard that all the important statistics have been given --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
about where we are now,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
about how the continent is doing much better.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So I'm not going to spend too much time --

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
just to show you, refresh your memories

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that we are here for "Africa: the Next Chapter" because for the first time

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
there really is a platform to build on.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We really do have it going right
