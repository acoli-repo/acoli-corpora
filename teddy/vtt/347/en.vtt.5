00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
In 2005, remittances -- I just took one country, Nigeria

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
skyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
but increasing dramatically.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And in many other countries this is happening.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Why is this important? Because it shows confidence.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
People are now confident to bring --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
if your people in the diaspora bring their money back,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
it shows other people that, look,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
there is emerging confidence in your country.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now, why is all this important, to have to go really fast?
