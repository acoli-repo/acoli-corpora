But I worry because this money is so important.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Now, who are they accountable to?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Are we on their boards when they make decisions

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
about where to channel money? Are we there?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Will we make the same mistake that we made before?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about --

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
have they ever called these people together and said,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
"Look, your foundation and your foundation --

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
you have so much money, we are grateful.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and where this aid should go."

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Have we done that? The answer is no.
