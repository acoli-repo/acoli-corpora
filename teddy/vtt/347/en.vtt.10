And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here:

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
aid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And that's not what the debate should be about.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
That's engaging in the wrong debate.
