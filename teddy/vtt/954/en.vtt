00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:03.452
When I was a child, I always
wanted to be a superhero.

00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:06.912
I wanted to save the world
and make everyone happy.

00:00:06.936 --> 00:00:10.729
But I knew that I'd need superpowers
to make my dreams come true.

00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:12.976
So I used to embark
on these imaginary journeys

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.489
to find intergalactic objects
from planet Krypton,

00:00:16.513 --> 00:00:19.227
which was a lot of fun,
but didn't yield much result.

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:21.800
When I grew up and realized

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:24.976
that science fiction was not
a good source for superpowers,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.322
I decided instead to embark
on a journey of real science,

00:00:28.346 --> 00:00:29.976
to find a more useful truth.
