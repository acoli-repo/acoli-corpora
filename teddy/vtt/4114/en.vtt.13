00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and think of the arc that has happened since then,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to think of the possibilities that we are all

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
privileged to stand in today

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and imagine that this museum

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
that came out of a moment of great protest

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and one that was so much about

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
examining the history and the legacy

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
of important African-American artists

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
to the history of art in this country

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
like Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Romare Bearden.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And then, of course,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
to bring us to today.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
In 1975, Muhammad Ali

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
gave a lecture at Harvard University.
