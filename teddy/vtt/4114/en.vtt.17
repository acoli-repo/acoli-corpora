00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
as artists who came and start their work now,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
looking back at history but start in this moment, historically.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It is really in this sense of discovery

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
This new set of questions is:

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
What does it mean, right now,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to be African-American in America?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
What can artwork say about this?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Where can a museum exist

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
as the place for us all

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
to have this conversation?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Really, most exciting about this
