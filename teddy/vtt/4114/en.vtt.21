00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
about the nurturing of the spirit.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Now, where, perhaps, does this end up right now?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
For me, it is about re-imagining

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
this cultural discourse in an international context.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So the last iteration of this project

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
has been called Flow,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
with the idea now of creating

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
a real network

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
of artists around the world;

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
really looking, not so much

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
from Harlem and out, but looking across,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And as many of us think about that continent
