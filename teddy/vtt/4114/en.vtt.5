00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the ways in which art

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
could provide a space for dialogue --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
complicated dialogue,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
dialogue with many, many points of entry --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and how the museum could be the space

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
for this contest of ideas.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This exhibition included

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
over 20 artists

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
of various ages and races,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but all looking at black masculinity

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
from a very particular point of view.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
What was significant about this exhibition

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
is the way in which
