Think about the place that artists can play in that --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that is the kind of incubation and advocacy

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that I work towards, in working with young, black artists.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Think about artists, not as content providers,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
though they can be brilliant at that,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
but, again, as real catalysts.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s.

And I bring this up because it's important to locate

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
this practice in history.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
To look at 1968,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in the incredible historic moment that it is,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and think of the arc that has happened since then,
