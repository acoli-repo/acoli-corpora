J.J. from "Good Times,"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
(Applause)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
significant to many people of course

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
because of "Dy-no-mite,"

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but perhaps more significant

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
as the first, really, black artist

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
on primetime TV.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Jean-Michel Basquiat,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
important to me because [he was]

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the first black artist in real time

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that showed me the possibility of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
who and what I was about to enter into.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
My overall project is about art --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
specifically, about black artists --
