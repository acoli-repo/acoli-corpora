00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Harlem now, sort of explaining

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and thinking of itself in this part of the century,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
looking both backwards and forwards ...

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I always say Harlem is an interesting community

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
because, unlike many other places,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
it thinks of itself in the past, present

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and the future simultaneously;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
no one speaks of it just in the now.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It's always what it was and what it can be.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And, in thinking about that,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
then my second project, the second question I ask is:

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Can a museum

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
be a catalyst in a community?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Can a museum house artists

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and allow them to be change agents
