00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
wanted to understand

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
how images could work, how images did work,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and how artists provided

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
a space bigger than one

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to work through these images.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Fast-forward and I end up in Harlem;

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
home for many of black America,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
very much the psychic heart

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
of the black experience,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Harlem now, sort of explaining
