00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
My overall project is about art --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
specifically, about black artists --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
very generally

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
about the way in which art

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
can change the way we think

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
about culture and ourselves.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
My interest is in artists

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
who understand and rewrite history,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
who think about themselves

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
within the narrative

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of the larger world of art,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but who have created new places

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
for us to see and understand.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm showing two artists here, 
Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
two of many who really form for me
