00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the "me, we" seems

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
incredibly prescient

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
totally important.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
To this end,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
the specific project that has made this possible for me

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
is a series of exhibitions,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
all titled with an F --

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Freestyle, Frequency and Flow --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
which have set out to discover

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and define

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
the young, black artists working in this moment

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
who I feel strongly

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
will continue to work over the next many years.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
This series of exhibitions

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
was made specifically
