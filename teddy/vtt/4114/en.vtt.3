00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm showing two artists here, 
Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
two of many who really form for me

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the essential questions that I wanted to bring

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
as a curator to the world.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I was interested in the idea

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
of why and how

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I could create a new story,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
a new narrative in art history

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and a new narrative in the world.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And to do this, I knew

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that I had to see the way in which artists work,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
understand the artist's studio

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
as a laboratory,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
imagine, then,
