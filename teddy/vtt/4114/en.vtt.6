00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
What was significant about this exhibition

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
is the way in which

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
it engaged me in my role

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
as a curator, as a catalyst,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
for this dialogue.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
One of the things that happened

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
very distinctly in the course of this exhibition

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is I was confronted with the idea

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
of how powerful images can be

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
in people's understanding 
of themselves and each other.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I'm showing you two works, one on the right by Leon Golub,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
one on the left by Robert Colescott.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And in the course of the exhibition --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
which was contentious, controversial

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and ultimately, for me,
