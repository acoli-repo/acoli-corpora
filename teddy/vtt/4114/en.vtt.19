00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I am continually amazed

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
by the way in which

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
the subject of race

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
can take itself in many places

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
that we don't imagine it should be.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I am always amazed

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
by the way in which artists are willing

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
to do that in their work.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
It is why I look to art.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
It's why I ask questions of art.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
It is why I make exhibitions.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Now, this exhibition, as I said,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
40 young artists done over the course of eight years,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and for me it's about considering the implications.
