00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
when I look at artworks?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
What do I think about

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and to talk and speak to each other.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
