00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
wrote a volume called

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
"People Who Led to My Plays."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And if I were to write a volume,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
it would be called,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
"Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because my work,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in understanding art and in understanding culture,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
has come by following artists,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
by looking at what artists mean

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and what they do and who they are.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
J.J. from "Good Times,"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
