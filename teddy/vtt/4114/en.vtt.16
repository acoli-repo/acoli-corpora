WEBVTT

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
was made specifically

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to try and question

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
the idea of what it would mean

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
now, at this point in history,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
to see art as a catalyst;

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
what it means now, at this point in history,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
as we define and redefine culture,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
black culture specifically in my case,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
but culture generally.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I named this group of artists

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
around an idea, which I put out there

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
called post-black,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
really meant to define them

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
as artists who came and start their work now,
