imagine, then,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
reinventing the museum as a think tank

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and looking at the exhibition

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000

to look and to think about answers.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It sought to express

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the ways in which art
