Women are works of art.

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:06.393
On the outside as on the inside.

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:09.809
I am a neuroscientist,
and I focus on the inside,

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:12.393
especially on women's brains.

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:15.268
There are many theories
on how women's brains differ

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:16.559
from men's brains,

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.684
and I've been looking
at brains for 20 years

00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:21.684
and can guarantee
that there is no such thing

00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:23.768
as a gendered brain.

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:26.101
Pink and blue, Barbie and Lego,

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.809
those are all inventions
that have nothing to do

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:31.083
with the way our brains are built.
