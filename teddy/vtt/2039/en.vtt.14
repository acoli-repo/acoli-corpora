00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m."

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Well, how could it have?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000

at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
a nuclear missile out of a suitcase.

to face any tough questions.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
(Laughter)

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch.
