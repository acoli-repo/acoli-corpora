00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
from the New York Museum of Modern Art.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Its title -- "The Palace at Four in the Morning --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
(Laughter)

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
1932.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Not just the earliest cryptic reference

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to four in the morning I can find.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I believe that this so-called first surrealist sculpture

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
may provide an incredible key to virtually

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
No, feel free to follow along on your Blackberries

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
or your iPhones if you've got them.
