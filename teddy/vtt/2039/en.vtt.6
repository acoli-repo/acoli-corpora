00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Results vary, of course. This is pretty typical.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The top 10 results yield you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
four hits for Faron Young's song, "It's Four in the Morning,"

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
three hits for Judi Dench's film, "Four in the Morning,"

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000

besides this totally excellent Google ranking?
