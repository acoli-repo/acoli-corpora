00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
was in Stockholm, Sweden, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
100 years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Coincidence? No, it's creepy.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
(Laughter)

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
That's like me telling you,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
"Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?"

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
No, not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
but that does not mean there's not something going on

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
at the highest possible levels.
