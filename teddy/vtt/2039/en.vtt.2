00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
A time for plotting to whack the chief of police,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
like in this classic scene from "The Godfather."

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Coppola's script describes these guys as, "exhausted in shirt sleeves.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It is four in the morning."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
(Laughter)

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
A time for even grimmer stuff than that,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"The House of the Spirits."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
After the breathtaking green-haired Rosa is murdered,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
They worked until four o'clock in the morning.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
A time for even grimmer stuff than that,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
like in last April's New Yorker magazine.
