00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Rives: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Let me see if I got this straight, Matt.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
(Laughter)

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
When Homer Simpson needs to imagine

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the most remote possible moment of not just the clock,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
but the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
on the birthday of the Baby Jesus.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And no, I don't know how it works

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
into the whole puzzling scheme of things, but obviously

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I know a coded message when I see one.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
(Laughter)

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I said, I know a coded message when I see one.
