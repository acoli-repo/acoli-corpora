00:05:57.077 --> 00:06:00.664
is to expect and design for crazy.

00:06:01.188 --> 00:06:05.043
Half of handling crazy
is how you prepare for it.

00:06:05.877 --> 00:06:07.321
So if step one we triage,

00:06:07.345 --> 00:06:11.054
step two, we design to make
those tasks easier to do.

00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:14.807
Science shows us
that the more options we have,

00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:16.569
then the longer each decision takes.

00:06:16.593 --> 00:06:20.141
And the more decisions we have to make,
the more exhausted our brain gets

00:06:20.165 --> 00:06:23.077
and the less it is capable
of making good decisions.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.006
Which is why this step two

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.767
is about finding ways to reduce
your daily decisions.

00:06:29.482 --> 00:06:33.395
Here are four easy examples
you can use in your daily lifestyle.
