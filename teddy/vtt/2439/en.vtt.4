00:01:59.427 --> 00:02:01.838
we're not afraid of it.

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:06.474
Because we know that whatever comes in
through those ER double doors,

00:02:06.498 --> 00:02:08.029
that we can handle it.

00:02:08.053 --> 00:02:09.339
That we're ready.

00:02:09.887 --> 00:02:12.011
That's Ready Mode.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.339
We've trained for it,

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:16.531
and you can, too.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:18.386
Here's how.

00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:20.863
Step one to go
from Crazy Mode to Ready Mode

00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:23.506
is to relentlessly triage.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.948
In Crazy Mode, you're always busy,
always stressed,

00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:29.840
because you're reacting to every challenge
with the same response.
