00:04:57.712 --> 00:05:00.256
to, every once in a while,
be able to remind yourself,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.459
"That's a green task.
No one's going to die."

00:05:03.483 --> 00:05:04.594
(Laughter)

00:05:04.618 --> 00:05:07.824
It's OK if it's not perfect.

00:05:10.118 --> 00:05:14.331
Now there's one last triage level
that we use in the worst scenarios.

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:15.555
And that is black.

00:05:16.347 --> 00:05:20.160
Those patients for whom
there is nothing we can do.

00:05:21.165 --> 00:05:22.631
Where we must move on.

00:05:24.188 --> 00:05:26.125
And although it is gut-wrenching,

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:27.299
I mention it,

00:05:27.323 --> 00:05:32.243
because you each have your own equivalent
black tasks in your life.
