00:00:55.943 --> 00:01:00.306
and the brain areas for anger
and anxiety are activated.

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:01.975
Do you feel that?

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.211
Here's the thing.

00:01:05.235 --> 00:01:08.887
You can be as busy
as an emergency department

00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.005
without feeling like you're crazy busy.

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:14.362
How?

00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:16.244
By using the same tactics that we use.

00:01:16.268 --> 00:01:20.425
Our brains all process stress
in similar fundamental ways.

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:22.664
But how we react to it

00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:25.323
has been shown by research
to be modifiable,

00:01:25.347 --> 00:01:29.719
whether it's emergencies
or just daily, day-in, day-out stress.
