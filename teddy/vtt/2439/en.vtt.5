Contrast that with Ready Mode,

00:02:32.974 --> 00:02:34.495
where we triage,

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.151
which means we prioritize
by degree of urgency.

00:02:38.763 --> 00:02:41.508
This isn't just a nice way
to get your to-do list done.

00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:43.492
Work by Dr. Robert Sapolsky

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:47.654
shows that individuals who cannot
differentiate threat from non-threat

00:02:47.678 --> 00:02:50.218
and react to everything
with the same response

00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:52.975
have double the level of stress hormones.

00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:56.313
Which is why this
is the first skill to learn.

00:02:56.337 --> 00:02:58.284
You can't take care of them all at once,

00:02:58.308 --> 00:02:59.680
but you don't have to.

00:02:59.704 --> 00:03:00.926
Because we triage.
