00:10:00.156 --> 00:10:01.982
I focused not on my fear,

00:10:02.006 --> 00:10:05.672
but on the mother and the baby
and what they needed me to do.

00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:09.704
And got the cord off of the baby's neck,

00:10:09.728 --> 00:10:12.228
and a healthy screaming,
kicking baby arrived,

00:10:12.252 --> 00:10:14.561
just as the dad ran in
from the parking lot,

00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:16.478
"Hi, you have a son, I'm Dr. Darria.

00:10:16.502 --> 00:10:18.672
Congratulations,
you want to cut the cord?"

00:10:18.696 --> 00:10:20.077
(Laughter)

00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:21.744
And for a moment,

00:10:21.768 --> 00:10:24.307
the strong cries of a newborn

00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:29.751
drowned out the beeps and the sirens
that are the normal sounds of the ER.
