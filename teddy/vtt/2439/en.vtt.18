There are many tactics that you may hear,

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:06.386
but for me, I find it best in the moment
to actively put my focus on someone else.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.674
To deliberately make myself
see the person in front of me,

00:09:09.698 --> 00:09:11.507
see myself in the arena with them --

00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:13.618
what do they need, what do they fear

00:09:13.642 --> 00:09:16.134
and how can I help?

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:20.372
This may sound like a whole lot
of warm and fuzzy to you,

00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:21.815
but it's not.

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:24.768
In fact, research shows
that when you prime your brain

00:09:24.792 --> 00:09:27.014
with what is, essentially, compassion,

00:09:27.038 --> 00:09:30.419
we disrupt that tunnel vision
and internal monologue.
