00:09:27.038 --> 00:09:30.419
we disrupt that tunnel vision
and internal monologue.

00:09:30.443 --> 00:09:31.776
You widen your perception,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.609
so your brain can actually take in
broader information,

00:09:35.633 --> 00:09:39.986
so you see more possibilities
and can make better decisions.

00:09:41.336 --> 00:09:42.486
Try it.

00:09:43.241 --> 00:09:46.820
Know that your internal
monologue can derail you.

00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:52.535
And realize that when you get out
of your own head,

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:55.518
you get out of your own way.

00:09:57.503 --> 00:09:59.177
Now what happened to that baby?
