Now contrast Crazy Busy Mode

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:36.552
with how I think of us
in the ER -- Ready Mode.

00:01:37.243 --> 00:01:39.980
Ready Mode means whatever comes in
through those doors,

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:41.871
whether it's a multiple-car pileup,

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:45.377
or a patient having chest pain
while stuck in an elevator,

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:49.609
or another patient with an item
stuck where it shouldn't be.

00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:53.076
When you're know you're dying to ask.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.474
(Laughter)

00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:59.403
Even on those days when you would swear
you were being punked,

00:01:59.427 --> 00:02:01.838
we're not afraid of it.
