Here's why you cannot afford
to use "crazy"

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:35.328
to describe your busy.

00:00:35.847 --> 00:00:39.379
Because when we are
in what I refer to as Crazy Busy Mode,

00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:44.137
we are simply less capable
of handling the busy.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.035
Here's what happens.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.336
Your stress hormones rise and stay there,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.069
your executive function
in the prefrontal cortex declines.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:55.919
That means your memory, your judgment,
your impulse control deteriorate,

00:00:55.943 --> 00:01:00.306
and the brain areas for anger
and anxiety are activated.
