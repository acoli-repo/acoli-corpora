00:02:59.704 --> 00:03:00.926
Because we triage.

00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:03.823
Red -- immediately life-threatening.

00:03:03.847 --> 00:03:07.245
Yellow -- serious, but not
immediately life-threatening.

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.031
Green -- minor.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.610
And we focus our efforts
first on the reds.

00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:14.800
Now hear this.

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:17.926
Part of the problem in Crazy Mode

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.547
is that you are reacting to everything

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:22.769
as if it is red.

00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:28.037
So start by triaging correctly.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.194
Know your reds.
