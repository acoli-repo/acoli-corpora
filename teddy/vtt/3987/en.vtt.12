00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:00.473
Let's look at that number more carefully,

00:06:00.497 --> 00:06:01.823
because on the face of it,

00:06:01.847 --> 00:06:05.191
it seems to belie the stories we all hear

00:06:05.215 --> 00:06:09.603
about college grads
working as baristas and cashiers.

00:06:10.545 --> 00:06:15.696
Of 100 people who enroll
in any form of post-secondary education,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.768
45 do not complete it in a timely fashion,

00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:21.858
for a number of reasons,
including financial.

00:06:22.275 --> 00:06:24.188
Of the 55 that do graduate,

00:06:24.212 --> 00:06:26.260
two will remain unemployed,

00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:29.014
and another 18 are underemployed.
