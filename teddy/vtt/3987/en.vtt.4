00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:05.248
Even a college grad
earned 10 percent more in 2001

00:02:05.272 --> 00:02:07.247
than she did in 2013.

00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:09.134
So ...

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.438
tuition costs up,

00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:12.985
public funding down,

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.446
family incomes diminished,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.882
personal incomes weak.

00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:22.646
Is it any wonder that more
than a quarter of those who must

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.677
cannot make their student loan payments?

00:02:26.852 --> 00:02:29.829
The worst of times
can be the best of times,

00:02:29.853 --> 00:02:33.731
because certain truths flash up
in ways that you can't ignore.
