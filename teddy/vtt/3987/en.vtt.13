00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:33.733
So, college grads earn more
than high school grads,

00:06:33.757 --> 00:06:36.750
but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition

00:06:36.774 --> 00:06:39.165
and the lost wages while at college?

00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:42.257
Now even economists admit

00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:47.511
going to college pays off
for only those who complete it.

00:06:48.095 --> 00:06:52.127
But that's only because high school wages
have been cut to the bone,

00:06:52.151 --> 00:06:53.591
for decades now.

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:57.258
For decades,

00:06:57.282 --> 00:06:59.639
workers with a high school degree

00:06:59.663 --> 00:07:03.766
have been denied a fair share
of what they have produced.
