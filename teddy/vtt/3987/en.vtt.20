00:09:57.015 --> 00:10:00.722
Why should two people
buy the same product,

00:10:00.746 --> 00:10:01.921
pay the same,

00:10:01.945 --> 00:10:04.722
but one person receive
half or a third of the service.

00:10:06.448 --> 00:10:10.519
In fact, college grads, some majors,

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:14.163
pay 25 percent of their income
servicing their student debt,

00:10:14.187 --> 00:10:15.860
while others pay five percent.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:22.026
That kind if inequity would end
when majors are priced more correctly.

00:10:23.042 --> 00:10:25.201
Now of course, all this data --

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:27.299
and one of you is going to do this, right?

00:10:27.323 --> 00:10:29.170
All this data has to be well designed,

00:10:29.194 --> 00:10:31.292
maybe audited by public accounting firms
