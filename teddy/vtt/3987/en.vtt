Today 40 million Americans are indebted
for their passage to the new economy.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.143
Too poor to pay their way through college,

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:14.509
they now owe lenders
more than one trillion US dollars.

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.948
They do find what jobs they can get

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:20.457
to pay off a debt
that is secured on their person.

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:23.249
In America,

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:28.804
even a bankrupt gambler
gets a second chance.
