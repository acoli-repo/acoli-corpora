00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:01.965
And colleges and universities

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.289
that invest in these securitized loans

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.321
profit twice.

00:04:07.735 --> 00:04:09.156
Once from your tuition,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.560
and then again from the interest on debt.

00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:15.474
With all that money to be made,

00:04:15.498 --> 00:04:21.085
are we surprised that some
in the higher education business

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.181
have begun to engage in false advertising,

00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:24.362
in bait and switch ...

00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:30.680
in exploiting the very ignorance
that they pretend to educate?
