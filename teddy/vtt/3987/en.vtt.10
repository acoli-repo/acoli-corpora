00:04:58.697 --> 00:05:00.021
we already say that.

00:05:01.408 --> 00:05:02.807
But why stop there?

00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:06.308
People can be upsold
on certifications and recertifications,

00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:08.688
master's degrees, doctoral degrees.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:15.149
Higher education is also marketed
as a status object.

00:05:16.634 --> 00:05:17.785
Buy a degree,

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:20.996
much like you do a Lexus
of a Louis Vuitton bag,

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.814
to distinguish yourself from others.

00:05:22.838 --> 00:05:25.289
So you can be the object
of envy of others.

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.400
Diplomas are a brand.

00:05:29.034 --> 00:05:35.629
But these truths are often times
hidden by a very noisy sales pitch.
