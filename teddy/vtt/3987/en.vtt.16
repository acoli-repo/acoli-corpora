00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:00.948
Then, like any other consumer product,

00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:03.471
you would demand to know
what you're paying for.

00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:04.710
When you buy medicines,

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.649
you get a list of side effects.

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:08.785
When you buy a higher educational product,

00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:10.443
you should have a warning label

00:08:10.467 --> 00:08:12.659
that allows consumers to choose,

00:08:12.683 --> 00:08:14.062
make informed choices.

00:08:14.838 --> 00:08:16.030
When you buy a car,

00:08:16.054 --> 00:08:18.665
it tells you how many
miles per gallon to expect.

00:08:19.188 --> 00:08:20.634
Who knows what to expect

00:08:20.658 --> 00:08:24.372
from a degree say, in Canadian Studies.

00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:26.465
There is such a thing, by the way.

00:08:28.989 --> 00:08:31.044
What if there was an app for that?
