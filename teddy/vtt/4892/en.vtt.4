00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:00.915
Imagine just two robo-ants crawling

00:02:00.915 --> 00:02:02.275
toward each other.

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:04.265
When they collide, they immediately

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:05.465
reverse directions.

00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:07.335
And what would that sequence of events look

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:10.345
like if they crawled past each other instead?

00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:13.445
It would look exactly the same before

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.435
and after their collision, but with

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.705
their positions swapped.

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:20.715
This is true every time a pair of robo-ants meet.

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:23.285
Because the identities of individual ants

00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:25.305
don’t matter, you just need to figure out where

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:27.445
you should put the nozzles to capture

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:30.085
any single ant walking without interruption
