00:00:06.993 --> 00:00:09.708
The good news is that your experimental robo-ants

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.178
are a success!

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.298
The bad news is that you accidentally

00:00:13.298 --> 00:00:16.318
just gave them the ability to shoot deadly lasers

00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:17.808
…and you can’t turn it off.

00:00:17.808 --> 00:00:19.848
You have five minutes to stop them

00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:22.138
before the lasers go online.

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:22.968
Until then,

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:24.798
all of your robo-ants will walk

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:26.998
inside their habitat at a speed of

00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:29.218
exactly 1 meter per minute.

00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:31.808
If they bump into each other or hit a dead end,
