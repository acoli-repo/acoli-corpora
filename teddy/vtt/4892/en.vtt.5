00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:30.085
any single ant walking without interruption

00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:32.465
for less than 5 minutes, starting from

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:34.155
any point in the habitat.

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:37.655
That’s much easier to conceptualize and solve.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:40.285
Placing the nozzles at intersections where

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:43.345
three or four tubes meet seems like your best bet

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:45.845
since that’s where the robo-ants might otherwise

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:48.555
change directions and miss your nozzles.

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:50.955
There are only four intersections…

00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:52.795
which two should you pick?

00:02:52.795 --> 00:02:55.475
The top right intersection has to be one of them.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.845
If it isn’t, an ant crawling down from

00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:00.565
this intersection toward the dead end would
