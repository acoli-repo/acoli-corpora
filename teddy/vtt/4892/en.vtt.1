00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:31.808
If they bump into each other or hit a dead end,

00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:33.418
they’ll instantly turn around

00:00:33.418 --> 00:00:35.398
and walk back the way they came.

00:00:35.398 --> 00:00:36.293
When five minutes are up,

00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:37.778
they’ll turn on their lasers,

00:00:37.778 --> 00:00:38.828
break free,

00:00:38.828 --> 00:00:40.468
and stream out into the world,

00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:42.978
carving a path of destruction as they go.

00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:45.278
Your one chance to stop them is to insert

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:48.888
the two emergency vacuum nozzles into the habitat

00:00:48.888 --> 00:00:52.588
and suck the ants up before they break free.

00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:55.148
The nozzles can press into any one location

00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:57.488
in the habitat through a membrane covering

00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:00.458
its front side, and any ants that walk past
