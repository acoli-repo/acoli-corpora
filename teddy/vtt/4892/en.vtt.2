00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:00.458
its front side, and any ants that walk past

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:03.148
will be sucked up and deactivated.

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:05.398
You can’t move the nozzles once they’re placed

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.938
without leaving a hole that the robo-ants

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:09.768
would pour out of, so choosing the

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.988
right spots will be key.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.788
The habitat is made out of meter-long tubes.

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:17.018
When the robots reach an intersection,

00:01:17.018 --> 00:01:18.978
they will pick randomly whether to go

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.568
left, right, or forward.

00:01:20.568 --> 00:01:23.148
They only go backward if they hit

00:01:23.148 --> 00:01:25.528
hit another robo-ant or a dead end.

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:28.198
Unfortunately, there are hundreds of them

00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:30.898
inside the habitat, and if even one escapes,
