00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:31.305
for at most 4 meters before being sucked

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:32.855
up into the vacuum.

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:35.915
No other choice of two intersection points

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.385
is guaranteed to get all the robo-ants

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.955
within five minutes.

00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:42.565
Having vacuumed them all up, you’ve

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:44.275
averted a major crisis.

00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:47.095
Before you mess with robo-ants again,

00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:49.455
you’ll want to have a robo-anteater ready.

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:50.825
And wouldn’t it be cool if it could

00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:52.745
fly and breathe fire?

00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:55.065
There’s no way that could go wrong!
