00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:00.565
this intersection toward the dead end would

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:02.755
crawl for four minutes to get back to the

00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:05.275
intersection, and then go in any of three

00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:08.345
directions, walking for at least another minute.

00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:10.465
Once you’ve placed a nozzle in the top right,

00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:12.615
the only other choice that has a chance

00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:14.545
to work is the bottom left.

00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:17.245
To see that this works, imagine an ant

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:19.155
anywhere else in the habitat.

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:22.015
Worst case scenario, the ant would start

00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:25.225
right next to the vacuum nozzle, marching away from it.

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:28.385
But in all those worst cases, the ant would march

00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:31.305
for at most 4 meters before being sucked
