00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:30.898
inside the habitat, and if even one escapes,

00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:33.088
it’ll do a lot of damage.

00:01:33.088 --> 00:01:35.228
With just less than five minutes remaining,

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:38.138
where should you place the 2 vacuum nozzles

00:01:38.138 --> 00:01:40.306
to suck up all the robo-ants?

00:01:40.306 --> 00:01:43.840
Pause the video now if
you want to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.410
Answer in: 3

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.701
Answer in: 2

00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:48.275
Answer in: 1

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.365
With robo-ants ricocheting all over the habitat,

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:53.145
it might seem impossible to stop them

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:54.645
before they break free.

00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:57.505
But this situation is simpler than it seems.

00:01:57.505 --> 00:01:58.695
Here's why.

00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:00.915
Imagine just two robo-ants crawling
