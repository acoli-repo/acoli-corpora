00:00:01.663 --> 00:00:02.912
So picture this.

00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:07.121
Your friend calls to invite you
to a party this Saturday.

00:00:07.163 --> 00:00:12.496
They say, "Yes, I totally understand
that Saturday is Halloween,

00:00:12.538 --> 00:00:15.913
but trust me, it's not a Halloween party.

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:19.704
October 31 just happens to be the best day
when everyone is in town.

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:21.246
No, no, no, no.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:22.954
You don't have to wear a costume.

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:24.871
It's not going to be like that at all.

00:00:24.913 --> 00:00:26.204
Just come as you are."

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:30.704
A party with your friends on Halloween,
