00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Have you ever wondered

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
what is inside your dental plaque?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Probably not, but people like me do.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm an archeological geneticist

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
at the Center for Evolutionary Medicine

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
at the University of Zurich,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
by conducting genetic research

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And through this work, I hope to better understand

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so that we can improve

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and better manage our health in the future.
