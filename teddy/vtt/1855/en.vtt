00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:03.470
Two years ago, I was invited as an artist

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.330
to participate in an exhibition commemorating

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.988
100 years of Islamic art in Europe.

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:11.428
The curator had only one condition:

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:14.918
I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork.

00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:18.029
Now, as an artist, a woman, an Arab,

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.671
or a human being living in the world in 2010,

00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:24.636
I only had one thing to say:

00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:27.446
I wanted to say no.

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:29.662
And in Arabic, to say "no," we say "no,

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.982
and a thousand times no."
