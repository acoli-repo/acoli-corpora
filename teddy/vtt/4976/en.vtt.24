there's no one better to learn from

00:12:00.466 --> 00:12:04.052
than the forgetful guy who became
the American memory champ in a year.

00:12:04.744 --> 00:12:06.887
Say you want to remember someone's name.

00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:08.442
What should you do?

00:12:08.466 --> 00:12:11.815
JF: Come up with some sort
of an association

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:15.093
between the sound of a person's name

00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:17.998
and some aspect of their physical being.

00:12:18.022 --> 00:12:20.045
So what you're doing
when you meet somebody

00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:22.071
is you're looking at them
and saying, like,

00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:24.905
"What's distinct about this person's
physical presence?

00:12:24.929 --> 00:12:28.193
Something about their hair,
something about their eyebrows,

00:12:28.217 --> 00:12:29.514
something about their ears.

00:12:29.538 --> 00:12:32.736
The truth is, you're looking for
""What is weird abut this person?"
