(Clip) Man: When you find a way
to come on the road,

00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:33.907
finish up your road record 7-1,
and win a division,

00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:35.625
there's only one thing you can say:

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.823
(Multiple voices) Woo!

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:43.244
AG: The following season,
the Rams win 13 out of 16 games,

00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:45.450
tying for the best record in football.

00:00:45.474 --> 00:00:47.688
They make it all the way
to the Super Bowl.

00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:49.141
Their secret weapon?

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:51.981
The Rams had hired
a new head coach, Sean McVay.

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:54.149
He was just 30 years old,

00:00:54.173 --> 00:00:57.395
the youngest NFL coach since 1938.

00:00:58.292 --> 00:00:59.648
His secret weapon?

00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:00.860
His memory.
