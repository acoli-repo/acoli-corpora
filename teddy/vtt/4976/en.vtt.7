Even in the era of cavemen,

00:03:31.337 --> 00:03:33.237
your life depended on that friend

00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:36.027
who remembered
which mushroom was poisonous,

00:03:36.051 --> 00:03:38.281
or where to find water in a drought.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.299
As civilizations developed,

00:03:40.323 --> 00:03:43.022
you needed to remember
which merchants were trustworthy

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:44.979
and which guild were hostile.

a mark of a well-read person

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:51.132
was the ability to quote at length
from many sources.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.649
Now, you're probably in the habit
of outsourcing your memory

00:03:54.673 --> 00:03:56.139
to electronic devices.

00:03:56.966 --> 00:04:01.133
But the ability to retain and recall
information in your head is still crucial.
