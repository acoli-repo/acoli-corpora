AG: A memory palace.

00:08:01.752 --> 00:08:05.275
Because abstract words,
numbers and ideas get stickier

00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:08.679
when you connect them to a concrete image
and a familiar place.

00:08:09.386 --> 00:08:11.807
So, pick a place that you know well,

00:08:11.831 --> 00:08:14.307
and mentally attach things
you want to remember

00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:17.267
to vivid images
inside the different rooms.

00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:23.966
JF: You create a wild, crazy, funny,
colorful, bizarre, grotesque image

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.164
in your mind's eye

00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:30.141
of each word in a list of random words
that you're trying to memorize.
