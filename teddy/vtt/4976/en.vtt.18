00:08:59.257 --> 00:09:03.345
And what you find is that you can,
like, almost immediately,

00:09:03.369 --> 00:09:05.012
after learning this trick,

00:09:05.036 --> 00:09:08.158
you can memorize really long
strings of information.

00:09:08.552 --> 00:09:12.256
You know, memorizing
100 random words in perfect order

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.819
is almost trivial,
once you know this trick.

00:09:14.843 --> 00:09:16.391
(Music)

00:09:16.415 --> 00:09:18.548
AG: The key is a sense of place.

00:09:18.922 --> 00:09:21.204
Place really matters in memory.

00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:22.585
In a classic experiment,

00:09:22.609 --> 00:09:25.037
psychologists recruited
a bunch of scuba divers

00:09:25.061 --> 00:09:27.133
to learn a few dozen new words.

00:09:27.157 --> 00:09:31.108
The divers learned some words on dry land,
and others under water.
