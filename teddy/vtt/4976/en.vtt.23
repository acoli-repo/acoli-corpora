00:11:29.195 --> 00:11:32.363
especially during this year
when I was training my memory,

00:11:32.387 --> 00:11:35.459
where I was basically
a collector of architecture,

00:11:35.483 --> 00:11:41.125
so that I would have this whole
city of memory palaces available to me

00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:42.415
in the competition.

00:11:43.082 --> 00:11:44.237
AG: Nice.

00:11:44.261 --> 00:11:46.000
And so in a year of practicing that,

00:11:46.024 --> 00:11:48.587
you went from a journalist
with a bad memory, to what?

00:11:48.923 --> 00:11:50.082
JF: Well ...

00:11:50.106 --> 00:11:51.542
So, the punchline of the story

00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:54.105
is I became United States memory champion.

00:11:54.129 --> 00:11:56.155

00:11:56.179 --> 00:11:58.712
AG: So, if you're interested
in improving your memory,

00:11:58.736 --> 00:12:00.442
there's no one better to learn from
