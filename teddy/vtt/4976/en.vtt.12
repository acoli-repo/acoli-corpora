And they could repeat the sequence
of a whole deck of shuffled playing cards

00:06:02.665 --> 00:06:05.291
after looking at it for only five minutes.

00:06:05.974 --> 00:06:07.839
How does a person do that?

00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:13.831
JF: I figured these are going to be
like, a bunch of freakish savants,

00:06:13.855 --> 00:06:15.426
"Rain Man," basically,

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.172
who have these incredible memories.

00:06:17.196 --> 00:06:21.267
And what I discover
is something totally different.

00:06:21.784 --> 00:06:25.561
They are just like normal people
with normal memories,

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:29.078
and that they've trained themselves,
using a set of ancient techniques,

00:06:29.102 --> 00:06:32.101
to become these memory champions.
