00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.636
they are just, like ... sticky.

00:10:32.015 --> 00:10:35.061
They become attached
to all of these other memories

00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:36.696
that I have about that house.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.918
And so what I do,

00:10:37.942 --> 00:10:40.490
if I'm, let's say, memorizing
a shopping list,

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:44.751
and I have to remember that the first item
on the list is milk, say,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.816
I walk in that house
and I would picture myself

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.601
pouring a gallon of milk,
maybe over my mother's head

00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:54.887
in that entryway of the house.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.402
And I'd picture the dairy
dripping down her head,

00:10:58.426 --> 00:10:59.963
and what that would smell like,

00:10:59.987 --> 00:11:03.465
and how she would be
really annoyed about it.
