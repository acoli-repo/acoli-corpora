00:05:27.123 --> 00:05:30.337
I think maybe I've forgotten
some of the things that I've forgotten.

00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:33.529
AG: Back in 2005, Josh got
an odd reporting assignment.

00:05:33.553 --> 00:05:38.826
JF: "Slate Magazine" sends me to go cover
this wacky-sounding contest,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.949
called the United States
Memory Championship.

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:43.106
AG: The USA Memory Championship.

00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:46.387
What Josh observed
were these competitive memorizers

00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:48.344
who had remarkable abilities.

00:05:49.046 --> 00:05:51.371
They could see photos of 100 strangers

00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:54.180
and remember all their names
20 minutes later.

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.156
They could commit hundreds
of random numbers to memory

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.447
in just 15 minutes.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.641
And they could repeat the sequence
of a whole deck of shuffled playing cards
