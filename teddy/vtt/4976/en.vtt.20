If you put something
in a particular place in your mind,

00:10:00.385 --> 00:10:03.678
you can revisit that place
mentally at any time.

00:10:04.506 --> 00:10:07.958
Josh's go-to memory palace
is the home where he grew up in DC.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.716
JF: I can walk in the door,

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.014
I can see the black paint on the door,

00:10:12.038 --> 00:10:14.775
and the brass mail slot,

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:19.480
and I open it and there's this
walnut credenza

00:10:19.504 --> 00:10:22.871
and floor made out of stone.

00:10:23.204 --> 00:10:28.236
So when I create these
visual images in that home,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.636
they are just, like ... sticky.
