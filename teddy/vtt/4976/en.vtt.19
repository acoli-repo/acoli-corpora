00:09:27.157 --> 00:09:31.108
The divers learned some words on dry land,
and others under water.

00:09:32.228 --> 00:09:34.921
Twenty-four hours later,
they were tested for recall.

00:09:35.634 --> 00:09:37.833
If divers had learned words underwater,

00:09:37.857 --> 00:09:40.817
they had a much harder time
recalling them on dry land,

00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:41.991
and vice versa.

00:09:42.412 --> 00:09:45.664
They were able to remember
30 to 60 percent more of the words

00:09:45.688 --> 00:09:49.053
when they were in the setting
where they had originally learned them.

00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:51.633
So being back in the place
where you learned something

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:54.011
is where you find cues
to help you retrieve it.

00:09:54.401 --> 00:09:57.377
And you can simulate that effect
with the memory palace.

00:09:57.401 --> 00:10:00.361
If you put something
in a particular place in your mind,
