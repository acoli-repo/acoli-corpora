00:13:58.307 --> 00:14:01.045
where I can give myself
a big pat on the back.

00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:03.212
You know, the truth is,

00:14:03.236 --> 00:14:05.268
when you remember
something about somebody,

00:14:05.292 --> 00:14:07.529

to them that you care.

00:14:07.553 --> 00:14:09.704
AG: Think about your favorite teachers.

00:14:09.728 --> 00:14:12.427
They're usually the ones
who remember not only your name,

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:14.752

00:14:17.831 --> 00:14:19.768
They could answer seemingly any question

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:23.643
by reciting a compelling idea, quote
or data point from memory.

00:14:24.847 --> 00:14:27.085
JF: One of the things
that is true about memory

00:14:27.109 --> 00:14:28.458
is we develop great memories

00:14:28.482 --> 00:14:34.645
for domains in which
we have a rich knowledge base.
