00:06:59.714 --> 00:07:02.650
And so this little moment

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.486
had a really profound impact on me

00:07:05.486 --> 00:07:06.795
and our family

00:07:06.795 --> 00:07:09.936
because it helped us change our frame of reference

00:07:09.936 --> 00:07:12.144
for what was going on with him,

00:07:12.144 --> 00:07:15.120
and worry a little bit less and appreciate

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.302
his resourcefulness more.

00:07:17.302 --> 00:07:20.163
Facts are stupid things.

00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:22.560
And they're vulnerable to misuse,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.213
willful or otherwise.

00:07:24.213 --> 00:07:27.239
I have a friend, Emily Willingham, who's a scientist,

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:30.040
and she wrote a piece for Forbes not long ago
