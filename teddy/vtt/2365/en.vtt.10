My son Isaac, when he was two,

00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:04.411
was diagnosed with autism,

00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:06.572
and he was this happy, hilarious,

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.607
loving, affectionate little guy,

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:11.509
but the metrics on his developmental evaluations,

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.579
which looked at things like 
the number of words —

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:17.236
at that point, none —

00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:21.176
communicative gestures and minimal eye contact,

00:05:21.176 --> 00:05:23.179
put his developmental level

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:27.140
at that of a nine-month-old baby.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.100
And the diagnosis was factually correct,
