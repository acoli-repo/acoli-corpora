and consumer opt-in,

00:10:32.839 --> 00:10:35.832
and beyond that, we need to be clear

00:10:35.832 --> 00:10:37.935
about our hypotheses,

00:10:37.935 --> 00:10:40.531
the methodologies that we use,

00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:43.335
and our confidence in the result.

00:10:43.335 --> 00:10:45.809
As my high school algebra teacher used to say,

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:47.340
show your math,

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.781

00:10:50.781 --> 00:10:52.772
I don't know what steps you didn't take,

00:10:52.772 --> 00:10:55.210
and if I don't know what questions you asked,

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.407
I don't know what questions you didn't ask.

00:10:58.407 --> 00:10:59.930
And it means asking ourselves, really,

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.409
the hardest question of all:
