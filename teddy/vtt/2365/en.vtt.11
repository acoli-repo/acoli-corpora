00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.100
And the diagnosis was factually correct,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.309
but it didn't tell the whole story.

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:34.710
And about a year and a half later,

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.812
when he was almost four,

00:05:36.812 --> 00:05:39.175
I found him in front of the computer one day

00:05:39.175 --> 00:05:44.628
running a Google image search on women,

00:05:44.628 --> 00:05:48.244
spelled "w-i-m-e-n."

00:05:48.244 --> 00:05:50.984
And I did what any obsessed parent would do,

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:52.885
which is immediately started 
hitting the "back" button

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:56.248
to see what else he'd been searching for.

00:05:56.248 --> 00:05:58.419
And they were, in order: men,

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:05.686
school, bus and computer.
