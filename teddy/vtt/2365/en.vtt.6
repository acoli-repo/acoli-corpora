00:02:57.976 --> 00:03:01.200
And what it reminds us is that

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.611
language is created by people,

00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:05.951
and people are messy and we're complex

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.718
and we use metaphors and slang and jargon

00:03:08.718 --> 00:03:11.997
and we do this 24/7 in many, many languages,

00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:15.221
and then as soon as we figure it out, we change it up.

00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:20.339
So did these ads that the CDC put on,

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:22.769
these television ads that featured a woman

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.790
with a hole in her throat and that were very graphic

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.694
and very disturbing,

00:03:26.694 --> 00:03:28.579
did they actually have an impact

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.250
on whether people quit?
