00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:03.430
and we have the potential to make bad decisions

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.264
far more quickly, efficiently,

00:09:05.264 --> 00:09:10.292
and with far greater impact than we did in the past.

00:09:10.292 --> 00:09:11.680
Great, right?

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.710
And so what we need to do instead

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.040
is spend a little bit more time

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.786
on things like the humanities

because they give us context that is so important

00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:30.990
for big data, and because
