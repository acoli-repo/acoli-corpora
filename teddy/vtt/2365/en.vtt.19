00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:30.990
for big data, and because

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.408
they help us become better critical thinkers.

00:09:33.408 --> 00:09:37.615
Because after all, if I can spot

00:09:37.615 --> 00:09:40.101
a problem in an argument, it doesn't much matter

00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:42.860
whether it's expressed in words or in numbers.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.579
And this means

00:09:45.579 --> 00:09:50.000
teaching ourselves to find 
those confirmation biases

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.822
and false correlations

00:09:51.822 --> 00:09:53.960
and being able to spot a naked emotional appeal

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.622
from 30 yards,

00:09:55.622 --> 00:09:58.144
because something that happens after something

00:09:58.144 --> 00:10:01.226
doesn't mean it happened 
because of it, necessarily,
