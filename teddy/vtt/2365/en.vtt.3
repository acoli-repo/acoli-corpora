00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.316
and the challenges of interpreting it,

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:32.404
size isn't everything.

00:01:32.404 --> 00:01:35.307
There's also the speed at which it moves,

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:37.003
and the many varieties of data types,

00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:39.501
and here are just a few examples:

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:41.699
images,

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:45.706
text,

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.801
video,

00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:49.631
audio.

00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:52.673
And what unites this disparate types of data

00:01:52.673 --> 00:01:54.894
is that they're created by people

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:57.669
and they require context.

00:01:57.669 --> 00:02:00.114
Now, there's a group of data scientists
