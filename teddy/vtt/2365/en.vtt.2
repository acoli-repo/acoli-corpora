00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:01.970
We are not passive consumers
of data and technology.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.373
We shape the role it plays in our lives

00:01:04.373 --> 00:01:06.503
and the way we make meaning from it,

00:01:06.503 --> 00:01:08.106
but to do that,

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.649

00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:26.140
about how much data there is in the world,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.720
but when it comes to big data

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.316
and the challenges of interpreting it,
