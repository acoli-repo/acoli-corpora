He said, Orwell feared we would become

00:00:32.752 --> 00:00:35.000

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.752
Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture.

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:40.897
Orwell feared the truth would be

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:42.820
concealed from us,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.010
and Huxley feared we would be drowned

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.703
in a sea of irrelevance.

00:00:47.703 --> 00:00:49.873
In a nutshell, it's a choice between

00:00:49.873 --> 00:00:52.473
Big Brother watching you

00:00:52.473 --> 00:00:54.969
and you watching Big Brother.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.900
(Laughter)

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.634
But it doesn't have to be this way.

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:01.970
We are not passive consumers
of data and technology.
