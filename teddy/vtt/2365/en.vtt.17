00:08:28.928 --> 00:08:31.212
to try to make meaning out of it ourselves,

00:08:31.212 --> 00:08:36.564
because frankly, data doesn't 
create meaning. We do.

00:08:36.564 --> 00:08:39.820
So as businesspeople, as consumers,

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.359
as patients, as citizens,

00:08:42.359 --> 00:08:44.755
we have a responsibility, I think,

00:08:44.755 --> 00:08:46.949
to spend more time

00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:49.819
focusing on our critical thinking skills.

00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:50.897
Why?

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:54.075
Because at this point in our history, as we've heard

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.781
many times over,

00:08:55.781 --> 00:08:57.762
we can process exabytes of data

00:08:57.762 --> 00:08:59.915
at lightning speed,

00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:03.430
and we have the potential to make bad decisions
