00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:00.237
is that it's a fantastic example of courage

00:04:00.237 --> 00:04:04.680
in the face of a sea of irrelevance.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.985
And so it's not just big data that causes

00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:10.586
challenges of interpretation, because let's face it,

00:04:10.586 --> 00:04:13.180
we human beings have a very rich history

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.873
of taking any amount of data, no matter how small,

00:04:15.873 --> 00:04:17.490
and screwing it up.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.227
So many years ago, you may remember

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:23.500
that former President Ronald Reagan

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.491
was very criticized for making a statement

00:04:25.491 --> 00:04:28.501
that facts are stupid things.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:31.295
And it was a slip of the tongue, let's be fair.
