00:09:58.144 --> 00:10:01.226
doesn't mean it happened 
because of it, necessarily,

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.345
and if you'll let me geek out on you for a second,

00:10:03.345 --> 00:10:07.642
the Romans called this 
"post hoc ergo propter hoc,"

00:10:07.642 --> 00:10:10.938
after which therefore because of which.

00:10:10.938 --> 00:10:14.695
And it means questioning
disciplines like demographics.

00:10:14.695 --> 00:10:17.215
Why? Because they're based on assumptions

00:10:17.215 --> 00:10:19.521
about who we all are based on our gender

00:10:19.521 --> 00:10:20.983
and our age and where we live

00:10:20.983 --> 00:10:24.461
as opposed to data on what 
we actually think and do.

00:10:24.461 --> 00:10:26.124
And since we have this data,

00:10:26.124 --> 00:10:29.263
we need to treat it with appropriate privacy controls

00:10:29.263 --> 00:10:32.839
and consumer opt-in,
