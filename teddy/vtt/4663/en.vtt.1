00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.096
and suddenly, we have ourselves
a real cephalopod fight.

We know that almost all animals fight --
for food, for territory, for mates.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.376
The octopus is no different,
and knowing their fighting behavior

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.176
could help us better understand
these fascinating creatures

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.416
and how they interact.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.416
My friend Ilya has been observing
the classic fighting behavior

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.456
between California two-spot octopuses.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.936
Ilya Chugunov: Most people
think that it's "octopi,"

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.416
but that's actually incorrect.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.136
The correct plurals
are either "octopuses" or "octopodes"

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.016
if you want to be very Greek about it.
