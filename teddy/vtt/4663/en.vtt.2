00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.016
if you want to be very Greek about it.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.856
GG: So how do you do your experiment?

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.656
IC: First, I like to set up
the chamber just so it's ready,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.336
so I get a jug of water,
I aerate it by shaking the jug.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.656
It seems that if the water is
well-aerated, they're a lot more active.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.856
This gives the octopuses
some room to breathe.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.136
I get the first octopus --

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.576
Here, buddy. Here, pal.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.136
Put it in, set up my GoPro,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.250
put the second octopus in,
cover it up and leave it alone.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.050
(Bell ringing)

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.810
Rule 1: There's always
an aggressor.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.416
There's always one octopus
on defense, one on offense.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.776
Usually the one that's taking up
more space, that's more boastful,
