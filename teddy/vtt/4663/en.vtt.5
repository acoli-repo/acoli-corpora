00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.136
The aggressor in a fight will quickly
and sharply flash bright black on his arms

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.480
when he's about to initiate a fight.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.776
(Bell ringing)

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.056
GG: Ooh, and already --

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.680
IC: We're seeing some action.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.496
Looks like they've spotted each other.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.536
GG: Right. So now he's going to come --
He's approaching, but not directly at him.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.400
IC: Yeah, they're like
almost completely antiparallel.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.456
GG: And then right there --

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.416
IC: Yeah. They contact,
and then their arms clash together.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.338
