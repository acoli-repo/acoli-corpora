Greg Gage: The octopus is
a rather strange-looking animal

00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:05.216
that exhibits amazingly complex behaviors.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.336
They have the most impressive nervous
system in the entire invertebrate world.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.296
They have about a half a billion neurons

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.336
that are distributed
throughout their body,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.656
such that two-thirds of the neurons
are actually in its legs.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.016
Now mix this in with camouflaging cells,
jet propulsion and a razor-sharp beak,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.600
and you have all the makings
of a formidable predator.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.656
And then throw in the fact
that the octopus is a solitary creature,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.096
and suddenly, we have ourselves
a real cephalopod fight.
