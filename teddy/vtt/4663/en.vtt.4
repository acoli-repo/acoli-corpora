00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.600
Rule 2: Avoid eye contact.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.416
When the octopuses come
towards each other to begin the fight,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.536
they don't actually face each other.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.295
They approach sideways.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.896
The defensive octopus
tries to face away from the attacker

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.696
until it's the critical moment
it knows there's no way to avoid a fight.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.176
GG: Really, the one who's waiting
to the last moment

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.440
is the defensive octopus.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.480
(Bell ringing)

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.530
Rule 3: Flash your colors.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.136
The aggressor in a fight will quickly
and sharply flash bright black on his arms
