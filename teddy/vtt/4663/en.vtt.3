00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.776
Usually the one that's taking up
more space, that's more boastful,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.976
definitely the aggressor,
most likely the winner of the fight.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.416
The loser's pretty obvious.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.616
They get pushed around,
they curl up, hide in a corner.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.936
A lot of the time,
when there's initial contact,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.976
if one of them is too much
on the defensive side,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.736
the second one will sort of poke at it,
grab at its tentacle and see,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.496
"Hey, do you want to fight me,
do you want to turn around?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.456
Do you want to start a wrestling match?"

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.240
So it'll just poke and run away.
Come back, poke and run away.

00:01:57.818 --> 00:01:58.550
(Bell ringing)

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.600
Rule 2: Avoid eye contact.
