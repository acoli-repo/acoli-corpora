00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.040
and boosted ecotourism,
which today is a key engine of growth.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.936
So investing in environmental protection

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.176
did not hurt our economy.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.456
Quite the opposite.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.496
And it doesn't mean we are perfect,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.856
and it doesn't mean
we don't have contradictions.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.120
That's not the point.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.216
The point is that,
by making our own choices,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.200
we were able to develop resilience
in dealing with development problems.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.656
Also, if you take a country like ours,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.576
the GDP per capita
is around 11,000 dollars,
