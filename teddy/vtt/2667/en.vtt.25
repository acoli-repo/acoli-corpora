WEBVTT

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.640
That is why, in 2014,
we created Costa Rica Limpia.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.416
"Limpia" means "clean,"

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.080
because we want to empower
and we want to inspire citizens.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.680
If citizens don't get engaged,

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.736
clean transportation decisions
will be bogged down by endless,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.736
and I mean endless, technical discussions,

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.040
and by avalanches of lobbying
by various established interests.
