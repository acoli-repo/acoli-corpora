played a decisive role in the negotiations
of the Paris climate agreement.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.320
So we have to protect that legacy
and be an example.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.200
So what comes next?

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.520
The people.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.840
How do we get people to own this?

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.856
How do we get people

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.296
to believe that it's possible

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.960
to build a society without fossil fuels?

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.360
A lot of work from
the ground up is needed.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.640
That is why, in 2014,
we created Costa Rica Limpia.
