00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.376
These people disagree on almost everything

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.056
except on renewable energy

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.176
and clean transportation and clean air.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.176
It brings people together.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.056
And the key to real participation

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.296
is to help people not to feel small.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.616
People feel powerless,

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.960
and they are tired of not being heard.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.376
So what we do is concrete things,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.896
and we translate technical issues
into citizen language

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.640
to show that citizens have a role to play
and can play it together.
