00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.616
for 299 days,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.856
we did not use any fossil fuels

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.360
in order to generate all our electricity?

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.200
It's a fantastic achievement,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.440
and yet, it hides a paradox,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.136
which is that nearly 70 percent

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.760
of all our energy consumption is oil.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.080
