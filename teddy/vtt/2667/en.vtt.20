00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.320
so this is the best moment
to redefine our urban and mobility future.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.336
We don't want cities
that are built for cars.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.696
We want cities for people

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.576
where we can walk and we can use bikes.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.736
And we want public transportation,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.256
lots of it,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.320
public transportation
that is clean and dignifying.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.120
Because if we continue
adding fleets of conventional cars,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.960
our cities will become unbearable.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.736
Second, we have to change,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.240
but incremental change
is not going to be sufficient.
