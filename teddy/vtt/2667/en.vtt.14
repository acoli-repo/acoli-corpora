heat from volcanoes,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.416
wind turbines, solar panels,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.640
biowaste.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.856
Abolishing fossil fuels means
disrupting our transportation system

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.216
so that we can power our cars,
buses and trains with electricity

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.720
instead of dirty energy.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.816
And transportation, let me tell you,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.896

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.336
because the model we have
is not working for us.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.600
It's hurting people,
