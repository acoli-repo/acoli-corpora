00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.576
we made that decision permanent
in the new constitution,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.760
and that is why I can tell you that story
nearly 70 years later.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.536
And I'm grateful.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.520
I'm grateful they made that decision
before I was born,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.536
because it allowed me
and millions of others

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.720
to live in a very stable country.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.136
And you might be thinking
that it was good luck,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.656
but it wasn't.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.720
There was a pattern of deliberate choices.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.136
In the '40s, Costa Ricans were given
free education and free health care.
