We can do it differently.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.456
And it's time, it really is time,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.176
to debunk the myth

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.256
that a country has to choose
between development on the one hand

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.680
and environmental protection,
renewables, quality of life, on the other.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.080
I come from Costa Rica,
a developing country.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.880
We are nearly five million people,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.776
and we live right in the middle
of the Americas,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.120
so it's very easy
to remember where we live.
