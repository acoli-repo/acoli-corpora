00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.696
So the question is,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.800
what is the next big idea
for this generation?

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.696
And I believe what comes next

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.880
is for this generation
to let go of fossil fuels for good,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.280
just as we did with the army.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.696
Fossil fuels create climate change.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.096
We know that,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.616
and we know how vulnerable we are
to the impacts of climate change.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.296
So as a developing country,
it is in our best interest
