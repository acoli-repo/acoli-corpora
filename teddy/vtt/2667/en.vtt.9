of using fossil fuels
for electricity generation,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.120
which is what the world
is struggling with today.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.696
In the '70s we invested in national parks,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.680
and that kept us away

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.296
from the deeply flawed logic
of growth, growth, growth at any cost

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.000
that you see others embracing,
especially in the developing world.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.896
In the '90s, we pioneered payments
for ecosystem services,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.856
and that helped us reverse deforestation

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.040
and boosted ecotourism,
which today is a key engine of growth.
