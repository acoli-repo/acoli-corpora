00:00:01.103 --> 00:00:04.228
How do we build a society

00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:05.760
without fossil fuels?

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:09.120
This is a very complex challenge,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.400
and I believe developing countries
could take the lead in this transition.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.680
And I'm aware that this
is a contentious statement,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.736
but the reality is that so much
is at stake in our countries

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.640
if we let fossil fuels stay
at the center of our development.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.080
We can do it differently.
