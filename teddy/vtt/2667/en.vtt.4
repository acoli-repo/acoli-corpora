00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.080
Why?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.536
Because of our transportation system,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.816
which is totally dependent
on fossil fuels,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.479
like it is in most countries.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.016
So if we think of the energy
transition as a marathon,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.936
the question is, how do we get
to the finish line,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.080
how do we decarbonize
the rest of the economy?

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.776
And it's fair to say
that if we don't succeed,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.576
it's difficult to see who will.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.160
So that is why I want
to talk to you about Costa Rica,
