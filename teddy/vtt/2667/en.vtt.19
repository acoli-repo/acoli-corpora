00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.016
That in 1948, we didn't say
the world is stuck with armies,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.976
so let's keep our army, too.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.960
No, we made a very brave choice,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.840
and that choice made the whole difference.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.976
So it's time for this generation
to be brave again

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.776
and abolish fossil fuels for good.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.400
And I'll give you three reasons
why we have to do this.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.440
First,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.856
our model of transportation
and urbanization is broken,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.320
so this is the best moment
to redefine our urban and mobility future.
