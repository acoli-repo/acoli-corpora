So as a developing country,
it is in our best interest

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.296
to build development without fossil fuels

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.960
that harm people in the first place.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.120
Because

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.840
why would we continue importing oil

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.536
for transportation

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.720
if we can use electricity instead?

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.536
Remember,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.456
this is the country

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.536
where electricity
comes from water in our rivers,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.056
heat from volcanoes,
