00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.736
and different mobility,

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.775
we're not talking about
some distant utopia out there.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:39.559
We're talking about electric mobility
that is happening today.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:46.496
By 2022, electric cars
and conventional cars

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.600
are expected to cost the same,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.880
and cities are already trying
electric buses.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.840
And these really cool creatures

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.960
are saving money,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.760
and they reduce pollution.
