00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.576
the GDP per capita
is around 11,000 dollars,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.320
depending on how you measure it.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.136

the narrative of a small country
with big ideas,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.000
and it was very empowering
to grow up with that narrative.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.696
So the question is,
