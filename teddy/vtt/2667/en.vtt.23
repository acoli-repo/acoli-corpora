So I believe Costa Rica
can be an inspiration to others,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.456
as we did last year when we disclosed

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.456
that for so many days
we were not using any fossil fuels

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.336
in order to generate all our electricity.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.720
The news went viral around the world.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.736
Also, and this makes me extremely proud,

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.600
a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:01.280
played a decisive role in the negotiations
of the Paris climate agreement.
