00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:31.911
the first thing they do
is look under the hood.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:35.021
But with mental health research,

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:38.069
you can't just pop open the hood
with the press of a button.

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:41.624
So this is why we do
experiments on animals.

00:01:41.648 --> 00:01:44.482
Specifically, in my lab, mice.

00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:49.328
To understand the brain, well,
we need to study brains.

00:01:49.752 --> 00:01:52.562
And for the first time, we actually can.

00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:54.205
We can pop open the hood.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.681
We can look inside

00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:58.494
and do an experiment
and see what comes out.
