If we clone this light-sensitive
part of the algae

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.255
and then add it to neurons
through genetic modification,

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.946
we can make neurons light-sensitive, too.

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:10.692
Except, with neurons,

00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:14.236
when we shine light down
an optical fiber deep into the brain,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.204
we change how they send electrical signals
to other neurons in the brain

00:03:18.228 --> 00:03:21.053
and thus change the animal's behavior.

00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:23.712
With the help of my colleagues,

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.585
I pioneered the use of optogenetic tools

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.407
to selectively target neurons
that are living in point A,
