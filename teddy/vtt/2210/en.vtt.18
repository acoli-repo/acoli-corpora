00:08:59.296 --> 00:09:01.883
But really, I've come
full circle to do both.

00:09:01.907 --> 00:09:03.645
And now my research program

00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:06.256
bridges the gap between
the mind and the brain.

00:09:07.315 --> 00:09:08.609
Research from my laboratory

00:09:08.633 --> 00:09:12.180
suggests that we can begin
to tie specific neural circuits

00:09:12.204 --> 00:09:14.029
to emotional states.

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:15.897
And we have found a number of circuits

00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:18.522
that control anxiety-related behavior,

00:09:18.546 --> 00:09:20.022
compulsive overeating,

00:09:20.046 --> 00:09:22.688
social interaction, avoidance

00:09:22.712 --> 00:09:24.773
and many other types
of motivated behaviors

00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:28.208
that may reflect internal
emotional states.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:34.335
We used to think of functions of the mind
as being defined by brain regions.
