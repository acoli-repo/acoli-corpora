00:08:27.085 --> 00:08:30.783
I am the daughter
of a physicist and a biologist,

00:08:30.807 --> 00:08:33.895
who literally met on the boat
coming to America

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.719
in pursuit of an education.

00:08:36.714 --> 00:08:37.874
So naturally,

00:08:37.898 --> 00:08:41.056
since there was "no pressure"
to be a scientist ...

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.246
(Laughter)

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.449
as a college student,

00:08:45.473 --> 00:08:50.434
I had to decide whether I wanted to focus
on psychology, the study of the mind,

00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:52.945
or neuroscience, the study of the brain.

00:08:52.969 --> 00:08:54.498
And I chose neuroscience,

00:08:54.522 --> 00:08:57.392
because I wanted to understand
how the mind is born

00:08:57.416 --> 00:08:59.272
out of biological tissue.

00:08:59.296 --> 00:09:01.883
But really, I've come
full circle to do both.
