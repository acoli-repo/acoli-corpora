00:05:58.627 --> 00:06:01.132
but to flip the switch with my hand

00:06:01.156 --> 00:06:03.452
and see the mouse
change its behavioral state

00:06:03.476 --> 00:06:05.950
so rapidly and so reversibly,

00:06:05.974 --> 00:06:09.172
it was really the first time
that I truly believed it.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.291
Since that first breakthrough,

00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:14.822
there have been a number
of other discoveries.

00:06:14.846 --> 00:06:18.377
Finding specific neural circuits
that can elicit dramatic changes

00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:19.884
in animal behavior.

00:06:20.956 --> 00:06:23.761
Here's another example:
compulsive overeating.

00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:26.625
We can eat for two reasons.

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:29.188
Seeking pleasure, like tasty food,

00:06:29.212 --> 00:06:31.736
or avoiding pain, like being hungry.
