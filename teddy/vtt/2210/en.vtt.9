00:04:30.787 --> 00:04:35.509
We can use optogenetics
to target the same pathway in a mouse,

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:36.723
and see what happens.

00:04:36.747 --> 00:04:39.546
So this is the elevated plus maze.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.348
It's a widely used anxiety test

00:04:41.372 --> 00:04:43.316
that measures the amount of time

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.070
that the mouse spends in the safety
of the closed arms

00:04:46.094 --> 00:04:48.494
relative to exploring the open arms.

00:04:49.046 --> 00:04:52.031
Mice have evolved to prefer
enclosed spaces,

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:54.008
like the safety of their burrows,

00:04:54.032 --> 00:04:56.374
but to find food, water, mates,

00:04:56.398 --> 00:04:58.945
they need to go out into the open

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.529
where they're more vulnerable
to predatory threats.
