where activating one path
can drive positive emotion and approach,

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:04.763
and activating another path
can drive negative emotion and avoidance.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.696
I'm going to show you
a couple of examples --

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.942
a taste of raw data --

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:14.974
of how we can use optogenetics
to target specific neurons in the brain

00:04:14.998 --> 00:04:17.798
and get very specific changes in behavior.

00:04:18.117 --> 00:04:21.475
Anxiety patients
have abnormal communication

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:23.641
between two parts of the amygdala,

00:04:23.665 --> 00:04:28.549
but in people, it's hard to know
if this abnormality is cause or effect

00:04:28.573 --> 00:04:29.723
of the disease.
