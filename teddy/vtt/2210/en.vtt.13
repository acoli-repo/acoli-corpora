or avoiding pain, like being hungry.

00:06:32.603 --> 00:06:36.254
How can we find a treatment
for compulsive overeating

00:06:36.278 --> 00:06:38.326
without messing up
the hunger-driven feeding

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.950
that we need to survive?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.485
The first step is to understand

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.648
how the brain gives rise
to feeding behavior.

00:06:46.165 --> 00:06:50.450
This fully-fed mouse
is just exploring a space

00:06:50.474 --> 00:06:53.021
completely devoid of any food.

00:06:53.736 --> 00:06:57.268
Here we're using optogenetics to target
neurons living in the hypothalamus,

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:01.101
sending messages down wires
aimed at the midbrain.
