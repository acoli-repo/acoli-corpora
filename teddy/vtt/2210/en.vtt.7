00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.407
to selectively target neurons
that are living in point A,

00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:34.105
sending messages down wires
aimed at point B,

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:39.153
leaving neighboring neurons
going other places unaffected.

00:03:40.347 --> 00:03:44.442
This approach allowed us to test
the function of each wire

00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:47.037
within the tangled mess that is our brain.

00:03:47.775 --> 00:03:49.585
A brain region called the amygdala

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.125
has long been thought
to be important for emotion,

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:53.839
and my laboratory discovered

00:03:53.863 --> 00:03:56.156
that the amygdala
resembles a fork in the road

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.323
where activating one path
can drive positive emotion and approach,
