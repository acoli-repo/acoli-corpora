00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:34.335
We used to think of functions of the mind
as being defined by brain regions.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.191
But my work shows
that within a given brain region,

00:09:37.215 --> 00:09:40.024
there are many different neurons
doing different things.

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:44.807
And these functions
are partly defined by the paths they take.

00:09:46.033 --> 00:09:48.232
Here's a metaphor to help illustrate

00:09:48.256 --> 00:09:52.164
how these discoveries change the way
that we think about the brain.

00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:56.807
Let's say that the brain
is analogous to the world

00:09:56.831 --> 00:09:59.434
and that neurons are analogous to people.

00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:04.331
And we want to understand how information
is transmitted across the planet.
