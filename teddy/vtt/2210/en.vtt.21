00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:30.212
And it is not working.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.800
The development of new drug therapies
for mental health disorders

00:10:34.824 --> 00:10:36.149
has hit a brick wall,

00:10:36.173 --> 00:10:40.387
with scarcely any real progress
since the 1950s.

00:10:40.927 --> 00:10:42.860
So what does the future hold?

00:10:43.474 --> 00:10:44.807
In the near future,

I expect to see a mental health
treatment revolution,

00:10:48.117 --> 00:10:51.291
where we focus on specific
neural circuits in the brain.

00:10:51.315 --> 00:10:55.276
Diagnoses will be made

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.300
and measurable brain activity.

00:10:58.339 --> 00:11:00.331
Further in the future,
