00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.727
Technology has opened new windows
into the black box that is our minds.

00:02:05.363 --> 00:02:08.966
The development of optogenetic tools

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.443
has allowed us unprecedented control
over specific neurons in the brain

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:17.034
and how they talk to each other
by firing electrical signals.

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.324
We can genetically engineer neurons
to be light sensitive

00:02:21.348 --> 00:02:25.402
and then use light to control
how neurons fire.

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:27.553
This can change an animal's behavior,

00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:31.212
giving us insight
into what that neural circuit can do.
