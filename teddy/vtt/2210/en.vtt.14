00:07:08.847 --> 00:07:10.799

00:07:13.048 --> 00:07:15.143
This seemingly frenzied behavior

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:18.818
is about to escalate into something
I find really incredible.

00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:20.857

00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:25.482
It's right here.

00:07:25.856 --> 00:07:29.720
See, he picks up his hands
as if he is eating a piece of food,

00:07:29.744 --> 00:07:32.245
but there's nothing there,
he's not holding anything.
