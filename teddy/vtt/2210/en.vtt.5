00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:31.212
giving us insight
into what that neural circuit can do.

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:34.704
Want to know how scientists
figure this out?

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:39.323
Scientists developed optogenetic tools
by borrowing knowledge

00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:41.480
from other basic science fields.

00:02:41.887 --> 00:02:46.759
Algae are single-celled organisms
that have evolved to swim towards light.

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:51.236
And when blue light shines
onto the eyespot of an algae cell,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.514
a channel opens,
sending an electrical signal

00:02:53.538 --> 00:02:55.387
that makes little flagella flap

00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:57.910
and propels the algae towards sunlight.

00:02:58.482 --> 00:03:01.545
If we clone this light-sensitive
part of the algae
