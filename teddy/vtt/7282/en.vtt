00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:01.556
Biologically speaking,

00:00:01.596 --> 00:00:03.996
I am right in the middle
of my reproductive age.

00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:06.436

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:27.596
And let's not forget about the ads

00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:29.836
that have been following me

00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:33.196
since the age of roughly 25,
promising to track my ovulation,
