manta rays.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
this is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
at the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
You can see the fish are balled up

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and then there's a little cloudy area there

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
where they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
events that the ocean is supposed to do,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
but struggles to do in many places now

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
because of human activity.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
are very important for tuna fisheries,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location.
