00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And are you free for dinner?"

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And I was free for dinner,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And over the course of dinner,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000

to take fish out of its waters,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
because Kiribati does not have the capacity

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
to take the fish itself.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And the deal that they strike

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
is the extracting country

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
gives Kiribati five percent

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
of the landed value.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So if the United States
