00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
ranging from creating legislation

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
to multiple research expeditions

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
to communication plans,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
as I said, teams of lawyers,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
MOUs,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
creating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Kiribati has frozen extracting activities

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
at its current state while we raise the endowment.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So it's a fully functional

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
up-and-running entity

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And the PIPA Trust Board holds that license
