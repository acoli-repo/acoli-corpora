00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You may have seen this in other forms,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but the top line is the amount of protected area

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
on land, globally,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and it's about 12 percent.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
around the 1960s and '70s,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And that's probably because

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that's when everybody got aware of the environment

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and Earth Day

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and all the stuff that happened in the '60s with the Hippies and everything

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
really did, I think, have an affect on global awareness.
