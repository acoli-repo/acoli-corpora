00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
They realized that this was a common cause

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
that they had found

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
with the conservation community.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Then in 2002,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
when this was all going full-swing,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
a coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Here's this resource that we're looking to save,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and it turns out it's the hottest heating event

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
that we can find on record.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
The ocean heated up as it does sometimes,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and the hot spot formed and stalled

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
right over the Phoenix Islands for six months.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months
