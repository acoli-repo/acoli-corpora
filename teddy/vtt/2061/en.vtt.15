00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and people would ask me,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
"Why are you going to this place called Kiribati?"

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And it reminded me of that old joke

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and the reporter yells, "Hey, Willy. Why do you rob banks?"

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And he says, "cause that's where all the money is."

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And I would tell people, "Why do I go to Kiribati?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Because that's where all the ocean is."

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
They basically are one nation

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that controls most of the equatorial waters

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of the Central Pacific Ocean.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
They're also a country

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that is in dire danger.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Sea levels are rising,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and Kiribati, along with 42 other nations in the world,
