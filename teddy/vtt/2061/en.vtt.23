00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It had occurred on land,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
in rainforests of South America and Africa,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
where landowners had been paid

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
not to cut the trees down.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And Conservation International had struck some of those deals.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So I went to Conservation International

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and brought them in as a partner

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and went through the process

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
of valuing the fishery resource,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
what the range of the fishes were,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
brought in a whole bunch of other partners --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
the government of Australia,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
the government of New Zealand, the World Bank.
