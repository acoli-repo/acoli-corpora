I guess the story actually has to start

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
maybe back in the the 1960s,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
when I was seven or eight years old,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with my mask and flippers on.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Then after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
because that's all there was to look at.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And by the time I turned 16,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I pursued a career in marine science,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in exploration and diving,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and lived in underwater habitats, like this one off the Florida Keys,
