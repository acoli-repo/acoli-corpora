00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
That's the vessel that we took up there

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
for these studies, early on,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and that's what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
They're very low to the water,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and they're all uninhabited, except one island

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
has about 35 caretakers on it.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And they've been uninhabited for most of time

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
because even in the ancient days,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
these islands were too far away

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
for those ancient Polynesian mariners

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
that were traversing the Pacific so widely.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But we got up there,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity
