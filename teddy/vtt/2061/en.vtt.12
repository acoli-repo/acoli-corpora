00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And sharks -- we had sharks on our early dives,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
up to 150 sharks at once,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
which is an indication

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
of a very, very healthy, very strong, system.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So I thought the scenes

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
of never-ending wilderness

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
would go on forever,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
but they did finally come to an end.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And we explored the surface of the Islands as well --

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
very important bird nesting site,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
some of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And we finished our trip.
