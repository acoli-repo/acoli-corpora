00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and all the work that we're setting about to do here

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
will help rectify that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So where are the Phoenix Islands?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
They were the world's largest marine-protected area

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
up until last week

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
when the Chagos Archipelago was declared.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
If you want to get to the Phoenix Islands,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
it's five days from Fiji,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
it's five days from Hawaii, it's five days from Samoa.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It's out in the middle of the Pacific,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
right around the Equator.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I had never heard of the islands 10 years ago,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
nor the country, Kiribati, that owns them,
