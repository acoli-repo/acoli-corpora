00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
One is, remember I'm a politician,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
so you've got to go out and work with my ministers

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Secondly, I'd like you to create principles

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
that will transcend my own presidency.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I don't want to do something like this

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
if it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office."

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So we had very strong leadership, very good vision

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Many, many steps were taken to pull this off.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And it was primarily because Kiribati realized

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
that this was in their own self-interest to do this.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
They realized that this was a common cause
