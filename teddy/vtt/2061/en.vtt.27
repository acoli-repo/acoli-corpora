00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
right over the Phoenix Islands for six months.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and it basically killed

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
60 percent of the coral.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
but now it appeared to be dead, at least in the coral areas.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
but the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Well, the good news is it's recovered

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and recovering fast,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
faster than any reef we've seen.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
when we returned to the Phoenix Islands

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and discovered that, because it is a protected area
