00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The average depths are about 12,000 ft.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
which are specifically part of the protected area.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Seamounts are important for biodiversity.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It's an interesting fact.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So it's a deep -- think about it in a big three-dimensional space,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
very deep three-dimensional space

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
with herds of tuna, whales,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
all kinds of deep sea marine life

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
like we've seen here before.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
That's the vessel that we took up there

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
for these studies, early on,
