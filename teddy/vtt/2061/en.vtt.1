00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in exploration and diving,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and lived in underwater habitats, like this one off the Florida Keys,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
for 30 days total.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks, Brian.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And I've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
operated by the Japanese government.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And Sylvia Earle and I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
were on an expedition in this submarine

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
20 years ago in Japan.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And on my dive, I went down 18,000 feet,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to an area that I thought

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But when I got there, I found
