00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
nor the country, Kiribati, that owns them,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
said, "Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
They've never been dived."

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And I said, "Yeah.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But tell me where they are and the country that owns them."

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So that's when I first learned of the Islands

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and had no idea what I was getting into.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But I was in for the adventure.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It's a very deep-water part of our planet.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The average depths are about 12,000 ft.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands,
