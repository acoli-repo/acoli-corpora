And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
After the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000

And we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And are you free for dinner?"
