00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So I started contacting them --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
because they had actually given me a permit to do this --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and I said, "I want to come up and tell you what we found."

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And for some reason they didn't want me to come,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
or it was hard to find a time and a place, and it took a while,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
but finally they said, "Okay, you can come.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
But if you come, you have to buy lunch

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
for everybody who comes to the seminar."

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Just get whatever anybody wants."

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So David Obura, a coral reef biologist, and I went to Tarawa,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and we presented for two hours

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
on the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands.
