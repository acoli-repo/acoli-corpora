00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
In the center we have the Phoenix Islands,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
which is the subject that I'm talking about.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It's the largest atoll nation in the world.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And they have

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
about 110,000 people

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
spread out over 33 islands.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
They control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and that's between one and two percent

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
of all the ocean water on the planet.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And when I was first going up there,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and people would ask me,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
"Why are you going to this place called Kiribati?"
