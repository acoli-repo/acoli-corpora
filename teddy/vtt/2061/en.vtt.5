00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
really did, I think, have an affect on global awareness.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But the ocean-protected area

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is basically flat line

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
until right about now -- it appears to be ticking up.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
of the protected area in the ocean.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
if we could see what happens in the ocean

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
like we can see what happens on land.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But unfortunately, the ocean is opaque,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and we can't see what's going on.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And therefore we're way behind on protection.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But scuba diving, submersibles

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and all the work that we're setting about to do here
