00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
where we explored that big iceberg, B-15,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And we developed techniques

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to dive inside and under the iceberg,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
such as heating pads on our kidneys

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
with a battery that we dragged around,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so that, as the blood flowed through our kidneys,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
it would get a little boost of warmth

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
before going back into our bodies.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But after three trips to Antarctica,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And that same year, 10 years ago,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I headed north to the Phoenix Islands.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment.
