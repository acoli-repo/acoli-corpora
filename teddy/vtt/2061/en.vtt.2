00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But when I got there, I found

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
lots of plastic garbage and other debris.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000

where I started to realize

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Ten years ago was a seminal trip,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
where we explored that big iceberg, B-15,
