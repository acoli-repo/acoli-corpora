00:02:57.565 --> 00:03:00.161
and others were thrown 
overboard for being sick,

00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:01.752
or as discipline,

00:03:01.752 --> 00:03:05.950
the captain's ensured their profits 
by cutting off slave's ears

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.073
as proof of purchase.

00:03:08.073 --> 00:03:11.304
Some captives took matters 
into their own hands.

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:15.113
Many inland Africans 
had never seen whites before,

00:03:15.113 --> 00:03:16.628
and thought them to be cannibals,

00:03:16.628 --> 00:03:20.482
constantly taking people away 
and returning for more.

00:03:20.482 --> 00:03:23.988
Afraid of being eaten, 
or just to avoid further suffering,

00:03:23.988 --> 00:03:27.267
they committed suicide 
or starved themselves,

00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:31.400
believing that in death,
their souls would return home.
