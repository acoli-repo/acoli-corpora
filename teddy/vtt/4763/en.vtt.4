and strengthened them 
against neighboring enemies.

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.773
African kingdoms prospered 
from the slave trade,

00:02:04.773 --> 00:02:09.361
but meeting the European's massive demand
created intense competition.

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:11.971
Slavery replaced other criminal sentences,

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:15.091
and capturing slaves 
became a motivation for war,

00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:17.163
rather than its result.

00:02:17.163 --> 00:02:19.319
To defend themselves from slave raids,

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.949
neighboring kingdoms 
needed European firearms,

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.845
which they also bought with slaves.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.389
The slave trade had become an arms race,

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.258
altering societies and economies 
across the continent.
