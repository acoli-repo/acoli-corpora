Slavery, the treatment of human beings as property,
deprived of personal rights,

00:00:11.604 --> 00:00:14.454
has occurred in many forms

both its global scale and its lasting legacy.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.018
The Atlantic slave trade,

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.433
and spanning three continents,

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.910
