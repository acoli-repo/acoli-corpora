00:03:56.433 --> 00:04:01.454
is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade
had on Africa's future.

00:04:01.454 --> 00:04:05.492
Not only did the continent lose
tens of millions of its able-bodied population,

00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:08.536
but because most of the slaves 
taken were men,

00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:11.888
the long-term demographic 
effect was even greater.

00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:15.727
When the slave trade was finally 
outlawed in the Americas and Europe,

00:04:15.727 --> 00:04:20.346
the African kingdoms whose economies 
it had come to dominate collapsed,

00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:23.716
leaving them open 
to conquest and colonization.

00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:27.265
And the increased competition 
and influx of European weapons

00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:31.703
fueled warfare and instability 
that continues to this day.
