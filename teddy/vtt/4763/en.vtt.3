00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:33.250
In some societies, slaves could 
be part of a master's family,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.785
own land, and even rise 
to positions of power.

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:39.692
But when white captains came offering 
manufactured goods,

00:01:39.692 --> 00:01:42.158
weapons, and rum for slaves,

00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:46.239
African kings and merchants 
had little reason to hesitate.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.515
They viewed the people they sold 
not as fellow Africans

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:55.881
but criminals, debtors, 
or prisoners of war from rival tribes.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:59.052
By selling them, kings enriched 
their own realms,

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.959
and strengthened them 
against neighboring enemies.
