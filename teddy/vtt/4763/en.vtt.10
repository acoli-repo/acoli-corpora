and destined to be slaves,

00:05:00.588 --> 00:05:03.188
making great efforts 
to justify this theory.

00:05:03.188 --> 00:05:07.343
Thus, slavery in Europe and the Americas
acquired a racial basis,

00:05:07.343 --> 00:05:10.497
making it impossible for slaves 
and their future descendants

00:05:10.497 --> 00:05:13.628
to attain equal status in society.

00:05:13.628 --> 00:05:14.774
In all of these ways,

00:05:14.774 --> 00:05:18.574
the Atlantic slave trade 
was an injustice on a massive scale

00:05:18.574 --> 00:05:21.996
whose impact has continued 
long after its abolition.
