00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.044
I grew up to study the brain

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:04.482
because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed

00:00:04.506 --> 00:00:07.452
with a brain disorder, schizophrenia.

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:11.417
And as a sister and later, as a scientist,

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:15.734
I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams,

00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:17.993
I can connect them to my reality,

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.683
and I can make my dreams come true?

00:00:20.707 --> 00:00:24.484
What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia

00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:29.976
that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so they instead become delusion?
