00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.007
History’s first empire rose 
out of a hot, dry landscape,

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:18.787
without rainfall to nourish crops, 
without trees or stones for building.

00:00:18.787 --> 00:00:24.140
In spite of all this, its inhabitants
built the world’s first cities,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.226
with monumental architecture 
and large populations—

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:32.542
and they built them 
entirely out of mud.
