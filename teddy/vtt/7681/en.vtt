A Love Letter to my Garden
by Debbie Millman

00:00:07.197 --> 00:00:09.997
In the beginning of time,
there was no time.

00:00:10.863 --> 00:00:13.930
The universe began
with every bit of energy

00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:16.463
contained in a very tiny,

00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:18.497
incredibly dense point.

00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:21.263
It was even smaller than this point.

00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:25.630
The point exploded
with an unimaginable force

00:00:25.663 --> 00:00:28.797
and created everything we know
and are made of.

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:32.397
Seeds are a bit like that too.
