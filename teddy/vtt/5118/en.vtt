How is it that a breathalyzer can measure 
the alcohol content in someoneâ€™s blood,

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:16.341
hours after they had their last drink, 
based on their breath alone?

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:20.891
Exhaled breath contains trace amounts 
of hundreds, even thousands,

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.351
of volatile organic compounds:

00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:27.835
small molecules lightweight enough 
to travel easily as gases.

00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:32.434
One of these is ethanol, 
which we consume in alcoholic drinks.
