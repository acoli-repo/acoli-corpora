00:06:00.262 --> 00:06:04.247
for overlapping fingerprints, chances are,

00:06:04.271 --> 00:06:06.792
especially if they come
from different individuals,

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:10.235
that the molecular composition
is not identical,

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.342
so let's ask the software
to visualize those unique molecules

00:06:15.366 --> 00:06:19.240
just present in one fingermark
and not in the other one.

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:21.560
By doing so,

00:06:21.584 --> 00:06:25.532
that's how we can separate
the two ridge patterns.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.465
And this is really important

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:34.514
because the police now are able
to identify one of the two fingerprints,
