00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:34.514
because the police now are able
to identify one of the two fingerprints,

00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:36.695
which actually corresponds to Katie.

00:06:37.368 --> 00:06:38.861
And they've been able to say so

00:06:38.885 --> 00:06:41.488
because they've compared
the two separate images

00:06:41.512 --> 00:06:44.193
with one taken posthumously from Katie.

00:06:44.902 --> 00:06:50.095
So now, we can concentrate
on one fingerprint only --

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:51.976
that of the killer's.

00:06:52.477 --> 00:06:54.468
So then, step two ...

00:06:54.968 --> 00:06:57.736
where are these three
molecules that I've seen?

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.498
Well, let's interrogate the software --
show me where they are.
