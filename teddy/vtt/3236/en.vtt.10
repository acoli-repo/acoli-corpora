00:04:55.463 --> 00:05:00.956
But the reality is that I still don't know
where these molecules are coming from,

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.726
from which fingerprint,

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.723
and who those two fingerprints belong to.

00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:07.617
Fear not.

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:10.456
Mass spectrometry imaging
can help us further.

00:05:10.763 --> 00:05:14.008
In fact, the technology is so powerful

00:05:14.032 --> 00:05:19.079
that we can see where
these molecules are on a fingerprint.

00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:21.872
Like you see in this video,

00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:25.774
every single one of those peaks
corresponds to a mass,

00:05:25.798 --> 00:05:27.870
every mass to a molecule,

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:32.835
and we can interrogate the software,
by selecting each of those molecules,
