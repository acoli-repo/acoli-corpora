00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.297
But the reality is that that print
is still not good enough

00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:34.369
to make an identification.

00:07:34.393 --> 00:07:35.794
Step three:

00:07:35.818 --> 00:07:42.482
since we can generate hundreds of images
of the same fingerprint,

00:07:42.506 --> 00:07:45.429
why don't we superimpose them,

00:07:45.453 --> 00:07:46.606
and by doing so,

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.043
try to improve the rich pattern
of continuity and clarity?

00:07:50.067 --> 00:07:51.567
That's the result.

00:07:52.303 --> 00:07:53.705
Striking.

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:57.671
We now have a very clear image
of the fingerprint

00:07:57.695 --> 00:08:00.445
and the police can run it
through the database.
