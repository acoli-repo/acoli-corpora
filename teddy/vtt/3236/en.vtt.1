Thankfully, criminals underestimate
the power of fingerprints, too.

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:34.121
And I'm not just talking about
the twisted parting of lines

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:37.253
that make our fingerprint unique.

00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:41.572
I'm talking about
an entire world of information

00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:45.260
hiding in a small, often invisible thing.

00:00:45.718 --> 00:00:48.404
In fact, fingerprints
are made up of molecules

00:00:48.428 --> 00:00:50.171
that belong to three classes:

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:54.997
sweat molecules that we all produce
in very different amounts ...

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:59.452
molecules that we introduce into our body
and then we sweat out

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:03.040
and molecules that we may contaminate
our fingertips with
