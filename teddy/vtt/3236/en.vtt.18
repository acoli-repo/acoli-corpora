I believe this is also a new era
for criminal profiling.

00:09:00.884 --> 00:09:02.274
The work of the criminologist

00:09:02.298 --> 00:09:06.383
draws on the expert recognition
of behavioral patterns

00:09:06.407 --> 00:09:10.032
that have been observed before
to belong to a certain type,

00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:11.556
to a certain profile.

00:09:11.869 --> 00:09:16.316
As opposed to this expert
but subjective evaluation,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.671
we're trying to do the same thing,

00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:22.259
but from the molecular makeup
of the fingerprint,

00:09:22.283 --> 00:09:24.094
and the two can work together.

00:09:24.812 --> 00:09:27.678
I did say that molecules are storytellers,

00:09:27.702 --> 00:09:30.241
so information on your health,
