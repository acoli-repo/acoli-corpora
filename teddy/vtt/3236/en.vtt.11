00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:32.835
and we can interrogate the software,
by selecting each of those molecules,

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:36.509
as to where they are present
on a fingermark.

00:05:37.385 --> 00:05:40.458
And some images are not very revealing,

00:05:40.482 --> 00:05:41.949
some are better,

00:05:41.973 --> 00:05:44.435
some are really good.

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:49.451
And we can create multiple images
of the same mark --

00:05:49.475 --> 00:05:53.562
in theory, hundreds of images
of the same fingerprint --

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:56.644
for as many of the molecules
that we have detected.

00:05:57.547 --> 00:05:59.119
So step one ...
