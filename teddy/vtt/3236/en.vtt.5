00:02:28.643 --> 00:02:33.303
of mass spectrometry imaging technology

00:02:33.327 --> 00:02:35.890
that we have further developed and adapted

00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:41.164
specifically for the molecular and imaging
analysis of fingerprints.

00:02:41.936 --> 00:02:45.921
In essence, we fire
a UV laser at the print,

00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:49.802
and we cause the desorption
of the molecules from the print,

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:52.701
ready to be captured
by the mass spectrometer.

00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:57.009
Mass spectrometry measures
the weight of the molecules --

00:02:57.033 --> 00:02:59.327
or as we say, the mass --

00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:03.869
and those numbers that you see there,
they indicate that mass.
