to make an identification.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.889
And until recently,
this might have been the end of the road,

00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:16.112

The tape is sent to our labs,

00:02:19.888 --> 00:02:22.848
where we're asked to use
our cutting-edge technology

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:24.732
to help with the investigation.

00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:28.619
And here, we use an existing form
