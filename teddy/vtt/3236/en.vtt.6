00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:03.869
and those numbers that you see there,
they indicate that mass.

00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:05.531
But more crucially,

00:03:05.555 --> 00:03:10.010
they indicate who those molecules are --

00:03:10.034 --> 00:03:12.151
whether I'm seeing paracetamol

00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:15.800
or something more sinister,
forensically speaking.

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:19.750
We applied this technology
to the evidence that we have

00:03:19.774 --> 00:03:23.602
and we found the presence
of condom lubricants.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:28.965
In fact, we've developed protocols
that enable us to even suggest

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.282
what brand of condom might have been used.
