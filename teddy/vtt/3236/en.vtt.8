00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:00.684
Of course not,

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:03.438
and we are asked to delve deeper
with our investigation.

00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:08.960
So we found out, also, the presence
of other two very interesting molecules.

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.053
One is an antidepressant,

00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:14.099
and one is a very special molecule.

00:04:14.123 --> 00:04:16.248
It only forms in your body

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:20.306
if you drink alcohol
and consume cocaine at the same time.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:24.569
And alcohol is known to potentiate
the effects of cocaine,

00:04:24.593 --> 00:04:29.357
so here, we now have a hint
on the state of mind

00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.468
of the individual
whilst perpetrating the crime.
