00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to step up and do something --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
in other words, to act.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Well, this image you've all seen.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It changed our view of the physical world.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Many people credit

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a lot of the birth of the environmental movement

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to our seeing the planet like this

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
for the first time --

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
its smallness, its fragility.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Forty years later, this group, more than most,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
are well aware of the destructive power

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that our species can wield over our environment.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And at last, we appear to be doing something about it.
