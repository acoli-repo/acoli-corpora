00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
was an enormous barrier

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to even discussing or addressing it.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
A simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
the Princess of Wales, touching

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
an HIV/AIDS infected baby

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
did a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
She, better than most, knew the power of an image.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So when we are confronted by a powerful image,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
we all have a choice:

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We can look away, or we can address the image.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Thankfully, when these photos appeared in

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The Guardian in 1998,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
they put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.
