that haunts me still, much more than the others.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Ansel Adams said, and I'm going to disagree with him,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
"You don't take a photograph, you make it."

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
In my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We bring to each image

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
our own values, our own belief systems,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Here it is.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I hope that the next time you see

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
an image that sparks something in you,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
you'll better understand why,
