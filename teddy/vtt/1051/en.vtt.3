00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that our species can wield over our environment.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And at last, we appear to be doing something about it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This destructive power takes many different forms.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
For example, these images taken by Brent Stirton

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in the Congo.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
These gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and unsurprisingly,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
they sparked international outrage.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Most recently,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
with the recent earthquake in Haiti.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Well, I think what is far worse

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is man's destructive power over man.
