00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
with the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
a student killed by the National Guard

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
In fact, these images became

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
the voices of protest themselves.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now, images have power

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to shed light of understanding

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
on suspicion, ignorance,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but I'll just show one image --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the issue of HIV/AIDS.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
was an enormous barrier

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to even discussing or addressing it.
