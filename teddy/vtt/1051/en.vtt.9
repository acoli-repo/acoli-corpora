are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I'll show you one photo here,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
from an extraordinary piece of work,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
which has never been published, called War Is Personal.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But images don't need to be graphic

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
in order to remind us of the tragedy of war.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
After all the tense moments of conflict

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
in all the conflict zones of the world,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
there's one photograph from a much quieter place

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that haunts me still, much more than the others.
