00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
they put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Did the images change the world?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
No, but they had a major impact.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Images often push us to question our core beliefs

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and our responsibilities to each other.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
We all saw those images after Katrina,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and I think for millions of people

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
they had a very strong impact.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And I think it's very unlikely

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that they were far from the minds of Americans

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
when they went to vote in November 2008.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Unfortunately, some very important images

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.
