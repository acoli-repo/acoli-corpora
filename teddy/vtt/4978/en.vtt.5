00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:30.631
With fiber optics,

00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:32.851
distance hardly limits data,

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:36.851
which has allowed the internet to evolve
into a planetary computer.

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:37.651
Increasingly,

00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:43.221
our mobile work and play rely on legions 
of overworked computer servers,

00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:47.161
warehoused in gigantic data centers 
flung across the world.

00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:49.081
This is called cloud computing,

00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:51.361
and it leads to two big problems:

00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:54.144
heat waste and bandwidth demand.

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:58.844
The vast majority of internet traffic 
shuttles around inside data centers,

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:03.544
where thousands of servers are connected 
by traditional electrical cables.
