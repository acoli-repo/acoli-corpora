00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:03.544
where thousands of servers are connected 
by traditional electrical cables.

00:03:03.544 --> 00:03:06.286
Half of their running power 
is wasted as heat.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:10.446
Meanwhile, wireless bandwidth demand 
steadily marches on,

00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:13.536
and the gigahertz signals used in our 
mobile devices

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:16.336
are reaching their data delivery limits.

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:19.866
It seems fiber optics has been too good
for its own good,

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:24.576
fueling overly-ambitious cloud and mobile
computing expectations.

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:29.826
But a related technology, integrated 
photonics, has come to the rescue.

00:03:29.827 --> 00:03:32.857
Light can be guided not 
only in optical fibers,
