00:00:55.056 --> 00:01:00.146
glass can be carefully melted and 
drawn into flexible fiber strands,

00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:04.535
hundreds of kilometers long 
and no thicker than human hair.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:06.237
And instead of electricity,

00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:11.487
these strands carry pulses of light, 
representing digital data.

00:01:11.487 --> 00:01:16.227
But how does light travel within glass, 
rather than just pass through it?

00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:21.511
The trick lies in a phenomenon known 
as total internal reflection.

00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:23.168
Since Isaac Newton’s time,

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:26.798
lensmakers and scientists have 
known that light bends

00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:31.588
when it passes between air and 
materials like water or glass.
