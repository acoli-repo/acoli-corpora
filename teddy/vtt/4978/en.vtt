00:00:07.016 --> 00:00:08.476
In 2012,

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:13.136
a team of Japanese and Danish researchers
set a world record,

00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:15.716
transmitting 1 petabit of data—

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:19.006
that’s 10,000 hours of high-def video—

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.526
over a fifty-kilometer cable, in a second.

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:24.426
This wasn’t just any cable.

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:27.466
It was a souped-up version 
of fiber optics—

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.766
the hidden network that links our planet

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.236
and makes the internet possible.
