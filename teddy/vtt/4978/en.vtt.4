00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:01.781
fiber optic signals barely degrade 
over great distances—

00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:04.051
a little power does scatter away,

00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:06.581
and fibers can’t bend too sharply,

00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:08.491
otherwise the light leaks out.

00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:12.791
Today, a single optical fiber carries many
wavelengths of light,

00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:15.256
each a different channel of data.

00:02:15.256 --> 00:02:19.466
And a fiber optic cable contains hundreds 
of these fiber strands.

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:23.445
Over a million kilometers of cable 
crisscross our ocean floors

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:25.045
to link the continents—

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:29.435
that’s enough to wind around the 
Equator nearly thirty times.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:30.631
With fiber optics,
