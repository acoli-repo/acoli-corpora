00:03:29.827 --> 00:03:32.857
Light can be guided not 
only in optical fibers,

00:03:32.857 --> 00:03:36.217
but also in ultrathin silicon wires.

00:03:36.217 --> 00:03:39.547
Silicon wires don’t guide light
as well as fiber.

00:03:39.547 --> 00:03:42.117
But they do enable engineers to shrink

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:45.597
all the devices in a hundred kilometer 
fiber optic network

00:03:45.597 --> 00:03:49.237
down to tiny photonic chips that plug
into servers

00:03:49.237 --> 00:03:53.327
and convert their electrical signals 
to optical and back.

00:03:53.327 --> 00:03:59.429
These electricity-to-light chips allow for
wasteful electrical cables in data centers

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.809
to be swapped out for 
power-efficient fiber.
