00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:31.431
terahertz signals can be relayed over 
long-range distances.

00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:34.069
They can do so via a stable middleman,

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:39.429
optical fiber, and make hyperfast 
wireless connectivity a reality.

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:41.303
For all of human history,

00:04:41.303 --> 00:04:43.893
light has gifted us with sight and heat,

00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:49.183
serving as a steady companion while we
explored and settled the physical world.

00:04:49.183 --> 00:04:52.812
Now, we’ve saddled light with information
and redirected it

00:04:52.812 --> 00:04:55.762
to run along a fiber optic superhighway—

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:59.102
with many different integrated 
photonic exits—

00:04:59.102 --> 00:05:02.882
to build an even more expansive, 
virtual world.
