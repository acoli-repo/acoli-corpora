00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:31.588
when it passes between air and 
materials like water or glass.

00:01:31.588 --> 00:01:36.239
When a ray of light inside glass hits its 
surface at a steep angle,

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:39.969
it refracts, or bends 
as it exits into air.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.959
But if the ray travels at a shallow angle,

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.029
it’ll bend so far that it stays trapped,

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:48.949
bouncing along inside the glass.

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:50.319
Under the right condition,

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.549
something normally transparent to light
can instead hide it from the world.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.991
Compared to electricity or radio,

00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:01.781
fiber optic signals barely degrade 
over great distances—
