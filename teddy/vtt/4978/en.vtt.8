00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.809
to be swapped out for 
power-efficient fiber.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:07.379
Photonic chips can help break open 
wireless bandwidth limitations, too.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.861
Researchers are working to replace mobile
gigahertz signals

00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:12.651
with terahertz frequencies,

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:15.581
to carry data thousands of times faster.

00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:17.621
But these are short-range signals:

00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:19.721
they get absorbed by moisture in the air,

00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:21.961
or blocked by tall buildings.

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:25.331
With tiny wireless-to-fiber photonic 
transmitter chips

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.001
distributed throughout cities,

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:31.431
terahertz signals can be relayed over 
long-range distances.
