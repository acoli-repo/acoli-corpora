and makes the internet possible.

00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:33.116
For decades,

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.496
long-distance communications 
between cities and countries

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:38.546
were carried by electrical signals,

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:40.266
in wires made of copper.

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.236
This was slow and inefficient,

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:47.656
with metal wires limiting data rates 
and power lost as wasted heat.

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:49.596
But in the late 20th century,

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:53.596
engineers mastered a far superior method
of transmission.

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:55.056
Instead of metal,

00:00:55.056 --> 00:01:00.146
glass can be carefully melted and 
drawn into flexible fiber strands,
