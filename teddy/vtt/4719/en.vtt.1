00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:30.733
ways of defining it by contrast,

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.220
by saying it's more important

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.334
than all other things,

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.831
but is it?

00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:37.313
Sure, love matters more

00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:39.027
than your standard turkey sandwich,

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.359
but does it matter more than shelter?

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:42.538
Or sanity?

00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:44.564
Or an exceptional turkey sandwich?

00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:45.906
No matter your answer,

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:47.262
you're just ranking it,

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:48.805
not defining it.

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:50.406
Another challenge to defining love

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:52.080
is we often try to do so

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.355
while falling into it

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:54.467
or out of it.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:56.689
Would you trust someone who just won the lottery

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.525
to accurately define the concept of currency?

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:02.852
Or, I don't know, ask a guy to define bears
