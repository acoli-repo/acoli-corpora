00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.380
we associate with the feeling:

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.521
Holding hands,

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:03.245
kissing,

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:04.000
hugging,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.963
public displays of affection,

00:02:05.963 --> 00:02:06.805
dating,

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:07.673
marriage,

00:02:07.673 --> 00:02:08.749
having kids,

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:10.238
or just sex.

00:02:10.238 --> 00:02:12.533
But these loving actions can be subjective

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.249
or culturally relative.

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.287
You may love or be someone who can't have kids

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:18.541
or doesn't want to,

00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:20.793
who believes in marriage but also in divorce,

00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:22.968
who's from a culture where people don't really date

00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:24.748
the way we think of dating,

00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:27.365
or who just doesn't want to make out on the bus.

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:29.581
But if love is a thing that we can define,

00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:31.148
then how can it mean opposite things
