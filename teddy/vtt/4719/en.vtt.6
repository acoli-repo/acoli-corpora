00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:00.625
a physiological craving,

00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:01.916
and you want more.

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:02.916
But then sometimes,

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.331
slowly or suddenly,

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:05.391
you don't.

00:03:05.391 --> 00:03:06.652
You've fallen out of love,

00:03:06.652 --> 00:03:07.860
become unaddicted,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.914
for a spell.

00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:09.962
What happened?

00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:12.493
Does one develop a tolerance or hit a limit?

00:03:12.493 --> 00:03:14.138
Why do some lovers stay addicted

00:03:14.138 --> 00:03:15.905
to each other their entire lives?

00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:17.464
Perhaps to create new lives,

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:19.014
to proliferate their species?

00:03:19.014 --> 00:03:21.500
Maybe love is just human DNA's optimal method

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.914
for bringing about its own replication.

00:03:23.914 --> 00:03:25.251
There are evolutionary arguments

00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:27.164
regarding every human mating behavior,

00:03:27.164 --> 00:03:29.569
from how we display ourselves to potential mates,

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.743
to how we treat each other in relationships,
