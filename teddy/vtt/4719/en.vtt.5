00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:31.148
then how can it mean opposite things

00:02:31.148 --> 00:02:32.663
for so many people?

00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:34.386
So, maybe love's just all in your head,

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:36.938
a personal mystery winding through your neural pathways

00:02:36.938 --> 00:02:39.348
and lighting up pleasing, natural rewards

00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:41.062
in your nervous system.

00:02:41.062 --> 00:02:42.958

00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.671
like some pop song.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.663
Evidence shows that chemicals in your brain

00:02:53.663 --> 00:02:55.163
stimulated by another person

00:02:55.163 --> 00:02:57.743
can make you develop a habit for that person.

00:02:57.743 --> 00:02:58.997
The person comes to satisfy

00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:00.625
a physiological craving,
