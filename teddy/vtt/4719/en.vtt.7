00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.743
to how we treat each other in relationships,

00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:33.363
to how we raise kids.

00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:35.408
Thus, some argue that the feeling

00:03:35.408 --> 00:03:37.419
you think you feel in your soul

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.611
is just biology's way to make you continue our species.

00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:42.040
Nature has selected you

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.866
to have crushes on hotties,

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:45.075
just like it makes monkeys

00:03:45.075 --> 00:03:46.657
have crushes on hot monkeys,

00:03:46.657 --> 00:03:48.658
and biology marches on.

00:03:48.658 --> 00:03:50.303
But is that all love is?

00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:52.651
Or, perhaps worse, is it just a construct,

00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:55.106
some fake concept we all convince each other

00:03:55.106 --> 00:03:56.250
to try to live up to

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.659
for a fake sense of purpose?

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:58.827
Maybe it is a construct,

00:03:58.827 --> 00:04:00.132
but let's be more precise
