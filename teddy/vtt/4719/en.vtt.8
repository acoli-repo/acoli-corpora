00:03:58.827 --> 00:04:00.132
but let's be more precise

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:01.581
about what a construct is

00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:04.417
because love is constructed from reality:

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:05.415
Our experiences,

00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:06.082
feelings,

00:04:06.082 --> 00:04:07.206
brain chemistry,

00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:08.335
cultural expectations,

00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:10.180
our lives.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.512
And this edifice can be viewed

00:04:11.512 --> 00:04:12.818
through countless dimensions:

00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:13.728
scientific,

00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:14.424
emotional,

00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:15.326
historical,

00:04:15.326 --> 00:04:16.221
spiritual,

00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:16.992
legal,

00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:18.795
or just personal.

00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:20.914
If no two people are the same,

00:04:20.914 --> 00:04:23.739
no two people's love is the same either.

00:04:23.739 --> 00:04:25.500
So, in every loving relationship,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.982
there's a lot to talk about

00:04:26.982 --> 00:04:28.873
and partners should be open to that,

00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:31.445
or the relationship probably won't last.
