00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:02.852
Or, I don't know, ask a guy to define bears

00:01:02.852 --> 00:01:04.988
while he's fending them off?

00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:08.040
Or is romance not like winning the lottery?

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.415
Are break ups not like bear attacks?

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:11.589
Bad comparisons?

00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:12.772
That's my point.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:13.846
I'm not thinking right

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:15.308
because I'm in love,

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:16.625
so ha!

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:17.563
Taking a step back,

00:01:17.563 --> 00:01:19.650
or taking a cold shower,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.758
whatever,

00:01:19.758 --> 00:01:22.723
love is potentially the most intensely thought about thing

00:01:22.723 --> 00:01:24.223
in all of human history.

00:01:24.223 --> 00:01:27.086
And despite centuries upon centuries of obsession,

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.797
it still overwhelms us.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:30.605
Some say it's a feeling,
