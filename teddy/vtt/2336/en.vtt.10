Even something like
doing my homework at night

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:04.771
becomes very tiring.

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.902
Some people think,

00:05:09.347 --> 00:05:11.434
because of our ability to mask,

00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:13.592
that this is the cure to autism.

00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.721
However, all it really does
is makes us ashamed

00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:19.038
of showing our true selves.

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:28.950
Another common stereotype
that is often associated with autism

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:31.441
is that autistic people lack empathy.
