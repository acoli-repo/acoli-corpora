00:03:00.478 --> 00:03:02.057
For example,

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:07.355
the thing that makes me overwhelmed
all the time is loud noises,

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.478
which means I never
crank up my music really loud

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:14.601
and I usually am not a fan
of large parties.

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:18.762
But other people on the spectrum
might get overwhelmed

00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:22.260
with things like bright lights
or strong smells

00:03:22.284 --> 00:03:24.307
or gooey textures

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.217
that all have the potential
to create anxiety.

00:03:28.847 --> 00:03:34.299
Think about all of the social gatherings
you've been to in the past.
