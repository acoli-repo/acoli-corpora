Emotional expression,
however much or however little,

00:06:01.348 --> 00:06:02.710
is difficult for me.

00:06:03.671 --> 00:06:06.403
And that is because I am bursting inside

00:06:06.427 --> 00:06:10.442
with every single emotion
one feels at all times.

00:06:11.188 --> 00:06:14.498
Though of course,
I cannot express it that way.

00:06:14.522 --> 00:06:19.052
Otherwise, let's say,
happiness, for example,

00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:22.354
would come out as a huge burst
of gleeful wheezing,

00:06:22.378 --> 00:06:25.814
hand flapping and loud vocal "woohoos."

00:06:25.838 --> 00:06:27.377
(Laughter)

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:29.776
Whereas you may just smile.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.126
(Laughter)
