lacking empathy

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.164
and even being a supergenius.

00:01:35.687 --> 00:01:40.503
And the lack of knowledge
on autism doesn't stop there either.

00:01:40.527 --> 00:01:44.125
Did you know that some people
are trying to find a cure for autism?

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.752
That's because they see it
as a negative thing,

00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:48.291
as a disease.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.410
Many people are challenging the idea

00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:55.990
and to us, we think autism
is not a disease.

00:01:56.014 --> 00:02:00.188
It's just another way of thinking
and looking at the world.
