It's just another way of thinking
and looking at the world.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.188
Our brains function differently
from most people's brains.

00:02:04.577 --> 00:02:07.926
Think of it like comparing
and Xbox and a PlayStation.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.490
They're both highly capable consoles
with different programming.

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:16.188
But if you put your Xbox game
in a PlayStation,

00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:20.521
it won't work, because the PlayStation
communicates differently.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.588
When I look in the mirror,

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:28.706
I see someone who thinks differently.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.603
Oh, and I also see nice hair.
