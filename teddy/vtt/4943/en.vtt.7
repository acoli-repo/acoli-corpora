00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:32.399
Of course, these characters 
are far from perfect.

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.799
They often think they have 
all the answers.

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.099
And by telling the story 
from their perspective,

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.539
Austen tricks the viewer into believing 
their heroine knows best–

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:46.077
only to pull the rug out from under 
the protagonist and the reader.

00:03:46.077 --> 00:03:49.781
In "Emma," the titular character feels 
surrounded by dull neighbors,

00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:53.141
and friends who can’t hope 
to match her wit.

00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.691
As her guests prattle on and 
on about nothing,

00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:57.371
the reader begins to agree–

00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:01.561
Emma is the only exciting character 
in this quiet neighborhood.
