00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:31.943
It’s even been said that some readers 
feel like the author’s secret confidante,

00:00:31.943 --> 00:00:36.381
trading letters with their delightfully 
wicked friend Jane.

00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:38.792
But this unique brand of 
tongue-in-cheek humor

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:42.362
is just one of the many feats found 
in her sly satires

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:46.642
of society, civility, 
and sweeping romance.

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:48.852
Written in the early nineteenth century,

00:00:48.852 --> 00:00:51.282
Austen's novels decode 
the sheltered lives

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:54.082
of the upper classes in rural England.

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:56.732
From resentment couched in pleasantries

00:00:56.732 --> 00:00:59.202
to arguing that masks attraction,

00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:03.902
her work explores the bewildering 
collision of emotions and etiquette.
