and provided space for her to write 
and publish her work anonymously.

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.302
But writing was hardly lucrative work.

00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:35.542
And although she had sparks of chemistry,

00:02:35.542 --> 00:02:37.052
she never married.

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:40.912
Elements of her circumstances can be found
in many of her characters;

00:02:40.912 --> 00:02:45.222
often intelligent women with witty, 
pragmatic personalities,

00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:47.530
and rich inner lives.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.880
These headstrong heroines provide 
an entertaining anchor

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.450
for their tumultuous romantic narratives.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.260
Like the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet 
of "Pride and Prejudice,"

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.400
whose devotion to her sisters’ love lives 
blinds her to a clumsy suitor.
