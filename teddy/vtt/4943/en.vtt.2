00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:03.902
her work explores the bewildering 
collision of emotions and etiquette.

00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:06.456
But while romance is a common 
thread in her work,

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:10.836
Austen dismissed the sentimental style 
of writing so popular at the time.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:12.950
Instead of lofty love stories,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.040
her characters act naturally, 
and often awkwardly.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.513
They trade pragmatic advice, 
friendly jokes

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:23.633
and not-so-friendly barbs 
about their arrogant peers.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.795
As they grapple with the endless rules 
of their society,

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.055
Austen’s characters can usually find humor

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:32.865
in all the hypocrisy, propriety, 
and small talk.
