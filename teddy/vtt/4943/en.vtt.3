As Mr. Bennet jokes 
to his favorite daughter,

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:38.685
“For what do we live, 
but to make sport for our neighbors

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:41.285
and laugh at them in our turn?”

00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:44.805
And though her heroines might ridicule 
senseless social mores,

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:49.485
Austen fully understood the practical 
importance of maintaining appearances.

00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:50.889
At the time she was writing,

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:54.529
a wealthy marriage was a financial 
necessity for most young women,

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:58.489
and she often explores the tension between
the mythical quest for love,

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:02.079
and the economic benefits 
of making a match.
