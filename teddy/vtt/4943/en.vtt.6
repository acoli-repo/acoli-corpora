WEBVTT

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.400
whose devotion to her sisters’ love lives 
blinds her to a clumsy suitor.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.492
Or the iron-willed Anne Elliot 
of "Persuasion,"

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:10.352
who chooses to remain unmarried 
after the disappearance of her first love.

00:03:10.352 --> 00:03:11.659
And Elinor Dashwood,

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.089
who fiercely protects her family 
at the cost of her own desires

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:17.719
in "Sense and Sensibility."

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.919
These women all encounter 
difficult choices

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.449
about romantic, filial, and 
financial stability,

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.411
and they resolve them without 
sacrificing their values–

00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:28.601
or their sense of humor.

00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:32.399
Of course, these characters 
are far from perfect.
