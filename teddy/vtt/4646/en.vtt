Sea turtles are miraculous.

00:00:17.158 --> 00:00:19.660
First, they've been around
since the late Jurassic,

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:21.777
roughly 150 million years ago.

00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:23.965
Cohorts of the dinosaurs,

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.210
sea turtles have survived
through the challenges of eons,

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:28.758
existing still today,

00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:31.520
where many others
have ended their evolutionary run.
