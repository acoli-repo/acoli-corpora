00:01:59.037 --> 00:02:01.489
and not fall to the pressures
of challenging weather

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:02.894
or unfortunate currents.

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:06.942
In this phase, roughly 50 percent
of those who reach the surf

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:08.164
will perish.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.890
Ultimately, with the passage of years,

00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:12.934
the survivors will increase in size,

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.829
from that of a dinner plate at year one

00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:16.140
to that of a dinner table,

00:02:16.164 --> 00:02:18.826
in the case of one species
at least, the leatherback,

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.211
a decade or so later.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.395
With size comes
some measure of protection.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.618
The only truly worrisome predators
now are some of the larger shark species--

00:02:27.642 --> 00:02:29.807
bulls, tigers, and whites --

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:31.601
and the occasional killer whale.
