00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.926
to plastic refuse to poaching,
long lines, nets,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.545
and even noxious chemicals, including oil,

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.646
have upped the ante for sea turtles,

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.976
causing their survival rate to drop
to around one percent or less,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.831
from each nesting cycle.

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:14.533
It is this added human pressure
which has pushed

00:03:14.557 --> 00:03:16.312
each of the eight sea turtle species

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:18.795
into either a threatened
or endangered state.

00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:22.796
For while they have evolved
to overcome a host of obstacles,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.292
the most recent has arisen so quickly

00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:29.194
and at such scale that the species
find themselves overwhelmed.

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.237
So let's quickly recap this cycle of odds.
