00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:30.421
as they first face
the repelling force of the waves,

00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:33.471
and then find a whole new
host of predators awaiting them:

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:37.178
Various fish, dolphins,
sharks, and sea birds,

00:01:37.202 --> 00:01:39.905
as the young turtles
come to the surface for air.

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.771
For their first few days of life,

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:44.086
should they count themselves
amongst the living,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.746
the vulnerable turtles
swim frantically forward.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.317
Ultimately, they will often
look to settle in a patch of flotsam,

00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:52.609
preferably a patch of floating seaweed.

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:54.530
Now for the next several months,

00:01:54.554 --> 00:01:56.943
they will seek to avoid
those that would eat them,

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.013
find that which they might eat themselves,

00:01:59.037 --> 00:02:01.489
and not fall to the pressures
of challenging weather
