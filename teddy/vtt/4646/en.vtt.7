00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.237
So let's quickly recap this cycle of odds.

00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:34.043
Using a hypothetical nesting season,

00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:36.976
for females may nest
multiple times in a single year,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.109
of 1,000 eggs, for sake of ease.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.169
1000 eggs laid.

00:03:41.898 --> 00:03:43.145
800 hatch.

00:03:43.784 --> 00:03:45.661
400 make it to the water.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.780
200 progress toward adulthood.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.811
20 survive to breeding age --

00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:53.945
that is, without human interference.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.549
Two survive to breeding age
with human interference.

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.115
So a breeding adult sea turtle
is the very embodiment of a long shot.
