where many others
have ended their evolutionary run.

00:00:31.847 --> 00:00:34.804
Second, throughout the centuries
and up till today,

00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:38.216
every living adult sea turtle
has overcome the odds,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.684
existing as a consequence of chance,

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:42.698
skill, and capability.

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:46.861
The gauntlet each sea turtle faces
in the course of its lifetime goes thus:

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.032
First, deposited as a clutch of leathery,
ping-pong ball-sized eggs

00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:55.134
into a nesting pit dug by its mother
high on the beach,

00:00:55.158 --> 00:00:57.338
of the 50 to 200 eggs laid,

00:00:57.362 --> 00:00:59.628
roughly 20 percent will never hatch.
