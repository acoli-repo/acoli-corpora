00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.836
Roughly a month and a half

00:01:11.352 --> 00:01:13.507

Along the way, debris, pitfalls, crabs,

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:19.270

For those that actually reach the surf,

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:27.653
they trade one set of threats for another,

00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:30.421
as they first face
the repelling force of the waves,
