00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.743
in our world today,

00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:32.950
these harrowing water crises

00:03:32.974 --> 00:03:35.122
that have streamed
across our digital devices

00:03:35.146 --> 00:03:37.435
in countdowns to Day Zero,

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.657
the point at which municipal
water supplies are shut off.

00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:44.015
Places like Cape Town, South Africa,

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:45.815
where in 2018,

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.752
residents were limited
to two-minute showers

00:03:48.776 --> 00:03:52.464
and 23 gallons of water
per day per person,

00:03:52.488 --> 00:03:55.987
or just this past summer,
where the mismanagement of water

00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:57.686
led the streets of Chennai

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.750
to be lined with thousands
of plastic water jugs
