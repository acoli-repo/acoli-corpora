It's the first medicine
that each of us as human beings

00:11:00.077 --> 00:11:01.370
is exposed to.

00:11:01.906 --> 00:11:07.100
See, we are all born as human beings
with a natal connection to water,

00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:10.530
but somewhere along the way,
we lost that connection,

00:11:10.554 --> 00:11:12.688
and we have to work to restore it.

00:11:12.712 --> 00:11:14.800

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.744
as water citizens

00:11:26.768 --> 00:11:28.830
and protects water.

00:11:29.868 --> 00:11:33.557
So, in the words of Nokomis,
