00:07:57.615 --> 00:08:01.337
as being living and protected
under our laws.

00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:03.376
And even for the Western world,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.067
environmental legal theorists

00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:08.318
have argued for the rights of nature
since the 1970s.

00:08:09.284 --> 00:08:10.959
But we need to do better.

00:08:10.983 --> 00:08:12.972
We need to change.

00:08:12.996 --> 00:08:15.555
And we need to grant
legal personhood to water,

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:18.302
because it affords the following

00:08:18.326 --> 00:08:21.206
It grants water the right to exist,

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.355
flourish, and naturally evolve,

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:25.872
and most of all,
it protects the water from us,

00:08:25.896 --> 00:08:28.546
from human beings that would do it harm,

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.714
from human-caused climate-change impacts,
