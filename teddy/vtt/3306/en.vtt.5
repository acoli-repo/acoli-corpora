So to do so, we need to transform
the way in which we value water.

00:02:31.268 --> 00:02:35.029
We have to start to think
about how do we connect to water.

00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:38.197
Usually, someone might ask you,

00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:39.931
"What is water?"

00:02:39.955 --> 00:02:45.770
and you would respond
with "Rain, ocean, lake, river,

00:02:45.794 --> 00:02:47.963
H20, liquid."

00:02:47.987 --> 00:02:52.294
You might even understand
the sacred essentiality of water

00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:55.095
and say that water is life.

00:02:56.268 --> 00:02:58.731
But what if I asked you, instead,

00:02:58.755 --> 00:03:00.722
"Who is water?"
