00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:33.015
but globally, our waters
are also threatened,

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:36.279
and we are facing a global water crisis,

00:07:36.303 --> 00:07:39.557
and if we want to address
these crises in our lifetime,

00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:41.295
we need to change.

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:45.381
We need to fundamentally transform
the way in which we value water.

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:50.654
And this is not something new
for us as Indigenous peoples.

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:54.812
Our Indigenous legal systems
have a foundational principle

00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:57.591
of understanding our nonhuman relations

00:07:57.615 --> 00:08:01.337
as being living and protected
under our laws.
