00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:32.136
And in that prophecy,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.287
she told me that it tells
of a day that will come

00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:39.310
where an ounce of water
costs more than an ounce of gold.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:45.441
When she told me that prophecy,
I sat for a moment,

00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:51.227
and I thought about all of the injustices
we see in our world today,

00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:55.144
the water crises we see
in our world today,

00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:57.631
and I said, "Nokomis, Grandmother,

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:00.956
I feel like we are already
in that time of prophecy."
