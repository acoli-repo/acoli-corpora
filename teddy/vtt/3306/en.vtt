Aquay Wunne Kesuk. 
Kelsey Leonard Nooweesuonk.

00:00:05.575 --> 00:00:07.566
Hello, good day, everyone.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.805
I'm from the Shinnecock Nation.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.907
Tabutni to the Cahuilla peoples,

00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:15.097
whose land we gather on today.

00:00:16.374 --> 00:00:19.632
I was taught that water is alive.

00:00:19.656 --> 00:00:21.352
It can hear,

00:00:21.376 --> 00:00:22.854
it holds memories.

00:00:23.343 --> 00:00:26.424
And so I brought a water vessel
up with me today,

00:00:26.448 --> 00:00:30.169
because I want it to hold the memories
of our conversation today.
