00:04:59.678 --> 00:05:03.568
After the spill leaked millions
of hazardous mine waste

00:05:03.592 --> 00:05:05.020
into the river system,

00:05:05.044 --> 00:05:07.019
this was it later that day.

00:05:07.586 --> 00:05:10.408
Today, the Navajo Nation
and the Diné People

00:05:10.432 --> 00:05:15.054
and the river itself are still
trying to recover from contamination.

00:05:15.673 --> 00:05:19.380
Or even right here
in Palm Springs, California,

00:05:19.404 --> 00:05:21.737
where the Agua Caliente Band
of Cahuilla Indians

00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:25.999
has been fighting for decades
to protect groundwater from exploitation

00:05:26.023 --> 00:05:27.793
so that future generations

00:05:27.817 --> 00:05:31.182
can not only live but thrive
in their homelands,
