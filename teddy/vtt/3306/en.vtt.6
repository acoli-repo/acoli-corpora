00:02:58.755 --> 00:03:00.722
"Who is water?"

00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:05.273
In the same way that I might ask you,
"Who is your grandmother?"

00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:07.058
"Who is your sister?"

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.136
That type of orientation

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.469
fundamentally transforms the way
in which we think about water,

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.660
transforms the way
in which we make decisions

00:03:15.684 --> 00:03:17.771
about how we might protect water,

00:03:17.795 --> 00:03:20.701
protect it in the way that you
would protect your grandmother,

00:03:20.725 --> 00:03:23.191

00:03:25.641 --> 00:03:29.465
that we need if we are going to address
the many water crises we see

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.743
in our world today,
