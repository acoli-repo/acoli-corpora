We often imagine that the world
is filled with infinite water.

00:09:01.234 --> 00:09:02.494
In fact, it's not.

00:09:02.518 --> 00:09:04.615
This planet, Ohke, Mother Earth,

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:07.639
has very finite freshwater resources.

00:09:07.663 --> 00:09:10.592
Currently, nearly two billion people

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:14.165
live in countries experiencing
high water stress.

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:17.901
It is also estimated that by 2030,

00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:22.310
up to 700 million people
could be displaced, worldwide,

00:09:22.334 --> 00:09:23.854
due to water scarcity.

00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:27.122
We have to address this crisis.

00:09:27.741 --> 00:09:29.713
And so it's time for us to change.

00:09:29.737 --> 00:09:33.101
We have to transform
the way in which we value water.
