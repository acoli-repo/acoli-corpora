00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:02.136
I believe that many
of these water injustices

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.114
are the result of the Western
legal system's failure to recognize

00:06:06.138 --> 00:06:08.070
the legal personhood of water.

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:11.221
And so we must ask ourselves --

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:13.368
who is justice for?

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:15.622
Humanity alone?

00:06:16.824 --> 00:06:19.650
We've granted legal personhood
to corporations.

00:06:19.674 --> 00:06:22.872
In the US, the Supreme Court
found in "Citizens United"

00:06:22.896 --> 00:06:24.582
that a corporation was a person

00:06:24.606 --> 00:06:27.074
with similar protections
under the Constitution,

00:06:27.098 --> 00:06:28.932
such as freedom of speech,

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:31.623
and applied similar reasoning
in "Hobby Lobby,"
