So, in the words of Nokomis,

00:11:33.581 --> 00:11:35.686
what are you going to do about it?

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.844
What are you going to do for the water?

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:42.672
Well, you can call your local politician.

00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:44.458
You can go to a town meeting.

00:11:44.482 --> 00:11:47.512
You can advocate for granting
legal personhood to water.

00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:51.148
You can be like the residents
of the city of Toledo

00:11:51.172 --> 00:11:52.775
and build from the grass roots,

00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:56.183
and craft your own legislation
if the politicians won't write it,

00:11:56.207 --> 00:11:58.948
recognizing legal personality of water.

00:11:59.282 --> 00:12:03.666
You can learn about the Indigenous lands
and waters that you now occupy
