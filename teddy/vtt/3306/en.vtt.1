because I want it to hold the memories
of our conversation today.

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:34.213
Who gets legal rights?

00:00:35.273 --> 00:00:39.782
History has shown us
some people but not others.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:43.545
In the United States,
Indigenous peoples like myself

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:47.401
were not citizens
under the law until 1924.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.469
My Shinnecock ancestors, pictured here,

00:00:50.493 --> 00:00:52.794
were not citizens under the law.

00:00:53.573 --> 00:00:59.731
Then why do we claim to be nations
governed by the rule of law

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:04.018
if some people are protected,
but not others?
