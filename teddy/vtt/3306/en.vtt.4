I feel like we are already
in that time of prophecy."

00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:04.107
And she looked back at me directly,

00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:05.431
and she said,

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:07.670
"So what are you going to do about it?"

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:10.655
That's why I'm here with you today,

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.981
because I believe
that one of the many solutions

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:17.894
to solving the many water injustices
we see in our world today

00:02:17.918 --> 00:02:21.205
is recognizing that water
is a living relation

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.967
and granting it the legal
personhood it deserves.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.554
So to do so, we need to transform
the way in which we value water.
