My wife is pregnant right
now with our first child,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.351
and when people see her
with her big baby bump,

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.205
the first question people ask,
almost without fail, is,

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:23.806
"Is it a boy or is it a girl?"

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.307
Now, there are some assumptions
behind that question

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:27.489
that we take for granted

00:00:27.513 --> 00:00:30.140
because of our familiarity
with our own human biology.
