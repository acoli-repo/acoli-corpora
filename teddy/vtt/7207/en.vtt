It's my job to find aliens,
so as you might guess,

00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:06.419
I spent a lot of time thinking about them,

00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:08.880
imagining little green women

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:11.591
meeting up with their friends,
commuting to work.

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:14.594
And that gets me thinking
about alien astronomers

00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:16.971
trying to find us in their night sky.

00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:20.808
If these alien astronomers
had looked in our direction

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:22.310
in the last century,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.732
they would have been really excited
to detect unequivocal signs of technology.

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:30.109
But what if they looked
ten thousand years ago,
