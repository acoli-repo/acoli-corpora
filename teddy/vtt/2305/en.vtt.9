00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I could be in the movement

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
in a way that I wasn't able to be

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
in my real life, in myself.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And at 16,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I stumbled across another opportunity,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and I earned my first acting role in a film.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I can hardly find the words

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
to describe the peace I felt

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
when I was acting.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
My dysfunctional self

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
could actually plug in

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to another self, not my own,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and it felt so good.
