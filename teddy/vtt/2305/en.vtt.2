Our little portion of oneness is given a name,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is told all kinds of things about itself,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and these details,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
opinions and ideas

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which go towards building ourselves,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And that self becomes the vehicle

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
for navigating our social world.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
based on other people's projections.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Is it who we really are?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Or who we really want to be, or should be?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So this whole interaction
