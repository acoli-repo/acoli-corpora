00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I've become very familiar

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
with its dysfunctional behavior.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
But I'm not ashamed of my self.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
In fact, I respect my self

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and its function.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And over time and with practice,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I've tried to live

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
more and more from my essence.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And if you can do that,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
incredible things happen.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I was in Congo in February,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
dancing and celebrating

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
with women who've survived

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
the destruction of their selves

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
in literally unthinkable ways --
