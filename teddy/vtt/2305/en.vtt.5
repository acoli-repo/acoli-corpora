00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
before I realized

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that it was never alive in the first place?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I grew up on the coast of England

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
in the '70s.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
My dad is white from Cornwall,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and my mom is black from Zimbabwe.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Even the idea of us as a family

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
was challenging to most people.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But nature had its wicked way,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and brown babies were born.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But from about the age of five,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I was aware that I didn't fit.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I was the black atheist kid
