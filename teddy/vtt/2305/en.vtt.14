00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that feeling of otherness.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
My desire to disappear

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
was still very powerful.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I had a degree from Cambridge;

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I had a thriving career,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
but my self was a car crash,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and I wound up with bulimia

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and on a therapist's couch.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And of course I did.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I still believed

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
my self was all I was.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I still valued self-worth

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
above all other worth,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and what was there to suggest otherwise?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
