00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but I don't think that we're born with one.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You know how newborn babies

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
believe they're part of everything;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
they're not separate?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Well that fundamental sense of oneness

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is lost on us very quickly.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's like that initial stage is over --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
oneness: infancy,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
unformed, primitive.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's no longer valid or real.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What is real is separateness,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and at some point in early babyhood,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the idea of self

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
starts to form.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Our little portion of oneness is given a name,
