00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Without it, we literally can't interface with others.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We can't hatch plans

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and climb that stairway of popularity,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
of success.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But my skin color wasn't right.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
My hair wasn't right.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
My history wasn't right.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
My self became defined

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
by otherness,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
which meant that, in that social world,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I didn't really exist.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And I was "other" before being anything else --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
even before being a girl.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I was a noticeable nobody.
