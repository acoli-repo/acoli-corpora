But in retrospect,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the destruction of my self was so repetitive

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that I started to see a pattern.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The self changed,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
got affected, broken, destroyed,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but another one would evolve --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
sometimes stronger,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
sometimes hateful,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
sometimes not wanting to be there at all.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000

would my self have to die

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
before I realized
