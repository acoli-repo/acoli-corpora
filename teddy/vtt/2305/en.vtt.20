00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I thought I lacked substance,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and the fact that I could feel others'

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
The thing that was a source of shame

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
was actually a source of enlightenment.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And when I realized

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and really understood

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that my self is a projection and that it has a function,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
a funny thing happened.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I stopped giving it so much authority.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I give it its due.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I take it to therapy.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I've become very familiar

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
with its dysfunctional behavior.
