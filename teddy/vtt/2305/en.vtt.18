00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that feeling of oneness.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And when I'm acting a role,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I inhabit another self,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and I give it life for awhile,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
because when the self is suspended

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
so is divisiveness

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and judgment.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And I've played everything

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to Secretary of State in 2004.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And no matter how other

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
these selves might be,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
they're all related in me.
