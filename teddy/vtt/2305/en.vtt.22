00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
the destruction of their selves

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
in literally unthinkable ways --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
all over that beautiful land

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
are fueling our selves' addiction

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
to iPods, Pads, and bling,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
which further disconnect ourselves

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
from ever feeling their pain,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
their suffering,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
their death.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Because, hey,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
if we're all living in ourselves

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and mistaking it for life,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
then we're devaluing
