00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
We've created entire value systems

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and a physical reality

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
to support the worth of self.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Look at the industry for self-image

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and the jobs it creates,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
the revenue it turns over.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
We'd be right in assuming

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that the self is an actual living thing.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
But it's not. It's a projection

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
which our clever brains create

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
in order to cheat ourselves

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
from the reality of death.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
But there is something

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that can give the self
