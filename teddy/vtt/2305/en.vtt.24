00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and oil and blood,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
rivers of it.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Crucially, we haven't been figuring out

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
how to live in oneness

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
with the Earth and every other living thing.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
We've just been insanely trying to figure out

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
how to live with each other -- billions of each other.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Only we're not living with each other;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
our crazy selves are living with each other

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and perpetuating an epidemic

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
of disconnection.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Let's live with each other

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and take it a breath at a time.
