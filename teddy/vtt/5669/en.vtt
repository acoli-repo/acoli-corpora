00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.021
My father used to call me Jamila
"Gabar Nasiib Nasiib Badan,"

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.420
which means Jamila
"The Lucky, Lucky Girl."

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.793
And I have been very fortunate in my life.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.510
My family were originally nomads.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.840
And when it rained the night I was born,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.710
they stopped in a tiny village
that looked a bit like this,

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.380
where we lived in the next 11 years

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.440
until drought and a war with Ethiopia

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.330
forced us to move
to Somali's capital, Mogadishu.
