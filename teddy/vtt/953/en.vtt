One day, Los Angeles Times columnist

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Steve Lopez was walking along

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the streets of downtown Los Angeles

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
when he heard beautiful music.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the source was a man,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
an African-American man,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
charming, rugged, homeless,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
playing a violin that only had two strings.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I'm telling a story that many of you know,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because Steve's columns became the basis

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
for a book, which was turned into a movie,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,
