00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
These are spinneret glands

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
on the abdomen of a spider.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
They produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
tougher than any fiber humans have ever made.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And to make that, it involves extremes of temperature,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
extremes of pressure and loads of pollution.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with raw materials of dead flies and water.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away.
