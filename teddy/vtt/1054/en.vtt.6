(Applause)

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You guys are looking good out there.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Ready for some jokes?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Audience: Yeah.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Data: Here's the first one.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Right, so,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
a doctor says to his patient,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
"I have bad news and worse news.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live."

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
"That's terrible," said the patient.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
"How can the news possibly be worse?"

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
"I've been trying to contact you since yesterday."
