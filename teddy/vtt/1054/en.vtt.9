00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The guy's voice comes back on the line,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
"Okay, now what?"

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
(Laughter)

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
(Applause)

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Question: Why is television called a medium?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Anyone?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Because it's neither rare nor well done.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But to be completely honest with you,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I kind of love television.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Data: I find it incredibly educational.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Actually, as soon as someone turns it on,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I go into the other room and read.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
