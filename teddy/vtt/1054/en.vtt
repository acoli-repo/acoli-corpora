00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Some of the greatest innovations

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and developments in the world

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
often happen at the intersection of two fields.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So tonight I'd like to tell you

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is entertainment and robotics.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So if we're trying to make robots

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that can be more expressive

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and that can connect better with us in society,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
maybe we should look to some of the human professionals

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of artificial emotion and personality

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that occur in the dramatic arts.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts
