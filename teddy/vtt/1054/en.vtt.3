00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And so it's going to try to watch your response.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
(Laughter)

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It can also learn from you

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
about the quality of its jokes

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
over longer-term

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to different communities or audiences,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
children versus adults, different cultures.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You can learn something from the robot

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
about the community that you're in.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to our future robot companions.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Some of you in this middle section --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
you have red/green paddles.
