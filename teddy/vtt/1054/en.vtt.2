or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
please contact me, the Bot-Agent.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The bot, our rising celebrity,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
He's named after the Star Trek character.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I think he's going to be super popular.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We've got the robot --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in his head is a database of a lot of jokes.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It knows how much it's moving.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And so it's going to try to watch your response.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.
