00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Some of you in this middle section --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
you have red/green paddles.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If you like what's going on,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
show the green.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
If you don't like the subject or the performance,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
you can hold the red.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Now don't be shy.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's just a robot.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It doesn't have feelings ... yet.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
(Laughter)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And the rest of you,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
you still count, you still matter.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
There's also a microphone

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and booing -- I hope not --
