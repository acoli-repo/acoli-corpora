WEBVTT

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.993
She was the person who, if you needed
an extra pair of boots

00:08:32.017 --> 00:08:34.972
or a home-cooked dinner,
would be on your speed dial.

00:08:35.404 --> 00:08:37.642
Because she never, ever would talk to you

00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:38.817
about how good she was,

00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:41.049
but let her character speak
through action.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:48.086
She was famous for taking the hard right
over the easy wrong.

00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:51.877
And she was also famous
for walking up to a 15-foot rope,

00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:54.061
climbing it using only her arms,

00:08:54.085 --> 00:08:56.086
and then shuffling away and apologizing,

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.500
because she knew she was supposed
to use both her arms and her legs,

00:08:59.524 --> 00:09:01.221
as the Rangers had trained them.
