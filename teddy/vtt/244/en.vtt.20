She doesn't remember much
about that overwhelming set of days,

00:10:02.546 --> 00:10:05.315
in which grief -- enormous grief --

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:06.622
mixed with pride.

00:10:07.359 --> 00:10:09.359
But she does remember one moment.

00:10:09.913 --> 00:10:13.319
A stranger with a child
in her hand came up to her

00:10:13.343 --> 00:10:16.025
and she said, "Mrs. White,

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:18.347
I brought my daughter here today,

00:10:18.371 --> 00:10:21.060
because I wanted her to know
what a hero was.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.514
And I wanted her to know
that heroes could be women, too."

00:10:27.749 --> 00:10:31.363
It is time to celebrate
all the unsung heroines
