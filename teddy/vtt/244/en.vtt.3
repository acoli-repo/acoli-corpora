00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.389

00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:42.757
of the entire United States military.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.259
Less than five percent.

So the call went out.

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:50.556

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.703

on the battlefield in Afghanistan."

00:01:54.727 --> 00:01:56.501
This is in 2011.

00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:58.714
And from Alabama to Alaska,

00:01:58.738 --> 00:02:02.671
a group of women who had always
wanted to do something that mattered
