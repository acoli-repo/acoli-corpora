00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:31.002
This was a group of women
whose friendship and valor was cemented

00:00:31.026 --> 00:00:35.484
not only by what they had seen
and done at the tip of the spear,

00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:37.479
but by the fact that they were there

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:40.021
at a time when women --
officially, at least --

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:42.580
remained banned from ground combat,

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:46.309
and America had no idea they existed.

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:50.408
This story begins
with Special Operations leaders,

00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:54.009
some of the most tested men
in the United States military, saying,

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:57.368
"We need women to help us wage this war."

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:01.747
"America would never kill its way
to the end of its wars," it argued.
