00:08:59.524 --> 00:09:01.221
as the Rangers had trained them.

00:09:01.245 --> 00:09:03.121
(Laughter)

00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:06.448
Some of our heroes return home
to tell their stories.

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:08.958
And some of them don't.

00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.503
And on October 22, 2011,

00:09:12.527 --> 00:09:16.095
First Lieutenant Ashley White was killed
alongside two Rangers,

00:09:16.119 --> 00:09:17.474
Christopher Horns

00:09:17.498 --> 00:09:18.854
and Kristoffer Domeij.

00:09:19.998 --> 00:09:23.247
Her death threw this program built
for the shadows

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:25.298
into a very public spotlight.

00:09:25.322 --> 00:09:26.475
Because after all,

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:29.666
the ban on women in combat
was still very much in place.
