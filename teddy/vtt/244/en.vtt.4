00:01:58.738 --> 00:02:02.671
a group of women who had always
wanted to do something that mattered

00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:04.673
alongside the best of the best,

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:06.950
and to make a difference
for their country,

00:02:06.974 --> 00:02:08.959
answered that call to serve.

00:02:10.294 --> 00:02:15.926
And for them it was not about politics,
it was about serving with purpose.

00:02:16.858 --> 00:02:19.316
And so, the women who came
to North Carolina

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.043
to compete for a spot on these teams

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:25.264
which would put women
on the Special Operations front lines,

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:28.659
landed and found
very quickly a community,

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.280
the likes of which they had never seen.
