00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:31.623
to a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs,

00:06:31.647 --> 00:06:34.043
when she found the intel item
they were looking for

00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:36.329
wrapped up in a baby's wet diaper.

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:40.546
And there was the night that Isabel,
another one of their teammates,

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.668
found the things
that they were looking for,

00:06:42.692 --> 00:06:44.808
and received an Impact Award
from the Rangers

00:06:44.832 --> 00:06:46.558
who said that without her,

00:06:46.582 --> 00:06:49.336
the things and the people
they were looking for that night

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.784
would never have been found.

00:06:51.553 --> 00:06:53.381
That night and so many others,

00:06:53.405 --> 00:06:56.518
they went out to prove themselves,
not only for one another,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.812
but for everybody
who would come after them.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:02.306
And also for the men
alongside whom they served.
