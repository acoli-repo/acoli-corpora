00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.411
to be one of the only women
doing what they were doing.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:03.612
They would swap jokes,

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:06.088
they would talk about
what was working, what wasn't,

00:05:06.112 --> 00:05:09.159
what they had learned to do well,
what they needed to do better.

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:12.606
And they would talk about
some of the lighter moments of being women

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.122
out on the Special Operations front lines,

00:05:15.146 --> 00:05:16.511
including the Shewee,

00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:18.850
which was a tool
that let you pee like a guy,

00:05:18.874 --> 00:05:23.302
although it's said to have had only
a 40 percent accuracy rate out there.

00:05:23.326 --> 00:05:26.417
(Laughter)

00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:28.441
These women lived in the "and."

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.301
They proved you could be fierce
and you could be feminine.
