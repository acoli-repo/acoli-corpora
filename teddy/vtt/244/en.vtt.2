"America would never kill its way
to the end of its wars," it argued.

00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:04.431
"Needed more knowledge

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.219
And as everyone knows,

So you needed women soldiers out there.

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:33.018
That meant, at this time in the war,
that the women who would be recruited
