Hence it is unable to reach the
District Collector of Chandrapur.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.080
Today we are living
in the world of big data

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.080
where even your Facebook comments

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.420
and likes are analyzed
to show you only those things

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.400
which you may want to see.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.680
During the initial phase of SocialCops,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.080
my co-founder Varun and I often wondered,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.250
whether this kind of personalization
was possible for our villages or not.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.800
And this journey took us to Chandrapur.
