In the last two years,
the world has generated so much data,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.680
which hasn’t been created
since the history of mankind.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.520
The future we would like
for the world is that

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:46.620
no decision is taken just by
someone saying so

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.200
or on someone’s personal opinion,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.920
instead it is taken by using data
for unbiased results.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.760
Just imagine,
can we create a world

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.480
where data is not just used to increase
