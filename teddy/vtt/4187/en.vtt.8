00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.650
that covered every village,
every healthcare center,

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.250
every school, every courtyard
shelter present there.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.920
In fact every home
in Chandrapur was mapped.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.140
The yellow dots on this map
are the homes in Chandrapur.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.290
And like this,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.000
we collected all the necessary data
required for personalization.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.310
But even now,

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.240
we only had data,
not a specific plan for Jangubai’s family.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.800
It could be called a plan only

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.000
if we were able to determine
how to get electricity to her home.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.440
In our country there is no dearth of
government schemes.
