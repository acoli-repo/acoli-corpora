00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.800
And this journey took us to Chandrapur.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.400
When Chandrapur’s ruling minister
Sudhir Mungantiwar learned of

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.560
the Tata Trust funding ministers
under their Adarsh Gaon Scheme,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.960
he formed a partnership.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.600
Tata Trust took up the responsibility
not of one but 290 villages in Chandrapur,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.320
to make them ideal villages
by micro planning.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.440
Micro planning, i.e.,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.800
every village having a personalized plan
for its own needs.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.480
Now if we had done micro planning
by the traditional method,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.440
it would take up nine months for one village.
