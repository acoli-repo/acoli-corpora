In the beginning of the year,
Jangubai and her people

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.800
reached the Chandrapur city to protest.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.540
They only wanted one thing:

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.000
fundamental necessities

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.740
such as sturdily built houses,
clean drinking water,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.280
and electricity in their homes.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.920
Do we not know about these problems?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.750
Data is collected
even today in our country,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.970
but it’s trapped in

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.000
several different register 
and computers in government offices.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.400
Hence it is unable to reach the
District Collector of Chandrapur.
