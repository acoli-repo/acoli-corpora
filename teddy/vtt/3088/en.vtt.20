00:09:59.301 --> 00:10:01.271
We are mentally compressing our networks

00:10:01.295 --> 00:10:03.914
when we are being harassed,
when we are being bullied,

00:10:03.938 --> 00:10:06.152
when we are threatened about losing a job,

00:10:06.176 --> 00:10:08.552
when we feel down and weak.

00:10:08.576 --> 00:10:11.501
We are closing ourselves off,
isolating ourselves,

00:10:11.525 --> 00:10:15.269
creating a blind spot where we actually
don't see our resources.

00:10:15.293 --> 00:10:18.190
We don't see our allies,
we don't see our opportunities.

00:10:18.214 --> 00:10:19.715
How can we overcome this?

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:21.533
Two simple strategies.

00:10:21.557 --> 00:10:25.295
One strategy is simply to look
at your list of Facebook friends

00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:26.475
and LinkedIn friends

00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:29.556
just so you remind yourself
of people who are there

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.100
beyond those that
automatically come to mind.
