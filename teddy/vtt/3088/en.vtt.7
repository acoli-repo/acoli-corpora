00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:31.580
because your networks
are so fundamentally predictable."

00:03:31.604 --> 00:03:34.726
Map out your habitual daily footpath,

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.271
and what you'll probably discover
is that you start at home,

00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:40.731
you go to your school or your workplace,

00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:43.525
you maybe go up
the same staircase or elevator,

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.254
you go to the bathroom --
the same bathroom --

00:03:46.278 --> 00:03:48.051
and the same stall in that bathroom,

00:03:48.075 --> 00:03:49.688
you end up in the gym,

00:03:49.712 --> 00:03:51.172
then you come right back home.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:53.396
It's like stops on a train schedule.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.746
It's that predictable.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.613
It's efficient, but the problem is,
you're seeing exactly the same people.
