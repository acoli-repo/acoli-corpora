and so I want you to think about this one.

00:01:10.986 --> 00:01:15.503
How many of you here
brought a friend along for this talk?

00:01:15.527 --> 00:01:18.203
I want you to look
at your friend a little bit.

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:22.091
Are they of the same nationality as you?

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.008
Are they of the same gender as you?

00:01:25.032 --> 00:01:26.697
Are they of the same race?

00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:29.146
Really look at them closely.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.286
Don't they kind of look like you as well?
