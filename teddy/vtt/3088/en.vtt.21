00:10:32.415 --> 00:10:35.248
And in our own research,
one of the things we did was,

00:10:35.272 --> 00:10:38.883
we considered Claude Steele's
research on self-affirmation:

00:10:38.907 --> 00:10:41.430
simply thinking about your own values,

00:10:41.454 --> 00:10:43.289
networking from a place of strength.

00:10:43.313 --> 00:10:46.223

we found that people
who had affirmed themselves first

00:10:49.323 --> 00:10:51.154
were able to take advice from people

00:10:51.178 --> 00:10:53.315
who would otherwise
be threatening to them.

00:10:54.778 --> 00:10:56.624
Here's a last exercise.
