00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.596
I started teaching MBA students

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.428
17 years ago.

00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:08.912
Sometimes I run into
my students years later.

00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:11.556
And when I run into them,
a funny thing happens.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.832
I don't remember just their faces;

00:00:13.856 --> 00:00:18.496
I also remember where exactly
in the classroom they were sitting.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.841
And I remember who
they were sitting with as well.

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:26.559
This is not because I have
any special superpowers of memory.

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:28.443
The reason I can remember them

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:31.134
is because they are creatures of habit.
