00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:00.701
They thought of more people.

00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:03.572
They were also less constrained
in how they were networking.

00:09:03.596 --> 00:09:05.633
They were thinking of more diverse people

00:09:05.657 --> 00:09:07.119
than the higher-status people.

00:09:07.143 --> 00:09:10.264
Then we asked them
to think about maybe losing a job.

00:09:10.288 --> 00:09:11.504
We threatened them.

00:09:11.528 --> 00:09:13.599
And once they thought about that,

00:09:13.623 --> 00:09:16.319
the networks they generated
completely differed.

00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:20.180
The lower socioeconomic status
people reached inwards.

00:09:20.204 --> 00:09:21.764
They thought of fewer people.

00:09:21.788 --> 00:09:24.145
They thought of less-diverse people.

00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:27.798
The higher socioeconomic status
people thought of more people,

00:09:27.822 --> 00:09:29.489
they thought of a broader network,

00:09:29.513 --> 00:09:33.697
they were positioning themselves
to bounce back from that setback.
