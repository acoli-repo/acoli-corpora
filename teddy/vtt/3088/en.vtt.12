It's "go to the coffee room."

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.678
When researchers talk about social hubs,

00:06:04.702 --> 00:06:08.513
what makes a social hub so special

you're going to meet in that place.

00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:17.637
And so with these social hubs,
the paradox is, interestingly enough,

00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:19.160
to get randomness,

00:06:19.184 --> 00:06:21.245
it requires, actually, some planning.

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:24.118
In one university that I worked at,

00:06:24.142 --> 00:06:26.645
there was a mail room
on every single floor.

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.324
What that meant is that the only people
who would bump into each other
