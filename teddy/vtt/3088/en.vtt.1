00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:35.269
They are sitting with their
favorite people in their favorite seats.

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:39.472
They find their twins,
they stay with them for the whole year.

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:44.826
Now, the danger of this
for my students is they're at risk

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.396
of leaving the university
with just a few people

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.741
who are exactly like them.

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:54.183
They're going to squander their chance
for an international, diverse network.

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:55.819
How could this happen to them?

00:00:55.843 --> 00:00:57.462
My students are open-minded.

00:00:57.486 --> 00:01:01.873
They come to business school precisely
so that they can get great networks.
