And what I want to encourage you
to do instead is to fight your filters.

00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:33.014
I want you to take a look
around this room,

00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:37.238
and I want you to identify
the least interesting person that you see,

00:04:37.262 --> 00:04:40.438
and I want you to connect with them
over the next coffee break.

00:04:40.462 --> 00:04:42.903
And I want you to go
even further than that.

00:04:42.927 --> 00:04:47.684
What I want you to do is find
the most irritating person you see as well

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:49.313
and connect with them.

00:04:49.337 --> 00:04:55.995
What you are doing with this exercise
is you are forcing yourself

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:58.644
to see what you don't want to see,

00:04:58.668 --> 00:05:01.334
to connect with who
you don't want to connect with,
