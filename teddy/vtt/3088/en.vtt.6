00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:01.144
and how can we be
a little bit more intentional

00:03:01.168 --> 00:03:03.449
about traveling our social universe?

00:03:03.854 --> 00:03:05.914
So let's look at the first strategy.

00:03:06.223 --> 00:03:12.559
The first strategy is to use
a more imperfect social search engine.

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:14.694
What I mean by a social search engine

00:03:14.718 --> 00:03:18.659
is how you are finding
and filtering your friends.

00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:21.300
And so people always tell me,

00:03:21.324 --> 00:03:23.364
"I want to get lucky through the network.

00:03:23.388 --> 00:03:26.299
I want to get a new job.
I want to get a great opportunity."

00:03:26.323 --> 00:03:28.304
And I say, "Well, that's really hard,

00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:31.580
because your networks
are so fundamentally predictable."
