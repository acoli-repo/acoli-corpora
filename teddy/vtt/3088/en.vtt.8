00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.613
It's efficient, but the problem is,
you're seeing exactly the same people.

00:04:00.637 --> 00:04:03.760
Make your network
slightly more inefficient.

00:04:03.784 --> 00:04:06.137
Go to a bathroom on a different floor.

00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:09.298
You encounter a whole new
network of people.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:14.328
The other side of it is how
we are actually filtering.

00:04:14.352 --> 00:04:15.985
And we do this automatically.

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.113
The minute we meet someone,
we are looking at them, we meet them,

00:04:19.137 --> 00:04:20.716
we are initially seeing,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.892
"You're interesting."

00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:24.015
"You're not interesting."
"You're relevant."

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.438
We do this automatically.
We can't even help it.

00:04:26.462 --> 00:04:30.457
And what I want to encourage you
to do instead is to fight your filters.
