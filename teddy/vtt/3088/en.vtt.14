in places where you get injections
of unpredictable diversity?

00:07:05.165 --> 00:07:07.836
And my students give me
some wonderful examples.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.694
They tell me when they're doing
pickup basketball games,

00:07:10.718 --> 00:07:13.607
or my favorite example
is when they go to a dog park.

00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:17.224
They tell me it's even better
than online dating when they're there.

00:07:17.248 --> 00:07:21.278
So the real thing that
I want you to think about

00:07:21.302 --> 00:07:23.359
is we've got to fight our filters.

00:07:23.383 --> 00:07:26.600
We've got to make ourselves
a little more inefficient,

00:07:26.624 --> 00:07:31.602
and by doing so, we are creating
a more imprecise social search engine.
