00:04:58.668 --> 00:05:01.334
to connect with who
you don't want to connect with,

00:05:01.358 --> 00:05:03.555
to widen your social world.

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:06.598
To truly widen, what we have to do is,

00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:08.937
we've got to fight our sense of choice.

00:05:08.961 --> 00:05:10.512
We've got to fight our choices.

00:05:10.536 --> 00:05:12.945
And my students hate this,
but you know what I do?

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.160

00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:22.143
so there are more accidental
bumps in the network

00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:24.866
where people get a chance
to connect with each other.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.524
And we studied exactly this kind
of an intervention at Harvard University.

00:05:29.548 --> 00:05:32.651
At Harvard, when you look at
the rooming groups,
