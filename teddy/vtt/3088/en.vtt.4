00:01:56.737 --> 00:02:00.816
this is when we really pay a price
for living in a clique.

00:02:01.294 --> 00:02:05.989
Mark Granovetter, the sociologist,
had a famous paper

00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:08.073
"The Strength of Weak Ties,"

00:02:08.097 --> 00:02:10.796
and what he did in this paper
is he asked people

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.721
how they got their jobs.

00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:15.900
And what he learned was that
most people don't get their jobs

00:02:15.924 --> 00:02:19.835
through their strong ties -- their father,
their mother, their significant other.

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.522
They instead get jobs through weak ties,
people who they just met.

00:02:24.546 --> 00:02:27.677
So if you think about what
the problem is with your strong ties,

00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:30.033
think about your
significant other, for example.
