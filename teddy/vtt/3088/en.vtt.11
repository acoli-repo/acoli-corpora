At Harvard, when you look at
the rooming groups,

00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:36.490
there's freshman rooming groups,
people are not choosing those roommates.

00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:39.283
They're of all different races,
all different ethnicities.

00:05:39.307 --> 00:05:42.311
Maybe people are initially uncomfortable
with those roommates,

00:05:42.335 --> 00:05:43.567
but the amazing thing is,

00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:45.617
at the end of a year with those students,

00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:49.068
they're able to overcome
that initial discomfort.

00:05:49.092 --> 00:05:52.956
They're able to find deep-level
commonalities with people.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.264
So the takeaway here is not just
"take someone out to coffee."

00:05:58.288 --> 00:05:59.582
It's a little more subtle.

00:05:59.606 --> 00:06:02.255
It's "go to the coffee room."
