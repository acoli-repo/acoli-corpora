00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.286
Don't they kind of look like you as well?

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.323
(Laughter)

00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:33.902
The muscle people are together,

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.943
and the people with the same hairstyles

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:37.194
and the checked shirts.

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.886
We all do this in life.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.622
We all do it in life, and in fact,
there's nothing wrong with this.

00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:47.494
It makes us comfortable to be
around people who are similar.

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:50.593
The problem is when
we're on a precipice, right?

00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:52.881
When we're in trouble,
when we need new ideas,

00:01:52.905 --> 00:01:56.713
when we need new jobs,
when we need new resources --

00:01:56.737 --> 00:02:00.816
this is when we really pay a price
for living in a clique.
