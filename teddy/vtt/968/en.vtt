00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I really consider myself a storyteller.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But I don't really tell stories in the usual way,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Instead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
large numbers of other people to tell their stories,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
people all around the world.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I think people are very similar,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but I also think that we have trouble seeing that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps,
