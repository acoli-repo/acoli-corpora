00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I am always thinking about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is what this session is about, which is called simplicity.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but in the best sense of the word.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm trying to figure out two very simple things:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
how to live and how to die, period.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That's all I'm trying to do, all day long.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal things

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that keep you grounded.
