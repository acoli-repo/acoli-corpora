The cortical homunculus is a model 
of the human body

00:02:30.994 --> 00:02:36.481
with proportions based on the size of each
body part’s representation in the cortex,

00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:41.406
The amount of cortex devoted 
to a specific body part can grow or shrink

00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:46.124
based on how much sensory input 
the brain receives from that body part.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:51.213
For example, representation of the left
hand is larger in violinists

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.693
than in non-violinists.

00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:56.377
The brain also increases 
cortical representation

00:02:56.377 --> 00:02:58.489
when a body part is injured

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.259
in order to heighten sensations 
that alert us to danger.
