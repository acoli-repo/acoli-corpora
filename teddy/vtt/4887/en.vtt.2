00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:01.593
the vast majority of them are painful.

00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:05.447
To fully understand phantom limbs 
and phantom pain,

00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:09.802
we have to consider the entire pathway 
from limb to brain.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:13.624
Our limbs are full of sensory neurons
responsible for everything

00:01:13.624 --> 00:01:16.082
from the textures we feel 
with our fingertips

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:20.048
to our understanding 
of where our bodies are in space.

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:24.342
Neural pathways carry this sensory input
through the spinal cord

00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:26.009
and up to the brain.

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.042
Since so much of this path 
lies outside the limb itself,
