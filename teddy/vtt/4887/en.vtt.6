00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.259
in order to heighten sensations 
that alert us to danger.

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.700
This increased representation 
can lead to phantom pain.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.617
The cortical map is also 
most likely responsible

00:03:09.617 --> 00:03:13.223
for the feeling of body parts 
that are no longer there,

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:16.505
because they still 
have representation in the brain.

00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:22.172
Over time, this representation may shrink
and the phantom limb may shrink with it.

00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:26.757
But phantom limb sensations 
don’t necessarily disappear on their own.

00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:29.632
Treatment for phantom pain 
usually requires

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:31.495
a combination of physical therapy,
