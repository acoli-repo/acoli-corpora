00:01:56.988 --> 00:02:00.957
For reasons we don’t fully understand,
after an amputation,

00:02:00.957 --> 00:02:05.623
there is a loss of this inhibitory
control in the dorsal horn,

00:02:05.623 --> 00:02:08.776
and signals can intensify.

00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:13.214
Once they pass through the spinal cord,
sensory signals reach the brain.

00:02:13.214 --> 00:02:17.194
There, the somatosensory cortex 
processes them.

00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:20.611
The entire body is mapped in this cortex.

00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:23.375
Sensitive body parts 
with many nerve endings,

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:25.136
like the lips and hands,

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:27.710
are represented by the largest areas.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.994
The cortical homunculus is a model 
of the human body
