00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.042
Since so much of this path 
lies outside the limb itself,

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:34.184
most of it remains 
behind after an amputation.

00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:35.623
But the loss of a limb

00:01:35.623 --> 00:01:40.260
alters the way signals travel 
at every step of the pathway.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.031
At the site of an amputation,

00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:46.264
severed nerve endings can thicken 
and become more sensitive,

00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:50.697
transmitting distress signals 
even in response to mild pressure.

00:01:50.697 --> 00:01:52.386
Under normal circumstances,

00:01:52.386 --> 00:01:56.988
these signals would be curtailed 
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.

00:01:56.988 --> 00:02:00.957
For reasons we don’t fully understand,
after an amputation,
