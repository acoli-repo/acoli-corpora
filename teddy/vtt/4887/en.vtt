00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.269
The vast majority of people 
who’ve lost a limb can still feel it—

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.976
not as a memory or vague shape,
but in complete lifelike detail.

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:19.438
They can flex their phantom fingers

00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:22.722
and sometimes even feel 
the chafe of a watchband

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:25.948
or the throb of an ingrown toenail.

00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:27.917
And astonishingly enough,

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:33.464
occasionally even people born 
without a limb can feel a phantom.
