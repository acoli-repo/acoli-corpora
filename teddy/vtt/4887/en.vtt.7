00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:31.495
a combination of physical therapy,

00:03:31.495 --> 00:03:33.302
medications for pain management,

00:03:33.302 --> 00:03:34.377
prosthetics,

00:03:34.377 --> 00:03:36.052
and time.

00:03:36.052 --> 00:03:38.301
A technique called mirror box therapy

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:41.368
can be very helpful in developing 
the range of motion

00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:43.967
and reducing pain in the phantom limb.

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:48.076
The patient places the phantom limb 
into a box behind a mirror

00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:50.699
and the intact limb 
in front of the mirror.

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.866
This tricks the brain 
into seeing the phantom

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.913
rather than just feeling it.

00:03:55.913 --> 00:03:59.045
Scientists are developing 
virtual reality treatments

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:03.726
that make the experience 
of mirror box therapy even more lifelike.
