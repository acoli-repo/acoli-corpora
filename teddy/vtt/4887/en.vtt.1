00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:33.464
occasionally even people born 
without a limb can feel a phantom.

00:00:33.464 --> 00:00:36.650
So what causes phantom limb sensations?

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.692
The accuracy of these apparitions

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:42.364
suggests that we have a map 
of the body in our brains.

00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:43.747
And the fact that it’s possible

00:00:43.747 --> 00:00:46.944
for someone who’s never had a limb 
to feel one

00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:51.607
implies we are born with at least 
the beginnings of this map.

00:00:51.607 --> 00:00:55.172
But one thing sets the phantoms
that appear after amputation

00:00:55.172 --> 00:00:58.459
apart from their flesh 
and blood predecessors:

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:01.593
the vast majority of them are painful.
