although a night in the Temple Bar
district can get pretty wild.

00:02:02.897 --> 00:02:04.245
(Laughter)

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:08.183
No, we do two important things
to make a place our own.

00:02:08.207 --> 00:02:11.259
First, we move along linear routes.

00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:13.753
Typically, we find a main street,

00:02:13.777 --> 00:02:17.347
and this main street becomes
a linear strip map in our minds.

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.594
But our mind keeps it pretty simple, yeah?

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:22.973
Every street is generally perceived
as a straight line,

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:26.729
and we kind of ignore the little twists
and turns that the streets make.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.560
When we do, however,
make a turn into a side street,

00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:34.874
our mind tends to adjust that turn
to a 90-degree angle.
