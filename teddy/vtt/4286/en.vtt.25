James wanted to use
bus rapid transport for that,

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.700
rather than light rail.

00:12:32.724 --> 00:12:34.851
For me, it was important

00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:39.273
that the vehicles that would run
on those rapid transport corridors

00:12:39.297 --> 00:12:43.713
would be visibly distinguishable
from local buses on the street.

00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:47.755
Now we could take out all the local buses

00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:50.852
that ran alongside
those rapid transport means.

00:12:50.876 --> 00:12:54.368
Any gaps that appeared
in the outskirts were filled again.

00:12:54.392 --> 00:12:57.605
So, in other words,
if there was a street in an outskirt

00:12:57.629 --> 00:13:00.692
where there had been a bus,
we put a bus back in,
