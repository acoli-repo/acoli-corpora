00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.242
What's more, we're all capable
of understanding the cognitive maps,

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:35.984
and you are all capable of creating
these cognitive maps yourselves.

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:39.601
So next time, when you want to tell
your friend how to get to your place,

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:44.393
you grab a beermat, grab a napkin,
and you just observe yourself

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:48.784
create this awesome piece
of communication design.

00:04:48.808 --> 00:04:50.220
It's got straight lines.

00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:52.722
It's got 90-degree corners.

00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:54.846
You might add little symbols
along the way.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.989
And when you look
at what you've just drawn,

00:04:59.013 --> 00:05:03.551
you realize it does not
resemble a street map.
