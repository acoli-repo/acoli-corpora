00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:31.900
Each individual route
is represented by a separate line.

00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:37.389
The map shows each and every station,

00:14:37.413 --> 00:14:40.718
each and every station name,

00:14:40.742 --> 00:14:44.992
and I'm also displaying side streets.

00:14:45.516 --> 00:14:48.997
In fact, most of the side streets
even with their name,

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:53.948
and for good measure,
also a couple of landmarks,

00:14:53.972 --> 00:14:56.146
some of them signified by little symbols,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.259
others by these isometric
three-dimensional

00:14:59.283 --> 00:15:01.281
bird's-eye-view drawings.
