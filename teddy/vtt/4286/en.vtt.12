00:05:56.624 --> 00:06:00.500
and changed the way public transport
maps are designed forever.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.965
Now the very key
to the success of this map

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:09.049
is in the omission
of less important information

00:06:09.073 --> 00:06:11.768
and in the extreme simplification.

00:06:11.792 --> 00:06:15.728
So, straightened streets,
corners of 90 and 45 degrees,

00:06:15.752 --> 00:06:21.872
but also the extreme geographic
distortion in that map.

00:06:21.896 --> 00:06:25.802
If you were to look at the actual
locations of these stations,

00:06:25.826 --> 00:06:27.841
you'd see they're very different.

00:06:28.493 --> 00:06:32.240
But this is all for the clarity
of the public Tube map.
