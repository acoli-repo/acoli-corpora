But this is all for the clarity
of the public Tube map.

00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:36.225
If you, say, wanted to get
from Regent's Park station

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:37.875
to Great Portland Street,

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:39.733
the Tube map would tell you:

00:06:39.757 --> 00:06:44.369
take the Tube, go to Baker Street,
change over, take another Tube.

00:06:44.393 --> 00:06:48.290
Of course, what you don't know
is that the two stations

00:06:48.314 --> 00:06:50.858
are only about a hundred meters apart.

00:06:50.882 --> 00:06:53.769
Now we've reached the subject
of public transport,

00:06:53.793 --> 00:06:56.837
and public transport here in Dublin

00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:58.844
is a somewhat touchy subject.

00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:01.147
