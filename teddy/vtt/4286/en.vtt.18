Now, the maps of Dublin transport
have gotten better,

00:09:05.122 --> 00:09:10.288
and after I finished the project,
they got a good bit better,

00:09:10.312 --> 00:09:12.808
but still no station names,
still no routes.

00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:19.485
So, being naive,
and being half-German, I decided,

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:22.025
"Aris, why don't you build your own map?"

00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:23.927
So that's what I did.

00:09:23.951 --> 00:09:29.939
I researched how each and every bus route
moved through the city, nice and logical,

00:09:29.963 --> 00:09:31.948
every bus route a separate line.
