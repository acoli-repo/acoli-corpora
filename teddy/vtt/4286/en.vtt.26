00:12:57.629 --> 00:13:00.692
where there had been a bus,
we put a bus back in,

00:13:00.716 --> 00:13:05.147
only now these buses wouldn't run
all the way to the city center,

00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:08.711
but connect to the nearest
rapid-transport mode,

00:13:08.735 --> 00:13:10.896
one of these thick lines over there.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.065
So the rest was merely
a couple of months of work,

00:13:14.089 --> 00:13:16.188
and a couple of fights with my girlfriend,

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:20.164
of our place constantly
being clogged up with maps,

00:13:20.188 --> 00:13:22.181
and the outcome, one of the outcomes,

00:13:22.205 --> 00:13:25.438
was this map of the Greater Dublin area.

00:13:25.462 --> 00:13:27.048
I'll zoom in a little bit.

00:13:28.548 --> 00:13:32.595
This map only shows the rapid
transport connections, no local bus,
