00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.785
What I do is I organize information.

00:00:01.809 --> 00:00:03.216
I'm a graphic designer.

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:06.285
Professionally, I try to make sense

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:09.914
often of things that don't
make much sense themselves.

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:14.052
So my father might not understand
what it is that I do for a living.

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:16.329
His part of my ancestry has been farmers.

00:00:16.353 --> 00:00:19.453
He's part of this ethnic minority
called the Pontic Greeks.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.392
They lived in Asia Minor
and fled to Greece after a genocide

00:00:24.416 --> 00:00:25.936
about a hundred years ago.

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:30.823
And ever since that, migration
has somewhat been a theme in my family.
