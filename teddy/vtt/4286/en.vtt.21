I can proudly say,
as a public transport map,

00:10:31.348 --> 00:10:35.280
this diagram is an utter failure.

00:10:35.304 --> 00:10:37.191
(Laughter)

00:10:37.215 --> 00:10:39.250
Except, probably, in one aspect:

00:10:39.274 --> 00:10:41.902
I now had a great visual representation

00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:45.798
of just how clogged up and overrun
the city center really was.

00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:49.147
Now, call me old-fashioned,

00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:52.654
but I think a public transport
route map should have lines,

00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:54.771
because that's what they are, yeah?

00:10:54.795 --> 00:10:58.011
They're little pieces of string
that wrap their way

00:10:58.035 --> 00:11:00.224
through the city center
or through the city.
