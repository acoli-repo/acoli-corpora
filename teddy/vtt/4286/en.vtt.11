00:05:33.582 --> 00:05:37.915
the pinnacle of showing everybody
how to get from A to B,

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:39.957
the London Underground map --

00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:44.294
was not designed by a cartographer
or a city planner;

00:05:44.318 --> 00:05:47.992
it was designed
by an engineering draftsman.

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:50.424
In the 1930s,

00:05:50.448 --> 00:05:56.600
Harry Beck applied the principles
of schematic diagram design

00:05:56.624 --> 00:06:00.500
and changed the way public transport
maps are designed forever.
