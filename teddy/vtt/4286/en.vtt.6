The cognitive map
in your mind may tell you,

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:04.679
"Aris, go back to the main
cathedral square,

00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:08.416
take a 90-degree turn
and walk down that other side street."

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.875
But somehow you feel adventurous that day,
and you suddenly discover

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:17.751
that the two spots were actually
only a single building apart.

00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:19.116
Now, I don't know about you,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.264
but I always feel
like I find this wormhole

00:03:21.288 --> 00:03:24.061
or this inter-dimensional portal.

00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:25.359
(Laughter)

00:03:25.383 --> 00:03:28.890
So we move along linear routes

00:03:28.914 --> 00:03:34.936
and our mind straightens streets
and perceives turns as 90-degree angles.
