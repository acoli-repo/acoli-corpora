00:11:28.182 --> 00:11:30.588
was the lack of a coherent
public transport map --

00:11:30.612 --> 00:11:33.329
a simplified, coherent
public transport map --

00:11:33.353 --> 00:11:36.768
because I think this is the crucial
step to understanding

00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:39.989
a public transport network
on a physical level,

00:11:40.013 --> 00:11:44.308
but it's also the crucial step to make
a public transport network mappable

00:11:44.332 --> 00:11:45.840
on a visual level.

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:50.249
So I teamed up with a gentleman
called James Leahy,

00:11:50.273 --> 00:11:53.584
a civil engineer and a recent
master's graduate

00:11:53.608 --> 00:11:56.918
of the Sustainable Development
program at DIT,

00:11:56.942 --> 00:12:01.245
and together we drafted
the simplified model network,
