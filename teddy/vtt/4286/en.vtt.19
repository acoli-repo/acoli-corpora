00:09:29.963 --> 00:09:31.948
every bus route a separate line.

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:36.035
I plotted it into my own map of Dublin,

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:38.646
and in the city center ...

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.300
I got a nice spaghetti plate.

00:09:40.324 --> 00:09:42.852
(Laughter)

00:09:42.876 --> 00:09:45.925
Now, this is a bit of a mess,

00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:48.099
so I decided, of course,

00:09:48.123 --> 00:09:51.678
"You're going to apply
the rules of schematic design,"

00:09:51.702 --> 00:09:53.563
cleaning up the corridors,

00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:56.342
widening the streets
where there were loads of buses

00:09:56.366 --> 00:10:01.151
and making the streets at straight,
90-degree corners, 45-degree corners
