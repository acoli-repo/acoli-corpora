00:08:00.295 --> 00:08:01.947
And like a pearl necklace,

00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:06.900
all the stations and stops are nicely
and neatly aligned along the line.

00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:13.243
And only then you start to discover
some local bus routes

00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:14.982
that would fill in the gaps,

00:08:15.006 --> 00:08:19.853
and that allow for those wormhole,
inter-dimensional portal shortcuts.

00:08:21.687 --> 00:08:25.079
So I tried to make sense,
and when I arrived,

00:08:25.103 --> 00:08:27.643
I was looking for some
information leaflets

00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:31.184
that would help me crack this system
and understand it,
