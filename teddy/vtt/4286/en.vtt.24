00:11:56.942 --> 00:12:01.245
and together we drafted
the simplified model network,

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:04.547
which I could then go ahead and visualize.

00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:06.602
So here's what we did.

00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:12.916
We distributed these rapid-transport
corridors throughout the city center,

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.355
and extended them into the outskirts.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:22.031
Rapid, because we wanted them to be served
by rapid-transport vehicles.

00:12:22.055 --> 00:12:25.965
They would get exclusive
road use, where possible,

00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:28.544
and it would be high-quantity,
high-quality transport.

00:12:28.568 --> 00:12:31.246
James wanted to use
bus rapid transport for that,
