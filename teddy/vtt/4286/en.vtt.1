00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:30.823
And ever since that, migration
has somewhat been a theme in my family.

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:35.348
My father moved to Germany,
studied there and married,

00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:39.800
and as a result, I now have
this half-German brain,

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:43.182
with all the analytical thinking
and that slightly dorky demeanor

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:45.185
that come with that.

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:48.295
And of course it meant
that I was a foreigner in both countries,

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.669
and that of course made it pretty easy
for me to migrate as well,

00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:55.116
in good family tradition, if you like.

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:58.997
But of course, most journeys
that we undertake from day to day

00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:00.647
are within a city.
