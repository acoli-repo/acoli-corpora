Once you find your base, your home,

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:37.321
you start to build this cognitive map
of your environment.

00:01:37.345 --> 00:01:41.233
It's essentially this virtual map
that only exists in your brain.

00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:43.018
All animal species do it,

00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:46.017
even though we all use
slightly different tools.

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:52.066
Us humans, of course, we don't move around
marking our territory by scent, like dogs.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.582
We don't run around emitting
ultrasonic squeaks, like bats.

00:01:57.606 --> 00:01:59.603
We just don't do that,

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:02.873
although a night in the Temple Bar
district can get pretty wild.
