00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:02.479
and make a public transport map
for the city center,

00:14:02.503 --> 00:14:05.599
one where I wouldn't just show
rapid transport connections,

00:14:05.623 --> 00:14:09.097
but also all the local bus routes,
streets and the likes,

00:14:09.121 --> 00:14:11.431
and this is what a map
like this could look like.

00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:13.042
I'll zoom in a little bit.

00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:20.968
In this map, I'm including
each transport mode,

00:14:20.992 --> 00:14:25.857
so rapid transport, bus,
DART, tram and the likes.

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:31.900
Each individual route
is represented by a separate line.
