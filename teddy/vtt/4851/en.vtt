Have you ever wondered what
happens to a painkiller, like ibuprofen,

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:11.964
after you swallow it?

00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:14.972
Medicine that slides down

00:00:14.972 --> 00:00:16.054

00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:27.445

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:31.145
before it's snared by organs
and molecules designed to neutralize
