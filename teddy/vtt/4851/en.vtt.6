00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.109
but they're averages based on 
a sample population

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.933
that doesn't represent every consumer.

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:05.201
And getting the dose right is important.

00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.989
If it's too low, 
the medicine won't do its job.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.210
If it's too high, the drug 
and its metabolites can be toxic.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.151
That's true of any drug.

00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:18.350
One of the hardest groups of patients
to get the right dosage for are children.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.930
That's because how they process medicine
changes quickly, as do their bodies.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.629
For instance, the level of liver enzymes
that neutralize medication

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.781
highly fluctuates 
during infancy and childhood.

00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:32.590
And that's just one 
of many complicating factors.
