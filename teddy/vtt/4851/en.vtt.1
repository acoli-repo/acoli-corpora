00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:31.145
before it's snared by organs
and molecules designed to neutralize

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:33.926
and expel foreign substances.

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:36.605
This process starts 
in your digestive system.

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:40.845
Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet
for a sore ankle.

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:44.125
Within minutes, the tablet starts
disintegrating in the acidic fluids

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:45.736
of your stomach.

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:48.552
The dissolved ibuprofen travels
into the small intestine

00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:53.276
and then across the intestinal wall
into a network of blood vessels.

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:56.005
These blood vessels feed into a vein,

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.845
which carries the blood,
and anything in it, to the liver.

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:02.526
The next step is to make 
it through the liver.
