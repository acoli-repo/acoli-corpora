00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:00.859
that help the body transmit pain signals.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.758
As more drug molecules accumulate,

00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:05.388
the pain-cancelling affect increases,

00:02:05.388 --> 00:02:09.084
reaching a maximum within about
one or two hours.

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:11.948
Then the body starts efficiently 
eliminating ibuprofen,

00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:16.299
with the blood dose decreasing by half
every two hours on average.

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.238
When the ibuprofen molecules detach
from their targets,

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:22.828
the systemic blood stream carries
them away again.

00:02:22.828 --> 00:02:26.412
Back in the liver, another small fraction
of the total amount of the drug

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:29.169
gets transformed into metabolites,

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.728
which are eventually filtered out
by the kidneys in the urine.
