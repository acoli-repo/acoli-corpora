00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:32.590
And that's just one 
of many complicating factors.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.461
Genetics,

00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:34.201
age,

00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:34.941
diet,

00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:35.685
disease,

00:03:35.685 --> 00:03:40.700
and even pregnancy influence the body's
efficiency of processing medicine.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.841
Some day, routine DNA tests may be able
to dial in the precise dose of medicine

00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:49.570
personalized to your liver efficiency
and other factors,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.702
but in the meantime,

00:03:50.702 --> 00:03:52.341
your best bet is reading the label

00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:54.263
or consulting your doctor
or pharmacist,

00:03:54.263 --> 00:03:57.922
and taking the recommended amounts
with the recommended timing.
