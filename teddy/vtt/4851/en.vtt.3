00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.206
into the body's circulatory system.

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:32.176
Half an hour after you swallow the pill,

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:36.987
some of the dose has already made it
into the circulatory blood stream.

00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:39.698
This blood loop travels through every
limb and organ,

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:44.674
including the heart, brain, kidneys,
and back through the liver.

00:01:44.674 --> 00:01:47.218
When ibuprofen molecules 
encounter a location

00:01:47.218 --> 00:01:50.084
where the body's pain 
response is in full swing,

00:01:50.084 --> 00:01:54.611
they bind to specific target molecules
that are a part of that reaction.

00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:57.681
Painkillers, like ibuprofen, block the
production of compounds

00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:00.859
that help the body transmit pain signals.
