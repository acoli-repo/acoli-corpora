00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:02.526
The next step is to make 
it through the liver.

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:07.775
As the blood and the drug molecules
in it travel through liver blood vessels,

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:11.195
enzymes attempt to react with 
the ibuprofen molecules

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:13.305
to neutralize them.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:16.769
The damaged ibuprofen molecules,
called metabolites,

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:19.837
may no longer be effective as painkillers.

00:01:19.837 --> 00:01:24.396
At this stage, most of the ibuprofen
makes it through the liver unscathed.

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:26.527
It continues its journey out of the liver,

00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:27.766
through veins,

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.206
into the body's circulatory system.
