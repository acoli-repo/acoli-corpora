00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.728
which are eventually filtered out
by the kidneys in the urine.

00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:35.530
The loop from liver to body to kidneys
continues at a rate

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.220
of about one blood cycle per minute,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.398
with a little more of the drug neutralized
and filtered out in each cycle.

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:45.570
These basic steps are the same for
any drug that you take orally,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.119
but the speed of the process

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.086
and the amount of medicine that makes
it into your blood stream

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.538
varies based on drug,

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:52.456
person,

00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:54.709
and how it gets into the body.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.320
The dosing instructions 
on medicine labels can help,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.109
but they're averages based on 
a sample population
