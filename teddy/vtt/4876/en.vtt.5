00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.620
The word cemetery, or “sleeping chamber,”

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.040
was first used by ancient Greeks,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.960
who built tombs in graveyards

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.470
at the edges of their cities.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.016
In medieval European cities,

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:44.256
Christian churchyards provided 
rare, open spaces

00:02:44.256 --> 00:02:45.646
that accommodated the dead,

00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:49.106
but also hosted markets, fairs, 
and other events.

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:51.046
Farmers even grazed cattle in them,

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:55.006
believing graveyard grass made 
for sweeter milk.

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:58.066
As cities grew during the industrial 
revolution,

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:03.426
large suburban cemeteries replaced 
smaller urban churchyards.
