00:03:57.396 --> 00:04:00.386
Cities like London, New York, and 
Hong Kong

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.636
are running out of burial space.

00:04:02.636 --> 00:04:05.286
Even in places where space isn’t so tight,

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.656
cemeteries permanently occupy land

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:10.776
that can’t be otherwise cultivated 
or developed.

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:13.426
Traditional burial consumes materials

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:16.465
like metal, stone, and concrete,

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:21.045

people are seeking alternatives.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:29.745
Many are turning to cremation and 
related practices.

00:04:29.745 --> 00:04:31.985
Along with these more conventional 
practices,
