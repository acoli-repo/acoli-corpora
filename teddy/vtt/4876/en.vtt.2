Still others were sunk in lakes,

00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:02.181
put out to sea,

00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:04.041
ritually cannibalized,

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.831
or cremated.

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.581
All of these practices,

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.691
though some may seem strange today,

00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.228
were ways of venerating the dead.

00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:14.858
By contrast, the first known burials

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:17.318

00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:19.848
were likely reserved for transgressors,

00:01:19.848 --> 00:01:22.308
excluding them from the usual rites

00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:24.708
intended to honor the dead.

00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:28.758
But the first burials revealed some
advantages over other practices:

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:32.098
they protected bodies from scavengers 
and the elements,
