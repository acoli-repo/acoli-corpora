00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:32.255
How did our cemeteries 
become what they are today?

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:34.485
Some have been around for centuries,

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:37.495
like the world’s largest, Wadi al-Salaam,

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.535
where more than five million 
people are buried.

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:44.598
But most of the places we’d recognize 
as cemeteries are much younger.

00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:46.458
In fact, for much of human history,

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:48.798
we didn’t bury our dead at all.

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:53.468
Our ancient ancestors had many other ways 
of parting with the dead loved ones.

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:55.451
Some were left in caves,

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:56.791
others in trees

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.601
or on mountaintops.

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:00.811
Still others were sunk in lakes,
