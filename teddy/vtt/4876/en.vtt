00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:09.205
Spindly trees,

00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:11.015
rusted gates,

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:13.195
crumbling stone,

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:15.425
a solitary mournerâ€”

00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:18.955
these things come to mind 
when we think of cemeteries.

00:00:18.955 --> 00:00:20.355
But not so long ago,

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.945
many burial grounds were lively places,

00:00:22.945 --> 00:00:25.955
with blooming gardens and crowds of people

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:29.105
strolling among the headstones.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:32.255
How did our cemeteries 
become what they are today?
