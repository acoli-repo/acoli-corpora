People visited cemeteries for funerals,

00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:32.686
but also for anniversaries, holidays,

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:36.066
or simply an afternoon outdoors.

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:41.077
By the late 19th century, as more public 
parks and botanical gardens appeared,

00:03:41.077 --> 00:03:43.497
cemeteries began to lose visitors.

00:03:43.497 --> 00:03:47.346
Today, many old cemeteries are 
lonely places.

00:03:47.346 --> 00:03:50.086
Some are luring visitors back with tours,

00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:52.336
concerts, and other attractions.

00:03:52.336 --> 00:03:54.616
But even as we revive old cemeteries,

00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:57.396
we’re rethinking the future of burial.
