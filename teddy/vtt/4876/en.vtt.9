Along with these more conventional 
practices,

00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:34.835
people can now have their remains 
shot into space,

00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:36.995
used to fertilize a tree,

00:04:36.995 --> 00:04:38.405
or made into jewelry,

00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:39.595
fireworks,

00:04:39.595 --> 00:04:42.095
and even tattoo ink.

00:04:42.102 --> 00:04:46.602
In the future, options like these may 
replace burial completely.

00:04:46.602 --> 00:04:50.572
Cemeteries may be our most familiar 
monuments to the departed,

00:04:50.572 --> 00:04:52.382
but they’re just one step

00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:54.312
in our ever-evolving process

00:04:54.312 --> 00:04:57.382
of remembering and honoring the dead.
