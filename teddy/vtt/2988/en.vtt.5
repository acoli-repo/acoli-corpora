00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.496
I chanced giving the two large suitcases
sitting atop the force field a shove.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.576
They moved smoothly,
and I breathed another sigh of relief.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.600
At least some luck was on my side.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.776
So, in a distant future part of Africa,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.576
Binti is a mathematical genius
of the Himba ethnic group.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.296
She's been accepted
into a university on another planet,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.720
and she's decided to go.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.936
Carrying the blood
of her people in her veins,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.736
adorned with the teachings,
ways, even the land on her very skin,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.280
Binti leaves the earth.
