00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.696
I swiped otjize from my forehead
with my index finger and knelt down,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.576
then I touched the finger to the sand,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.056
grounding the sweet-smelling
red clay into it.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.960
"Thank you," I whispered.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.016
It was a half-mile walk
along the dark desert road.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.800
With the transporter working
I would make it there on time.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.816
Straightening up,
I paused and shut my eyes.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.736
Now, the weight of my entire life
was pressing on my shoulders.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.976
I was defying the most traditional
part of myself for the first time

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.576
in my entire life.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.736
I was leaving in the dead of night,
and they had no clue.
