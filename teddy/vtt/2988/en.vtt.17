African science fiction's blood runs deep

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.360
and it's old,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.216
and it's ready to come forth,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.816
and when it does,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.760
imagine the new technologies, ideas
and sociopolitical changes it'll inspire.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.520

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.040
What if?

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.000
It's a powerful question.
