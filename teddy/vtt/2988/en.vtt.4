00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.016
would shout and gossip amongst themselves

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.720
about how I had scandalized
the entire bloodline.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.960
I was going to be a pariah.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.735
"Go," I softly whispered
to the transporter,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.576
stamping my foot.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.816
The thin metal rings I wore
around each ankle jingled noisily,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.400
but I stamped my foot again.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.776
Once on, the transporter worked best
when I didn't touch it.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.840
"Go," I said again,
sweat forming on my brow.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.856
When nothing moved,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.496
I chanced giving the two large suitcases
sitting atop the force field a shove.
