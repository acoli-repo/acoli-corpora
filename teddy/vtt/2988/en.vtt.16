00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.136
Change begets change.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.960
The alien Ayodele knew it.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.560
All her people know it.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.056
So, this is a voice of Udide,
the supreme spider artist,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.416
who is older than dirt

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.016
and lives in the dirt
beneath the city of Lagos,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.976
listening and commenting

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.320
and weaving the story
of extraterrestrials coming to Lagos.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.856
In the end, the great spider
who was the size of a house

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.816
and responsible for weaving
the past, present and future

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.559
decides to come forth
and be a part of the story.
