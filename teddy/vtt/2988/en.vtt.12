00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.216
I started noticing
the role of technology in Nigeria:

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.096
cable TV and cell phones in the village,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.896
419 scammers occupying the cybercafes,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.336
the small generator connected
to my cousin's desktop computer

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.640
because the power
was always going on and off.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.136
And my Americanness othered me enough

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.120
to be intrigued by these things
that most Nigerians saw as normal.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.320
My intrigue eventually
gave birth to stories.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.480
I started opening strange doors.
