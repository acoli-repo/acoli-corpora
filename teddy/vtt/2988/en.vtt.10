00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.336
but because of blood that runs deep,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.976
family, cultural conflict

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.640
and the need to see an African girl
leave the planet on her own terms.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.616
My science fiction
had different ancestors,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.840
African ones.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.696
So I'm Nigerian-American.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.216
I was born to two
Nigerian immigrant parents

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.376
and raised in the United States,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.096
one of the birthplaces
of classic science fiction.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.416
However, it was my Nigerian heritage
that led me to write science fiction.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.960
Specifically I cite those family trips
to Nigeria in the late '90s.
