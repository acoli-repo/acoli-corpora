How can the audience
experience this differently?

00:08:00.838 --> 00:08:02.726
In order to [create] our explorations,

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.566
we partnered with Paramount Pictures

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.641
in order to explore immersive media
in a Hollywood movie production.

00:08:09.109 --> 00:08:11.253
Together with the director Randal Kleiser,

00:08:11.277 --> 00:08:16.085
we reimagined the iconic movie of 1978,

00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:17.460
"Grease."

00:08:17.484 --> 00:08:19.862
Some of you know it, some of you don't.

00:08:19.886 --> 00:08:22.982
A 40-year-old movie, amazing experience.

00:08:23.454 --> 00:08:29.890
And our goal was really to look at how 
we can take this iconic action and dance

00:08:29.914 --> 00:08:32.589
and bring it deeper into the experience,
