Broadway stage.

00:05:05.397 --> 00:05:07.455
We call it Intel Studios,

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.476
and it's the largest volumetric
stage in the world,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.054
with the objective
of enabling and exploring

00:05:14.078 --> 00:05:17.121
the next generation
of this immersive media filmmaking.

00:05:18.498 --> 00:05:20.855

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.472
So we chose the Western scene.
