00:07:29.066 --> 00:07:30.462
(Horse galloping)

00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:33.755
So what you're seeing right now
is the same action,

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:37.200
but this time, we're watching
exactly from the eyes of the horse.

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:40.882
The possibilities are, well, unlimited.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.361
(Applause)

00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:43.544
Thank you.

00:07:43.568 --> 00:07:46.975
(Applause)

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:51.086
So this is all great
for creators and storytellers.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.122
It really opens a huge canvas

00:07:53.146 --> 00:07:56.102
for a different type
of storytelling and moviemaking.

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:57.621
But what about the audience?

00:07:57.645 --> 00:08:00.221
How can the audience
experience this differently?
