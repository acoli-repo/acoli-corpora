00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:31.011
For the last three years,

00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:35.432
we have been building
a huge volumetric camera chamber.

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.210
It's 10,000 square feet of a stage,

00:04:39.234 --> 00:04:42.424
enabling to capture the action
from any location.

00:04:43.184 --> 00:04:45.266
We have deployed hundreds of cameras,

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.806
sending a tremendous amount of information

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.734
to a huge data center
powered by Intel supercomputers.

00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:56.059
The ability to have this 10,000 feet

00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:59.445
enables us to fit any kind of action,

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:00.921
any kind of performance.
