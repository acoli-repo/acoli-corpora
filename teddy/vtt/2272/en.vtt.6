WEBVTT

00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:00.558
capturing the light
from multiple perspectives,

00:03:00.582 --> 00:03:02.502
enabling us to reconstruct the object.

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.716
This is like photography in 3D space.

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:09.132
Now, with these
technological advancements,

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:12.553
we can record video
not just as a flat image

00:03:12.577 --> 00:03:14.069
but as a volume.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.989
This is what we call "volumetric video,"

00:03:17.013 --> 00:03:20.608
and it has the capability
to record every action of the scene

00:03:20.632 --> 00:03:22.433
as a full three-dimensional volume.

00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:25.282
Now, what is a voxel?

00:03:26.193 --> 00:03:29.296
A voxel is like a three-dimensional pixel,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.616
but instead of being a flat image square,
staying light and colored,
