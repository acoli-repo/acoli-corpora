00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:01.490
(Music, sounds of combat)

00:07:01.514 --> 00:07:03.312
of space and time.

00:07:03.336 --> 00:07:10.336
(Music, sounds of combat)

00:07:14.358 --> 00:07:17.169
Now, again, no physical camera was here.

00:07:17.193 --> 00:07:19.867
Everything was captured surrounding.

00:07:19.891 --> 00:07:22.042
Now, this is very nice,

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:26.301
but what if we wanted to see the scene,
maybe, from the eyes of the horse?

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:29.042
Well, we can do that as well.

00:07:29.066 --> 00:07:30.462
