How can we start creating content

00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:03.264
for the next generation
of content experiences?

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.248
Traditionally, when we imagine a scene,

00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:09.446
we look at the frame and the composition.

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:13.428
We have to think about how we create
depth and parallax

00:01:13.452 --> 00:01:17.857
using foreground, background elements
as the camera moves.

00:01:18.354 --> 00:01:21.965
With the technology today
and devices of VR glasses,

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:24.785
AR glasses, smart devices,

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:28.700
allowing three-dimensional
and full navigation in space,

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:31.220
we have the possibility
to enable audiences
