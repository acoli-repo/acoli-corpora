00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.616
but instead of being a flat image square,
staying light and colored,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.901
it's like a three-dimensional
cube in space,

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:40.328
with x, y, and z positions.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.810
This enables us to create
a full capture of the scene

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:46.142
from any perspective.

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:51.889
Now this renders
a fully light-immersive scene

00:03:51.913 --> 00:03:53.985
from multiple perspectives.

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:58.929
This capability requires an insane amount
of information to be processed.

00:03:58.953 --> 00:04:03.866
We will have to capture the light
from an enormous amount of cameras
