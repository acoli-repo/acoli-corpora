00:01:58.127 --> 00:02:02.104
We have to start thinking
how we capture the actors

00:02:02.128 --> 00:02:04.380
and how we capture the real scene

00:02:04.404 --> 00:02:06.350
in order to immerse inside.

00:02:06.374 --> 00:02:09.675
Now, we're familiar
with the 360-degree video,

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.215
where you place a camera inside the scene

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.993
and you can create this beautiful
panoramic image all around you,

00:02:16.017 --> 00:02:17.557
but from the same aspect,

00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:19.770
filmmaking is still frontal.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:23.259
In order to emerge fully inside the scene,

00:02:23.283 --> 00:02:27.327
we will need to capture the light
from all the possible directions.

00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:32.057
We will have to surround the scene
with an enormous amount of sensors,
