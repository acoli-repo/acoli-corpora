00:00:00.775 --> 00:00:02.541
I love making movies.

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:09.373
Motion pictures have been in existence
for more than a hundred years.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.029
Filmmaking hasn't changed
for the dimensional mindset.

00:00:15.092 --> 00:00:19.430
Placing the camera in a scene
and pressing "record" hasn't changed.

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:22.699
Filmmaking is still a frontal experience,

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:25.859
and creating the film has the possibility

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:30.062
to follow the same direction
of the content creation.
