(Applause and cheers)

00:10:33.881 --> 00:10:35.214
Diego Prilusky: Thank you.

00:10:35.238 --> 00:10:37.485
(Applause and cheers)

00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:38.801
So as you can see,

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:43.961
we can watch and experience content
in the traditional way

00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:45.189
or in an immersive way.

00:10:46.014 --> 00:10:47.926
Really, the possibilities are open.

00:10:48.705 --> 00:10:52.157
We're not trying to change
or replace movies.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.348
We're enhancing them.

00:10:54.372 --> 00:10:59.189
The technologies enable new possibilities
to start thinking beyond the flat screen.
