00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:32.057
We will have to surround the scene
with an enormous amount of sensors,

00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:35.908
with all possible capabilities
to capture the light

00:02:35.932 --> 00:02:38.464
and enable us to emerge
inside afterwards again.

00:02:39.908 --> 00:02:41.226
Now, in this setup,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.774
there's no more foreground or background

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:45.490
or a camera placed in space

00:02:45.514 --> 00:02:49.031
but hundreds of sensors
capturing the light

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:51.911
and capturing the motion
from all the possible directions.

00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:55.099
With the new technological advancements,

00:02:55.123 --> 00:02:57.687
we can start looking at 3D photography,

00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:00.558
capturing the light
from multiple perspectives,
