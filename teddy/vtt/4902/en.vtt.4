00:01:59.658 --> 00:02:02.188
But if all three combinations fail,

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:07.278
then you’ll know this group has either 
one good battery, or none at all.

00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:09.593
Now you can set those three aside

00:02:09.593 --> 00:02:12.763
and repeat the process for 
another three batteries.

00:02:12.763 --> 00:02:16.543
You might get a match, but if every 
combination fails again,

00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:20.253
you’ll know this set can have 
no more than one good battery.

00:02:20.253 --> 00:02:23.153
That would leave only two 
batteries untried.

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:25.483
Since there are four good 
batteries in total

00:02:25.483 --> 00:02:28.263
and you’ve only accounted for two so far,

00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:31.103
both of these remaining ones must be good.
