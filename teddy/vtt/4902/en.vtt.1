and 4 dead ones in separate piles,

00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:34.771
but it looks like the baby giant 
mixed them all up.

00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.561
You need to get the iron working 
and press the giant shirt, fast –

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:41.751
or you’ll end up being the 
main course tonight!

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:43.401
How can you test the batteries

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:48.371
so that you’re guaranteed to get 
a working pair in 7 tries or less?

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:52.001
Pause the video now if you want to 
figure it out for yourself

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:53.041
Answer in 3

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:54.201

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:55.661
Answer in 1

00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:57.863
You could, of course, take 
all eight batteries

00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:01.163
and begin testing the 28 
possible combinations.
