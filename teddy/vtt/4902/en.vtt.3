00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.630
That doesn’t help you right away,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.200
since testing all six batteries could 
still take as many as 15 tries.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.199
But it does give you 
a clue to the solution –

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:43.709
dividing the batteries into smaller 
subsets narrows down the possible results.

00:01:43.718 --> 00:01:45.698
So instead of six batteries,

00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:47.628
let’s take any three.

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:51.298
This group has a total of three 
possible combinations.

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:54.768
Since both batteries have to be 
working for the iron to power up,

00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:59.658
a single failure can’t tell you whether 
both batteries are dead, or just one.

00:01:59.658 --> 00:02:02.188
But if all three combinations fail,
