00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:01.163
and begin testing the 28 
possible combinations.

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:03.783
You might get lucky within 
the first few tries.

00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:07.133
But if you don’t, moving the giant 
batteries that many times

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.893
will take way too long.

00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:10.413
You can’t rely on luck –

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:14.963
you need to assume the worst 
possibility and plan accordingly.

00:01:14.963 --> 00:01:19.801
However, you don’t actually need 
to test every possible combination.

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:23.320
Remember – there are four 
good batteries in total,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.060
meaning that any pile of six you choose

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.950
will have at least two 
good batteries in it.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.630
That doesn’t help you right away,
