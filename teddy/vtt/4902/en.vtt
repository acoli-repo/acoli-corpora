The family of giants you work for

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:12.431
is throwing a fancy dinner party,

00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:14.751
and they all want to look their best.

00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:16.021
But there’s a problem –

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:19.241
the elder giant’s favorite 
shirt is wrinkled!

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:21.631
To fix it, you’ll need to power up…

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:23.881
the Giant Iron.

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.921
The iron needs two giant 
batteries to work.

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:28.771
You just had 4 working ones

00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:31.511
and 4 dead ones in separate piles,
