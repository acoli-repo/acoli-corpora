00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:04.212
I have the answer to a question that we've all asked.

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:05.329
The question is,

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:07.613
Why is it that the letter X

00:00:07.613 --> 00:00:09.611
represents the unknown?

00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:12.578
Now I know we learned that in math class,

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:14.329
but now it's everywhere in the culture --

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.130
The X prize, the X-Files,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.053
Project X, TEDx.

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:23.048
Where'd that come from?

00:00:23.048 --> 00:00:24.266
About six years ago

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.982
I decided that I would learn Arabic,

00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:30.934
which turns out to be a supremely logical language.
