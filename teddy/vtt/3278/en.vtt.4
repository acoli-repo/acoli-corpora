00:01:59.835 --> 00:02:01.002
There, I said it.

00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:03.465
Because, you know,
we have this culture inferiority,

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:06.775
which means that anything
that comes from us is not good enough.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.244
But you know, in my situation,

00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:13.537
and because I was raised to criticize
by creating, it's Michelangelos.

00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:15.887
My father said, "Do not
come to me with problems

00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:17.968
unless you thought
of a couple alternatives.

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:19.355
They don't have to be right,

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.958
but I just want to know
that you thought of something."

00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:25.704
So, I have this attitude in life --
something is wrong, find a way to fix it.

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:28.141
And that's why I start
the businesses that I start,

00:02:28.165 --> 00:02:29.673
that's usually consumer brands,

00:02:29.697 --> 00:02:32.650
that have embedded in them
the very best of my African culture.
