00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.219
Come from where?

00:03:31.627 --> 00:03:33.571
Businesses, thank you.

00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:38.135
Now, if jobs is what fixes poverty,

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.553
and jobs come from businesses,

00:03:40.577 --> 00:03:41.951
don't you think --

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:45.295
especially, they come from small
and medium size enterprises, SMEs --

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.296
then don't you think, maybe for a second,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.253
that we should focus on making it easy
for a small-business person

00:03:52.277 --> 00:03:53.832
to start and run their business?

00:03:53.856 --> 00:03:55.610
Don't you think that it makes sense?

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:58.626
Why is it that when I look
at the Doing Business index ranking

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.808
of the World Bank,

00:03:59.832 --> 00:04:02.521
that ranks every country in the world
