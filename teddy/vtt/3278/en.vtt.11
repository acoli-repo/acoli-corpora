00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:30.460
She said, "I'm crying
because I had come to believe --

00:05:30.484 --> 00:05:32.650
always seeing us
represented as poor people --

00:05:32.674 --> 00:05:37.063
I had come to believe that maybe,
yes, maybe we are inferior.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:39.491
Because, otherwise, how do you explain

00:05:39.515 --> 00:05:42.273
that we're always
in the begging situation?"

00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:44.101
That's what broke my heart.

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.037
But at the same time that she said that,

00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:48.744
because of how I explained
just what I explained to you,

00:05:48.768 --> 00:05:51.267
she said, "But now, I know
that I am not the problem.

00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:54.052
It is my environment in which I live,
that's my problem."

00:05:54.076 --> 00:05:55.861
I said, "Yes."

00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:58.033
And that's what gave me hope --

00:05:58.057 --> 00:06:01.585
that once people get it,
they now change their outlook on life.
