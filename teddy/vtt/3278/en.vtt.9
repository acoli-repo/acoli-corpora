00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:32.523
Did you know that for all my raw material
that I can't find in the country,

00:04:32.547 --> 00:04:35.728
I have to pay a 45 percent tariff
on everything that comes in?

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:38.058
Forty-five percent tariff.

00:04:39.217 --> 00:04:41.863
Do you know that,
even to look for fine cardboard

00:04:41.887 --> 00:04:43.974
to ship my finished products to the US,

00:04:43.998 --> 00:04:45.997
I can't find new, finished cardboard?

00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:47.212
Impossible.

00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:49.678
Because the distributors
are not going to come here

00:04:49.702 --> 00:04:50.942
to start their business,

00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:52.642
because it makes no sense, either.

00:04:52.666 --> 00:04:55.761
So right now, I have to mobilize
3000 dollars' worth of cardboard

00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:57.968
in my warehouse,
so that I can have cardboard,

00:04:57.992 --> 00:05:00.092
and they won't arrive
for another five weeks.
