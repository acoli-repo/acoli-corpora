00:06:28.864 --> 00:06:30.132
What are you doing?

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:31.307
(Applause)

00:06:31.331 --> 00:06:33.419
And as for you,
everybody here in this room,

00:06:33.443 --> 00:06:35.260
I leave you with two marching orders.

00:06:35.284 --> 00:06:36.459
Get in the game,

00:06:36.483 --> 00:06:38.672
and the way you get in it
is educate yourself,

00:06:38.696 --> 00:06:40.237
build awareness around yourself,

00:06:40.261 --> 00:06:43.212
and then also advocate
for e-government solutions.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.117
He said, "Oh, corruption,
how do we fight corruption?"

00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:48.379
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm here to tell you

00:06:48.403 --> 00:06:50.617
that yes, you can do it
by the stroke of a pen.

00:06:50.641 --> 00:06:53.934
You do not need anyone to tell you
when and how to do that.

00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.201
It is one thing, actually,

00:06:55.225 --> 00:06:58.164
that you don't need to wait
for anyone to do, so do it.

00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:01.466
Otherwise, don't come and tell me
that you want to fix corruption.
