00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:01.466
Otherwise, don't come and tell me
that you want to fix corruption.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.197
You and your other 50 friends
from the other 50 countries

00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:05.982
that are at the bottom of that list.

00:07:06.006 --> 00:07:08.371
That's how you fight corruption.

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:11.721
If you were only charging me 5 percent
to get my stuff in the country,

00:07:11.745 --> 00:07:12.903
my raw material,

00:07:12.927 --> 00:07:14.212
instead of the 45 percent,

00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:16.974
do you really think
that I would have to go a pay a bribe?

00:07:16.998 --> 00:07:18.776
That's what breeds corruption.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.252
Bad laws, sets of horrible, nonsense laws.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.664
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:07:25.688 --> 00:07:26.839
Right?

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:32.172
(Applause)
