00:02:57.371 --> 00:03:00.436
They're leaving because they have no jobs.

00:03:01.093 --> 00:03:03.831
They're leaving because
where they are, there's no jobs.

00:03:03.855 --> 00:03:05.005
So ...

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:12.953
But poverty, that's really striking them,
is the root cause of why they're leaving.

00:03:12.977 --> 00:03:15.000
Now, why are people poor?

00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:17.073
People are poor
because they have no money.

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:19.723
You have no money
because you have no source of income.

00:03:19.747 --> 00:03:21.974
And for most of us,
what is a source of income?

00:03:21.998 --> 00:03:25.156
For most of us, what is our
source of income, what is it, tell me?

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.331
Jobs, thank you.

00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:27.654
Where do jobs come from?

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.219
Come from where?
