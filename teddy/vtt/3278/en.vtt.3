00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:34.907
Sometimes I hear stories
of bodies that fall off an airplane.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.006
Somebody hid in
the landing gear of a plane

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.712
or in the cargo section of a plane,

00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:42.719
and then you find them frozen to death.

00:01:44.346 --> 00:01:47.992
Wouldn't you be haunted if, like me,
from the moment you were a little girl,

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:50.779
you hear these stories
and they keep repeating themselves,

00:01:50.803 --> 00:01:51.978
over and over and over?

00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:53.502
Wouldn't you be haunted?

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:55.138
That's my case.

00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:58.540
And at the same time, you know,
as my people are dying,

00:01:58.564 --> 00:01:59.811
my culture is also dying.

00:01:59.835 --> 00:02:01.002
There, I said it.
