00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:03.656
Do you really think
that's the best we can do?

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.147
To serve as fish food?

00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:08.903
And for those of them
who are trying to migrate to Europe --

00:01:08.927 --> 00:01:10.649
because that's what it is all about,

00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:13.062
they are trying to migrate
to Europe to find a job.

00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:14.353
Going through Libya.

00:01:15.498 --> 00:01:18.864
Do you know what happens to us
when we're trying to cross through Libya

00:01:18.888 --> 00:01:20.426
and we're trapped over there?

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.124
Well, we're being sold as slaves.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.847
For 300 dollars,
maybe sometimes 500 dollars.
