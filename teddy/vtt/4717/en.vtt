00:00:07.098 --> 00:00:09.959
What if you could only see one color?

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:11.584
Imagine, for instance,

00:00:11.584 --> 00:00:13.738
that you could only see things that were red

00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:14.869
and that everything else

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.106
was completely invisible to you.

00:00:17.106 --> 00:00:18.139
As it turns out,

00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:20.414
that's how you live your life all the time

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:21.919
because your eyes can only see

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.084
a minuscule part of the full spectrum of light.

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:28.183
Different kinds of light are all around you everyday

00:00:28.183 --> 00:00:30.101
but are invisible to the human eye,
