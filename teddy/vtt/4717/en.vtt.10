00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:00.144
missions that can each see part

00:05:00.144 --> 00:05:01.780
of the full spectrum of light.

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.862
With telescopes acting as our virtual eyes,

00:05:04.862 --> 00:05:06.610
both in space and here on Earth,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.260
we can see some amazing things.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.787
And the coolest thing of all,

00:05:10.787 --> 00:05:13.201
no matter the wavelength or energy,

00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:15.697
the light that we see out in the distant universe

00:05:15.697 --> 00:05:17.120
is the same thing as the light

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.717
that we can experience and study here on Earth.

00:05:19.717 --> 00:05:20.992
So, since we know the physics

00:05:20.992 --> 00:05:22.280
of how x-ray,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.410
ultraviolet light,

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.204
or microwaves work here,

00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:28.202
we can study the light of a distant star or galaxy

00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:29.698
and know what kinds of things

00:05:29.698 --> 00:05:31.503
are happening there too.
