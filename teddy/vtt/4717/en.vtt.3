00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:30.406
they just have different wavelengths and frequencies.

00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:33.195
If you know the wavelength or frequency

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:34.323
of a wave of light,

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:36.787
you can also figure out its energy.

00:01:36.787 --> 00:01:39.002
Long wavelengths have low energies,

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.230
while short wavelengths have high energies.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.673
It's easy to remember

00:01:42.673 --> 00:01:44.727
if you think about being in that boat.

00:01:44.727 --> 00:01:46.428
If you were out sailing on a day

00:01:46.428 --> 00:01:47.975
with short, choppy waves,

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:50.398
you'd probably be pretty high energy yourself,

00:01:50.398 --> 00:01:53.650
running around to keep things from falling over.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.805
But on a long wavelength sea,

00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:57.058
you'd be rolling along, relaxed,

00:01:57.058 --> 00:01:58.312
low energy.

00:01:59.158 --> 00:02:00.704
The energy of light tells us
