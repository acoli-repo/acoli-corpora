00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:30.975
And visible light, the kind you can actually see,

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:33.149
is somewhere in between.

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:35.210
Even though our eyes can't detect light

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.029
outside of the visible range,

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.662
we can build special detectors

00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:39.618
that are stimulated

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:41.622
by these other wavelengths of light,

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:43.464
kind of like digital eyes.

00:03:43.464 --> 00:03:44.639
With these devices,

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.455
we can measure the light that is there,

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:48.804
even though we can't see it ourselves.

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:51.819
So, take a step back and think about

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.789
all of this for a moment.

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:54.875
Even though they seem different,

00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:57.092
the warmth you feel from a crackling fire

00:03:57.092 --> 00:03:58.972
is the same as the sun shining on you

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.234
on a beautiful day,
