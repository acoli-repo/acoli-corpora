00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:00.155
and waves that only roll in every so often.

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:02.992
The size of a wave is called its wavelength,

00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:04.498
and how often it comes by

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:06.393
is called its frequency.

00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:08.748
Imagine being a boat in that ocean,

00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:11.231
bobbing up and down as the waves go by.

00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:13.667
If the waves that day have long wavelengths,

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.789
they'll make you bob only so often,

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.696
or at a low frequency.

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:20.058
If the waves, instead, have short wavelengths,

00:01:20.058 --> 00:01:21.308
they'll be close together,

00:01:21.308 --> 00:01:23.535
and you'll bob up and down much more often,

00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:25.286
at a high frequency.

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:27.902
Different kinds of light are all waves,

00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:30.406
they just have different wavelengths and frequencies.
