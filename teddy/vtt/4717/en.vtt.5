00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:31.221
because different cones are sensitive

00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:33.426
to different energies of light.

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:35.421
Some cones are more excited by light

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.820
that is long wavelength and low energy,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.654
and other cones are more excited

00:02:39.654 --> 00:02:42.537
by short wavelength, high-energy light.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:43.767
When light hits our eye,

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:46.183
the relative amount of energy each cone measures

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:48.981
signals our brain to perceive colors.

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:50.235
The rainbow we perceive

00:02:50.235 --> 00:02:53.621
is actually visible light in order of its energy.

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:54.693
At one side of the rainbow

00:02:54.693 --> 00:02:57.397
is low-energy light we see as red,

00:02:57.397 --> 00:02:59.734
and at the other side is high-energy light

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:01.631
we see as blue.
