00:04:28.312 --> 00:04:30.181
which you now know is only a tiny part

00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:31.956
of the full spectrum.

00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:33.287
If we had to draw the universe

00:04:33.287 --> 00:04:35.600
and could only use visible light,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.428
it would be like having only one crayon --

00:04:37.428 --> 00:04:38.702
pretty sad.

00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:41.504
To see the universe in its full spectrum,

00:04:41.504 --> 00:04:43.329
we need to have the right eyes,

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:45.283
and that means using special telescopes

00:04:45.283 --> 00:04:48.158
that can help us see beyond visible light.

00:04:48.158 --> 00:04:50.498
You've probably heard of the Hubble Space Telescope

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:51.783
and seen its beautiful pictures

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:54.516
taken in visible and ultraviolet light.

00:04:54.516 --> 00:04:55.749
But you might not know

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:58.355
that there are 20 space telescopes in orbit,

00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:00.144
missions that can each see part
