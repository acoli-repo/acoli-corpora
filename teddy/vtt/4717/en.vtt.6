00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:01.631
we see as blue.

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:02.813
If light shines on us

00:03:02.813 --> 00:03:04.896
that has an energy our retina can't measure,

00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:06.784
we won't be able to see it.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.957
Light that is too short wavelength or high energy

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:11.981
gets absorbed by the eye's surface

00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:14.130
before it can even get to the retina,

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.940
and light that is too long wavelength

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.206
doesn't have enough energy

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:19.576
to stimulate our retina at all.

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:21.520
The only thing that makes one kind of light

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.270
different from another is its wavelength.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.215
Radio waves have long wavelengths,

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:28.514
while x-rays have short wavelengths.

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:30.975
And visible light, the kind you can actually see,
