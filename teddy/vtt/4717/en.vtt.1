00:00:28.183 --> 00:00:30.101
but are invisible to the human eye,

00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:32.940
from the radio waves that carry your favorite songs,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.475
to the x-rays doctors use to see inside of you,

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:37.939
to the microwaves that heat up your food.

00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:39.682
In order to understand

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:41.243
how these can all be light,

00:00:41.243 --> 00:00:42.656
we'll need to know a thing or two

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:44.284
about what light is.

00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:46.519
Light is electromagnetic radiation

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.037
that acts like both a wave and a particle.

00:00:49.037 --> 00:00:52.028
Light waves are kind of like waves on the ocean.

00:00:52.028 --> 00:00:53.991
There are big waves and small waves,

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.698
waves that crash on the shore

00:00:55.698 --> 00:00:57.235
one right after the other,

00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:00.155
and waves that only roll in every so often.
