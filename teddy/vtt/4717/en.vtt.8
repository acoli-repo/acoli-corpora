00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.234
on a beautiful day,

00:04:00.234 --> 00:04:01.927
the same as ultraviolet light

00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:04.418
you put on sunscreen to protect yourself from,

00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:05.997
the same thing as your TV,

00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:06.897
your radio,

00:04:06.897 --> 00:04:08.280
and your microwave.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.479

00:04:20.782 --> 00:04:22.459
When you think of the night sky,

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:24.057
you probably think of being able

00:04:24.057 --> 00:04:26.677
to see the stars shining with your own eyes,

00:04:26.677 --> 00:04:28.312
but that's just visible light,

00:04:28.312 --> 00:04:30.181
which you now know is only a tiny part
