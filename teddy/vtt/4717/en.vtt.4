00:01:59.158 --> 00:02:00.704
The energy of light tells us

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:02.635
how it will interact with matter,

00:02:02.635 --> 00:02:04.918
for example, the cells of our eyes.

00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:07.630
When we see, it's because the energy of light

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.590
stimulates a receptor in our eye

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.324
called the retina.

00:02:11.324 --> 00:02:13.117
Our retina are only sensitive to light

00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:15.319
with a very small range in energy,

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.484
and so we call that range of light visible light.

00:02:18.484 --> 00:02:20.700
Inside our retina are special receptors

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.734
called rods and cones.

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:24.570
The rods measure brightness,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.538
so we know how much light there is.

00:02:26.538 --> 00:02:29.552
The cones are in charge of what color of light we see

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:31.221
because different cones are sensitive
