00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:30.203
to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy

00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:32.803
and that your engineering is engaging.

00:01:32.803 --> 00:01:36.536
First question to answer for us: so what?

00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:40.491
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.

00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:43.121
Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae,

00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:47.018
but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones

00:01:47.018 --> 00:01:51.631
because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.

00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:56.137
And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.

00:01:56.137 --> 00:02:00.013
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.
