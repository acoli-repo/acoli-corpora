00:01:56.137 --> 00:02:00.013
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.

00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:03.089
Sure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:06.515
"space and time," which is so much more accessible to us?

00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:11.663
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:14.440
Instead, as Einstein said, make everything

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.874
as simple as possible, but no simpler.

00:02:17.874 --> 00:02:20.647
You can clearly communicate your science

00:02:20.647 --> 00:02:23.334
without compromising the ideas.

00:02:23.334 --> 00:02:27.279
A few things to consider are having examples, stories

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:28.984
and analogies. Those are ways to engage

00:02:28.984 --> 00:02:31.166
and excite us about your content.
