00:00:01.261 --> 00:00:03.783
Five years ago, I experienced a bit

00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:07.119
of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:09.782
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher,

00:00:09.782 --> 00:00:13.122
to teach a communications class for engineering students.

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:15.728
And I was scared. (Laughter)

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:19.399
Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:23.106
and their big books and their big, unfamiliar words.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.311
But as these conversations unfolded,

00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:29.219
I experienced what Alice must have when she went down

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:33.396
that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.
