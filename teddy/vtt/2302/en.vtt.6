00:02:57.822 --> 00:03:00.704
much more effective. It's showing that the special structure

00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:04.368
of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired

00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:07.223
the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.

00:03:07.223 --> 00:03:10.903
And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence

00:03:10.903 --> 00:03:13.955
that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost,

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:17.233
and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:19.647
and create a deeper sense of understanding

00:03:19.647 --> 00:03:21.286
of what's being described.

00:03:21.286 --> 00:03:24.136
So I think these are just a few keys that can help

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:27.658
the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland

00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:29.874
that is science and engineering.

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.323
And because the engineers that I've worked with have
