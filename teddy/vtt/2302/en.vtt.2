and if we don't know about it and understand it,

00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:08.817
then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility

00:01:08.817 --> 00:01:11.768
as non-scientists to have these interactions.

00:01:11.768 --> 00:01:14.928
But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists

00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:18.162
and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.

00:01:18.162 --> 00:01:23.641
So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.

00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:26.128
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:30.203
to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy
