And because the engineers that I've worked with have

00:03:32.323 --> 00:03:36.123
taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd,

00:03:36.123 --> 00:03:39.076
I want to summarize with an equation. (Laughter)

00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:43.321
Take your science, subtract your bullet points

00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:46.099
and your jargon, divide by relevance,

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.546

and that is going to equal incredible interactions

00:03:56.338 --> 00:03:58.812
that are full of understanding.

00:03:58.812 --> 00:04:02.274
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved
