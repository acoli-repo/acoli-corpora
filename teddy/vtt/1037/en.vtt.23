Just like if you're a white person

00:11:30.715 --> 00:11:33.958
and another white person makes
a racist comment, you'd hope, I hope,

00:11:33.982 --> 00:11:36.606
that white people would interrupt
that racist enactment

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.867
by a fellow white person.

00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:40.757
Just like with heterosexism,
if you're a heterosexual person

00:11:40.781 --> 00:11:43.588
and you yourself don't enact
harassing or abusive behaviors

00:11:43.612 --> 00:11:45.822
towards people of varying
sexual orientations,

00:11:45.846 --> 00:11:49.566
if you don't say something in the face
of other heterosexual people doing that,

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.901
then, in a sense, isn't your silence
a form of consent and complicity?

00:11:52.925 --> 00:11:55.760
Well, the bystander approach
is trying to give people tools

00:11:55.784 --> 00:11:59.605
to interrupt that process and to speak up
and to create a peer culture climate

00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:02.293
where the abusive behavior
will be seen as unacceptable,
