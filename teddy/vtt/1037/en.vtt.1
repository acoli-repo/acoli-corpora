00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:30.226
Now obviously --

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.508
(Applause)

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:34.416
Obviously, they're also women's issues,
so I appreciate that,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.087
but calling gender violence
a women's issue is part of the problem,

00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:40.739
for a number of reasons.

00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:44.237
The first is that it gives men
an excuse not to pay attention, right?

00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:46.307
A lot of men hear
the term "women's issues"

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:48.320
and we tend to tune it out, and we think,

00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:51.249
"I'm a guy; that's for the girls,"
or "that's for the women."

00:00:51.273 --> 00:00:55.161
And a lot of men literally don't get
beyond the first sentence as a result.

00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:57.538
It's almost like a chip
in our brain is activated,

00:00:57.562 --> 00:01:00.722
and the neural pathways take
our attention in a different direction
