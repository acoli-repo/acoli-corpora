00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.338
So now Mary's very identity --
Mary is a battered woman --

00:04:05.673 --> 00:04:08.220
is what was done to her by John
in the first instance.

00:04:08.244 --> 00:04:11.460
But we've demonstrated that John
has long ago left the conversation.

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:14.400
Those of us who work
in the domestic and sexual violence field

00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:16.941
know that victim-blaming
is pervasive in this realm,

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.904
which is to say, blaming the person
to whom something was done

00:04:19.928 --> 00:04:21.559
rather than the person who did it.

00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:23.791
And we say: why do they
go out with these men?

00:04:23.815 --> 00:04:26.695
Why are they attracted to them?
Why do they keep going back?

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.671
What was she wearing at that party?
What a stupid thing to do.

00:04:29.695 --> 00:04:32.383
Why was she drinking
with those guys in that hotel room?
