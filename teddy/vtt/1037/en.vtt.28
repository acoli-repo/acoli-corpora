And I said, "With all due respect,

00:14:06.657 --> 00:14:09.186

with the Marines.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.488

in the Marine Corps."

00:14:11.512 --> 00:14:13.586

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.371
but it's an important distinction,

00:14:15.395 --> 00:14:18.544

that what we need is sensitivity training.

00:14:18.568 --> 00:14:21.004

because, for example,

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:24.794
when a professional coach or a manager
of a baseball team or a football team --

00:14:24.818 --> 00:14:27.124
and I work extensively
in that realm as well --

00:14:27.148 --> 00:14:30.351
makes a sexist comment,
makes a homophobic statement,
