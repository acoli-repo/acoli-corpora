00:07:23.663 --> 00:07:30.205
and the disgusting
and offensive "feminazi", right?

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:31.970
And you know what all this is about?

00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:33.498
It's called kill the messenger.

00:07:33.522 --> 00:07:35.529
It's because the women who are standing up

00:07:35.553 --> 00:07:37.971
and speaking out for themselves
and for other women

00:07:37.995 --> 00:07:40.180
as well as for men and boys,

00:07:40.204 --> 00:07:42.576
it's a statement to them
to sit down and shut up,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.208
keep the current system in place,

00:07:44.232 --> 00:07:46.630
because we don't like it
when people rock the boat.

00:07:46.654 --> 00:07:49.002
We don't like it when people
challenge our power.

00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:51.148
You'd better sit
down and shut up, basically.

00:07:51.172 --> 00:07:53.423
And thank goodness
that women haven't done that.

00:07:53.447 --> 00:07:55.321
Thank goodness that we live in a world

00:07:55.345 --> 00:07:58.467
where there's so much women's leadership
that can counteract that.

00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:01.333
But one of the powerful roles
that men can play in this work
