I make films and I work with high tech,

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:35.086
but I'm still old school as an educator,

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.696
and I want to share with you this exercise

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.453
that illustrates
on the sentence-structure level

00:02:40.477 --> 00:02:45.008
how the way that we think,
literally the way that we use language,

00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:47.175
conspires to keep
our attention off of men.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.386
This is about domestic
violence in particular,

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.834
but you can plug in other analogues.

00:02:52.858 --> 00:02:55.922
This comes from the work
of the feminist linguist Julia Penelope.

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:58.114
It starts with a very basic
English sentence:

00:02:58.138 --> 00:03:01.567
"John beat Mary."
