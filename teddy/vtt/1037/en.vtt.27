00:13:29.964 --> 00:13:31.629
for being leaders on these issues,

00:13:31.653 --> 00:13:33.972
because when somebody
speaks up in a peer culture

00:13:33.996 --> 00:13:35.932
and challenges and interrupts,

00:13:35.956 --> 00:13:38.530
he or she is being a leader, really.

00:13:38.554 --> 00:13:41.805
But on a big scale,
we need more adult men with power

00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:43.975
to start prioritizing these issues,

00:13:43.999 --> 00:13:46.428
and we haven't seen that yet, have we?

00:13:46.452 --> 00:13:49.858
Now, I was at a dinner
a number of years ago,

00:13:49.882 --> 00:13:53.071
and I work extensively
with the US military, all the services.

00:13:53.095 --> 00:13:55.937
And I was at this dinner
and this woman said to me --

00:13:56.636 --> 00:13:58.793
I think she thought
she was a little clever --

00:13:58.817 --> 00:14:03.363
she said, "So how long have you been doing
sensitivity training with the Marines?"
