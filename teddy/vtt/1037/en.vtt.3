A lot of people, when they hear
the word "sexual orientation"

00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:33.720
think it means gay, lesbian, bisexual.

00:01:33.744 --> 00:01:36.285
And a lot of people,
when they hear the word "gender,"

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:37.463
think it means women.

00:01:37.487 --> 00:01:40.463
In each case, the dominant group
doesn't get paid attention to.

00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:43.237
As if white people don't have
some sort of racial identity

00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:46.251
or belong to some racial
category or construct,

00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:49.811
as if heterosexual people
don't have a sexual orientation,

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:51.935
as if men don't have a gender.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.737
This is one of the ways that dominant
systems maintain and reproduce themselves,

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:58.350
which is to say the dominant group
is rarely challenged

00:01:58.374 --> 00:02:00.034
to even think about its dominance,
