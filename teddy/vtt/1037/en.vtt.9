00:04:29.695 --> 00:04:32.383
Why was she drinking
with those guys in that hotel room?

00:04:32.407 --> 00:04:35.172
This is victim blaming,
and there are many reasons for it,

00:04:35.196 --> 00:04:38.802
but one is that our cognitive structure
is set up to blame victims.

00:04:38.826 --> 00:04:39.993
This is all unconscious.

00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:42.642
Our whole cognitive structure
is set up to ask questions

00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:46.157
about women and women's choices
and what they're doing, thinking, wearing.

00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:49.503
And I'm not going to shout down
people who ask questions about women.

00:04:49.527 --> 00:04:51.028
It's a legitimate thing to ask.

00:04:51.052 --> 00:04:53.351
But's let's be clear:
Asking questions about Mary

00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:56.507
is not going to get us anywhere
in terms of preventing violence.

00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:58.592
We have to ask a different
set of questions.

00:04:58.616 --> 00:05:02.197
The questions are not about Mary,
they're about John.
