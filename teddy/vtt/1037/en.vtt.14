00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.130
These are the kind of questions
that we need to be asking

00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:02.314
and the kind of work
that we need to be doing,

00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:05.901
but if we're endlessly focused
on what women are doing and thinking

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.612
in relationships or elsewhere,

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:10.058
we're not going to get to that piece.

00:07:10.082 --> 00:07:11.745
I understand that a lot of women

00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:14.248
who have been trying to speak out
about these issues,

00:07:14.272 --> 00:07:16.339
today and yesterday
and for years and years,

00:07:16.363 --> 00:07:18.619
often get shouted down for their efforts.

00:07:18.643 --> 00:07:23.639
They get called nasty names
like "male-basher" and "man-hater,"

00:07:23.663 --> 00:07:30.205
and the disgusting
and offensive "feminazi", right?
