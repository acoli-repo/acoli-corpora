But one of the powerful roles
that men can play in this work

00:08:01.357 --> 00:08:04.283
is that we can say some things
that sometimes women can't say,

00:08:04.307 --> 00:08:06.690
or, better yet, we can be heard
saying some things

00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:08.667
that women often can't be heard saying.

00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:12.173
Now, I appreciate that that's a problem,
it's sexism, but it's the truth.

00:08:12.197 --> 00:08:14.095
So one of the things that I say to men,

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.058
and my colleagues and I always say this,

00:08:16.082 --> 00:08:18.767
is we need more men
who have the courage and the strength

00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:21.201
to start standing up and saying
some of this stuff,

00:08:21.225 --> 00:08:23.326
and standing with women
and not against them

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.318
and pretending that somehow
this is a battle between the sexes

00:08:26.342 --> 00:08:27.688
and other kinds of nonsense.

00:08:27.712 --> 00:08:29.188
We live in the world together.

00:08:29.212 --> 00:08:31.884
And by the way, one of the things
that really bothers me
