It's along a continuum, we're trying
to get men to interrupt each other.

00:11:03.895 --> 00:11:06.823
So, for example, if you're a guy
and you're in a group of guys

00:11:06.847 --> 00:11:09.715
playing poker, talking, hanging out,
no women present,

00:11:09.739 --> 00:11:16.088
and another guy says something sexist
or degrading or harassing about women,

00:11:16.112 --> 00:11:18.964
instead of laughing along
or pretending you didn't hear it,

00:11:18.988 --> 00:11:21.005
we need men to say,
"Hey, that's not funny.

00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:23.279
that could be my sister
you're talking about,

00:11:23.303 --> 00:11:25.267
and could you joke about something else?

00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:27.167
Or could you talk about something else?

00:11:27.191 --> 00:11:29.022
I don't appreciate that kind of talk."

00:11:29.046 --> 00:11:30.691
Just like if you're a white person
