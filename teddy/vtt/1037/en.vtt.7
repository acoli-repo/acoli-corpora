00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.516
and you can see John is very close
to the end of the sentence,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.506
well, close to dropping
off the map of our psychic plain.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.250
The third sentence, John is dropped,

00:03:35.274 --> 00:03:38.588
and we have, "Mary was beaten,"

00:03:38.612 --> 00:03:40.484
and now it's all about Mary.

00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:43.570
We're not even thinking about John,
it's totally focused on Mary.

00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:44.805
Over the past generation,

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.605
the term we've used
synonymous with "beaten" is "battered,"

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.676
so we have "Mary was battered."

00:03:51.324 --> 00:03:55.118
And the final sentence in this sequence,
flowing from the others, is,

00:03:55.142 --> 00:03:57.816
"Mary is a battered woman."

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.338
So now Mary's very identity --
Mary is a battered woman --
