00:00:57.562 --> 00:01:00.722
and the neural pathways take
our attention in a different direction

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:02.607
when we hear the term "women's issues."

00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:05.090
This is also true, by the way,
of the word "gender,"

00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:07.432
because a lot of people
hear the word "gender"

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:09.036
and they think it means "women."

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.240
So they think that gender issues
is synonymous with women's issues.

00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:14.375
There's some confusion
about the term gender.

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.984
And let me illustrate
that confusion by way of analogy.

00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:18.830
So let's talk for a moment about race.

00:01:18.854 --> 00:01:20.774
In the US, when we hear the word "race,"

00:01:20.798 --> 00:01:23.160
a lot of people think
that means African-American,

00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:25.257
Latino, Asian-American, Native American,

00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:28.057
South Asian, Pacific Islander, on and on.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.281
A lot of people, when they hear
the word "sexual orientation"
