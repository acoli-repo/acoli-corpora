00:10:29.106 --> 00:10:31.134
with people who might be
in that situation.

00:10:31.158 --> 00:10:34.358
What do we do? How do we speak up?
How do we challenge our friends?

00:10:34.382 --> 00:10:35.876
How do we support our friends?

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.411
But how do we not remain silent
in the face of abuse?

00:10:38.435 --> 00:10:41.121
Now, when it comes
to men and male culture,

00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:44.541
the goal is to get men who are not abusive
to challenge men who are.

00:10:44.565 --> 00:10:47.812
And when I say abusive, I don't mean just
men who are beating women.

00:10:47.836 --> 00:10:52.632
We're not just saying a man whose friend
is abusing his girlfriend

00:10:52.656 --> 00:10:55.473
needs to stop the guy
at the moment of attack.

00:10:55.497 --> 00:10:59.951
That's a naive way
of creating a social change.

00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:03.871
It's along a continuum, we're trying
to get men to interrupt each other.
