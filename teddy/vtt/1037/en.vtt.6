00:02:58.138 --> 00:03:01.567
"John beat Mary."

00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:03.092
That's a good English sentence.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:06.602
John is the subject, beat is the verb,
Mary is the object, good sentence.

00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:08.840
Now we're going to move
to the second sentence,

00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:11.210
which says the same thing
in the passive voice.

00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:16.473
"Mary was beaten by John."

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.350
And now a whole lot
has happened in one sentence.

00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:22.479
We've gone from "John beat Mary"

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:24.298
to "Mary was beaten by John."

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:27.585
We've shifted our focus
in one sentence from John to Mary,

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.516
and you can see John is very close
to the end of the sentence,
