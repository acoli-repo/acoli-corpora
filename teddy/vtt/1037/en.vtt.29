00:14:27.148 --> 00:14:30.351
makes a sexist comment,
makes a homophobic statement,

00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:31.916
makes a racist comment,

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.320
there will be discussions on the sports
blogs and in sports talk radio.

00:14:35.344 --> 00:14:38.126
And some people will say,
"He needs sensitivity training."

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.155
Other people will say, "Well, get off it.

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:42.349
That's political correctness run amok,

00:14:42.373 --> 00:14:44.177
he made a stupid statement, move on."

00:14:46.855 --> 00:14:48.263

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:49.823
because he's being a bad leader,

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:52.974
because in a society with gender diversity
and sexual diversity --

00:14:52.998 --> 00:14:54.063
(Applause)

00:14:54.087 --> 00:14:55.626
and racial and ethnic diversity,

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.857
you make those kind of comments,
you're failing at your leadership.

00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:01.069
If we can make this point that I'm making
