00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:01.069
If we can make this point that I'm making

00:15:01.093 --> 00:15:03.734
to powerful men and women in our society

00:15:03.758 --> 00:15:06.829
at all levels of institutional
authority and power,

00:15:06.853 --> 00:15:10.083
it's going to change
the paradigm of people's thinking.

00:15:10.655 --> 00:15:12.161
You know, for example,

00:15:12.185 --> 00:15:14.461
I work a lot in college
and university athletics

00:15:14.485 --> 00:15:16.019
throughout North America.

00:15:17.087 --> 00:15:20.902
We know so much about how to prevent
domestic and sexual violence, right?

00:15:21.613 --> 00:15:23.985
There's no excuse
for a college or university

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:26.867
to not have domestic and sexual
violence prevention training

00:15:26.891 --> 00:15:29.701
mandated for all student athletes,
coaches, administrators,

00:15:29.725 --> 00:15:32.073
as part of their educational process.
