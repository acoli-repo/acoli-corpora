00:08:29.212 --> 00:08:31.884
And by the way, one of the things
that really bothers me

00:08:31.908 --> 00:08:34.495
about some of the rhetoric
against feminists and others

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:38.221
who have built the battered women's
and rape crisis movements around the world

00:08:38.245 --> 00:08:40.749
is that somehow, like I said,
that they're anti-male.

00:08:40.773 --> 00:08:44.028
What about all the boys who are profoundly
affected in a negative way

00:08:44.052 --> 00:08:47.835
by what some adult man is doing against
their mother, themselves, their sisters?

00:08:47.859 --> 00:08:49.135
What about all those boys?

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:50.927
What about all the young men and boys

00:08:50.951 --> 00:08:53.312
who have been traumatized
by adult men's violence?

00:08:53.336 --> 00:08:54.524
You know what?

00:08:54.548 --> 00:08:56.928
The same system that produces
men who abuse women,

00:08:56.952 --> 00:08:58.539
produces men who abuse other men.

00:08:58.563 --> 00:09:02.031
And if we want to talk about male victims,
let's talk about male victims.
