you've missed out on part of
what it means to be human.

00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:06.245
Many thinkers contend that melancholy
is necessary in gaining wisdom.

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:08.798
Robert Burton, born in 1577,

00:02:08.798 --> 00:02:13.176
spent his life studying the causes
and experience of sadness.

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:16.171
In his masterpiece
"The Anatomy of Melancholy,"

00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:20.909
Burton wrote, "He that increaseth wisdom
increaseth sorrow."

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.758
The Romantic poets of 
the early 19th century

00:02:23.758 --> 00:02:29.016
believed melancholy allows us to more
deeply understand other profound emotions,

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:30.603
like beauty and joy.
