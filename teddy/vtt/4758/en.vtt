00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:09.903
Sadness is part of the human experience,

00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:12.511
but for centuries there has 
been vast disagreement

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:17.377
over what exactly it is and what,
if anything, to do about it.

00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:19.085
In its simplest terms,

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.723
sadness is often thought of

00:00:20.723 --> 00:00:23.966
as the natural reaction 
to a difficult situation.

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:27.843
You feel sad when a friend moves away
or when a pet dies.

00:00:27.843 --> 00:00:29.683
When a friend says, "I'm sad,"

00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:32.503
you often respond by asking,
"What happened?"
