00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:32.211
unexplained emotional states are at least
partially related to brain chemistry,

00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:35.948
the balance of various chemicals 
present inside the brain.

00:01:35.948 --> 00:01:37.238
Like the Greek system,

00:01:37.238 --> 00:01:39.932
changing the balance of these chemicals
can deeply alter

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:44.148
how we respond to even extremely
difficult circumstances.

00:01:44.148 --> 00:01:46.921
There's also a long tradition
of attempting to discern

00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:48.911
the value of sadness,

00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:50.175
and in that discussion,

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:52.752
you'll find a strong argument
that sadness is not only

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:56.438
an inevitable part of life
but an essential one.

00:01:56.438 --> 00:01:58.237
If you've never felt melancholy,

00:01:58.237 --> 00:02:01.795
you've missed out on part of
what it means to be human.
