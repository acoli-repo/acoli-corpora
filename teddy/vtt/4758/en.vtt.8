00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:00.882
where as in a culture that talks 
about a bruised heart,

00:04:00.882 --> 00:04:05.044
there actually seems to be a different
subjective experience.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:07.221
Some contemporary thinkers 
aren't interested

00:04:07.221 --> 00:04:10.426
in sadness' subjectivity 
versus universality,

00:04:10.426 --> 00:04:14.981
and would rather use technology to
eliminate suffering in all its forms.

00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:18.267
David Pearce has suggested
that genetic engineering

00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:20.680
and other contemporary processes

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.847
cannot only alter the way humans
experience emotional and physical pain,

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:28.202
but that world ecosystems 
ought to be redesigned

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:30.817
so that animals don't suffer in the wild.
