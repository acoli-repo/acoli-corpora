I'm an astronomer who builds telescopes.

00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:08.524
I build telescopes because,
number one, they are awesome.

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:11.330
But number two,

00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:15.062
I believe if you want to discover
a new thing about the universe,

00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:16.618
you have to look at the universe

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:17.870
in a new way.

00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:20.227
New technologies in astronomy --

00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:23.849
things like lenses, photographic plates,

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:26.288
all the way up to space telescopes --

00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:29.404
each gave us new ways to see the universe

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:32.133
and directly led to a new understanding
