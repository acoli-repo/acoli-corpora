00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.866
And our goal was to prove
that this sensor would work really well

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.650
to detect that hydrogen gas.

00:02:36.618 --> 00:02:37.991
In my work on this,

00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:45.011
I destroyed several very,
very, very expensive sensors

00:02:45.035 --> 00:02:47.142
before realizing that
the machine I was using

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:50.968
created a plasma that shorted out
anything electrical that we put in it.

00:02:51.414 --> 00:02:54.183
We used a different machine,
there were other challenges,

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:56.184
and it took years to get it right.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.852
But when that first sensor worked,

00:02:58.876 --> 00:03:01.074
it was glorious.
