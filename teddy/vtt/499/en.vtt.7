00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.685
and observes for one night only

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.468
from 130,000 feet in the stratosphere,

00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:36.259
at the very edge of space.

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:41.159
This is partly because the edge of space
is much cheaper than actual space.

00:03:41.183 --> 00:03:42.427
(Laughter)

00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:46.067
So building it, of course, more failures:

00:03:46.908 --> 00:03:48.077
mirrors that failed,

00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:50.054
scratched mirrors that had to be remade;

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:51.937
cooling system failures,

00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:54.128
an entire system that had to be remade;

00:03:54.731 --> 00:04:00.828
calibration failures, we ran tests
again and again and again and again;
