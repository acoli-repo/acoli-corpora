00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:30.568
due to six weeks of continuous rain
in the New Mexico desert.

00:04:30.592 --> 00:04:33.120
(Laughter)

00:04:33.144 --> 00:04:35.108
Our spirits dampened, we showed up again,

00:04:35.132 --> 00:04:37.735
August 2018, year 10.

00:04:38.247 --> 00:04:41.287
And on the morning of September 22nd,

00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:47.046
we finally got the telescope launched.

00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:52.214
(Applause)

00:04:52.238 --> 00:04:56.960
I have put so much of myself --
my whole life -- into this project,

00:04:56.984 --> 00:04:59.933
and I, like, still can't believe
that that happened.
