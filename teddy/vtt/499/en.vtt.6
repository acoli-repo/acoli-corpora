it was glorious.

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:05.005
And our sensors are now 10 times better
than the previous state of the art

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:07.977
and are getting put into

00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:12.899
Our sensors will give us a new way
to see the universe and our place in it.

00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:16.120
So, sensors done,

00:03:16.144 --> 00:03:17.470
time to build a telescope.

00:03:17.494 --> 00:03:21.108
And FIREBall is weird
as far as telescopes go,

00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:24.124
because it's not in space,
and it's not on the ground.

00:03:24.148 --> 00:03:27.636
Instead, it hangs on a cable
from a giant balloon

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.685
and observes for one night only
