The reality of my job is that I fail
almost all the time and still keep going,

00:01:03.302 --> 00:01:05.684
because that's how telescopes get built.

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:08.593
The telescope I helped build is called

00:01:08.617 --> 00:01:13.873
the faint intergalactic-medium
red-shifted emission balloon,

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:15.516
which is a mouthful,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.895

And don't worry, it is not going
to explode at the end of this story.

I've been working on FIREBall
for more than 10 years

00:01:24.672 --> 00:01:28.109
and now lead the team
of incredible people who built it.

00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:32.871
FIREBall is designed to observe
some of the faintest structures known:
