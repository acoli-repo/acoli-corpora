00:05:57.743 --> 00:06:00.001
that we just get wrong the first time,

00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:01.488
and so they fail.

00:06:01.512 --> 00:06:04.085
I think about the thousands
of people who built Hubble

00:06:04.109 --> 00:06:06.062
and how many failures they endured.

00:06:06.086 --> 00:06:09.219
There were countless failures,
heartbreaking failures,

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:10.925
even when it was in space.

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.516
And none of those failures
were a reason for them to give up.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.088
I think about why I love my job.

00:06:17.112 --> 00:06:19.539
I want to know what
is happening in the universe.

00:06:19.563 --> 00:06:22.359
You all want to know
what's happening in the universe, too.

00:06:22.383 --> 00:06:24.717
I want to know what's going on
with that hydrogen.

00:06:25.891 --> 00:06:29.370
And so I've realized
that discovery is mostly a process

00:06:29.394 --> 00:06:31.233
of finding things that don't work,
