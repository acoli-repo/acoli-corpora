FIREBall is designed to observe
some of the faintest structures known:

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:35.775
huge clouds of hydrogen gas.

00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:37.734
These clouds are giant.

00:01:37.758 --> 00:01:40.296
They are even bigger than
whatever you're thinking of.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.505
They are huge,

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:44.849
huge clouds of hydrogen that we think
flow into and out of galaxies.

00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:47.369
I work on FIREBall

00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:50.577
because what I really want
is to take our view of the universe

00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:53.765
from one with just light from stars

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.157
to one where we can see and measure
every atom that exists.

00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:01.192
That's all that I want to do.
