WEBVTT

00:03:54.731 --> 00:04:00.828
calibration failures, we ran tests
again and again and again and again;

00:04:00.852 --> 00:04:03.266
failures when you literally
least expect them:

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.196
we had an adorable but super angry
baby falcon that landed

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.120
on our spectrograph tank one day.

00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:10.173
(Laughter)

00:04:10.197 --> 00:04:12.387
Although to be fair,
this was the greatest day

00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:14.003
in the history of this project.

00:04:14.027 --> 00:04:15.210
(Laughter)

00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:17.500
I really loved that falcon.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.361
But falcon damage fixed, we got it built

00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:23.610
for an August 2017 launch attempt --

00:04:23.634 --> 00:04:25.764
and then failed to launch,

00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:30.568
due to six weeks of continuous rain
in the New Mexico desert.
