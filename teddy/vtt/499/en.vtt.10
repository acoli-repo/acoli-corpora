00:05:00.663 --> 00:05:04.380
And I have this picture that's taken
right around sunset on that day

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:07.158
of our balloon,

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:08.379
FIREBall hanging from it,

00:05:08.383 --> 00:05:10.021
and the nearly full moon.

00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:11.290
And I love this picture.

00:05:11.314 --> 00:05:13.520
God, I love it.

00:05:15.092 --> 00:05:16.244
But I look at it,

00:05:16.268 --> 00:05:17.698
and it makes me want to cry,

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:23.013
because when fully inflated,
these balloons are spherical,

00:05:23.037 --> 00:05:24.553
and this one isn't.

00:05:24.577 --> 00:05:26.553
It's shaped like a teardrop.

00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:29.902
And that's because there is a hole in it.
