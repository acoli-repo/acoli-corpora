00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:01.192
That's all that I want to do.

00:02:01.216 --> 00:02:03.208
(Laughter)

00:02:03.232 --> 00:02:05.442
But observing at least some of those atoms

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:09.237
is crucial to our understanding
of why galaxies look the way they do.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.603
I want to know

00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:14.615
how that hydrogen gas
gets into a galaxy and creates a star.

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.516
My work on FIREBall started in 2008,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.438
working not on the telescope
but on the light sensor,

00:02:21.462 --> 00:02:23.541
which is the heart of any telescope.

00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:26.939
This new sensor was being developed
by a team that I joined

00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:28.867
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.866
And our goal was to prove
that this sensor would work really well
