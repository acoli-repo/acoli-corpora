00:06:29.394 --> 00:06:31.233
of finding things that don't work,

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:35.000
and failure is inevitable when
you're pushing the limits of knowledge.

00:06:35.024 --> 00:06:36.630
And that's what I want to do.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.457
So I'm choosing to keep going.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.642
And our team is going to do

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:45.849
what everyone who has ever
built anything before us has done:

00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:47.109
we're going to try again,

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:48.313
in 2020.

00:06:48.648 --> 00:06:53.603
And it might feel like a failure today --
and it really does --

00:06:53.627 --> 00:06:55.908
but it's only going to stay a failure

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:57.538
if I give up.

00:06:57.562 --> 00:06:58.790
Thank you very much.
