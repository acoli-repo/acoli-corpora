00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:04.012
Everything is interconnected.

00:00:04.012 --> 00:00:07.538
As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.

00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:09.561
We are a small fishing tribe

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:12.745
situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:15.910
near the town of Southampton in New York.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.380
When I was a little girl,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.728
my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.

00:00:23.728 --> 00:00:27.282
There were no clouds in the sky.

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:30.453
And after a while I began to perspire.
