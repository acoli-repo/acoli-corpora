00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.042
I fell into depression,

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:32.613
I stopped talking,

00:01:32.998 --> 00:01:34.487
and I stopped eating.

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:39.488
In two months, I lost
about 10 kilos of weight.

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.008
Later on, I was diagnosed
with Asperger syndrome,

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.289
OCD and selective mutism.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.760
That basically means I only speak
when I think it's necessary -

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.670
now is one of those moments.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.258
