clean drinking water,
electricity, and so on.

00:05:03.707 --> 00:05:08.299
Because how can we expect
countries like India or Nigeria

00:05:08.303 --> 00:05:10.180
to care about the climate crisis

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:15.190
if we who already have everything
don't care even a second about it

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.048
or our actual commitments
to the Paris Agreement?

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.527
So, why are we not reducing our emissions?

00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:28.909
Why are they in fact still increasing?

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.031
Are we knowingly causing
a mass extinction?
