00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.227
clearly stated everywhere
in the Paris Agreement,

00:04:31.614 --> 00:04:35.849
which is absolutely necessary
to make it work on a global scale.

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:39.342
That means that rich countries

00:04:39.342 --> 00:04:43.279
need to get down to zero emissions
within 6 to 12 years,

00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:46.337
with today's emission speed.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.330
And that is so that people
in poorer countries

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.990
can have a chance to heighten
their standard of living

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.558
by building some of the infrastructure
that we have already built,

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:59.911
such as roads, schools, hospitals,

00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:02.960
clean drinking water,
electricity, and so on.
