00:06:57.738 --> 00:07:03.181
When you think about the future today,
you don't think beyond the year 2050.

00:07:04.178 --> 00:07:08.992
By then, I will, in the best case,
not even have lived half of my life.

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.969
What happens next?

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:19.590
The year 2078, I will celebrate
my 75th birthday.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.460
If I have children or grandchildren,
maybe they will spend that day with me.

00:07:26.682 --> 00:07:28.953
Maybe they will ask me about you,

00:07:29.384 --> 00:07:32.893
the people who were around, back in 2018.
