00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.525
where everyone keeps saying
climate change is an existential threat

00:02:32.925 --> 00:02:35.136
and the most important issue of all,

00:02:35.534 --> 00:02:38.082
and yet they just carry on like before.

00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:41.396
I don't understand that,

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.198
because if the emissions have to stop,

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:46.579
then we must stop the emissions.

00:02:47.194 --> 00:02:49.019
To me that is black or white.

00:02:49.698 --> 00:02:52.460
There are no gray areas
when it comes to survival.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.781
Either we go on
as a civilization or we don't.

00:02:56.646 --> 00:02:58.939
We have to change.
