00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.198
could be capable of changing
the Earth's climate.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.561
Because if we were,
and if it was really happening,

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:42.739
we wouldn't be talking
about anything else.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.000
As soon as you'd turn on the TV,
everything would be about that.

00:00:48.508 --> 00:00:51.541
Headlines, radio, newspapers,

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:54.690
you would never read or hear
about anything else,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.719
as if there was a world war going on.

00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:01.360
But no one ever talked about it.
