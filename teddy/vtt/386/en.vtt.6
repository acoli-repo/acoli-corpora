Rich countries like Sweden
need to start reducing emissions

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.230
by at least 15 percent every year.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:12.119
And that is so that we can stay
below a two-degree warming target.

00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:16.273
Yet, as the IPCC
have recently demonstrated,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.116
aiming instead for 1.5 degrees Celsius

00:03:20.362 --> 00:03:23.302
would significantly
reduce the climate impacts.

00:03:23.928 --> 00:03:27.798
But we can only imagine
what that means for reducing emissions.

00:03:28.897 --> 00:03:31.600
You would think the media
and every one of our leaders
