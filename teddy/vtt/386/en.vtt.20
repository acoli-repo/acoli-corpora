00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.189
of course we do.

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:06.469
But the one thing we need
more than hope is action.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.183
Once we start to act,
hope is everywhere.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.960
So instead of looking for hope,

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.820
look for action.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.519
Then, and only then, hope will come.

00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:29.045
Today, we use 100 million
barrels of oil every single day.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.221
There are no politics to change that.
