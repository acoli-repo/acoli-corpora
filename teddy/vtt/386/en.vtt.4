00:02:03.908 --> 00:02:06.290
For those of us who are on the spectrum,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.857
almost everything is black or white.

00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:11.234
We aren't very good at lying,

00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:14.598
and we usually don't enjoy
participating in this social game

00:02:14.598 --> 00:02:17.153
that the rest of you seem so fond of.

00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:18.423
(Laughter)

00:02:18.688 --> 00:02:21.751
I think in many ways
that we autistic are the normal ones,

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.368
and the rest of the people
are pretty strange,

00:02:24.368 --> 00:02:25.561
(Laughter)

00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:28.509
especially when it comes to
the sustainability crisis,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.525
where everyone keeps saying
climate change is an existential threat
