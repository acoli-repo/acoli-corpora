Sometimes school is under a tree,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
so you need a collaborative model of learning,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
not just building more schools and training more teachers,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
which you have to do anyway.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So we're once again doing "Give One, Get One."

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Last year, we ran a "Give One, Get One" program,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and it generated over 100,000 laptops

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
that we were then able to give free.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And by being a zero-dollar laptop,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
we can go to countries that can't afford it at all.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And that's what we did. We went to Haiti,
