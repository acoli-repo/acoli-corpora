00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
who had traveled all day to come to Bogota,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
one of the three children brought her mother.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And the reason she brought her mother

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
is that this six-year-old child

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
had been teaching her mother

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
how to read and write.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Her mother had not gone to primary school.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And this is such an inversion,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and such a wonderful example

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
of children being the agents of change.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So now, in closing, people say,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
now why laptops?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Laptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods. No.
