00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It's not going to happen, you know, in one year,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but it's an important, deeply economic

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that happens through children.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Thirty-one countries in total are involved,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and in the case of Uruguay,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
half the children already have them,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and by the middle of 2009,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Now what are some of the results?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Some of the results
