Laptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods. No.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The reason you want laptops

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
is that the word is education, not laptop.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
This is an education project, not a laptop project.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
They need to learn learning. And then, just think --

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
they can have, let's say, 100 books.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
In a village, you have 100 laptops,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
each with a different set of 100 books,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
You and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Sometimes school is under a tree,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education,
