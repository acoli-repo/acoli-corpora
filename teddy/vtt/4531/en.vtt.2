00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and 50 percent of them don't have electricity

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
at home or at school.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
75 percent of the little girls don't go to school.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And I don't mean that they drop out of school

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in the third or fourth grade -- they don't go.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So in the three years

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
since I talked at TED and showed a prototype,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it's gone from an idea

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to a real laptop.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We have half a million laptops today

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in the hands of children.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We have about a quarter of a million in transit

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to those and other children,
