00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to those and other children,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and then there are another quarter of a million more

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that are being ordered at this moment.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That's smaller than I predicted --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I predicted three to 10 million --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but is still a very large number.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
In Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
a strategic defense issue

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in the sense of liberating these zones
