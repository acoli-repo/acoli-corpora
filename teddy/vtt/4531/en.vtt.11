00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And that's what we did. We went to Haiti,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
we went to Rwanda, Afghanistan,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Ethiopia, Mongolia.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Places that are not markets,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
seeding it with the principles of

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
saturation, connectivity, low ages, etc.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And then we can actually roll out large numbers.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So think of it this way:

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
think of it as inoculating children

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
against ignorance.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And think of the laptop as a vaccine.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
You don't vaccinate a few children.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
You vaccinate all the children in an area.
