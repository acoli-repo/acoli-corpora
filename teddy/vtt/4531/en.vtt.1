00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
today to children

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
who have no television, no telephone

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and have been in a community

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
cut off from the rest of the world

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
for the past 40 years. 


00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The importance of delivering laptops to this region

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
because of the FARC,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
as a political movement and then became a drug movement.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There are one billion children in the world,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and 50 percent of them don't have electricity

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
at home or at school.
