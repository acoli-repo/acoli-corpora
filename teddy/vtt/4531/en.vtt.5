00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but it's opening it up to the rest of the world.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
yes, there will be television.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But the kids six to 12 years old

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
so the children grow up

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
with access to information,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
with a window into the rest of the world.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Before, they were closed off.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Interestingly enough, in other countries,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
as an engine of economic growth.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years.
