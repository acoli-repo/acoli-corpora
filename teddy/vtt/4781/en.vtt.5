00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:33.647
Periods work best here because these
are two totally different ideas.

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:37.787
A semicolon's job is to reunite 
two independent clauses

00:02:37.787 --> 00:02:40.262
that will benefit from 
one another's company

00:02:40.262 --> 00:02:42.446
because they refer to the same thing.

00:02:42.446 --> 00:02:46.489
Secondly, you'll almost never find
a semicolon willingly stationed

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.250
before coordinating conjunctions:

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.763
the words, "and," "but," "for,"
"nor," "or," "so," and "yet."

00:02:55.763 --> 00:02:57.852
That's a comma's place, in fact.

00:02:57.852 --> 00:03:02.157
But a semicolon can replace 
a conjunction to shorten a sentence
