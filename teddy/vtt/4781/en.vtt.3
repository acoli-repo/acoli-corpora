00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:31.556
but when connected by semicolons,

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:35.662
look and sound better
because they're related in some way.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.812
"Semicolons were once 
a great mystery to me.

00:01:38.812 --> 00:01:41.526
I had no idea where to put them."

00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:43.695
Technically, there's nothing 
wrong with that.

00:01:43.695 --> 00:01:46.513
These two sentences can stand alone.

00:01:46.513 --> 00:01:49.984
But imagine they appeared
in a long list of other sentences,

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:54.218
all of the same length,
each separated by periods.

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:57.789
Things would get monotonous very fast.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.335
In that situation,

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:02.382
semicolons bring fluidity 
and variation to writing
