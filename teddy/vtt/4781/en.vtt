00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.165
It may seem like the semicolon
is struggling with an identity crisis.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:15.083
It looks like a comma 
crossed with a period.

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:20.608
Maybe that's why we toss these punctuation
marks around like grammatical confetti.

00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:23.628
We're confused about 
how to use them properly.

00:00:23.628 --> 00:00:29.343
In fact, it's the semicolon's half-half 
status that makes it useful.

00:00:29.343 --> 00:00:33.393
It's stronger than a comma,
and less final than a period.
