00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:02.382
semicolons bring fluidity 
and variation to writing

00:02:02.382 --> 00:02:04.927
by connecting related clauses.

00:02:04.927 --> 00:02:09.687
But as beneficial as they are,
semicolons don't belong just anywhere.

00:02:09.687 --> 00:02:12.663
There are two main rules 
that govern their use.

00:02:12.663 --> 00:02:15.692
Firstly, unless they're 
being used in lists,

00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:20.728
semicolons should only connect clauses
that are related in some way.

00:02:20.728 --> 00:02:22.884
You wouldn't use one here, for instance:

00:02:22.884 --> 00:02:25.903
"Semicolons were once 
a great mystery to me;

00:02:25.903 --> 00:02:29.051
I'd really like a sandwich."

00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:33.647
Periods work best here because these
are two totally different ideas.
