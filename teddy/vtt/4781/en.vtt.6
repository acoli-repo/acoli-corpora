00:02:57.852 --> 00:03:02.157
But a semicolon can replace 
a conjunction to shorten a sentence

00:03:02.157 --> 00:03:04.149
or to give it some variety.

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:08.101
Ultimately, this underappreciated
punctuation mark

00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:11.782
can give writing clarity, 
force, and style,

00:03:11.782 --> 00:03:15.345
all encompassed 
in one tiny dot and squiggle

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:18.486
that's just waiting to be put 
in the right place.
