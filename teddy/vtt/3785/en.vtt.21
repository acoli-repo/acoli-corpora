00:10:29.174 --> 00:10:32.149
held in Lahore in a year when that city

00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:36.219
had already experienced 44 terror attacks.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.322
This was a time when the Pakistani Taliban

00:10:38.322 --> 00:10:40.139
had commenced their systematic targeting

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.347
of girls' schools that would culminate

00:10:42.347 --> 00:10:45.106
in the attack on Malala Yousafzai.

00:10:45.106 --> 00:10:49.501
What did the Peerzadas do in that environment?

00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:52.674
They staged girls' school theater.

00:10:52.674 --> 00:10:55.486
So I had the privilege of watching "Naang Wal,"

00:10:55.486 --> 00:10:58.118
which was a musical in the Punjabi language,

00:10:58.118 --> 00:10:59.880
and the girls of Lahore Grammar School

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.606
played all the parts.
