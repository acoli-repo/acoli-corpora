00:00:00.621 --> 00:00:01.993
Could I protect my father

00:00:01.993 --> 00:00:05.168
from the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife?

00:00:05.168 --> 00:00:06.729
That was the question I faced

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.497
one Tuesday morning in June of 1993,

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:11.339
when I was a law student.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.277
I woke up early that morning

00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:14.397
in Dad's apartment

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:16.695

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:19.969
to an unrelenting pounding on the front door.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:22.729
It was a season as described by a local paper

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:25.585
when every Tuesday a scholar fell

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:28.768
to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins.

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:31.130
