00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:32.541
called Muslim fundamentalism
that is the same everywhere,

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:35.257
because these movements
also have their diversities.

00:05:35.257 --> 00:05:37.720
Some use and advocate violence.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.350
Some do not, though they're often interrelated.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.920
They take different forms.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.544
Some may be non-governmental organizations,

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:47.076
even here in Britain like Cageprisoners.

00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:49.169
Some may become political parties,

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.740
like the Muslim Brotherhood,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.458
and some may be openly armed groups

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:54.183
like the Taliban.

00:05:54.183 --> 00:05:57.504
But in any case, these are all radical projects.

00:05:57.504 --> 00:06:00.733
They're not conservative or traditional approaches.
