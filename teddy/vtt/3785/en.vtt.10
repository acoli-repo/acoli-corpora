00:04:56.996 --> 00:05:00.901
I cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.940
Marieme Helie Lucas,

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.336
and she says that fundamentalisms,

00:05:05.336 --> 00:05:07.834
note the "s," so within all of the world's

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:09.656
great religious traditions,

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:13.627
"fundamentalisms are political
movements of the extreme right

00:05:13.627 --> 00:05:15.790
which in a context of globalization

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.284
manipulate religion in order to achieve

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:19.933
their political aims."

00:05:19.933 --> 00:05:23.616
Sadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization

00:05:23.616 --> 00:05:25.127
of theology.

00:05:25.127 --> 00:05:27.542
Now I want to avoid projecting the notion

00:05:27.542 --> 00:05:29.328
that there's sort of a monolith out there

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:32.541
called Muslim fundamentalism
that is the same everywhere,
