00:00:59.063 --> 00:01:01.402
And that was when I went to the kitchen,

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:02.777
got out a paring knife,

00:01:02.777 --> 00:01:05.755
and took up a position inside the entryway.

00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:07.302

Untold Stories from the Fight

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.416
The title comes from a Pakistani play.

00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:29.266
I think it was actually that moment

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.010
that sent me on the journey
