00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.372
that I support an effective struggle

00:06:31.372 --> 00:06:33.317
against fundamentalism,

00:06:33.317 --> 00:06:35.597
but also a struggle that must itself

00:06:35.597 --> 00:06:37.535
respect international law,

00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:39.964
so nothing I am saying should be taken

00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:41.809
as a justification for refusals

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:43.274
to democratize,

00:06:43.274 --> 00:06:45.949
and here I send out a shout-out of support

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.000
to the pro-democracy movement 
in Algeria today, Barakat.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.282
Nor should anything I say be taken

00:06:52.282 --> 00:06:55.149
as a justification of violations of human rights,

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:56.555
like the mass death sentences

00:06:56.555 --> 00:06:59.475
handed out in Egypt earlier this week.

00:06:59.475 --> 00:07:00.998
But what I am saying
