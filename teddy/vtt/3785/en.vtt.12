They're not conservative or traditional approaches.

00:06:00.733 --> 00:06:03.946
They're most often about changing
people's relationship with Islam

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:05.501
rather than preserving it.

00:06:05.501 --> 00:06:08.891
What I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right,

00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:10.890
and the fact that its adherents are

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.730
or purport to be Muslim

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.140
makes them no less offensive

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.631
than the extreme right anywhere else.

00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:18.498
So in my view, if we consider ourselves

00:06:18.498 --> 00:06:20.248
liberal or left-wing,

00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:22.708
human rights-loving or feminist,

00:06:22.708 --> 00:06:24.909
we must oppose these movements

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.754
and support their grassroots opponents.

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:29.370
Now let me be clear

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.372
that I support an effective struggle
