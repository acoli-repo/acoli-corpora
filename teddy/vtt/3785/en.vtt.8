00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:00.950
Muslim culture as inherently violent,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.535
and some on the left imagine this

00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:04.323
because they view Muslim violence,

00:04:04.323 --> 00:04:05.674
fundamentalist violence,

00:04:05.674 --> 00:04:09.307
solely as a product of legitimate grievances.

00:04:09.307 --> 00:04:11.804
But both views are dead wrong.

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:13.619
In fact, many people of Muslim heritage

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.383
around the world are staunch opponents

00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:19.644
both of fundamentalism and of terrorism,

00:04:19.644 --> 00:04:22.110
and often for very good reason.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.150
You see, they're much more likely to be victims

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.305
of this violence than its perpetrators.

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:29.322
Let me just give you one example.

00:04:29.322 --> 00:04:32.165
According to a 2009 survey
