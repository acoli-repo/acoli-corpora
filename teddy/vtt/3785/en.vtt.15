00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:30.427
of everyone who either practices in a different way

00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:32.391
or chooses not to practice.

00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:35.815
And most definingly, they lead an all-out war

00:07:35.815 --> 00:07:37.896
on the rights of women.

00:07:37.896 --> 00:07:39.692
Now, faced with these movements

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.264
in recent years, Western discourse

00:07:41.264 --> 00:07:42.899
has most often offered

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:45.156
two flawed responses.

00:07:45.156 --> 00:07:47.719
The first that one sometimes finds on the right

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:50.261
suggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.607
or something about Islam is
inherently fundamentalist,

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:56.898
and this is just offensive and wrong,

00:07:56.898 --> 00:07:59.306
but unfortunately on the left
one sometimes encounters

00:07:59.306 --> 00:08:01.488
a discourse that is too politically correct
