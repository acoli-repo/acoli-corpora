00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.010
that sent me on the journey

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.960
to interview 300 people of Muslim heritage

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.494
from nearly 30 countries,

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:37.910
from Afghanistan to Mali,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.251
to find out how they fought fundamentalism

00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:42.479
peacefully like my father did,

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.214
and how they coped with the attendant risks.

00:01:46.214 --> 00:01:48.431
Luckily, back in June of 1993,

00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:51.263
our unidentified visitor went away,

00:01:51.263 --> 00:01:54.308
but other families were so much less lucky,

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:58.161
and that was the thought
that motivated my research.

00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:59.691
In any case, someone would return

00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:01.275
a few months later and leave a note
