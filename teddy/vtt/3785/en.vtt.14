00:06:59.475 --> 00:07:00.998
But what I am saying

00:07:00.998 --> 00:07:04.305
is that we must challenge these
Muslim fundamentalist movements

00:07:04.305 --> 00:07:06.123
because they threaten human rights

00:07:06.123 --> 00:07:08.706
across Muslim-majority contexts,

00:07:08.706 --> 00:07:11.087
and they do this in a range of ways,

00:07:11.087 --> 00:07:14.050
most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.289
by the armed groups that carry those out.

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:19.336
But that violence is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:22.127
These movements as a whole purvey discrimination

00:07:22.127 --> 00:07:25.448
against religious minorities and sexual minorities.

00:07:25.448 --> 00:07:27.528
They seek to curtail the freedom of religion

00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:30.427
of everyone who either practices in a different way
