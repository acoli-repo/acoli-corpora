00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.606
played all the parts.

00:11:01.606 --> 00:11:02.840
They sang and danced,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.498
they played the mice and the water buffalo,

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.962
and I held my breath, wondering,

00:11:07.962 --> 00:11:09.229
would we get to the end

00:11:09.229 --> 00:11:11.515
of this amazing show?

00:11:11.515 --> 00:11:14.071
And when we did, the whole audience

00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:15.809
collectively exhaled,

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:18.073
and a few people actually wept,

00:11:18.073 --> 00:11:20.596
and then they filled the auditorium

00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:23.435
with the peaceful boom of their applause.

00:11:23.435 --> 00:11:26.422
And I remember thinking in that moment

00:11:26.422 --> 00:11:28.853
that the bombers made headlines here

00:11:28.853 --> 00:11:30.516
two years before
