00:07:59.306 --> 00:08:01.488
a discourse that is too politically correct

00:08:01.488 --> 00:08:05.290
to acknowledge the problem of
Muslim fundamentalism at all

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.651
or, even worse, apologizes for it,

00:08:07.651 --> 00:08:10.199
and this is unacceptable as well.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:12.261
So what I'm seeking is a new way

00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.382
of talking about this all together,

00:08:14.382 --> 00:08:17.110
which is grounded in the lived experiences

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.059
and the hope of the people on the front lines.

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:22.010
I'm painfully aware that there has been

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.191
an increase in discrimination
against Muslims in recent years

00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:27.662
in countries like the U.K. and the U.S.,

00:08:27.662 --> 00:08:30.716
and that too is a matter of grave concern,
