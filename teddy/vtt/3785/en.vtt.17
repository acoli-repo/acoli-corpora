00:08:27.662 --> 00:08:30.716
and that too is a matter of grave concern,

00:08:30.716 --> 00:08:31.855
but I firmly believe

00:08:31.855 --> 00:08:34.816

00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:36.142
of people of Muslim heritage

workshop named for his father

00:08:55.793 --> 00:08:57.931
have for years promoted the performing arts

00:08:57.931 --> 00:08:59.663
in Pakistan.

00:08:59.663 --> 00:09:01.124
