00:14:28.776 --> 00:14:30.536
spirited to Somalia,

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:33.906
and then killed when he tried to come home.

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:35.500
Since that time, Mr. Bihi,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.753
who directs the no-budget Somali
Education and Advocacy Center,

00:14:39.753 --> 00:14:42.204
has been vocally denouncing the recruitment

00:14:42.204 --> 00:14:44.060
and the failures of government

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.279
and Somali-American institutions

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:49.304
like the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center

00:14:49.304 --> 00:14:51.535
where he believes his nephew was radicalized

00:14:51.535 --> 00:14:53.641
during a youth program.

00:14:53.641 --> 00:14:55.794
But he doesn't just criticize the mosque.

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.373
He also takes on the government

00:14:57.373 --> 00:14:59.158
for its failure to do more

00:14:59.158 --> 00:15:01.656
to prevent poverty in his community.
