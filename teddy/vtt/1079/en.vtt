00:00:01.278 --> 00:00:05.499
So, as researchers, something
that we often do is use immense resources

00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:08.802
to achieve certain capabilities,
or achieve certain goals.

00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:11.361
And this is essential
to the progress of science,

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:13.710
or exploration of what is possible.

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:15.742
But it creates this unfortunate situation

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.782
where a tiny, tiny fraction of the world

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:19.902
can actually participate
in this exploration

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:21.747
or can benefit from that technology.

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.176
Something that motivates me,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.413
and gets me really excited
about my research,

00:00:25.437 --> 00:00:27.143
is when I see simple opportunities

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:30.967
to drastically change that distribution
and make the technology accessible
