For example, paying more
consideration to sustainability

alongside just about speed,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.496
and also quality over quantity.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.456
But there are really
no simple answers to these questions.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.096
That is exactly why
I'm here to tell everyone

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.000
that we need to watch it, study it,
and play a part in this evolution.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.216
MP: Thank you very much.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.456
AW: Thank you.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.120
