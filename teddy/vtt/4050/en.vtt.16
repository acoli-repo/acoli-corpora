00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.376
they're going to switch
their shopping behaviors online,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.600
like, in no time.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.576
So ultraconvenience and spontaneity,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.456
that's not the full story.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.616
The other trend I have seen in China

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.880
is social shopping.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.056
If you think of social shopping
elsewhere in the world,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.520
it is a linear process.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.696
You pick up something on Facebook,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.336
watch it, and you switch to Amazon

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.056
or brand.com to complete
the shopping journey.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.736
Clean and simple.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.856
But in China it is a very different thing.
