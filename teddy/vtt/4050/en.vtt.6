00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.336
This number tripled
to reach about 25 pairs of shoes a year.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.920
Who would need so many pairs of shoes?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.656
So I asked them,
"What are the reasons you buy?"

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.336
They told me a list of inspirations:

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.016
blogs, celebrity news,
fashion information.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.496
But really, for many of them,
there was no particular reason to buy.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.016
They were just browsing
on their mobile site

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.160
and then buying whatever they saw.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.816
We have observed the same level
of spontaneity in everything,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.520
from grocery shopping
to buying insurance products.
