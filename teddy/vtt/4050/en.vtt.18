One of them took out a pack of snack

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.840
and posted the product link
in that chatroom.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.016
I hate it, because usually
I would just click that link

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.656
and then land on the product page.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.936
Lots of information, very colorful,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.376
mind-blowing.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.136
Watched it and then
a shop assistant came online

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.216
and asked me, "How can I
help you tonight?"

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.416
Of course I bought that pack of snack.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.496
What is more beautiful is I know
that the next day, around noontime,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.376
that pack of snack
will be delivered to my office.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.016
I can eat it and share it
with my colleagues
