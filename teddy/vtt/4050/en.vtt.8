However, this new shopping behavior
is creating a lot of challenges

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.776
for those once-dominant businesses.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.656
The owner of a fashion company
told me that he's so frustrated

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.800
because his customers keep complaining
that his products are not new enough.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.120
Well, for a fashion company,
really bad comment.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.976
And he already increased the number
of products in each collection.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.200
It doesn't seem to work.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.216
So I told him there's something
more important than that.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.696
You've got to give your consumer
exactly what they want

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.960
when they still want it.
