Massimo Portincaso: Angela, 
what you shared with us

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.380
is truly impressive and almost incredible,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.656
but I think many in the audience
had the same question that I had,

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.896
which is:

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.256
Is this kind of impulsive consumption

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.496
both economically and environmentally
sustainable over the longer term?

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.256
And what is the total price to be paid
