00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.680
Then there's a consumer's need
for ultraconvenience.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.456
A couple of months ago,
I was shopping with a friend in Tokyo.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.736
We were in the store,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.576
and there were three to four people
standing in front of us

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.056
at the checkout counter.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.616
Pretty normal, right?

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.416
But both of us dropped our selection

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.640
and walked away.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.680
This is how impatient we have become.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.416
Delivering ultraconvenience
is not just something nice to have.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.520
It is crucial to make sure
your consumer actually buys.
