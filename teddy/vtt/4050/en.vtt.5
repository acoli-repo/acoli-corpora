00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.936
meets with aggregated ecosystems,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.816
chemical reactions happen.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.456
Today, China is like a huge laboratory

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.296
generating all sorts of experiments.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.776
You should come to China,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.400
because here you will get
a glimpse into the future.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.760
One of the trends I have seen
concerns the spontaneity of shopping.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.496
Five years ago, in a fashion study,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.976
we found that on average,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.936
a Chinese consumer would be buying
five to eight pairs of shoes.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.336
This number tripled
to reach about 25 pairs of shoes a year.
