00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Most of the time, art and science stare at each other

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
across a gulf of mutual incomprehension.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There is great confusion when the two look at each other.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Art, of course, looks at the world through the psyche,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the emotions -- the unconscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Science tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
things that can be measured and described --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but it gives art a terrific context of understanding.
