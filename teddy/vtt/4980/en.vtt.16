00:07:58.387 --> 00:08:03.529
I had just become so full of myself
because of the success I'd had

00:08:03.553 --> 00:08:05.593
at Virgin Atlantic,

00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:08.180
that I just wasn't listening.

00:08:08.204 --> 00:08:10.998
AG: Eventually, Sarah landed another job.

00:08:11.022 --> 00:08:15.022
SRO: So I end up working at Atari,
the video game publisher.

00:08:15.046 --> 00:08:16.593
AG: And that was exciting.

00:08:16.617 --> 00:08:18.061
And then you got fired again.

00:08:18.085 --> 00:08:21.442
SRO: Adam, I got laid off the second time.

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:23.125
That is a huge improvement.

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:24.809
(Laughter)

00:08:25.362 --> 00:08:28.187
AG: Like in the past,
Sarah faced a choice:

00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:30.411
she could blame Atari or herself.
