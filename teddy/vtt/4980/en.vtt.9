00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:30.862
and a one-way ticket back to New Zealand,

00:04:30.886 --> 00:04:33.964
because we have to get rid of your visa."

00:04:33.988 --> 00:04:38.592
In other words, "It's our obligation
to send you out of this country,

00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:40.216
that's how bad you are."

00:04:40.823 --> 00:04:44.770
And I remember being in absolute shock.

00:04:45.092 --> 00:04:47.926
I still get sort of, pains of anxiety

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.164
remembering walking
through that fucking office

00:04:50.188 --> 00:04:53.276
with everybody sitting at their desks

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.114
and you know, as I'm walking out,

00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:58.045
they're like little prairie dogs
with their heads popping over

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.664
the tops of their cubes,

00:04:59.688 --> 00:05:03.243
going, "Who is this and why is this loser
being marched out of the office?"
