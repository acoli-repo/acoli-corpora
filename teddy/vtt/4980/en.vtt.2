00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.917
in my pajamas,

00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:03.592
subsisting on ramen noodles and takeout.

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:06.035
I rewrote the paper and sent it back in.

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:09.621
The editor replied with four words:

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:11.494
"Dear Adam, you win."

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:13.836
A few months later,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.731
I had my first publication
in a prestigious journal.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.529
The editor told me

00:01:18.553 --> 00:01:21.619
he didn't give me a second chance
because he believed in my work.

00:01:21.643 --> 00:01:24.553
He gave me a chance
because he saw me accept rejection

00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:26.624
and then use it to improve my work.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.124
I ended up publishing plenty of papers
and getting tenure.
