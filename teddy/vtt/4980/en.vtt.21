Recently, researchers have discovered
that there’s a third option.

00:10:31.887 --> 00:10:33.918
Most if the time, when you get rejected,

00:10:33.942 --> 00:10:35.902
the main reason is not you,

00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:37.085
it's not me,

00:10:37.109 --> 00:10:38.450
it's us.

00:10:40.031 --> 00:10:41.753
That's what Sarah came to understand

00:10:41.777 --> 00:10:44.577
as she started to analyze
her relationship with Atari.

00:10:44.896 --> 00:10:48.095
SRO: You know, I've realized
that that rejection was not a failure,

00:10:48.119 --> 00:10:49.908
it was actually just a mismatch.

00:10:49.932 --> 00:10:51.440
Because I just was like,

00:10:51.464 --> 00:10:53.193
I could have avoided this

00:10:53.217 --> 00:10:58.475
if I had actually picked a job
in an industry or a category

00:10:58.499 --> 00:11:01.344
where I had a lot more knowledge.
