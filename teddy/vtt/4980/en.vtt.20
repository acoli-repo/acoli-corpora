For a long time, psychologists
only studied two kinds of explanations:

00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:03.386
blaming others and blaming ourselves.

00:10:03.942 --> 00:10:06.022
You heard Sarah do both at Virgin.

00:10:06.046 --> 00:10:08.442
And then, blame herself again at Atari.

00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:11.879
SRO: My confidence was just
at an all-time low.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.822
AG: In some situations, those reactions
may be totally appropriate.

00:10:16.244 --> 00:10:19.322
Yet, blaming ourselves
often makes us weaker.

00:10:19.346 --> 00:10:21.370
It leaves our confidence shattered.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:24.188
Blaming others makes us weaker, too.

00:10:24.212 --> 00:10:27.249
It prevents us from learning
from our own mistakes.

00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:31.863
Recently, researchers have discovered
that there’s a third option.
