00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.124
I ended up publishing plenty of papers
and getting tenure.

00:01:31.507 --> 00:01:33.959
But making a name in the field
hasn't really helped.

00:01:33.983 --> 00:01:36.459
We submit papers anonymously
for blind review,

00:01:36.483 --> 00:01:38.723
and I still get rejected all the time.

00:01:39.348 --> 00:01:41.584
I've already had two papers
rejected this year.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.188
One reviewer even wrote,

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:47.127
"You should go back
and the read the work of Adam Grant."

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:50.086
Dude, I am Adam Grant!

00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:53.393
There are different ways
to cope with rejection

00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:55.131
that can help you get through it.

00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:57.599
But there are also techniques
for handling rejection

00:01:57.623 --> 00:01:59.761
that can actually make you stronger.
