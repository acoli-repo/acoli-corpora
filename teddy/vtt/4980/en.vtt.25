SRO: When I look back
and realize that yes,

00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:40.021
a giant amount of the screwups was me,

00:12:40.045 --> 00:12:44.432
but a big chunk of it also
was that I was the wrong person

00:12:44.456 --> 00:12:46.164
in wildly the wrong environment,

00:12:46.188 --> 00:12:52.331
and I just realize now that

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:56.171
sometimes, I think, it's really easy
to beat yourself up

00:12:56.195 --> 00:12:57.955
of all the stuff you're doing wrong,

00:12:57.979 --> 00:13:01.082
when in actual fact, the same person
can be a screaming success
