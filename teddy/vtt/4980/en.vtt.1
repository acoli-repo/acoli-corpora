00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:30.195
I spent months perfecting it,

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:32.910
got feedback from more
than a dozen leading thinkers

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.068
and shipped it to our premier journal.

00:00:35.092 --> 00:00:37.092

00:00:56.248 --> 00:00:57.776
So I did the opposite.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.736
I spent the next three days at my desk,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.917
in my pajamas,
