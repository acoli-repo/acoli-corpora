00:11:29.018 --> 00:11:31.704
"Why the fuck is no one
wanting to go for a run with me?"

00:11:31.728 --> 00:11:36.532
Like, I had nothing in common
with the people that I worked with,

00:11:36.556 --> 00:11:40.444
let alone the product, so yeah,
it was a bad fit.

00:11:40.468 --> 00:11:41.618
(Laughter)

00:11:42.858 --> 00:11:44.143
AG: The fit.

00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:46.633
That's often a better way
to look at things.

00:11:46.657 --> 00:11:49.283
Therapists point out
that in any relationship,

00:11:49.307 --> 00:11:51.562
there are not two, but three parties:

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.501
you, the other person

00:11:53.525 --> 00:11:55.020
and the relationship itself.

00:11:55.796 --> 00:11:58.446
What's usually to blame
is the relationship,

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.270
the fit between you and me.
