(Theme music)

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.534
In case it's not clear yet,
I'm Adam Grant,

00:02:06.558 --> 00:02:08.872
and this is WorkLife, my podcast with TED.

00:02:09.447 --> 00:02:11.329
I'm an organizational psychologist.

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:14.203
I study how to make work not suck.

00:02:14.972 --> 00:02:16.123
In this show,

00:02:16.147 --> 00:02:19.608
I'm inviting myself inside the minds
of some truly unusual people,

00:02:19.632 --> 00:02:22.886
because they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work.

00:02:23.432 --> 00:02:25.553
Today: rejection

00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:28.291
and how it's possible
to not just bounce back,

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:29.582
but bounce forward.
