Which would make it awfully difficult
to pass on your genes.

Even though rejection rarely has
life or death consequences today,

00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:39.654
we're still wired to have
those intense reactions.

00:05:40.457 --> 00:05:44.322
Neuroscientists argue that rejection
actually causes physical pain.

00:05:45.193 --> 00:05:46.970
There's a great demonstration of this

00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:49.551
in a cruel online game called Cyberball.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.168
On your computer screen,

00:05:51.192 --> 00:05:53.757

with a few other players,

00:05:53.781 --> 00:05:55.236
like a game of catch.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.635
But after a little while,

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.785
the other players suddenly
stop passing the ball to you.
