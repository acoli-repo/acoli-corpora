going, "Who is this and why is this loser
being marched out of the office?"

00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:06.559
And it's just a horrific feeling of ...

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.425
I don't know. You feel like a criminal.

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:10.663
AG: Rejection.

00:05:10.687 --> 00:05:13.603
It leaves us feeling
incompetent and worthless.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.231
The pain of rejection often gets
explained in terms of evolution.

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:19.485
In prehistoric times,

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.839
if being rejected didn't bother you,
you could end up on your own,

00:05:22.863 --> 00:05:27.182
with no food and no group to protect you
from being mauled by a tiger.

00:05:27.498 --> 00:05:30.616
Which would make it awfully difficult
to pass on your genes.
