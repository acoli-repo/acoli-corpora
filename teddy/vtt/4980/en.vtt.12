00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:01.664
You've been excluded,

00:06:01.688 --> 00:06:03.955

To find out, neuroscientists
scanned people's brains

00:06:09.228 --> 00:06:11.085
while they were playing Cyberball.

00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:12.983

You can see the same

00:06:19.362 --> 00:06:23.425
when people who have recently been dumped
are shown pictures of their exes.

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.622
It's not exactly the same
as physical pain, but it does hurt.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.350
It won't surprise you
that over 100 studies have documented
