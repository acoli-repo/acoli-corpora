And new evidence shows that when
people get negative feedback at work,

00:12:04.431 --> 00:12:06.351

to the individuals involved,

00:12:08.543 --> 00:12:11.373
they don't wallow in self-pity
or lash out in anger.

00:12:11.892 --> 00:12:13.829

00:12:22.114 --> 00:12:25.066
the biggest problem lies
not in individuals,

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.661
but in relationships.

00:12:27.363 --> 00:12:30.371

not just bounce back,
