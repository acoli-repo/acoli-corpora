00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.496
She blamed herself.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.022
SRO: I entirely took the blame.
I was just like --

00:08:36.046 --> 00:08:40.583
it was all me, and I didn't really
see any other part of it.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.646
I think having gone
from a firing to a layoff,

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.618
I was just like, "What has happened?
Is my career over?

00:08:49.642 --> 00:08:52.966
Am I ever going to get
back on my feet again?"

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.561
AG: It took Sarah many months
of reflection to see things differently,

00:08:56.585 --> 00:08:58.686
that this wasn't the end of her career.

00:08:59.173 --> 00:09:03.061
And she also realized that it was time
to stop ruminating about the past.
