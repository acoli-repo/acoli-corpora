00:10:58.499 --> 00:11:01.344
where I had a lot more knowledge.

00:11:01.666 --> 00:11:04.111
AG: And video games

00:11:04.135 --> 00:11:07.920
SRO: And video games
were so not that category.

00:11:08.373 --> 00:11:11.625
I actually hate video games,

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:15.182
which is enormously hard
when your job is marketing.

00:11:15.514 --> 00:11:17.291
You know, at lunch time,

00:11:17.315 --> 00:11:21.882
the entire place would just go silent
with the sound of the mouses clicking,

00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:26.192
with the entire office playing this
massively multiplayer game

00:11:26.216 --> 00:11:27.494
or whatever they call it.

00:11:27.518 --> 00:11:28.994
And I'm sitting there going,

00:11:29.018 --> 00:11:31.704
"Why the fuck is no one
wanting to go for a run with me?"
