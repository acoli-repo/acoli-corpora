00:06:57.225 --> 00:07:01.680
I would feel this absolute
pang of devastation, like,

00:07:01.704 --> 00:07:04.104
"Why is this happening to me again?"

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:07.022
AG: Getting fired is even worse.

00:07:07.046 --> 00:07:08.752
Research shows that losing your job

00:07:08.776 --> 00:07:10.999
predicts a cascade
of negative life events,

00:07:11.023 --> 00:07:15.868
from financial strain to depression,
to marital conflict and poor health.

00:07:16.914 --> 00:07:20.437
When you get fired, there's a natural way
to respond to the rejection --

00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:22.517
by trying to protect your ego:

00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:24.492
"It's not me, it's you."

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.204
That's what Sarah did at Virgin.

00:07:27.228 --> 00:07:30.712
She started pointing fingers,
blaming her employer.
