00:13:26.688 --> 00:13:30.371
But I also knew that if
I was able to speak to it,

00:13:30.395 --> 00:13:31.934
then with any luck,

00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.840
you know, that sort of takes
the sting out of the awkwardness

00:13:34.864 --> 00:13:36.815
of the elephant in the room.

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:39.387
And it shows a level of self-awareness.

00:13:39.411 --> 00:13:43.834
AG: After a grueling interview process,
Sarah ended up with an offer.

00:13:43.858 --> 00:13:47.271
SRO: By the way,
it was a title cut, a pay cut,

00:13:47.295 --> 00:13:50.573
it was a much smaller job
than anything I'd been doing.

00:13:50.597 --> 00:13:53.903
But I was like, I will take anything
just to get in the door

00:13:53.927 --> 00:13:56.157
and prove myself again

00:13:56.181 --> 00:14:00.180
in a big, respected company
that obviously Nike was.
