00:16:29.307 --> 00:16:31.817
And you’ll be surprised
for how many people it has.

00:16:32.727 --> 00:16:35.411
When you tell someone, you know,

00:16:35.435 --> 00:16:38.934
"Here's the areas where I screwed up,
and here's what I'm not good at,"

00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:43.138
you immediately sort of put yourself
into a position of strength,

00:16:43.162 --> 00:16:45.736
because the expectation
of what you're going to deliver

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.307
is the stuff you've said
you're really good at.

00:16:48.331 --> 00:16:54.533
And the other stuff -- you've already
sort of taken away the fear and worry

00:16:54.557 --> 00:16:56.617
that you're going to get put in a position

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:59.204
that you can't necessarily deliver.

00:16:59.228 --> 00:17:02.783
