it's almost a must these days
to be sustainable.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.331
on living in places that are
taking action on climate change

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:16.259
and achieving net zero.

00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:18.648

00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:23.319

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.123
UK member of parliament for Scunthorpe,

00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:30.428
home to one of the last
