00:03:58.273 --> 00:04:01.130
yet native Hawaiians like myself

00:04:01.154 --> 00:04:04.240
die a full decade
before our non-native counterparts,

00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:08.315
because we have some
of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes,

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:09.490
obesity,

00:04:09.514 --> 00:04:12.039
and the number one and number
two killers in the US:

00:04:12.063 --> 00:04:13.902
cardiovascular disease and cancer.

00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:15.645
So how do we ensure

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.820
the populations of people
that need genome sequencing the most

00:04:18.844 --> 00:04:20.264
are not the last to benefit?

00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:25.394
My vision is to make
genetic research more native,

00:04:25.418 --> 00:04:27.829
to indigenize genome
sequencing technology.

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:31.933
Traditionally, genomes
are sequenced in laboratories.
