00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:07.583
This got my curious about what
makes us unique as Hawaiians --

00:01:07.607 --> 00:01:09.448
namely, our genetic makeup.

00:01:10.964 --> 00:01:12.908
But it wasn't until high school,

00:01:12.932 --> 00:01:14.544
through the Human Genome Project,

00:01:14.568 --> 00:01:16.767
that I realized I wasn't alone

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:19.619
in trying to connect
our unique genetic ancestry

00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:23.325
to our potential health,
wellness and illness.

00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:25.211
You see,

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:27.034
the 2.7 billion-dollar project

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:31.048
promised an era of predictive
and preventative medicine
