00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:01.000
It doesn't have the same
physical limitations,

00:05:01.024 --> 00:05:05.300
in that it's not tethered to a lab bench
with extraneous cords,

00:05:05.324 --> 00:05:07.849
large vats of chemicals
or computer monitors.

00:05:08.456 --> 00:05:13.607
It allows us to de-black box genome
sequencing technology development

00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:16.243
in a way that's immersive
and collaborative,

00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:19.005
activating and empowering
indigenous communities ...

00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:21.917
as citizen scientists.

00:05:23.092 --> 00:05:25.648
100 years later in Kalaupapa,

00:05:25.672 --> 00:05:29.911
we now have the technology to sequence
leprosy bacteria in real time,

00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:32.823
using mobile genome sequencers,
