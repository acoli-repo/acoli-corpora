00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.215
This culminated in a sort of domino effect

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.001
with local tribes in the Southwest --

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:35.454
including the Navajo Nation,

00:03:35.478 --> 00:03:37.565
one of the largest
tribes in the country --

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:39.836
putting a moratorium on genetic research.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.741
Now despite this history of distrust,

00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:47.240
I still believe that indigenous people
can benefit from genetic research.

00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:49.509
And if we don't do something soon,

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:52.400
the gap in health disparities
is going to continue to widen.

00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:54.518
Hawaii, for example,

00:03:54.542 --> 00:03:58.249
has the longest life expectancy
on average of any state in the US,

00:03:58.273 --> 00:04:01.130
yet native Hawaiians like myself
