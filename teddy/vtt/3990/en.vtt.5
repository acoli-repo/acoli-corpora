So how many of you
would be shocked to learn

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.221
that 95 percent of clinical trials

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:37.661
have also exclusively featured
individuals of European ancestry?

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:39.722
This bias

00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:43.587
and systematic lack of engagement
of indigenous people

00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:46.595
in both clinical trials
and genome studies

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.559
is partially the result
of a history of distrust.

00:02:50.893 --> 00:02:52.043
For example,

00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:55.996
in 1989, researchers
from Arizona State University

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.586
obtained blood samples
from Arizona's Havasupai tribe,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.544
promising to alleviate the burden
of type 2 diabetes
