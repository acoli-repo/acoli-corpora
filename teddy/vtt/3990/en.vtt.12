00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.419
on the potential use and misuse
of genetic information.

00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:06.171
Eventually we'd like to have our own
IndiGenomics research institute

00:06:06.195 --> 00:06:07.624
to conduct our own experiments

00:06:07.648 --> 00:06:10.783
and educate the next generation
of indigenous scientists.

00:06:11.523 --> 00:06:13.084
In the end,

00:06:13.108 --> 00:06:17.700
indigenous people need to be partners in
and not subjects of genetic research.

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:20.132
And for those on the outside,

00:06:20.156 --> 00:06:21.640
just as Father Damien did,

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:26.983
the research community needs
to immerse itself in indigenous culture

00:06:27.007 --> 00:06:28.960
or die trying.

00:06:28.984 --> 00:06:30.189
