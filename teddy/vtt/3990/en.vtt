00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.071
As a little Hawaiian,

00:00:02.095 --> 00:00:05.477
my mom and auntie always told me
stories about Kalaupapa --

00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:06.822
the Hawaiian leper colony

00:00:06.846 --> 00:00:09.673
surrounded by the highest
sea cliffs in the world --

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:11.109
and Father Damien,

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.561
the Belgian missionary who gave his life
for the Hawaiian community.

00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:16.465
As a young nurse,

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:19.430
my aunt trained the nuns
caring for the remaining lepers

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:22.731
almost a 100 years after
Father Damien died of leprosy.

00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:26.172
I remember stories she told

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:29.148
about traveling down
switchback cliff paths on a mule,

00:00:29.172 --> 00:00:32.303
while my uncle played
her favorite hula songs on the ukulele
