Traditionally, genomes
are sequenced in laboratories.

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:35.143
Here's an image of your classic
genome sequencer.

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:36.318
It's huge.

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:38.094
It's the size of a refrigerator.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.817
There's this obvious physical limitation.

00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:44.440
But what if you could sequence
genomes on the fly?

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.511
What if you could fit a genome
sequencer in your pocket?

00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:54.246
This nanopore-based sequencer

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.755
is one 10,000th the size
of your traditional genome sequencer.

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:01.000
It doesn't have the same
physical limitations,
