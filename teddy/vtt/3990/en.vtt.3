WEBVTT

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:31.048
promised an era of predictive
and preventative medicine

00:01:31.072 --> 00:01:33.485
based on our unique genetic makeup.

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:35.525
So to me it always seemed obvious

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.277
that in order to achieve this dream,

00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:42.314
we would need to sequence
a diverse cohort of people

00:01:42.338 --> 00:01:45.742
to obtain the full spectrum
of human genetic variation on the planet.

00:01:46.303 --> 00:01:48.875
That's why 10 years later,

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.573
it continues to shock me,

00:01:50.597 --> 00:01:53.811
knowing that 96 percent of genome studies

00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:57.415
associating common genetic variation
with specific diseases

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.240
have focused exclusively
on individuals of European ancestry.
