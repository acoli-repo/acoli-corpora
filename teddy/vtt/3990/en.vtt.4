00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.240
have focused exclusively
on individuals of European ancestry.

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.478
Now you don't need a PhD

00:02:03.502 --> 00:02:06.535
to see that that leaves four percent
for the rest of diversity.

00:02:07.164 --> 00:02:09.292
And in my own searching,

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:11.825
I've discovered that far less
than one percent

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.923
have actually focused on indigenous
communities, like myself.

00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:17.528
So that begs the question:

00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:20.099
Who is the Human Genome
Project actually for?

00:02:20.853 --> 00:02:23.211
Just like we have
different colored eyes and hair,

00:02:23.235 --> 00:02:24.743
we metabolize drugs differently

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:26.634
based on the variation in our genomes.

00:02:26.978 --> 00:02:30.415
So how many of you
would be shocked to learn
