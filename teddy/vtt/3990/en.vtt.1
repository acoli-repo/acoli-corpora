00:00:29.172 --> 00:00:32.303
while my uncle played
her favorite hula songs on the ukulele

00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:34.004
all the way down to Kalaupapa.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.231
You see, as a youngster,

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:38.191
I was always curious about a few things.

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:43.731
First was why a Belgian missionary
chose to live in complete isolation

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:44.945
in Kalaupapa,

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.199
knowing he would inevitably
contract leprosy

00:00:47.223 --> 00:00:49.603
from the community of people
he sought to help.

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:52.593
And secondly,

00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:54.978
where did the leprosy bacteria come from?

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.757
And why were Kānaka Maoli,

00:00:56.781 --> 00:00:59.030
the indigenous people of Hawaii,

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:03.416
so susceptible to developing
leprosy, or "mai Pake?"
