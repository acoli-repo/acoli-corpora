00:09:01.296 --> 00:09:05.027
Each of those is an outcome;
you would like something to happen.

00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:08.133
Now, I'd like you to think
about the following:

00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:10.030
actions are within your control,

00:09:10.054 --> 00:09:11.942
not entirely, but to a large extent.

00:09:12.443 --> 00:09:15.029
The outcome is completely
out of your control.

00:09:15.613 --> 00:09:16.764
OK?

00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:18.480
Actions are within your control.

00:09:18.504 --> 00:09:20.737
The outcome is completely
outside your control.

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.222
Have any of you recognized
that when you have a goal

00:09:23.246 --> 00:09:25.260
and you start to work towards it,

00:09:25.284 --> 00:09:27.582
some of the time
you don't achieve your goal,

00:09:27.606 --> 00:09:29.329
and some of the time what you get

00:09:29.353 --> 00:09:31.704
is the exact opposite of what you wanted?
