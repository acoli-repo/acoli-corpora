This is a conference on happiness,

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:02.651
but even if it wasn't
a conference on happiness,

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:07.776
would it be right if I said
that in some way, shape, fashion or form,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.005
you're devoting your entire life

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:11.205
to being happy?

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:16.390
Everything you do -- your job, family,
children, relationships, whatever --

00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:18.576
is a quest for happiness.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.931
Correct?

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.109
I'd like you to think about the following:

00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:26.909
What do you have to get

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:29.434
in order to be happy?

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:31.553
We're just going to spend
a minute on this.
