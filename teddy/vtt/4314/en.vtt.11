Ten years ago, if you remember clearly,

00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:31.934
there were certain things you wanted.

00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.108
Is that correct?

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:35.164
Odds are pretty good

00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:38.291
that many of those things you wanted
10 years ago you now have.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:39.465
Is that correct?

00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:42.175
Where has that left you?

00:05:44.704 --> 00:05:47.117
In exactly the same place, right?

00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:51.884
What we don't realize
is the model itself is flawed.

00:05:51.908 --> 00:05:54.902
The if-then model --
"If this happens I will be happy" --

00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:56.970
the model itself is flawed.

00:05:57.462 --> 00:06:01.530
But instead of recognizing
that it is the model itself that's flawed,
