00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:00.025
at that instant,

00:07:01.157 --> 00:07:05.657
you accepted the universe
exactly as it was.

00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:07.839

but it's kind of off to the left,

00:07:10.823 --> 00:07:13.216
and if I could move it

00:07:24.972 --> 00:07:26.615
I'd make it ever so much better."

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:28.632
Oh no, the rainbow off-center

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:29.814
was just fine.

00:07:29.838 --> 00:07:31.480
The tree with its crooked branches
