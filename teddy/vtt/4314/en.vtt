00:00:01.182 --> 00:00:04.617
I have a vision for each one of you,

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:06.445
and the vision I have for you

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:08.851
is that when you wake up in the morning,

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:12.379
your blood is singing at the thought
of being who you are

00:00:12.403 --> 00:00:14.324
and doing what you do;

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:15.880
that as you go through the day,

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:19.387
you can literally sink
to your knees in gratitude

00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:23.542
at the tremendous good fortune
that's been bestowed on you;

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.107
that as you go through the day,

00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:29.734
you become radiantly alive several times.
