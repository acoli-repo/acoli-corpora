00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.869
And the more we invest in a mental model,

00:04:00.893 --> 00:04:04.658
the more it appears that this, in fact,
is the way the world works.

00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:06.905
But it isn't: it's just a mental model,

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:10.568
and the mental model we have
that we buy into so strongly

00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:14.469
is that we have to get something
so we can do something

00:04:14.493 --> 00:04:16.021
so we can be something.

00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:19.903
Like, we have to get a great deal of money
so we can travel to exotic places

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:21.187
so we can be happy.

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:25.418
We have to be in a relationship
so we can have great sex

00:04:25.442 --> 00:04:26.702
so we can be happy.

00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:32.295
All of this is a variation
of the if-then model.
