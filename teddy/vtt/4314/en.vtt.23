00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:30.617
He's very well-known in the United States

00:11:30.641 --> 00:11:32.679
and certainly among basketball fans.

00:11:33.148 --> 00:11:37.002
He's the only person ever to make
the basketball Hall of Fame

00:11:37.026 --> 00:11:39.162
both as a player and as a coach.

00:11:39.804 --> 00:11:41.774
And what he told his entering team --

00:11:41.798 --> 00:11:47.872
he led UCLA to an unprecedented number
of victories and finals in the NCAA --

00:11:47.896 --> 00:11:53.329
and what he used to tell any new team
is he never spoke about winning.

00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:58.298
He always said, "When it's over
and you look in the mirror,

00:11:58.322 --> 00:12:01.027
did you do the best
that you were capable of?
