00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.115

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:36.268
And you have to get counseling for her

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.395
to help her deal with
feelings of inadequacy

00:14:39.419 --> 00:14:43.831
and not being able to achieve
and fail yet again.

00:14:43.855 --> 00:14:47.594
How long do you think it would take her
to learn to walk if you had to do that,

00:14:47.618 --> 00:14:50.578

you had to get a counselor

00:14:50.602 --> 00:14:52.423
to counsel her and so on?

00:14:52.781 --> 00:14:54.185
Sounds funny, doesn't it?

00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:56.733
But that is exactly what we're doing.

00:14:56.757 --> 00:15:01.015
What the child is doing
is focusing on the process.
