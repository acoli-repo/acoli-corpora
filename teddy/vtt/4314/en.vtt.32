00:15:59.131 --> 00:16:01.749
here's how big my office is,
how deep the carpeting is,

00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:03.320
how many windows I have --

00:16:03.344 --> 00:16:04.812
a bunch of parameters.

00:16:05.835 --> 00:16:08.534
And what I tell them is what
I want to share with you,

00:16:08.558 --> 00:16:11.820
because all of that stuff --
first of all, it doesn't exist.

00:16:11.844 --> 00:16:14.487
But second, even if it did
and you were plugged into it,

00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:16.352
it would not take more than six months

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:19.811
for you to be the same sorry,
miserable self there as you are now,

00:16:20.795 --> 00:16:24.233
because passion exists inside you.

00:16:24.257 --> 00:16:26.787
It does not exist in the job.

00:16:27.436 --> 00:16:30.989
And if you don't find a way
to ignite it within you
