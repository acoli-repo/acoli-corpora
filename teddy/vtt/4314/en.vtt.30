00:14:56.757 --> 00:15:01.015
What the child is doing
is focusing on the process.

00:15:01.039 --> 00:15:03.895
She's investing in the process,

00:15:03.919 --> 00:15:05.709
not in the outcome.

00:15:06.812 --> 00:15:09.409
What we do is the exact opposite.

00:15:09.433 --> 00:15:13.278
As we grow up, we lose the ability
to invest in the process,

00:15:13.302 --> 00:15:15.475
we start investing in the outcome.

00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:19.111
By definition the outcome
is outside of our control,

00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:21.912
and if that's where we spend
all of our emotional energy,

00:15:21.936 --> 00:15:24.191
we are going to get drained as we do.

00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:26.500
But if, on the other hand, we said,

00:15:26.524 --> 00:15:29.215
"Here is the outcome,
I am going to invest in the process

00:15:29.239 --> 00:15:31.572
and give it every single bit I could,"
