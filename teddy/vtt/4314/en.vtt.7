00:03:24.748 --> 00:03:30.228
Let me repeat that: you have spent
your entire life learning to be unhappy.

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:33.254
And the way we learn to be unhappy

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:36.346
is by buying into
a particular mental model.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.797
A mental model is a notion we have

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.865

how to pick a restaurant to eat at,

00:03:48.231 --> 00:03:51.295
how to have a movie
to go to ... dozens of them.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.469
The problem isn't
that we have mental models.

00:03:53.493 --> 00:03:56.655
The problem is that we don't know
that we have mental models.

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:58.885
We think this is the way the world works.

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.869
And the more we invest in a mental model,
