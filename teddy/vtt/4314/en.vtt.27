00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:30.222
you select another outcome and keep going.

00:13:30.828 --> 00:13:34.264
And when you do that, you will find
that every day is a blast.

00:13:34.817 --> 00:13:36.138
Let me give you an example.

00:13:36.162 --> 00:13:39.297
And if you have children -- raise
your hands if you have children.

00:13:39.321 --> 00:13:41.788
Have you ever seen
a small child learn to walk?

00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:45.921
What happens, and this happens
typically between 11 and 13 months,

00:13:45.945 --> 00:13:49.641
is the child gets up
and she sees everybody walking,

00:13:49.665 --> 00:13:53.281
she wants to walk, she gets up,
she falls down, she starts crying

00:13:53.305 --> 00:13:57.261
and momma runs up and comforts her,
kisses the place, makes it well.

00:13:57.285 --> 00:14:00.224
She tries again, falls down,
mommy runs up again.
