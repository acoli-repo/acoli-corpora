00:02:57.675 --> 00:03:01.594
And invariably, somebody articulates
what many of you are thinking,

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:05.201
which is: "If happiness
is my innate nature,

00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:07.519
how come I am not experiencing it?

00:03:07.543 --> 00:03:10.766
How come I am experiencing my life sucks?"

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.832
(Laughter)

00:03:12.856 --> 00:03:15.887
And the answer to that
is actually very simple.

00:03:16.602 --> 00:03:20.603
You have spent your entire life

00:03:20.627 --> 00:03:23.224
learning to be unhappy.

00:03:24.748 --> 00:03:30.228
Let me repeat that: you have spent
your entire life learning to be unhappy.
