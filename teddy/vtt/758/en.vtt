00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.996
Now, if President Obama

00:00:02.996 --> 00:00:06.996
invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics,

00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:09.996
then I would have a suggestion for him

00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:11.996
that I think would vastly improve

00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:14.996
the mathematics education in this country.

00:00:14.996 --> 00:00:16.996
And it would be easy to implement

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:18.996
and inexpensive.

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:20.996
The mathematics curriculum that we have

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:24.996
is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:26.996
And everything we learn after that

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:29.996
is building up towards one subject.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:33.996
And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.
