00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:03.523
So last year, on the Fourth of July,

00:00:03.523 --> 00:00:06.022
experiments at the Large Hadron Collider

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:08.312
discovered the Higgs boson.

00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:10.280
It was a historical day.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.575
There's no doubt that from now on,

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:14.409
the Fourth of July will be remembered

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.851
not as the day of the Declaration of Independence,

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:20.685
but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:23.117
Well, at least, here at CERN.

00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:27.272
But for me, the biggest surprise of that day

00:00:27.272 --> 00:00:29.771
was that there was no big surprise.

00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:32.370
In the eye of a theoretical physicist,
