I'm not sure what you might think

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:05.976
when you think about
the job of a police officer.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.934
Recent events have sparked lots of debate
over the role of law enforcement

00:00:09.958 --> 00:00:11.309
in our society

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.976
and if it should change.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.375
And that's a big, important conversation
that we all need have.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.018
But today I'd like to talk about something

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:22.184

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:26.018
something not often discussed
when talking about police work,

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:29.976
and that's dealing
with trauma, hurt and loss.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.809
What's it like to tell someone --
