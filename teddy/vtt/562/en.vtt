00:00:00.852 --> 00:00:04.025
Last summer, I got a call
from a woman named Ellie.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.289
And she had heard about the family
separations at the southern border

00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:09.815
and wanted to know
what she could do to help.

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.788
She told me the story
of her grandfather and his father.

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:16.373
When they were kids in Poland,

00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:17.640
their father,

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:19.568
fearing for his son's safety,

00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:22.726
gave them a little bit of money
and told them to walk west,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.110
to just keep walking west across Europe.

00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:26.293
And they did.

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.335
They walked all the way
west across Europe,

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.385
and they got on a boat
and they got to America.
