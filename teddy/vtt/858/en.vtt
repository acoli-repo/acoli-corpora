Those of you who know me know how passionate I am

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about opening the space frontier.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I want to tell you that story.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We have something called the Genome 100 --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Craig Venter chairs that event.
