said, "Well, why do you think
we didn't just pass through each other?"

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:38.339
And first of all, I thought,
"Who the hell are you?"

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:40.385
But second, the question annoyed me,

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.201
because the answer is so simple.

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:45.308
I said, "We didn't pass through each other

00:03:45.332 --> 00:03:47.576
because elementary particles have mass

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.973
and because the space
between elementary particles

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:53.369
is filled with the binding energy
that also has the properties of mass,

00:03:53.393 --> 00:03:55.573
and we've known that for 800 years."

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.875
She must have been in one of those moods

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:01.787
where she likes to mess with strangers.
