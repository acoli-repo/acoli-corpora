00:00:29.132 --> 00:00:30.283
in the open air,

00:00:30.307 --> 00:00:32.172
on a beach under a palm tree,

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.615
in the exact spot
where your stage used to be.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.734
I have 12 minutes with you.

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:42.043
I set a limit.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.005
My wife Navid once said

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:48.030
that infinite possibility
is a creator's worst enemy.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:51.510
For example, this dress: I'd asked
her to design something

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:54.887
that a priest might have worn
in 23rd-century Cairo.

00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.943
But we only had three days to make it,

00:00:57.967 --> 00:00:59.671
and the only fabric we had

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:02.416
was an old duvet cover
that another resident left behind.
