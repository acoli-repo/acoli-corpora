And she threw me out.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.412
I still got to watch, though.

00:10:39.748 --> 00:10:41.480
Humans live 400 years now,

00:10:41.504 --> 00:10:42.882
and we still die.

00:10:42.906 --> 00:10:45.114
And when death comes,

00:10:46.342 --> 00:10:49.597
the dying still pick at their bedsheets,

00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:56.130
and their arms break out
in blue and violet blooms on the insides,

00:10:56.154 --> 00:10:59.668
and their breaths get further
and further apart,

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:02.341
like they're falling asleep.
