00:08:32.468 --> 00:08:33.858
So, even here on Earth,

00:08:33.882 --> 00:08:36.579
I kept working on how to extend life.

00:08:37.198 --> 00:08:38.349
It didn't occur to me

00:08:38.373 --> 00:08:40.416
that there could be any other response.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.979
I kept going back to that thing
that Navid said to me

00:08:43.003 --> 00:08:44.742
that day in Azadi Square,

00:08:44.766 --> 00:08:46.707
that without that basic constraint --

00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:49.762
a universe that granted mass to matter --

00:08:49.786 --> 00:08:51.183
we would not exist.

00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:54.652
That's one rule.

00:08:54.676 --> 00:08:58.564
Another rule is that all mass
is subject to entropy.

00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:02.700
And there is no way to be
in this universe without mass.
