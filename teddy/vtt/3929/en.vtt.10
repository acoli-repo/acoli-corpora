00:04:56.276 --> 00:05:00.810
It was like we were both heroes
climbing up into a mountain range together

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:03.289
and we kept arriving at new vistas,

00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:06.309
and these new, perfect
constellations of words

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:08.190
would come out of us to describe them.

00:05:08.214 --> 00:05:10.338
And we'd forget them
as soon as we made them,

00:05:10.362 --> 00:05:13.783
and throw them over our shoulder
and go on to the next thing, on and up.

00:05:13.807 --> 00:05:17.721
Or one time, Navid said that our talk
was like we were always making bread,

00:05:17.745 --> 00:05:21.264
and that we were always
adding in a little more flour

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:22.737
and a little more water,

00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:24.714
and folding it in and turning it over

00:05:24.738 --> 00:05:28.412
and never getting around to baking it.
