like they're falling asleep.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.034
I've always thought that

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.890
what gives a life meaning is adventure.

00:11:15.476 --> 00:11:17.869
And death is just a problem

00:11:17.893 --> 00:11:20.361
we haven't discovered the solution to yet.

00:11:24.594 --> 00:11:27.297
But maybe a life has meaning
only because it ends.

00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:29.544
Maybe that's the paradox:

00:11:29.568 --> 00:11:33.419
constraints don't constrain,
they allow perfect freedom.
