00:01:58.589 --> 00:02:01.063
the longer we live,
the longer we want to live,

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.715
the less we want to die.

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:05.310
Who can blame us?

00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:09.441
The universe is so big.

00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:12.454
There won't ever not be more to see.

00:02:12.478 --> 00:02:13.629
Just yesterday,

00:02:13.653 --> 00:02:16.413
I was reading about how you can
take out a boat on Europa

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:18.851
and sail from island to island
all over the planet,

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:22.108
and some of the islands have villages
that you can stay and visit

00:02:22.132 --> 00:02:24.921
and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter.

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:28.992
And then there's this other island
where there's just one songwriter

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:31.493
who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean.
