Mariapolis on the South Pole,
and Ramachandran on the Equator.

00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:09.962
And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility.

00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:14.448
That's where Navid and I met.

00:03:14.472 --> 00:03:16.457
We were both artists downtown.

00:03:18.138 --> 00:03:20.994
The day we met, we were passing
each other in Azadi Square,

00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:22.480
and we bumped shoulders.

00:03:22.504 --> 00:03:24.255
And I turned to apologize

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:28.578
and she, without saying hello
or introducing herself or anything,

00:03:28.602 --> 00:03:32.140
said, "Well, why do you think
we didn't just pass through each other?"
