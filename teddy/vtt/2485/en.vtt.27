WEBVTT

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.840
We support Angolan journalists
who are being illegally detained.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.696
For the first time ever,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.176
African pain and African aspiration

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.496
has the ability to be witnessed

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.136
by those who can empathize
with it the most:

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.440
other Africans.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.856
I believe that with
a social Pan-Africanist thinking

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.920
and using the Internet as a tool,

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.776
we can begin to rescue each other,

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.376
and ultimately, to rescue ourselves.
