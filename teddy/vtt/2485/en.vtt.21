to fulfill regional agreements
they've already signed.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.336
But I think that the biggest way
for Africa to share its successes

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.800
is to foster something
I like to call social Pan-Africanism.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.176
Now, political Pan-Africanism
already exists,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.800
so I'm not inventing anything
totally new here.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.936
But political Pan-Africanism

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.496
is usually the African unity
of the political elite.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.856
And who does that benefit?

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.640
Well, African leaders, almost exclusively.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.176
No, what I'm talking about
