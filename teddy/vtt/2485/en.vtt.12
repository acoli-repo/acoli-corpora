like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.456
and Congo's Patrice Lumumba.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.856
I read every piece of African fiction
that I could get my hands on.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.536
So when Twitter came,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.736
I hopped on with the enthusiasm
of a teenage girl

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.240
whose friends are super, super bored
of hearing about all this random stuff.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.616
The year was 2011

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.696

and the whole continent,
