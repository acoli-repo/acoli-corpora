00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.336
Since then, I have continued
to read about politics

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.776
and geography and identity
and what all those things mean.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.536
I've also held on to a deep curiosity
about African philosophies.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.816
When I began to read,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.256
I gravitated towards the works
of black intellectuals

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.736
like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.576
who tackled complex ideas

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.656
like decolonization
and black consciousness.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.896
And when I thought, at 14,
that I had digested these grand ideas,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.976
I moved on to the speeches
of iconic African statesmen

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.016
like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara
