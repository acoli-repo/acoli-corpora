00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.616
affordable data packages
for smartphones and Internet surfing

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.456
became much easier to get.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.936
So my generation, we were sending
messages to each other on this platform

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.416
that just needed 140 characters
and a little bit of creativity.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.856
On long commutes to work,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.336
in lectures that some of us
should have been paying attention to,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.936
on our lunch breaks,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.976
we would communicate as much as we could

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.200
about the everyday realities
of being young and African.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.376
But of course, this luxury
was not available to everybody.
