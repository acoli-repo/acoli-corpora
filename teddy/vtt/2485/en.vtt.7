00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.576
And it has some very progressive
social policies.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.616
My mother's country
is the Kingdom of Swaziland.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.856
It's a very, very small country,
also in southern Africa.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.960
It is Africa's last complete monarchy.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.336
So it's been ruled by a king
and a royal family

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.776
in line with their tradition,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.120
for a very long time.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.856
On paper, these countries
seem very different.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.416
And when I was a kid,
I could see the difference.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.896
It rained a lot in one country,
it didn't rain quite as much in the other.
