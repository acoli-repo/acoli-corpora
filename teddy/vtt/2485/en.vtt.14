00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.376
But of course, this luxury
was not available to everybody.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.096
So this meant that if you were
a teenage girl in Botswana

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.176
and you wanted
to have fun on the Internet,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.856
one, you had to tweet in English.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.656
Two, you had to follow more than just
the three other people you knew online.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.736
You had to follow South Africans,
Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.536
And suddenly, your whole world opened up.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.896
And my whole world did open up.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.736
I followed vibrant Africans
who were travelling around the continent,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.216
taking pictures of themselves

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.336
and posting them
under the hashtag #myafrica.
