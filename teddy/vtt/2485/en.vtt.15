or any kind of social media,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.976
you would think that the entire continent
was just pictures of animals

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.496

to take some kind of ownership
of the tourism sectors.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.456
It was Africans taking selfies
on the beaches of Nigeria.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.440
It was Africans
in cocktail bars in Nairobi.
