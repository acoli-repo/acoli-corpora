00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.976
a platform that just needed a small spark

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.400
to light in us a hunger for each other.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.296
My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.056
I'm 22 years old

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.400
and I am Pan-Africanist by birth.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.656
Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.056
because my parents are
from two different African countries.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.816
My father's from a country
called Botswana in southern Africa.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.856
It's only slightly bigger than Germany.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.976
This year we celebrate
our 50th year of stable democracy.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.576
And it has some very progressive
social policies.
