no, to remind myself that I'm really funny

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.519
and that if nobody gets it, that's fine.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.176
But luckily,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.416
I didn't have to do that for very long.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.480
Very soon, people were participating.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.536
In fact, by the end of that week in July,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.096
the hashtag #ifafricawasabar

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.816
would have garnered around 60,000 tweets,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.496
lit up the continent

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.680
and made its way to publications
all over the world.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.400
People were using the hashtag
to do many different things.
