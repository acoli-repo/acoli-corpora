00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.640
It began with one question:

00:00:05.222 --> 00:00:10.360
If Africa was a bar, what would
your country be drinking or doing?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.456
I kicked it off with a guess
about South Africa,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.536
which wasn't exactly
according to the rules

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.080
because South Africa's not my country.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.896
But alluding to the country's
continual attempts

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.256
to build a postracial society

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.576
after being ravaged
for decades by apartheid,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.936
I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa
would be drinking all kinds of alcohol
