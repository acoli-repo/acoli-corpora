To remind us that even in Africa

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.056
there are some countries
we don't know exist:

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.456
[#IfAfricaWasABar
Lesotho would be that person

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.496
who nobody really knows

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.136
[#ifAfricawasabar
Rwanda would be that girl

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.776
that comes with no money and no transport
but leaves drunk, happy and rich]

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.480
But most importantly,
