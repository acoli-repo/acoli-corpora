of the wars that had happened
in Europe in the past 200 years,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.120
but I couldn't name the president
of my neighboring country.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.496
And to me, this doesn't make any sense

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.536
because whether we like it or not,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.200
the fates of African people
are deeply intertwined.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.176
When disaster hits, when turmoil hits,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.336
we share the consequences.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.336
When Burundians flee political turmoil,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.696
they go to us,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.736
to other African countries.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.520
Africa has six of the world's
largest refugee centers.
