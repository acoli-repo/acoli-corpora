00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:04.336
Before now, if you wanted to be heard
by your possibly tyrannical government,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.736
you were pushed to protest,
suffer the consequences

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.416
and have your fingers crossed

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.960
that some Western paper somewhere
might make someone care.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.376
But now we have opportunities
to back each other up

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.616
in ways we never could before.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.376
We support South African students

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.016
who are marching against
ridiculously high tertiary fees.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.376
We support Zimbabwean women
who are marching to parliament.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.840
We support Angolan journalists
who are being illegally detained.
