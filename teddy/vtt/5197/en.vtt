00:00:00.643 --> 00:00:02.691
How many of you
have ever heard someone say

00:00:02.715 --> 00:00:03.881
privacy is dead?

00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:05.055
Raise your hand.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.309
How many of you have heard someone say

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:12.267
they don't care about their privacy
because they don't have anything to hide?

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:13.825
Go on.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.291
(Laughter)

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.977
Now, how many of you
use any kind of encryption software?

00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:21.434
Raise your hand.

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:24.805
Or a password
to protect an online account?

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.449
Or curtains or blinds
on your windows at home?

00:00:29.473 --> 00:00:31.029
(Laughter)
