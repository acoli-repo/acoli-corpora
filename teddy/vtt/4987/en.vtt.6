00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.200
a ring siphons off and temporarily stores 
only certain waves of light—

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.918
those whose periodic wavelength 
fits a whole number of times

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.518
along the ring’s circumference.

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:10.588
It’s the same effect at work when
we pluck guitar strings.

00:03:10.588 --> 00:03:15.058
Only certain vibrating patterns dominate 
a string of a particular length,

00:03:15.058 --> 00:03:18.038
to give a fundamental 
note and its overtones.

00:03:18.038 --> 00:03:20.578
Ring resonators were originally 
designed

00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:23.598
to efficiently route different 
wavelengths of light—

00:03:23.598 --> 00:03:25.908
each a channel of digital data—

00:03:25.908 --> 00:03:28.908
in fiber optics communication networks.

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:31.778
But some day this kind of data
