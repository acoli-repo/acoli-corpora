When you inhale, your lungs transfer 
oxygen into hemoglobin molecules,

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:09.123
and the pulse oximeter measures the ratio 
of oxygenated to oxygen-free hemoglobin.

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:14.503
It does this by using a tiny red LED light
on one side of the fingerclip,

00:01:14.503 --> 00:01:17.234
and a small light detector on the other.

00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:19.664
When the LED shines into your finger,

00:01:19.664 --> 00:01:24.214
oxygen-free hemoglobin in your blood 
vessels absorbs the red light

00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:27.392
more strongly than its oxygenated 
counterpart.

00:01:27.392 --> 00:01:30.132
So the amount of light that makes
it out the other side
