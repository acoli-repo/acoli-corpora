00:03:56.768 --> 00:04:00.268
and can give early-warning signals for 
certain cancers

00:04:00.268 --> 00:04:03.348
and infectious and autoimmune diseases.

00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:05.788
To accurately identify an illness,

00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:08.498
labs-on-a-chip may rely on 
several methods,

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.388
including chemical fingerprinting,

00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:15.138
to sift through the large mix of trace 
substances in a sample of spit.

00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:19.938
Various biomolecules in saliva absorb 
light at the same wavelength—

00:04:19.938 --> 00:04:22.888
but each has a distinct chemical 
fingerprint.

00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:26.988
In a lab-on-a-chip, after the light passes
through a saliva sample,

00:04:26.988 --> 00:04:29.138
a host of fine-tuned rings

00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:32.698
may each siphon off a slightly different
wavelength of light
