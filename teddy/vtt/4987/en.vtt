00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.820
It’s an increasingly common sight 
in hospitals around the world:

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.790
a nurse measures our height, 
weight, blood pressure,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.560
and attaches a glowing plastic 
clip to our finger.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.610
Suddenly, a digital screen reads out 
the oxygen level in our bloodstream.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.884
How did that happen?

00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:29.234
How can a plastic clip learn something 
about our blood…

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:31.084
without a blood sample?
