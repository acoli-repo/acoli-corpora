But some day this kind of data 
traffic routing

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:35.218
may be adapted for miniature chemical
fingerprinting labs,

00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:37.898
on chips the size of a penny.

00:03:37.898 --> 00:03:41.168
These future labs-on-a-chip may easily, 
rapidly,

00:03:41.168 --> 00:03:44.688
and non-invasively detect a host 
of illnesses,

00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:48.488
by analyzing human saliva or sweat 
in a doctor’s office

00:03:48.488 --> 00:03:50.958
or the convenience of our homes.

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.068
Human saliva in particular

00:03:53.068 --> 00:03:56.768
mirrors the composition of our bodies’ 
proteins and hormones,

00:03:56.768 --> 00:04:00.268
and can give early-warning signals for 
certain cancers
