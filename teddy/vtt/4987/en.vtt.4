Light comes in a vast spectrum 
of wavelengths,

00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:04.741
and infrared light lies just beyond 
the visible colors.

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:07.369
All molecules, including hemoglobin,

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.479
absorb light at different efficiencies 
across this spectrum.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:15.129
So contrasting the absorbance of red 
to infrared light

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.609
provides a chemical fingerprint to 
eliminate the blood vessel size effect.

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:25.559
Today, an emerging medical sensor industry
is exploring all-new degrees

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:27.926
of precision chemical fingerprinting,

00:02:27.926 --> 00:02:32.816
using tiny light-manipulating devices 
no larger than a tenth of a millimeter.
