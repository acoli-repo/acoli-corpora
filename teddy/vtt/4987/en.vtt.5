00:02:27.926 --> 00:02:32.816
using tiny light-manipulating devices 
no larger than a tenth of a millimeter.

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:34.760
This microscopic technology,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.790
called integrated photonics,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.170
is made from wires of silicon 
that guide light—

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.650
like water in a pipe—

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.080
to redirect, reshape, even 
temporarily trap it.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.100
A ring resonator device, 
which is a circular wire of silicon,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.870
is a light trapper that enhances chemical 
fingerprinting.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.220
When placed close to a silicon wire,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.200
a ring siphons off and temporarily stores 
only certain waves of light—
