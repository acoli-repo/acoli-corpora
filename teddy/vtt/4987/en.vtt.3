00:01:27.392 --> 00:01:30.132
So the amount of light that makes
it out the other side

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:35.112
depends on the concentration ratio 
of the two types of hemoglobin.

00:01:35.112 --> 00:01:39.372
But any two patients will have different-sized 
blood vessels in their fingers.

00:01:39.372 --> 00:01:43.366
For one patient, a saturation reading of 
ninety-five percent

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.876
corresponds to a healthy oxygen level,

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:47.886
but for another with smaller arteries,

00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:53.056
the same reading could dangerously 
misrepresent the actual oxygen level.

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:57.626
This can be accounted for with a second 
infrared wavelength LED.

00:01:57.626 --> 00:02:00.831
Light comes in a vast spectrum 
of wavelengths,
