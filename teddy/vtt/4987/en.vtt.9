00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:32.698
may each siphon off a slightly different
wavelength of light

00:04:32.698 --> 00:04:35.458
and send it to a partner light detector.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:38.518
Together, this bank of detectors will 
resolve

00:04:38.518 --> 00:04:41.298
the cumulative chemical fingerprint 
of the sample.

00:04:41.298 --> 00:04:44.358
From this information, 
a tiny on-chip computer,

00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:47.988
containing a library of chemical 
fingerprints for different molecules,

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:50.548
may figure out their relative 
concentrations,

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:53.278
and help diagnose a specific illness.

00:04:53.648 --> 00:04:57.168
From globe-trotting communications 
to labs-on-a-chip,

00:04:57.168 --> 00:05:02.468
humankind has repurposed light to both 
carry and extract information.
