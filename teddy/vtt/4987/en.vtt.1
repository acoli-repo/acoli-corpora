00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:31.084
without a blood sample?

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:32.164
Here’s the trick:

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:34.474
our bodies are translucent,

00:00:34.474 --> 00:00:38.304
meaning they don’t completely 
block and reflect light.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:42.374
Rather, they allow some light to actually
pass through our skin,

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:44.454
muscles, and blood vessels.

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:45.564

Hold a flashlight to your thumb.

00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:52.814
Light, it turns out, can help probe the
insides of our bodies.

00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:55.193
Consider that medical fingerclip—

00:00:55.193 --> 00:00:57.553
it’s called a pulse oximeter.

00:00:57.553 --> 00:01:02.333
When you inhale, your lungs transfer 
oxygen into hemoglobin molecules,
