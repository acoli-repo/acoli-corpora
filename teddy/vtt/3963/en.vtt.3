00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:30.953
Its thick atmosphere, not its distance
from the sun, is the reason.

00:01:30.977 --> 00:01:34.080
It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids,

00:01:34.104 --> 00:01:37.744
trapping heat from the sun
and scorching the planet's surface.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:42.728
The reality totally contradicted
initial perceptions of this planet.

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:46.349
From these lessons
from our own solar system,

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:48.389
we've learned that a planet's atmosphere

00:01:48.413 --> 00:01:52.015
is crucial to its climate
and potential to host life.

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:55.882
We don't know what the atmospheres
of these planets are like

00:01:55.906 --> 00:02:00.274
because the planets are so small
and dim compared to their stars
