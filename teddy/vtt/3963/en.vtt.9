00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.093
... and how they can inform our search
for the next planet where life exists.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.153
My organization, Rising Stargirls,

00:04:33.177 --> 00:04:36.605
teaches astronomy
to middle-school girls of color,

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.085
using theater, writing and visual art.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:44.674
That's another contradiction --
science and art don't often go together,

00:04:44.698 --> 00:04:48.500
but interweaving them can help
these girls bring their whole selves

00:04:48.524 --> 00:04:49.723
to what they learn,

00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:53.187
and maybe one day join
the ranks of astronomers

00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:54.965
who are full of contradictions,

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:58.139
and use their backgrounds
to discover, once and for all,

00:04:58.163 --> 00:05:01.179
that we are truly not alone
in the universe.
