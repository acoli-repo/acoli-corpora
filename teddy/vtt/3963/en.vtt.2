00:00:57.203 --> 00:01:00.693
there are many factors
besides distance from its star

00:01:00.717 --> 00:01:03.321
that control whether
a planet can support life.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:05.813
Take the planet Venus.

00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:10.337
It's named after the Roman goddess
of love and beauty,

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:13.971
because of its benign,
ethereal appearance in the sky.

00:01:14.487 --> 00:01:17.651
But spacecraft measurements
revealed a different story.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.049
The surface temperature is close
to 900 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:22.073 --> 00:01:23.572
500 Celsius.

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:26.539
That's hot enough to melt lead.

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:30.953
Its thick atmosphere, not its distance
from the sun, is the reason.
