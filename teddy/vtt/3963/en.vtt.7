00:03:27.092 --> 00:03:30.589
The redder light from the sun
is absorbed on its way through the ice.

00:03:30.613 --> 00:03:33.470
Only the blue light
makes it all the way to the bottom.

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:36.339
Then it gets reflected
back to up to our eyes

00:03:36.363 --> 00:03:37.939
and we see blue ice.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.564
My models show that planets
orbiting cooler stars

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:44.756
could actually be warmer
than planets orbiting hotter stars.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.319
There's another contradiction --

00:03:46.343 --> 00:03:50.117
that ice absorbs the longer
wavelength light from cooler stars,

00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:53.249
and that light, that energy,
heats the ice.

00:03:54.622 --> 00:03:56.982
Using climate models to explore

00:03:57.006 --> 00:04:00.111
how these contradictions
can affect planetary climate
