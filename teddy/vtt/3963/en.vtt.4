00:01:55.906 --> 00:02:00.274
because the planets are so small
and dim compared to their stars

00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:01.963
and so far away from us.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.791
For example, one of the closest planets
that could support surface water --

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:10.172
it's called Gliese 667 Cc --

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:14.132
such a glamorous name, right,
nice phone number for a name --

00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:16.591
it's 23 light years away.

00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:19.861
So that's more than 100 trillion miles.

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:22.999
Trying to measure
the atmospheric composition

00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:27.039
of an exoplanet passing
in front of its host star is hard.

00:02:27.444 --> 00:02:29.324
It's like trying to see a fruit fly

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.634
passing in front of a car's headlight.
