00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:31.569
At this distance,

00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:35.073
shown in blue on this diagram
for stars of different temperatures,

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:38.951
planets could be warm enough
for water to flow on their surfaces

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:40.373
as lakes and oceans

00:00:40.397 --> 00:00:41.938
where life might reside.

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:46.501
Some astronomers focus their time
and energy on finding planets

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.966
at these distances from their stars.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.393
What I do picks up where their job ends.

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:54.853
I model the possible
climates of exoplanets.

00:00:55.353 --> 00:00:57.179
And here's why that's important:

00:00:57.203 --> 00:01:00.693
there are many factors
besides distance from its star
