00:03:57.006 --> 00:04:00.111
how these contradictions
can affect planetary climate

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:03.309
is vital to the search for life elsewhere.

00:04:04.128 --> 00:04:07.305
And it's no surprise
that this is my specialty.

00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:10.500
I'm an African-American female astronomer

00:04:10.524 --> 00:04:12.636
and a classically trained actor

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.495
who loves to wear makeup
and read fashion magazines,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.352
so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate
contradictions in nature --

00:04:21.376 --> 00:04:22.488
(Laughter)

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.976
(Applause)

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.093
... and how they can inform our search
for the next planet where life exists.
