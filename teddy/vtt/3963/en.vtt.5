00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.634
passing in front of a car's headlight.

00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:35.825
OK, now imagine that car
is 100 trillion miles away,

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.221
and you want to know
the precise color of that fly.

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:42.375
So I use computer models

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:45.502
to calculate the kind of atmosphere
a planet would need

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:48.225
to have a suitable climate
for water and life.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.551
Here's an artist's concept
of the planet Kepler-62f,

00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:55.058
with the Earth for reference.

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:57.547
It's 1,200 light years away,

00:02:57.571 --> 00:02:59.798
and just 40 percent larger than Earth.
