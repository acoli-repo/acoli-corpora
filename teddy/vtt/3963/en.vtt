00:00:00.856 --> 00:00:05.595
I am in search of another planet
in the universe where life exists.

00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:09.388
I can't see this planet
with my naked eyes

00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:11.698
or even with the most powerful telescopes

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:13.072
we currently possess.

00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:15.851
But I know that it's there.

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:19.018
And understanding contradictions
that occur in nature

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:20.398
will help us find it.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:22.530
On our planet,

00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:24.527
where there's water, there's life.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:27.826
So we look for planets that orbit
at just the right distance

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.149
from their stars.
