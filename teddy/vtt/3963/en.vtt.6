00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:04.361
Our NSF-funded work found that it
could be warm enough for open water

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:08.494
from many types of atmospheres
and orientations of its orbit.

00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:11.651
So I'd like future telescopes
to follow up on this planet

00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:13.246
to look for signs of life.

00:03:14.476 --> 00:03:17.865
Ice on a planet's surface
is also important for climate.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.084
Ice absorbs longer,
redder wavelengths of light,

00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:23.238
and reflects shorter, bluer light.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.759
That's why the iceberg
in this photo looks so blue.

00:03:27.092 --> 00:03:30.589
The redder light from the sun
is absorbed on its way through the ice.
