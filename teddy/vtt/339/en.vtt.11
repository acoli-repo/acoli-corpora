WEBVTT

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
We pick those words out.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We also reference that

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
with the tonation database

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that we build up of Dimitri's voice,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
or the user's voice.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Now we need to have a bit more engagement,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and again, what we can do

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
is we can look at the body.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And we'll do that in a second.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Milo: I wonder how deep it is.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Deep.
