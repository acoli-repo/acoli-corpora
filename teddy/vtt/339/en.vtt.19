00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
This looks nice.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
You cleaned up my room.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Thanks.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
PM: So after three-quarters of an hour,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
he recognizes you.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
that is a truly wonderful moment.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And we're ready now

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
to tell a story about his childhood and his life,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and it goes on,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and he has, you know, many adventures.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging --
