00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
because we went out with this strong idea:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
how can we make you believe that something's real?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now we've used the hand.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The other thing to use is your body.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Why not just, instead of pushing left and right

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
with a mouse or with a joypad,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
why not use your body just to lean on the chair --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
again, relaxed?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
You can lean back,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
but the camera will change its perspective

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
depending on which way you're looking.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So Dimitri's now going to use --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
he's used his hand; he's used his body.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
He's now going to use the other thing which is essential,
