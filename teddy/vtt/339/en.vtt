00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
it was called Natal -- I was inspired,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and I thought for a moment,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
maybe it's possible

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to address that one problem of storytelling,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to create a character

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which seemed alive,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which noticed me,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that could look me in the eyes

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and feel real,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and sculpt a story about our relationship.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And so a year ago,
