Okay, this is skimming stones.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
How do you skim stones?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
You stand up,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and you skim the stone.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It's that simple.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Just recognizing your body,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
recognizing the body's motions, the tech,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
understanding that you've gone

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
from sitting down to standing up.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Again, all of this is done

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
in the way us humans do things,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and that's crucially important

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
if we want Milo to appear real.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Female Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better.
