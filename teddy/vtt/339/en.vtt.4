00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He is just going to use

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
his hand, his body and his voice,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
just like humans interact with their hands, body and voice.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So let's move forward.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You're going to meet Milo for the first time.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We had to give him a problem

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
because when we first created Milo,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to be honest with you.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
He was quite a know-it-all,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and he wanted to kind of make you laugh.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So the problem we introduced to him was this:

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
he's just moved house.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
He's moved from London

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to New England, over in America.
