00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So remember, this is the first time you've met him,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
His face, by the way,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is fully AI-driven.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We have complete control over his blush responses,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
the diameter of his nostrils

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
to denote stress.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
We actually do something called body matching.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
If you're leaning forward,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
he will try and slightly change

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
the neuro-linguistic nature of his face,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
because we went out with this strong idea:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
how can we make you believe that something's real?
