00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And so a year ago,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I showed this off

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
at a computer show called E3.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And this was a piece of technology

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
with someone called Claire interacting with this boy.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And there was a huge row online

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
about, "Hey, this can't be real."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And so I waited till now

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to have an actual demo

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of the real tech.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now, this tech incorporates

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
three big elements.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The first is a Kinect camera,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which will be out in November,
