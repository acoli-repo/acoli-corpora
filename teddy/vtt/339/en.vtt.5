00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
He's moved from London

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to New England, over in America.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
His parents are too busy

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to listen to his problems,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So here he is

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
walking through the grass.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And you're able to interact with his world.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The cool thing is, what we're doing

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
is we're changing the mind

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
of Milo constantly.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
That means no two people's Milos

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
can be the same.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You're actually sculpting a human being here.
