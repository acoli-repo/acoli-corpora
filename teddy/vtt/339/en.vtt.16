00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
like a magician's trick.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And what we did was,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
we needed to give Milo this big problem.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So as Dimitri

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
starts tidying up,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
you can overhear a conversation

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that Milo's having with his parents.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Milo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor. (Milo: I didn't mean to!)

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Milo's Mom: That carpet is brand new.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
PM: So he's just spilled

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
a plate of sausages on the floor,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
on the brand-new carpet.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
We've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Now's a chance for Dimitri

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to kind of reassure and calm Milo down.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
It's all been too much for him.
