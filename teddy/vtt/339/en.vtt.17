00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to kind of reassure and calm Milo down.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
It's all been too much for him.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
He's just moved house. He's got no friends.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Now is the time

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
when we open that portal

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and allow you to talk to Milo.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Female Voice: Why don't you try saying something encouraging

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to cheer Milo up.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Dimitri: Come on, Milo. You know what parents are like.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
They're always getting stressed.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Milo: What do they want to come here for anyway?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We don't know anyone.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to.
