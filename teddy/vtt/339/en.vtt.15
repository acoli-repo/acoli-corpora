00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
PM: So, Milo's being called back in by his parents,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
giving us time to be alone

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and to help him out.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Basically -- the bit that we missed at the start --

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
in your natural voice to Milo.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Now, to do that, we needed a set up,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And what we did was,
