00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
he's used his hand; he's used his body.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
He's now going to use the other thing which is essential,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and that's his voice.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Now, the thing about voice is,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
our experience with voice recognition

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is pretty awful, isn't it?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
It never works.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So we've tackled that problem,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and we've come up with a solution, which we'll see in a second.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Milo: I could just squish it.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Peter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
but remember, even this choice

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
will affect how Milo develops.
