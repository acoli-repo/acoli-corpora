00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now, I'll be honest with you

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and say that most of it

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is just a trick,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but it's a trick that actually works.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So why don't we go over and have

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a look at the demo now.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This is Dimitri.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Dimitri, just waggle your arm around.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Now, you notice he's sitting.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
There are no controllers,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
no keyboards,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
or mice,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
or joysticks, or joypads.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He is just going to use

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
his hand, his body and his voice,
