00:00:01.786 --> 00:00:03.485
As you heard, I'm a physicist.

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.494
And I think the way we talk about physics
needs a little modification.

00:00:07.518 --> 00:00:10.879
I am from just down the road here;
I don't live here anymore.

00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:15.410
But coming from round here means
that I have a northern nana,

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:16.601
my mum's mom.

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:20.652
And Nana is very bright;
she hasn't had much formal education,

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:21.844
but she's sharp.

00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:25.946
And when I was a second-year undergraduate
studying physics at Cambridge,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.813
I remember spending an afternoon
at Nana's house in Urmston
