Last January, my company, Fark.com, was sued

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
along with Yahoo, MSN, Reddit,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
AOL, TechCrunch and others

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
by a company called Gooseberry Natural Resources.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Gooseberry owned a patent

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for the creation and distribution

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of news releases via email.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
(Laughter)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but it does happen all the time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Take something already being done

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and patent it for an emerging technology --
