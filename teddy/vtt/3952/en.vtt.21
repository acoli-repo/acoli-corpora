00:10:30.103 --> 00:10:32.287
And there was no window in my room,

00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:35.617
but it was great to just imagine it
coming down all sticky.

00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:41.233
Next day, one of my nurses
smuggled in a snowball for me.

00:10:41.257 --> 00:10:42.890
She brought it in to the unit.

00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:50.139
I cannot tell you the rapture I felt
holding that in my hand,

00:10:50.163 --> 00:10:53.212
and the coldness dripping
onto my burning skin;

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:55.546
the miracle of it all,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.329
the fascination as I watched it melt
and turn into water.
