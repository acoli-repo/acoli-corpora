Well, we all need a reason to wake up.

00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:09.271
For me, it just took 11,000 volts.

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:12.742
I know you're too polite to ask,

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.401
so I will tell you.

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:17.577
One night, sophomore year of college,

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:21.299
just back from Thanksgiving holiday,

00:00:21.323 --> 00:00:23.975
a few of my friends and I
were horsing around,

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.564
and we decided to climb atop
a parked commuter train.

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:31.281
It was just sitting there,
with the wires that run overhead.
