00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:00.967
as individuals as well as a civil society:

00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:04.907
to rethink and redesign how it is we die.

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.079
So let's begin at the end.

00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:15.546
For most people, the scariest thing
about death isn't being dead,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.389
it's dying, suffering.

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:19.184
It's a key distinction.

00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:22.629
To get underneath this,
it can be very helpful

00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:27.007
to tease out suffering
which is necessary as it is,

00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:29.696
from suffering we can change.
