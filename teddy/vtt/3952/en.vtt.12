00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.730
Now, let me introduce you to Frank.

00:06:05.768 --> 00:06:06.983
Sort of makes this point.

00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:09.037
I've been seeing Frank now for years.

00:06:09.061 --> 00:06:13.255
He's living with advancing prostate cancer
on top of long-standing HIV.

00:06:14.197 --> 00:06:16.183
We work on his bone pain and his fatigue,

00:06:16.207 --> 00:06:20.921
but most of the time we spend thinking
out loud together about his life --

00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:22.310
really, about our lives.

00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:24.731
In this way, Frank grieves.

00:06:25.207 --> 00:06:28.986
In this way, he keeps up with
his losses as they roll in,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.159
so that he's ready to take in
the next moment.
