I'm a physician now,
a hospice and palliative medicine doc,

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.472
so I've seen care from both sides.

00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:38.975
And believe me: almost everyone
who goes into healthcare

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.136
really means well -- I mean, truly.

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:46.807
But we who work in it
are also unwitting agents

00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:51.075
for a system that too often
does not serve.

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:53.156
Why?

00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:57.005
Well, there's actually a pretty easy
answer to that question,

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:59.277
and it explains a lot:

00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:05.259
because healthcare was designed
with diseases, not people, at its center.
