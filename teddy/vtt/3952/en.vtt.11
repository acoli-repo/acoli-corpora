00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:32.163
True to the tenets of palliative care,

00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:35.860
I function as something
of a reflective advocate,

00:05:35.884 --> 00:05:38.003
as much as prescribing physician.

00:05:39.177 --> 00:05:45.198
Quick aside: palliative care -- a very
important field but poorly understood --

00:05:45.222 --> 00:05:48.176
while it includes, it is not
limited to end of life care.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.041
It is not limited to hospice.

00:05:50.811 --> 00:05:54.268
It's simply about comfort
and living well at any stage.

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:58.038
So please know that you don't
have to be dying anytime soon

00:05:58.062 --> 00:05:59.749
to benefit from palliative care.
