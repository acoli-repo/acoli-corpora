00:08:00.602 --> 00:08:04.340
Perspective, that kind of alchemy
we humans get to play with,

00:08:04.364 --> 00:08:06.874
turning anguish into a flower.

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:13.791
Flash forward: now I work
at an amazing place in San Francisco

00:08:13.815 --> 00:08:16.054
called the Zen Hospice Project,

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:19.698
where we have a little ritual
that helps with this shift in perspective.

00:08:20.405 --> 00:08:23.466
When one of our residents dies,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.960
the mortuary men come, and as we're
wheeling the body out through the garden,

00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:30.014
heading for the gate, we pause.
