00:11:03.293 --> 00:11:05.424
In that moment,

00:11:05.448 --> 00:11:09.936
just being any part of this planet
in this universe mattered more to me

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.059
than whether I lived or died.

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:15.206
That little snowball packed
all the inspiration I needed

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.435
to both try to live
and be OK if I did not.

00:11:19.176 --> 00:11:22.060
In a hospital, that's a stolen moment.

00:11:24.356 --> 00:11:27.745
In my work over the years,
I've known many people

00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:29.596
who were ready to go, ready to die.
