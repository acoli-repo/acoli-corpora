00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:37.286
We'd certainly done stupider things.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.291
I scurried up the ladder on the back,

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:43.037
and when I stood up,

00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:46.643
the electrical current entered my arm,

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.207

Takes a licking!

00:00:57.447 --> 00:00:58.478
(Laughter)

00:00:58.502 --> 00:01:00.811
My father wears it now in solidarity.
