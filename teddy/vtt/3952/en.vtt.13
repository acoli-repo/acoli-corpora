00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.159

the next moment.

00:06:33.524 --> 00:06:37.695
Loss is one thing,
but regret, quite another.

00:06:39.243 --> 00:06:41.200
Frank has always been an adventurer --

00:06:41.224 --> 00:06:44.065
he looks like something
out of a Norman Rockwell painting --

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:45.653
and no fan of regret.

00:06:46.566 --> 00:06:49.247
So it wasn't surprising
when he came into clinic one day,

00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:52.007
saying he wanted to raft
down the Colorado River.

00:06:53.142 --> 00:06:54.817
Was this a good idea?

00:06:55.268 --> 00:06:59.472
With all the risks to his safety
and his health, some would say no.

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:03.062
Many did, but he went for it,
while he still could.
