00:14:03.373 --> 00:14:07.655
So much of it comes down to
loving our time by way of the senses,

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:12.971
by way of the body -- the very thing
doing the living and the dying.

00:14:14.258 --> 00:14:15.817
Probably the most poignant room

00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:18.094
in the Zen Hospice guest house
is our kitchen,

00:14:18.118 --> 00:14:20.155
which is a little strange when you realize

00:14:20.179 --> 00:14:23.992
that so many of our residents
can eat very little, if anything at all.

00:14:24.016 --> 00:14:29.886
But we realize we are providing
sustenance on several levels:

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.976
smell, a symbolic plane.
