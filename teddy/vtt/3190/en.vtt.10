00:04:57.152 --> 00:05:01.370
and the first show he ever produced
was the world premiere of "Hair."

00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:04.182

that it was as if Mr. Papp took a broom

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:10.803
and swept up all the refuse
from the East Village streets

00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:13.166
onto the stage at the Public.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.194

He didn't mean it complimentarily,

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:19.550

00:05:19.574 --> 00:05:21.050
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:21.074 --> 00:05:25.494
And what the Public Theater did over

00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:29.042
"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered
Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf,"

00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:31.834
"A Chorus Line,"
