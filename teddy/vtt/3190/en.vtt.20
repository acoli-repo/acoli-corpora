00:09:59.719 --> 00:10:03.293
and also an internet boycott of "Hamilton"

00:10:03.317 --> 00:10:07.453
from outraged people who had felt
we had treated him with disrespect.

00:10:08.142 --> 00:10:12.067
I looked at that boycott and I said,
we're getting something wrong here.

00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:15.410
All of these people who have signed
this boycott petition,

00:10:15.434 --> 00:10:17.699
they were never going to see
"Hamilton" anyway.

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:20.637
It was never going to come
to a city near them.

00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:23.220
If it could come,
they couldn't afford a ticket,

00:10:23.244 --> 00:10:26.736
and if they could afford a ticket,
they didn't have the connections

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.161
to get that ticket.

00:10:28.691 --> 00:10:30.546
They weren't boycotting us;
