00:02:59.322 --> 00:03:03.311
And you know from personal experience
that when you go to the movies,

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:06.583
you walk into a movie theater,
and if it's empty, you're delighted,

00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:09.265
because nothing's going to be
between you and the movie.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.501
You can spread out, put your legs
over the top of the stadium seats,

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.233
eat your popcorn and just enjoy it.

00:03:14.257 --> 00:03:16.159
But if you walk into a live theater

00:03:16.183 --> 00:03:18.626
and you see that the theater is half full,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.942
your heart sinks.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.477
You're disappointed immediately,

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:24.500
because whether you knew it or not,

00:03:24.524 --> 00:03:26.420
you were coming to that theater

00:03:26.444 --> 00:03:28.299
to be part of an audience.

00:03:28.323 --> 00:03:31.232
You were coming to have
the collective experience
