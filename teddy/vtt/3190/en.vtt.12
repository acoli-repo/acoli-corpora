Larry was actually changing
the dialogue about AIDS

00:06:01.108 --> 00:06:02.495
through writing this play,

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:03.922
and Joe was by producing it.

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:08.391
I was blessed to commission and work
on Tony Kushner's "Angels in America,"

00:06:08.415 --> 00:06:12.063
and when doing that play
and along with "Normal Heart,"

00:06:12.087 --> 00:06:15.435
we could see that the culture
was actually shifting,

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:17.488
and it wasn't caused by the theater,

00:06:17.512 --> 00:06:19.967
but the theater was doing its part

00:06:19.991 --> 00:06:24.266
to change what it meant to be gay
in the United States.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.130
And I'm incredibly proud of that.

00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:28.498

When I took over Joe's old job
at the Public in 2005,
