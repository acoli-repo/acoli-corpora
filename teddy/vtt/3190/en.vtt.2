00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:00.588
I'm standing up here,

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:02.633
the unitary authority,

00:01:02.657 --> 00:01:04.215
and I am talking to you.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.629
And you are sitting back,
and you are receiving what I have to say.

00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:11.087
And you may disagree with it,
you may think I'm an insufferable fool,

00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:12.719
you may be bored to death,

00:01:12.743 --> 00:01:15.878
but that dialogue is mostly
taking place inside your own head.

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:20.677
But what happens if,
instead of me talking to you --

00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:22.681
and Thespis thought of this --

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:25.456
I just shift 90 degrees to the left,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.150
and I talk to another person
onstage with me?

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.326
Everything changes,
