00:08:24.476 --> 00:08:30.596
Lin-Manuel's extraordinary retelling
of the foundational story of this country

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.426
through the eyes of the only Founding
Father who was a bastard immigrant orphan

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.006
from the West Indies.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.768
And what Lin was doing

00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:41.255
is exactly what Shakespeare was doing.

00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:45.854
He was taking the voice of the people,
the language of the people,

00:08:45.878 --> 00:08:48.135
elevating it into verse,

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:49.723
and by doing so,

00:08:49.747 --> 00:08:51.548
ennobling the language

00:08:51.572 --> 00:08:54.909
and ennobling the people
who spoke the language.

00:08:54.933 --> 00:08:59.717
And by casting that show entirely
with a cast of black and brown people,

00:08:59.741 --> 00:09:02.204
what Lin was saying to us,
