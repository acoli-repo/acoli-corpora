When I took over Joe's old job
at the Public in 2005,

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:37.077
I realized one of the problems we had
was a victim of our own success,

00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:42.126
which is: Shakespeare in the Park
had been founded as a program for access,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.701
and it was now the hardest ticket
to get in New York City.

00:06:45.725 --> 00:06:49.640
People slept out for two nights
to get those tickets.

00:06:49.664 --> 00:06:50.821
What was that doing?

00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:53.438
That was eliminating
98 percent of the population

00:06:53.462 --> 00:06:55.291
from even considering going to it.

00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:57.545
So we refounded the mobile unit

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:00.648
and took Shakespeare to prisons,
to homeless shelters,
