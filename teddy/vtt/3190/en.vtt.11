00:05:41.192 --> 00:05:42.514
"The Normal Heart."

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.929

that play in 1985,

00:05:46.953 --> 00:05:49.995
there was more information about AIDS

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:53.210
in Frank Rich's review
in the New York Times

00:05:53.234 --> 00:05:56.660
than the New York Times had published
in the previous four years.
