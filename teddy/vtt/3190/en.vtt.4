It's not the possession of any one person.

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:05.675
And if you believe in democracy,
you have to believe that.

00:02:06.136 --> 00:02:08.576
If you don't believe that,
you're an autocrat

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.266
who is putting up with democracy.

00:02:10.778 --> 00:02:13.298
But that's the basic thesis of democracy,

00:02:13.322 --> 00:02:16.451
that the conflict of different
points of views leads to the truth.

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:18.434
What's the other thing that's happening?

00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:21.101
I'm not asking you to sit back
and listen to me.

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:23.376
I'm asking you to lean forward

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.482
and imagine my point of view --

00:02:26.506 --> 00:02:30.105
what this looks like and feels like
to me as a character.
