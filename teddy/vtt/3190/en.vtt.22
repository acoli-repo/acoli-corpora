00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.110
So this idea of inclusion,
it has to keep going.

00:11:03.134 --> 00:11:06.256
Next fall, we are sending out on tour

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.469
a production of Lynn Nottage's brilliant,
Pulitzer Prize-winning play "Sweat."

00:11:11.493 --> 00:11:15.872
Years of research in Redding, Pennsylvania
led her to write this play

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:19.121
about the deindustrialization
of Pennsylvania:

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:21.793
what happened when steel left,

00:11:21.817 --> 00:11:24.077
the rage that was unleashed,

00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:25.732
the tensions that were unleashed,

00:11:25.756 --> 00:11:28.016
the racism that was unleashed

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.532
by the loss of jobs.

00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:32.924
We're taking that play
and we're touring it
