00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:30.700
to see the best theater
we can provide for free.

00:04:30.724 --> 00:04:33.566
It's not a commercial transaction.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.061
In 1967, 13 years
after he figured that out,

00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:39.732
he figured out something else,

00:04:39.756 --> 00:04:43.313
which is that the democratic
circle was not complete

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:46.564
by just giving the people the classics.

00:04:46.588 --> 00:04:50.125
We had to actually let the people
create their own classics

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:51.964
and take the stage.

00:04:51.988 --> 00:04:54.045
And so in 1967,

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.128
Joe opened the Public Theater
downtown on Astor Place,

00:04:57.152 --> 00:05:01.370
and the first show he ever produced
was the world premiere of "Hair."
