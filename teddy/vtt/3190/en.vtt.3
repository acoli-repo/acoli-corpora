00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.326
Everything changes,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.275
because at that moment,
I'm not the possessor of truth;

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.549
I'm a guy with an opinion.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.856
And I'm talking to somebody else.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.031
And you know what?

00:01:41.055 --> 00:01:43.508
That other person has an opinion too,

00:01:43.532 --> 00:01:46.936
and it's drama, remember,
conflict -- they disagree with me.

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:50.467
There's a conflict between
two points of view.

00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:56.787
And the thesis of that
is that the truth can only emerge

00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:59.083
in the conflict
of different points of view.

00:01:59.107 --> 00:02:01.841
It's not the possession of any one person.
