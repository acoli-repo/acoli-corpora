00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:00.648
and took Shakespeare to prisons,
to homeless shelters,

00:07:00.672 --> 00:07:03.160
to community centers in all five boroughs

00:07:03.184 --> 00:07:05.875
and even in New Jersey
and Westchester County.

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:10.103
And that program proved something to us
that we knew intuitively:

00:07:10.127 --> 00:07:14.867
people's need for theater
is as powerful as their desire for food

00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:16.135
or for drink.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.403
It's been an extraordinary success,
and we've continued it.

00:07:19.427 --> 00:07:23.116
And then there was yet another barrier
that we realized we weren't crossing,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.404
which is a barrier of participation.

00:07:25.428 --> 00:07:26.726
And the idea, we said, is:

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.269
How can we turn theater
from being a commodity, an object,
