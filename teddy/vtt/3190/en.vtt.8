that the culture should belong to
everybody in the United States of America,

00:04:03.227 --> 00:04:07.023
and that it was his job
to try to deliver on that promise.

00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:09.925
He created Free Shakespeare in the Park.

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.045
And Free Shakespeare in the Park
is based on a very simple idea,

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.639
the idea that the best theater,
the best art that we can produce,

00:04:17.663 --> 00:04:20.473
should go to everybody
and belong to everybody,

00:04:20.497 --> 00:04:22.238
and to this day,

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.651
every summer night in Central Park,

00:04:24.675 --> 00:04:27.052
2,000 people are lining up

00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:30.700
to see the best theater
we can provide for free.
