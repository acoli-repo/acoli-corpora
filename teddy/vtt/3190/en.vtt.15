00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.269
How can we turn theater
from being a commodity, an object,

00:07:31.293 --> 00:07:33.535
back into what it really is --

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:36.098
a set of relationships among people?

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.014
And under the guidance
of the amazing Lear deBessonet,

00:07:39.038 --> 00:07:40.916
we started the Public Works program,

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.832
which now every summer produces

00:07:42.856 --> 00:07:45.698
these immense Shakespearean
musical pageants,

00:07:45.722 --> 00:07:48.486
where Tony Award-winning
actors and musicians

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.356
are side by side with nannies
and domestic workers

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.254
and military veterans
and recently incarcerated prisoners,

00:07:56.278 --> 00:07:57.873
amateurs and professionals,

00:07:57.897 --> 00:08:00.331
performing together on the same stage.
