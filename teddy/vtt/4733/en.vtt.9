00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:33.854
So, spend some time living in those tasks
and the answers to those questions,

00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:37.579
and you're well on your way
to building your own fictional world.

00:04:37.603 --> 00:04:40.859
Once you know your world
as well as you hope your reader will,

00:04:40.883 --> 00:04:44.674
set your characters free in it
and see what happens.

00:04:44.698 --> 00:04:45.893
And ask yourself,

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:50.434
"How does this world you created
shape the individuals who live in it?

00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:53.787
And what kind of conflict
is likely to emerge?"

00:04:53.811 --> 00:04:57.020
Answer those questions,
and you have your story.

00:04:57.044 --> 00:04:59.025
Good luck, future world-builder!
