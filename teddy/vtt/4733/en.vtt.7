00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:31.784
showing how the world came to be.

00:03:31.808 --> 00:03:34.871
What past events have shaped
the way it is now?

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:37.302
Then I brainstorm answers to questions

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:40.497
that draw out the details
of my fictional world.

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:42.493
What rules are in place here?

00:03:42.517 --> 00:03:45.161
This covers everything
from laws of gravity,

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:46.263
or not,

00:03:46.287 --> 00:03:47.414
to the rules of society

00:03:47.438 --> 00:03:50.234
and the punishments
for individuals who break them.

00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:53.513
What kind of government
does this world have?

00:03:53.537 --> 00:03:55.653
Who has power, and who doesn't?

00:03:55.677 --> 00:03:58.004
What do people believe in here?

00:03:58.028 --> 00:04:00.937
And what does this society value most?
