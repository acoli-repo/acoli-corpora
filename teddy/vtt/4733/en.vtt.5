00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:30.775
not only to hold up a world

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.112
that is completely invented by the author,

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:36.473
but also to change
the reader's perspective

00:02:36.497 --> 00:02:38.773
on the real world that resumes

00:02:38.797 --> 00:02:41.118
only when the final squiggle is reached?

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.048
I'm not sure anyone knows
the answer to that question,

00:02:45.072 --> 00:02:48.799
yet fantastical, fictional worlds
are created everyday

00:02:48.823 --> 00:02:50.713
in our minds, on computers,

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:53.878
even on napkins at the restaurant
down the street.

00:02:53.902 --> 00:02:58.384
The truth is your imagination
and a willingness to, figuratively,

00:02:58.408 --> 00:02:59.479
live in your own world

00:02:59.503 --> 00:03:02.470
are all you need to get
started writing a novel.
