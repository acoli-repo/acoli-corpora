And what does this society value most?

00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:03.585
Then it's time to think

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:09.085
Where do the inhabitants live
and work and go to school?

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.111
What do they eat

00:04:23.127 --> 00:04:24.133

00:04:24.157 --> 00:04:25.165
Communication?

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:26.929
Access to information?

00:04:26.953 --> 00:04:29.302
There's so much to think about!

00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:33.854
So, spend some time living in those tasks
and the answers to those questions,
