00:02:59.503 --> 00:03:02.470
are all you need to get
started writing a novel.

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:05.624
I didn't dream up Hogwarts
or the Star Wars' Cantina,

00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:09.353
but I have written some science thrillers
for kids and young adults.

00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:11.686
Here are some questions
and methods I've used

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.960
to help build the worlds
in which those books take place.

00:03:16.088 --> 00:03:18.239
I start with a basic place and time.

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:22.288
Whether that's a fantasy world
or a futuristic setting in the real world,

00:03:22.312 --> 00:03:26.168
it's important to know where you are
and whether you're working in the past,

00:03:26.192 --> 00:03:27.861
present, or future.

00:03:27.885 --> 00:03:29.627
I like to create a timeline

00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:31.784
showing how the world came to be.
