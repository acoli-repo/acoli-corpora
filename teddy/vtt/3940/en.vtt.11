00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:31.975
the Black Stars,
and my love of Ghanaian food,

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:36.357
I've never had a relationship
with the Republic of Ghana, writ large.

00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:40.393
My relationship is with Accra,
where my mother lives,

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:42.028
where I go each year,

00:05:42.052 --> 00:05:46.448
with the little garden in Dzorwulu
where my father and I talk for hours.

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:50.171
These are the places
that shape my experience.

00:05:50.607 --> 00:05:52.956
My experience is where I'm from.

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:57.378
What if we asked, instead
of "Where are you from?" --

00:05:57.782 --> 00:05:59.586
"Where are you a local?"

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.023
This would tell us so much more
about who and how similar we are.
