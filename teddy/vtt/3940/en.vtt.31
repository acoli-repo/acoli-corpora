00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:32.298
So the next time that I'm introduced,

00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:34.171
I'd love to hear the truth:

00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:38.202
"Taiye Selasi is a human being,
like everybody here.

00:15:38.226 --> 00:15:42.284
She isn't a citizen of the world,
but a citizen of worlds.

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:45.069
She is a local of New York,
Rome and Accra."

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:46.572
Thank you.

00:15:46.596 --> 00:15:50.999
