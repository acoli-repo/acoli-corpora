00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:01.741
but how we experience our locality

00:08:01.765 --> 00:08:05.051
depends in part on our restrictions.

00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:07.918
By restrictions, I mean,
where are you able to live?

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:09.975
What passport do you hold?

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:15.266
Are you restricted by, say, racism,
from feeling fully at home where you live?

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.553
By civil war, dysfunctional governance,
economic inflation,

00:08:19.577 --> 00:08:23.975
from living in the locality
where you had your rituals as a child?

00:08:24.396 --> 00:08:26.993
This is the least sexy of the R’s,

00:08:27.017 --> 00:08:29.975
less lyric than rituals and relationships,

00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:33.309
but the question takes us past
"Where are you now?"
