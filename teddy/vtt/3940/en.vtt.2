00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:03.967
For this reason, my introducers
also called me "multinational."

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:08.466
"But Nike is multinational," I thought,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.481
"I'm a human being."

00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:14.284
Then, one fine day, mid-tour,

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:17.784
I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark

00:01:17.808 --> 00:01:21.136
where I shared the stage
with the writer Colum McCann.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.470
We were discussing the role
of locality in writing,

00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:26.673
when suddenly it hit me.

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:29.142
I'm not multinational.

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.162
I'm not a national at all.
