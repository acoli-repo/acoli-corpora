ignores the fact that these students
are locals of the same milieu.

00:14:01.744 --> 00:14:05.093
The same holds true on the other end
of the economic spectrum.

00:14:05.593 --> 00:14:10.265
A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles
and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi

00:14:10.289 --> 00:14:14.112
have more in common
in terms of rituals and restrictions

00:14:14.136 --> 00:14:15.922
than nationality implies.

00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:19.541
Perhaps my biggest problem
with coming from countries

00:14:19.565 --> 00:14:21.279
is the myth of going back to them.

00:14:21.303 --> 00:14:24.398
I'm often asked if I plan
to "go back" to Ghana.

00:14:24.422 --> 00:14:28.742
I go to Accra every year,
but I can't "go back" to Ghana.

00:14:28.766 --> 00:14:30.567
It's not because I wasn't born there.
