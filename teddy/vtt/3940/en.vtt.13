I call these the three "R’s":
rituals, relationships, restrictions.

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:38.533
First, think of your daily rituals,
whatever they may be:

00:06:38.557 --> 00:06:40.590
making your coffee, driving to work,

00:06:40.614 --> 00:06:43.490
harvesting your crops,
saying your prayers.

00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:45.736
What kind of rituals are these?

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.213
Where do they occur?

00:06:47.237 --> 00:06:51.876
In what city or cities in the world
do shopkeepers know your face?

00:06:52.582 --> 00:06:56.975
As a child, I carried out fairly standard
suburban rituals in Boston,

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:01.630
with adjustments made for the rituals
my mother brought from London and Lagos.
