00:06:04.047 --> 00:06:08.631
Tell me you're from France,
and I see what, a set of clichés?

00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:12.895
Adichie's dangerous single story,
the myth of the nation of France?

00:06:13.355 --> 00:06:16.589
Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris,

00:06:16.613 --> 00:06:20.978
better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see
a set of experiences.

00:06:21.002 --> 00:06:23.975
Our experience is where we're from.

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:26.046
So, where are you a local?

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.141
I propose a three-step test.

00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:34.262
I call these the three "R’s":
rituals, relationships, restrictions.
