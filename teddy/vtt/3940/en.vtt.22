00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:00.505
we're using a kind of shorthand.

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:04.456
It's quicker to say "Nigeria"
than "Lagos and Berlin,"

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:08.747
and as with Google Maps,
we can always zoom in closer,

00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:11.231
from country to city to neighborhood.

00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:13.548
But that's not quite the point.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.899
The difference between
"Where are you from?"

00:11:16.923 --> 00:11:18.439
and "Where are you a local?"

00:11:18.463 --> 00:11:21.425
isn't the specificity of the answer;

00:11:21.449 --> 00:11:23.564
it's the intention of the question.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.181
Replacing the language of nationality
with the language of locality asks us

00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:32.897
to shift our focus
to where real life occurs.
