00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:31.975
Olu always feels restricted there,

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:34.268
not least by the fact that he's gay.

00:10:35.228 --> 00:10:38.950
Both he and Udo are restricted
by the political conditions

00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:40.628
of their parents' countries,

00:10:40.652 --> 00:10:43.636
from living where some of their
most meaningful rituals

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.610
and relationships occur.

00:10:45.634 --> 00:10:49.735
To say Olu is from Nigeria
and Udo is from Argentina

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:51.872
distracts from their common experience.

00:10:51.896 --> 00:10:55.511
Their rituals, their relationships,
and their restrictions are the same.

00:10:56.146 --> 00:10:58.560
Of course, when we ask,
"Where are you from?"

00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:00.505
we're using a kind of shorthand.
