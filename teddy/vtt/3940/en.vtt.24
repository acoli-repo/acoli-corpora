00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:02.767
one fixed and fictional entity
bumping up against another.

00:12:03.164 --> 00:12:07.586
"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin,"
suggests overlapping experiences,

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.835
layers that merge together,
that can't be denied or removed.

00:12:12.176 --> 00:12:14.408
You can take away my passport,

00:12:14.432 --> 00:12:16.539
but you can't take away my experience.

00:12:16.563 --> 00:12:18.674
That I carry within me.

00:12:18.698 --> 00:12:21.340
Where I'm from comes wherever I go.

00:12:22.253 --> 00:12:25.620
To be clear, I'm not suggesting
that we do away with countries.

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:27.778
There's much to be said
for national history,

00:12:27.803 --> 00:12:29.764
more for the sovereign state.

00:12:29.788 --> 00:12:34.485
Culture exists in community,
and community exists in context.
