00:13:26.731 --> 00:13:30.975
the question "Where are you from?"
or "Where are you really from?"

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:33.468
is often code for "Why are you here?"

00:13:34.324 --> 00:13:37.436
Then we have the scholar
William Deresiewicz's writing

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.233
of elite American colleges.

00:13:39.257 --> 00:13:42.408
"Students think that
their environment is diverse

00:13:42.432 --> 00:13:45.687
if one comes from Missouri
and another from Pakistan --

00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:49.749
never mind that all of their parents
are doctors or bankers."

00:13:50.114 --> 00:13:51.273
I'm with him.

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:54.768
To call one student American,
another Pakistani,

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:58.053
then triumphantly claim
student body diversity

00:13:58.077 --> 00:14:01.720
ignores the fact that these students
are locals of the same milieu.
