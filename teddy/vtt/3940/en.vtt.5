And so it came as a huge relief
to discover the sovereign state.

00:02:35.232 --> 00:02:37.170
What we call countries are actually

00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:39.843
various expressions
of sovereign statehood,

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:43.731
an idea that came into fashion
only 400 years ago.

00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:49.181
When I learned this, beginning my
masters degree in international relations,

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:51.574
I felt a sort of surge of relief.

00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:53.844
It was as I had suspected.

00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:58.023
History was real, cultures were real,

00:02:58.047 --> 00:03:00.561
but countries were invented.
