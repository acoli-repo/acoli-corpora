00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.365
suggested that the country
was an absolute,

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:03.071
some fixed point in place in time,

00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:05.443
a constant thing, but was it?

00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:10.817
In my lifetime, countries
had disappeared -- Czechoslovakia;

00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:15.200
appeared -- Timor-Leste;
failed -- Somalia.

00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:19.498
My parents came from countries
that didn't exist when they were born.

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:25.832
To me, a country -- this thing that could
be born, die, expand, contract --

00:02:25.856 --> 00:02:29.277
hardly seemed the basis
for understanding a human being.

00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:34.756
And so it came as a huge relief
to discover the sovereign state.
