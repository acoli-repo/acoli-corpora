Udo was born in Córdoba,
in northwest Argentina,

00:09:31.847 --> 00:09:35.035
where his grandparents migrated
from Germany, what is now Poland,

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:36.487
after the war.

00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:40.393
Udo studied in Buenos Aires,
and nine years ago came to Berlin.

00:09:40.417 --> 00:09:44.618
He loves going to Argentina -- 
the weather, the food, the friends --

00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:47.102
but hates the economic corruption there.

00:09:47.467 --> 00:09:49.405
Where is Udo from?

00:09:49.429 --> 00:09:53.062
With his blonde hair and blue eyes,
Udo could pass for German,

00:09:53.086 --> 00:09:57.142
but holds an Argentinian passport,
so needs a visa to live in Berlin.

00:09:57.166 --> 00:10:01.475
That Udo is from Argentina
has largely to do with history.
