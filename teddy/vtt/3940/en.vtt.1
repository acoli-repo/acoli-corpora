00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.975
Whenever I heard this opening sentence,

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.564
no matter the country that concluded it --

00:00:33.588 --> 00:00:35.975
England, America, Ghana, Nigeria --

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.571
I thought, "But that's not true."

00:00:39.127 --> 00:00:43.126
Yes, I was born in England
and grew up in the United States.

00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:46.783
My mum, born in England,
and raised in Nigeria,

00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:48.791
currently lives in Ghana.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:53.040
My father was born in Gold Coast,
a British colony,

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:54.649
raised in Ghana,

00:00:54.673 --> 00:00:58.780
and has lived for over 30 years
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:03.967
For this reason, my introducers
also called me "multinational."
