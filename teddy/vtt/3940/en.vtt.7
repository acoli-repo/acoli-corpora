"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana,"
one such critic asked,

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.516
"when she's never known the indignities

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.253
of traveling abroad
on a Ghanian passport?"

00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:42.975
Now, if I'm honest,

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.431
I knew just what she meant.

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.448
I've got a friend named Layla
who was born and raised in Ghana.

00:03:48.472 --> 00:03:53.014
Her parents are third-generation
Ghanians of Lebanese descent.

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:58.506
Layla, who speaks fluent Twi,
knows Accra like the back of her hand,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.265
but when we first met years ago,
I thought, "She's not from Ghana."
