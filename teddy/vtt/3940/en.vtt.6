00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:05.483
For the next 10 years, I sought
to re- or un-define myself,

00:03:05.507 --> 00:03:07.975
my world, my work, my experience,

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.174
beyond the logic of the state.

00:03:10.198 --> 00:03:14.737
In 2005, I wrote an essay,
"What is an Afropolitan,"

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:20.029
sketching out an identity
that privileged culture over country.

00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:24.572
It was thrilling how many people
could relate to my experience,

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:29.573
and instructional how many others
didn't buy my sense of self.
