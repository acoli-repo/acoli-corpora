I was providing excellent treatment,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.280
such as it was.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.000
But I was not talking
about structural change.

Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan
has spoken candidly

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.456
about his personal failure

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.336
leading to the Rwandan genocide.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.416
In 1994, he was head
of the UN peacekeeping department.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.976
At a 10-year memorial for the genocide,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.056
he reflected, "I believed at the time
I was doing my best,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.976
but I realized after the genocide

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.960
that there was more
I could and should have done
