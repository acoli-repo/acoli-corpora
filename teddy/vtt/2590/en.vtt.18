as a white woman.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.896
And though we've made enormous strides

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.976
in reducing infant mortality rates,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.536
a black baby still faces

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.120
nearly three times the risk
of death in its first year of life

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.680
as compared to a white baby.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.760
New York City's not exceptional.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.096
These statistics are paralleled

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.320
by statistics found
across the United States.
