00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.576
and I will join you
when you speak out against sexism

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.856
or any other form of inequality.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.296
It's time for us to rise up

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.016
and collectively speak up

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.600
about structural inequality.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.936
We don't have to have all the answers

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.560
to call for change.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.440
We just need courage.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.560
The health of our patients,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.160
the health of us all, depends on it.
