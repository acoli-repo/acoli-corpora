00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.696
I was aware that socially marginalized
populations were at disproportionate risk

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.736
of getting and dying of AIDS.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.816
And on the sugar plantations,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.616
which really more closely
resembled feudal fiefdoms

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.616
than any modern enterprise,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.296
60 percent of pregnant women

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.360
tested HIV-positive.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.176
I worked to show how getting infected
was not a moral failure

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.976
but instead related
to a culture of male superiority,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.536
to forced migrant labor
and to colonialism.
