00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.536
keep me from doing good work,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.056
taking care of my patients,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.840
doing much-needed research.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.896
So I didn't speak out

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.040
about the government's
early stance on AIDS.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.616
I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.816
Many doctors, health professionals,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.720
may think I did nothing wrong.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.536
Our pact with our patients,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.296
the Hippocratic Oath and its variants,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.280
is about the sanctity
of the patient-doctor relationship.
