In 1980, the year of independence,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.216
25 percent of Zimbabwean children
were fully immunized.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.536
By 1990, a mere decade later,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.280
this proportion stood at 80 percent.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.096
I felt tremendously privileged
to be part of this transformation,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.576
a revolution.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.440
The excitement,
the camaraderie, was palpable.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.456
Working side by side
with brilliant Zimbabweans --
