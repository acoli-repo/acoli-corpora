00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.136
the transgender youth
who is contemplating suicide

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.776
because our society is just so harsh;

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.856
the single mother who has been made
to feel that she is responsible

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.440
for the poor health of her child.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.376
Our role as health professionals

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.560
is not just to treat our patients

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.720
but to sound the alarm

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.400
and advocate for change.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.576
Rightfully or not,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.576
our societal position
gives our voices great credibility,
