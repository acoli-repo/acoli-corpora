00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:30.081
the problem wasn't that there was a system
that didn't work well enough,

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.649
the problem was that we 
didn't have a system at all.

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:39.028
In fact, there's some pretty obvious
key missing pieces.

00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:43.940
We didn't have a group of epidemiologists 
ready to go, who would have gone,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.696
seen what the disease was,
seen how far it had spread.

00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:50.452
The case reports came in on paper.

00:01:50.452 --> 00:01:52.808
It was very delayed
before they were put online

00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:54.782
and they were extremely inaccurate.

00:01:55.492 --> 00:01:57.858
We didn't have a medical team ready to go.

00:01:57.858 --> 00:02:00.453
We didn't have a way of preparing people.
