00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:07.398
When I was a kid,

00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:10.959
the disaster we worried about most 
was a nuclear war.

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:15.085
That's why we had a barrel like this
down in our basement,

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:17.656
filled with cans of food and water.

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:19.901
When the nuclear attack came,

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:24.637
we were supposed to go downstairs,
hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:29.597
Today the greatest risk 
of global catastrophe

00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:32.457
doesn't look like this.
