00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:32.457
doesn't look like this.

00:00:32.457 --> 00:00:35.238
Instead, it looks like this.

00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:41.929
If anything kills over 10 million people
in the next few decades,

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.314
it's most likely to be 
a highly infectious virus

00:00:45.314 --> 00:00:47.792
rather than a war.

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:51.679
Not missiles, but microbes.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.878
Now, part of the reason for this is that

00:00:53.878 --> 00:00:58.081
we've invested a huge amount
in nuclear deterrents.

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:03.179
But we've actually invested very little 
in a system to stop an epidemic.
