00:01:57.858 --> 00:02:00.453
We didn't have a way of preparing people.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:05.784
Now, Médecins Sans Frontières 
did a great job orchestrating volunteers.

00:02:05.784 --> 00:02:08.880
But even so, we were far slower
than we should have been

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.022
getting the thousands of workers
into these countries.

00:02:12.022 --> 00:02:19.007
And a large epidemic would require us
to have hundreds of thousands of workers.

00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:25.155
There was no one there 
to look at treatment approaches.

00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:26.946
No one to look at the diagnostics.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:30.243
No one to figure out 
what tools should be used.
