Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;D
in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.

00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:05.246
There are some big breakthroughs, 
like the Adeno-associated virus,

00:07:05.246 --> 00:07:09.229
that could work very, very quickly.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:12.599
Now I don't have an exact budget
for what this would cost,

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:17.095
but I'm quite sure it's very modest
compared to the potential harm.

00:07:17.095 --> 00:07:21.740
The World Bank estimates that 
if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.465
global wealth will go down
by over three trillion dollars

00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:29.332
and we'd have millions
and millions of deaths.

00:07:29.332 --> 00:07:32.317
These investments 
offer significant benefits
