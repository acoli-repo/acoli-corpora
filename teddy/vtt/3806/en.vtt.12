00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:01.134
So those are the kinds of things
we need to deal with an epidemic.

00:06:01.134 --> 00:06:03.301
What are the key pieces?

00:06:03.301 --> 00:06:08.591
First, we need strong health systems
in poor countries.

00:06:08.591 --> 00:06:11.778
That's where mothers 
can give birth safely,

00:06:11.778 --> 00:06:13.295
kids can get all their vaccines.

00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:17.634
But, also where we'll see 
the outbreak very early on.

00:06:18.154 --> 00:06:19.935
We need a medical reserve corps:

00:06:19.935 --> 00:06:22.501
lots of people who've got 
the training and background

00:06:22.501 --> 00:06:25.853
who are ready to go, with the expertise.

00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:30.266
And then we need to pair those
medical people with the military.
