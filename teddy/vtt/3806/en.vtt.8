00:03:58.411 --> 00:04:00.115
And that was just luck.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:02.355
If it had gotten into a lot 
more urban areas,

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:05.877
the case numbers 
would have been much larger.

00:04:05.877 --> 00:04:09.466
So next time, we might not be so lucky.

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:14.530
You can have a virus where people 
feel well enough while they're infectious

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.842
that they get on a plane
or they go to a market.

00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:20.846
The source of the virus could be 
a natural epidemic like Ebola,

00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:22.826
or it could be bioterrorism.

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:27.474
So there are things that would literally
make things a thousand times worse.

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:33.475
In fact, let's look at a model
of a virus spread through the air,
