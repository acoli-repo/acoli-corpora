00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:30.266
And then we need to pair those
medical people with the military.

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:34.417
taking advantage of the military's ability
to move fast, do logistics

00:06:34.417 --> 00:06:36.220
and secure areas.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.129
We need to do simulations,

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.927
germ games, not war games,
so that we see where the holes are.

00:06:43.927 --> 00:06:46.723
The last time a germ game 
was done in the United States

00:06:46.723 --> 00:06:50.443
was back in 2001, 
and it didn't go so well.

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:55.490
So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.609
Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;D
in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.
