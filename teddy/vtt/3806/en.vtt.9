00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:33.475
In fact, let's look at a model
of a virus spread through the air,

00:04:33.475 --> 00:04:37.070
like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.560
So here's what would happen:

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.558
It would spread throughout the world
very, very quickly.

00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:48.683
And you can see over 30 million people
died from that epidemic.

00:04:48.683 --> 00:04:50.496
So this is a serious problem.

00:04:50.496 --> 00:04:52.257
We should be concerned.

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:56.692
But in fact, we can build
a really good response system.

00:04:56.692 --> 00:05:01.836
We have the benefits of all the science
and technology that we talk about here.
