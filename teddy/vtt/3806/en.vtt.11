00:05:29.793 --> 00:05:32.257
The best lessons, I think, 
on how to get prepared

00:05:32.257 --> 00:05:34.758
are again, what we do for war.

00:05:34.758 --> 00:05:39.005
For soldiers, we have full-time,
waiting to go.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:42.316
We have reserves that can scale 
us up to large numbers.

00:05:42.316 --> 00:05:46.005
NATO has a mobile unit 
that can deploy very rapidly.

00:05:46.005 --> 00:05:49.455
NATO does a lot of war games 
to check, are people well trained?

00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:51.883
Do they understand 
about fuel and logistics

00:05:51.883 --> 00:05:54.241
and the same radio frequencies?

00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:56.779
So they are absolutely ready to go.

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:01.134
So those are the kinds of things
we need to deal with an epidemic.
