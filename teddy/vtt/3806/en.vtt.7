00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:31.846
and nearly all were in the three
West African countries.

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:34.433
There's three reasons why
it didn't spread more.

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:38.874
The first is that there was a lot 
of heroic work by the health workers.

00:03:38.874 --> 00:03:42.136
They found the people and they 
prevented more infections.

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:44.621
The second is the nature of the virus.

00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.697
Ebola does not spread through the air.

00:03:47.697 --> 00:03:49.810
And by the time you're contagious,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.550
most people are so sick 
that they're bedridden.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.411
Third, it didn't get
into many urban areas.

00:03:58.411 --> 00:04:00.115
And that was just luck.
