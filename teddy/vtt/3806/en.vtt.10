00:04:56.692 --> 00:05:01.836
We have the benefits of all the science
and technology that we talk about here.

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:02.883
We've got cell phones

00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:06.140
to get information from the public 
and get information out to them.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.319
We have satellite maps where we can see
where people are and where they're moving.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.627
We have advances in biology

00:05:12.627 --> 00:05:16.453
that should dramatically change 
the turnaround time to look at a pathogen

00:05:16.453 --> 00:05:21.322
and be able to make drugs and vaccines
that fit for that pathogen.

00:05:21.322 --> 00:05:22.888
So we can have tools,

00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:27.500
but those tools need to be put
into an overall global health system.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.793
And we need preparedness.

00:05:29.793 --> 00:05:32.257
The best lessons, I think, 
on how to get prepared
