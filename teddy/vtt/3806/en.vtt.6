00:02:57.842 --> 00:03:02.674
There's a group of handsome
epidemiologists ready to go,

00:03:02.674 --> 00:03:08.446
they move in, they save the day,
but that's just pure Hollywood.

00:03:10.177 --> 00:03:13.887
The failure to prepare 
could allow the next epidemic

00:03:13.887 --> 00:03:17.695
to be dramatically 
more devastating than Ebola

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:23.531
Let's look at the progression 
of Ebola over this year.

00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.149
About 10,000 people died, 


00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:31.846
and nearly all were in the three
West African countries.
