Hi. I am an architect.

00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:04.456
I am the only architect in the world

00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:07.772
making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube,

00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:10.338
and this exhibition is the first one I did

00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:11.846
using paper tubes.

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:16.271
1986, much, much longer before people started talking

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:20.474
about ecological issues and environmental issues,

00:00:20.474 --> 00:00:23.764
I just started testing the paper tube

00:00:23.764 --> 00:00:26.499
in order to use this as a building structure.

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:31.652
It's very complicated to test the new material for the building,
