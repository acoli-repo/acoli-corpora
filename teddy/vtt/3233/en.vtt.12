is going to be really big,

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.471
but is it going to be good?

00:06:09.495 --> 00:06:12.312
Is the human race

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.469
Well, we hear all the time about
how things have been getting worse,

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:22.152

we take the long run,

00:06:22.176 --> 00:06:24.207

00:06:28.892 --> 00:06:31.915
Here's the proportion of people
not living in extreme poverty.
