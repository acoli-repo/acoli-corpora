00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:32.231
she would last
for about two million years.

00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:37.575
If the human race
were a single individual,

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.018
she would be just 10 years old today.

00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:45.692
And what's more, the human race
isn't a typical mammalian species.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.856
There's no reason why, if we're careful,

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.085
we should die off
after only two million years.

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:55.879
The earth will remain habitable
for 500 million years to come.

00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:58.640
And if someday, we took to the stars,

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.156
the civilization could continue
for billions more.
