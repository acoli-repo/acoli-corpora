00:07:59.725 --> 00:08:01.492
When we look to the coming centuries,

00:08:01.516 --> 00:08:04.163
we should expect to see
the same pattern again.

00:08:04.187 --> 00:08:07.543
And we can see some radically
powerful technologies on the horizon.

00:08:08.132 --> 00:08:10.981
Synthetic biology might give us
the power to create viruses

00:08:11.005 --> 00:08:14.052
of unprecedented
contagiousness and lethality.

00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:19.774
Geoengineering might give us the power
to dramatically alter the earth's climate.

00:08:19.798 --> 00:08:23.997
Artificial intelligence might give us
the power to create intelligent agents

00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:26.163
with abilities greater than our own.

00:08:28.222 --> 00:08:32.110
Now, I'm not saying that any
of these risks are particularly likely,
