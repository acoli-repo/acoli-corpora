00:03:28.594 --> 00:03:30.291
in that same time period.

00:03:31.893 --> 00:03:34.218
On our current best estimates,

00:03:34.242 --> 00:03:38.370
we can save a life by distributing
long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets

00:03:38.394 --> 00:03:40.297
for just a few thousand dollars.

00:03:40.911 --> 00:03:42.578
This is an amazing opportunity.

00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:46.109
The second big priority
is factory farming.

00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:48.244
This is superneglected.

00:03:48.768 --> 00:03:52.911
There are 50 billion land animals
used every year for food,

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:56.173
and the vast majority of them
are factory farmed,

00:03:56.197 --> 00:03:58.577
living in conditions
of horrific suffering.

00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:01.752
They're probably among
the worst-off creatures on this planet,
