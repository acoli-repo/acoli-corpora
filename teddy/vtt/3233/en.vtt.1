00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:31.488
the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions.

00:00:31.512 --> 00:00:34.297
And the basically flat graph you just saw

00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.996
transforms into this.

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:43.247
What this graph means is that,
in terms of power to change the world,

00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:46.709
we live in an unprecedented time
in human history,

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:50.677
and I believe our ethical understanding
hasn't yet caught up with this fact.

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:53.700
The Scientific and Industrial Revolutions

00:00:53.724 --> 00:00:56.633
transformed both
our understanding of the world

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:58.326
and our ability to alter it.

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:03.172
What we need is an ethical revolution
