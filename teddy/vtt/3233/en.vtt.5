00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:33.999
The more resources that have already been
invested into solving a problem,

00:02:34.023 --> 00:02:36.928
the harder it will be
to make additional progress.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.619
Now, the key thing that I want
to leave with you is this framework,

00:02:42.643 --> 00:02:44.627
so that you can think for yourself

00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:46.972
what are the highest global priorities.

00:02:47.954 --> 00:02:50.646
But I and others
in the effective altruism community

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.549
have converged on three moral issues
that we believe are unusually important,

00:02:56.573 --> 00:02:58.755
score unusually well in this framework.

00:02:59.151 --> 00:03:01.964
First is global health.
