00:02:59.151 --> 00:03:01.964
First is global health.

00:03:01.988 --> 00:03:04.399
This is supersolvable.

00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:07.820
We have an amazing track record
in global health.

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:13.264
Rates of death from measles,
malaria, diarrheal disease

00:03:13.288 --> 00:03:15.534
are down by over 70 percent.

00:03:17.534 --> 00:03:20.323
And in 1980, we eradicated smallpox.

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:25.482
I estimate we thereby saved
over 60 million lives.

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:28.570
That's more lives saved
than if we'd achieved world peace

00:03:28.594 --> 00:03:30.291
in that same time period.
