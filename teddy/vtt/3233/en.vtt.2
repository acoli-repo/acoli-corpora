00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:03.172
What we need is an ethical revolution

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:04.744
so that we can work out

00:01:04.768 --> 00:01:07.920
how do we use this tremendous
bounty of resources

00:01:07.944 --> 00:01:09.339
to improve the world.

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:11.840
For the last 10 years,

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:15.697
my colleagues and I have developed
a philosophy and research program

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:17.556
that we call effective altruism.

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:21.961
It tries to respond
to these radical changes in our world,

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:26.461
uses evidence and careful reasoning
to try to answer this question:

00:01:28.173 --> 00:01:30.451
How can we do the most good?
