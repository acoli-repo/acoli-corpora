00:10:01.885 --> 00:10:04.369
The final aspect of our framework then:

00:10:05.083 --> 00:10:06.273
Is this solvable?

00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:08.578
I believe it is.

00:10:09.014 --> 00:10:12.061
You can contribute with your money,

00:10:12.085 --> 00:10:14.729
your career or your political engagement.

00:10:16.225 --> 00:10:18.400
With your money,
you can support organizations

00:10:18.424 --> 00:10:19.726
that focus on these risks,

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.305
like the Nuclear Threat Initiative,

00:10:22.329 --> 00:10:25.989
which campaigns to take nuclear weapons
off hair-trigger alert,

00:10:26.013 --> 00:10:29.584
or the Blue Ribbon Panel, which
develops policy to minimize the damage

00:10:29.608 --> 00:10:31.703
from natural and man-made pandemics,
