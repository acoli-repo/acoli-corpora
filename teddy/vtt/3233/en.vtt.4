00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:02.136
Now, I'm going to give you a framework
for thinking about this question,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.096
and the framework is very simple.

00:02:04.842 --> 00:02:06.541
A problem's higher priority,

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:11.479
the bigger, the more easily solvable
and the more neglected it is.

00:02:12.694 --> 00:02:14.336
Bigger is better,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.201
because we've got more to gain
if we do solve the problem.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.790
More easily solvable is better

00:02:19.814 --> 00:02:22.638
because I can solve the problem
with less time or money.

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:25.800
And most subtly,

00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:29.530
more neglected is better,
because of diminishing returns.
