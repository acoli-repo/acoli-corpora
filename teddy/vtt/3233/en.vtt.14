00:06:57.858 --> 00:07:00.748
in terms of total human
flourishing over time,

00:07:00.772 --> 00:07:04.127
well, this is what we would expect
future progress to look like.

00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:06.031
It's vast.

00:07:06.953 --> 00:07:08.151
Here, for example,

00:07:08.175 --> 00:07:11.921
is where we would expect no one
to live in extreme poverty.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.132
Here is where we would expect
everyone to be better off

00:07:17.156 --> 00:07:19.009
than the richest person alive today.

00:07:20.081 --> 00:07:23.273
Perhaps here is where we would discover
the fundamental natural laws

00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:24.565
that govern our world.

00:07:25.516 --> 00:07:29.221
Perhaps here is where we discover
an entirely new form of art,

00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:32.285
a form of music we currently lack
the ears to hear.
