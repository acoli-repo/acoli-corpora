00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:30.443
Now the third area is the one
that I want to focus on the most,

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:33.451
and that's the category
of existential risks:

00:04:33.475 --> 00:04:37.348
events like a nuclear war
or a global pandemic

00:04:38.824 --> 00:04:41.435
that could permanently derail civilization

00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:44.592
or even lead to the extinction
of the human race.

00:04:45.882 --> 00:04:48.422
Let me explain why I think
this is such a big priority

00:04:48.446 --> 00:04:49.783
in terms of this framework.

00:04:50.992 --> 00:04:52.404
First, size.

00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:57.230
How bad would it be if there were
a truly existential catastrophe?

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.262
Well, it would involve the deaths
of all seven billion people on this planet
