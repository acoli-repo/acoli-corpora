Now, I'm not saying that any
of these risks are particularly likely,

00:08:32.134 --> 00:08:33.778
but when there's so much at stake,

00:08:33.802 --> 00:08:36.769
even small probabilities
matter a great deal.

00:08:37.568 --> 00:08:40.569
Imagine if you're getting on a plane
and you're kind of nervous,

00:08:40.593 --> 00:08:44.037
and the pilot reassures you by saying,

00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:48.695
"There's only a one-in-a-thousand
chance of crashing. Don't worry."

00:08:50.157 --> 00:08:51.711
Would you feel reassured?

00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:56.597
For these reasons, I think that preserving
the future of humanity

00:08:56.621 --> 00:08:59.605
is among the most important problems
that we currently face.
