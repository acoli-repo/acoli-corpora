They're probably among
the worst-off creatures on this planet,

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:04.634
and in many cases, we could
significantly improve their lives

00:04:04.658 --> 00:04:06.260
for just pennies per animal.

00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:09.205
Yet this is hugely neglected.

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.039
There are 3,000 times

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.973
but yet, factory farming gets one fiftieth

00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:24.339

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:30.443
Now the third area is the one
that I want to focus on the most,
