00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:02.336
This is a graph

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.019
that represents the economic history
of human civilization.

00:00:06.043 --> 00:00:08.443
[World GDP per capita
over the last 200,000 years]

00:00:11.757 --> 00:00:13.760
There's not much going on, is there.

00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:17.098
For the vast majority of human history,

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:21.883
pretty much everyone lived
on the equivalent of one dollar per day,

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:23.193
and not much changed.

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:27.534
But then, something
extraordinary happened:

00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:31.488
the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions.
