00:09:28.313 --> 00:09:31.555
They don't get to influence
the decisions we make today.

00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:33.186
They're voiceless.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.935
And that means we still spend
a paltry amount on these issues:

00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:39.758
nuclear nonproliferation,

00:09:39.782 --> 00:09:42.112
geoengineering, biorisk,

00:09:43.414 --> 00:09:45.056
artificial intelligence safety.

00:09:45.923 --> 00:09:48.797
All of these receive
only a few tens of millions of dollars

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:50.748
of philanthropic funding every year.

00:09:52.044 --> 00:09:55.973
That's tiny compared
to the 390 billion dollars

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.051
that's spent on US philanthropy in total.
