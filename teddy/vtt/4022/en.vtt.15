00:07:29.722 --> 00:07:31.352
the smartphones and the Internet,

00:07:31.352 --> 00:07:34.748
we are able to see and understand
most of what's happening in the world,

00:07:34.748 --> 00:07:36.897
and people are able to tell their story —

00:07:36.897 --> 00:07:38.796
but it's only partly true.

00:07:38.796 --> 00:07:41.794
Still today, with all
the technology we have,

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:44.202
less than half of the world's population

00:07:44.202 --> 00:07:46.478
has access to the Internet,

00:07:46.478 --> 00:07:49.025
and more than three billion people —

00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:50.589
I'm repeating the number —

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:56.891
three billion people are consuming news
that is censored by those in power.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.419
More or less around the same time,
