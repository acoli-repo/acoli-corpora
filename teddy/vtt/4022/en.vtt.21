00:10:25.562 --> 00:10:30.875
we've seen images that are staged 
or brought from a different conflict.

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:33.828
This misinformation destroyed
the credibility of the source,

00:10:33.828 --> 00:10:38.608
and it's harmed the credibility of other
reliable and trustworthy sources.

00:10:38.608 --> 00:10:42.611
We use a variety of ways to make sure
we can verify the information

00:10:42.611 --> 00:10:44.559
and we can trust the material.

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:46.432
It starts with vetting the partners,

00:10:46.432 --> 00:10:49.645

and working with them very intensively.

00:10:49.645 --> 00:10:51.780
How do you film a location?

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.614
You film road signs, you film watches,

00:10:53.614 --> 00:10:54.956
you film newspapers.

00:10:54.956 --> 00:10:59.442
We are checking maps, looking at maps,

00:10:59.442 --> 00:11:01.695
double-checking the information,
