00:08:27.326 --> 00:08:31.121
We tried to understand how we can help.

00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:33.790
There were four things that I learned.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.250
The first thing is that we have to engage

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.409
with communities that are
living in rural areas,

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.814
where violations are happening
far from the public eye.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.645
We need to partner with them,

00:08:44.645 --> 00:08:48.566
and we need to understand which images
are not making it out there

00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:51.474
and help them to document them.

00:08:51.824 --> 00:08:53.642
The second thing I learned

00:08:53.642 --> 00:08:57.424
is that we have to enable them 
to film in a safe way.

00:08:57.424 --> 00:09:01.803
Security has to be the priority.
