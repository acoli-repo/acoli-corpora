Security has to be the priority.

00:09:01.803 --> 00:09:04.006
Where I used to work before,
in the West Bank,

00:09:04.006 --> 00:09:05.646
one can take a camera out,

00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:08.339
most likely not going to get shot,

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:09.884
but in places we wanted to work,

00:09:09.884 --> 00:09:15.094
just try to pull a phone out,
and you're dead — literally dead.

00:09:15.094 --> 00:09:16.624
This is why we decided

00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:18.568
to take the operation undercover

00:09:18.568 --> 00:09:19.995
when necessary,

00:09:19.995 --> 00:09:22.026
and use mostly hidden cameras.

00:09:22.026 --> 00:09:25.403
Unfortunately, I can't show you
the hidden cameras we're using today —

00:09:25.403 --> 00:09:26.845
for obvious reasons —

00:09:26.845 --> 00:09:29.097
but these are cameras we used before.

00:09:29.097 --> 00:09:31.187
You can buy them off the shelf.
