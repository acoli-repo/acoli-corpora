who are the ones that are 
influencing the situation,

00:11:35.979 --> 00:11:40.036
and when to release the material
to advance the struggle.

00:11:40.036 --> 00:11:42.473
Sometimes, it's about
putting it in the media,

00:11:42.473 --> 00:11:44.399
mostly local ones, to create awareness.

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.835
Sometimes it's working
with decision makers,

00:11:46.835 --> 00:11:48.009
to change laws.

00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:52.535
Sometimes, it's working with lawyers
to use as evidence in court.

00:11:52.535 --> 00:11:54.053
But more than often,

00:11:54.053 --> 00:11:58.011
the most effective way
to create a social change

00:11:58.011 --> 00:12:00.342
is to work within the community.
