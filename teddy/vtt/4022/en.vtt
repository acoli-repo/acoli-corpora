00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.543
I would like to start

00:00:02.543 --> 00:00:04.504
with the story of Mary,

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:07.495
a woman from an African village.

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:09.088
Her first memories

00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:11.940
are of her family fleeing violent riots

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.797
orchestrated by 
the ruling political party.

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:19.794
Her brother was murdered
by the state-sponsored militia,

00:00:19.794 --> 00:00:21.371
and she was raped more than once

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:25.580
just because she belonged
to the wrong party.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.743
One morning, a month before the election,

00:00:29.743 --> 00:00:33.464
Mary's village was called 
to another intimidation meeting.
