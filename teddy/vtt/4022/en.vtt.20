00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:00.966
we work to understand
the risk of every location

00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:03.647
and of every shot before it's happened,

00:10:03.647 --> 00:10:06.549
building a backup plan
if something goes wrong,

00:10:06.549 --> 00:10:08.941
and making sure 
we have everything in place

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.892
before our operations start.

00:10:11.892 --> 00:10:15.707
The third thing I learned
is the importance of verification.

00:10:15.707 --> 00:10:18.311
You can have an amazing shot of atrocity,

00:10:18.311 --> 00:10:22.079
but if you can't verify it,
it's worth nothing.

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:25.562
Recently, like in the ongoing war 
in Syria or the war in Gaza,

00:10:25.562 --> 00:10:30.875
we've seen images that are staged 
or brought from a different conflict.
