I want to give you one example.

Fatuma is part of a network of women
that are fighting abuses in Kenya.

00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:11.282
Women in her community
have been harassed constantly

00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:14.157
on their way to school
and on their way to work.

00:12:14.157 --> 00:12:17.854
They are trying to change 
the behavior of the community from inside.

00:12:17.854 --> 00:12:20.384
In the next clip,

00:12:20.384 --> 00:12:24.649

on her journey to work.

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:28.553
Her voice is superimposed
on images that she filmed herself

00:12:28.557 --> 00:12:31.095
using hidden cameras.
