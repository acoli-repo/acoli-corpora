00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:04.492
I've been a police officer
in an urban city

00:00:04.516 --> 00:00:06.309
for nearly 25 years.

00:00:06.992 --> 00:00:08.333
That's crazy, right?

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.602
And in that time,
I've served in every rank,

00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:15.470
from police officer to police chief.

00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:19.699
A few years ago,
I noticed something alarming.

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:22.212
Starting in 2014,

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:23.921
I started monitoring recruits

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:27.926
as they cycled through police academies
in the state of New Jersey,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.569
and I found that women were failing
at rates between 65 and 80 percent,
