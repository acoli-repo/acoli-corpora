00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.096
between successful
decision-making with data

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.736
and unsuccessful decision-making,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.640
and I find this a pattern worth sharing,
and it goes something like this.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.655
So whenever you're
solving a complex problem,

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.416
you're doing essentially two things.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.736
The first one is, you take that problem
apart into its bits and pieces

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.256
so that you can deeply analyze
those bits and pieces,

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.296
and then of course
you do the second part.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.976
You put all of these bits and pieces
back together again

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.336
to come to your conclusion.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.696
And sometimes you
have to do it over again,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.376
but it's always those two things:

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.720
taking apart and putting
back together again.
