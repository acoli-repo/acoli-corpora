even when you have incomplete information,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.456
and coming to a good conclusion,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.416
especially if it's the brain of an expert.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.096
And that's why I believe
that Netflix was so successful,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.696
because they used data and brains
where they belong in the process.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.256
They use data to first understand
lots of pieces about their audience

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.696
that they otherwise wouldn't have
been able to understand at that depth,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.336
but then the decision
to take all these bits and pieces

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.696
and put them back together again
and make a show like "House of Cards,"

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.136
that was nowhere in the data.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.136
Ted Sarandos and his team
made that decision to license that show,
