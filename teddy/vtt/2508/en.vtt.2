He has to find shows
that are really, really great.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.536

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.936
that are on the very right end
of this curve here.

So this curve here
is the rating distribution

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.016
of about 2,500 TV shows
on the website IMDB,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.936
and the rating goes from one to 10,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.936
and the height here shows you
how many shows get that rating.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.656
So if your show gets a rating
of nine points or higher, that's a winner.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.496
Then you have a top two percent show.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.416
That's shows like "Breaking Bad,"
"Game of Thrones," "The Wire,"

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.736
so all of these shows that are addictive,
