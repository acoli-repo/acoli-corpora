00:07:01.506 --> 00:07:03.133
doesn't know what to do with data.

00:07:03.158 --> 00:07:05.456

Yes, even Google gets it wrong sometimes.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.176
In 2009, Google announced
that they were able, with data analysis,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.336
to predict outbreaks of influenza,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.136

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.016
And it worked beautifully,
and it made a big splash in the news,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.176
including the pinnacle
of scientific success:

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.656
a publication in the journal "Nature."

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.296
It worked beautifully
for year after year after year,
