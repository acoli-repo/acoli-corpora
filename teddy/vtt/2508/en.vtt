Roy Price is a man that most of you
have probably never heard about,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.616
even though he may have been responsible

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.536
for 22 somewhat mediocre 
minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.736
He may have also been responsible
for 22 very entertaining minutes,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.016
but not very many of you.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.936
And all of that goes back to a decision

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.960
that Roy had to make
about three years ago.

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:28.816
So you see, Roy Price
is a senior executive with Amazon Studios.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.856
That's the TV production
company of Amazon.
