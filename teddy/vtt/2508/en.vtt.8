Meanwhile, however,
at about the same time,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.776
at another company,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.016
another executive did manage
to land a top show using data analysis,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.616
and his name is Ted,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.056
Ted Sarandos, who is
the Chief Content Officer of Netflix,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.216
and just like Roy,
he's on a constant mission

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.736
to find that great TV show,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.776
and he uses data as well to do that,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.815
except he does it
a little bit differently.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.576
So instead of holding a competition,
what he did -- and his team of course --

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.136
was they looked at all the data
they already had about Netflix viewers,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.256
you know, the ratings
they give their shows,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.976
the viewing histories,
what shows people like, and so on.
