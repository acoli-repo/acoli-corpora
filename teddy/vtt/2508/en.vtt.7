"Amazon should do a sitcom
about four Republican US Senators."

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.656
They did that show.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.840
So does anyone know the name of the show?

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.016
(Audience: "Alpha House.")

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.496
Yes, "Alpha House,"

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.616
but it seems like not too many of you here
remember that show, actually,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.496

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.416
and "Alpha House" lands at 7.5,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.456
so a slightly above average show,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.400
but certainly not what Roy Price
and his team were aiming for.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.176
Meanwhile, however,
at about the same time,
