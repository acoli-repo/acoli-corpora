00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.416
and so what he does is,
he holds a competition.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.576
So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.896
and from those ideas,
through an evaluation,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.016
they select eight candidates for TV shows,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.256
and then he just makes the first episode
of each one of these shows

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.416
and puts them online for free
for everyone to watch.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.696
And so when Amazon
is giving out free stuff,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.256
you're going to take it, right?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.416
So millions of viewers
are watching those episodes.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.656
What they don't realize is that,
while they're watching their shows,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.976
actually, they are being watched.
