00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.616
because if you have a decision to make,
a yes or no question,

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.376
all you have to do is you shake the ball,
and then you get an answer --

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.216
"Most Likely" -- right here
in this window in real time.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.336
I'll have it out later for tech demos.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.576
(Laughter)

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.176
Now, the thing is, of course --
so I've made some decisions in my life

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.096
where, in hindsight,
I should have just listened to the ball.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.456
But, you know, of course,
if you have the data available,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.536
you want to replace this with something
much more sophisticated,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.176
like data analysis
to come to a better decision.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.816
But that does not change the basic setup.
