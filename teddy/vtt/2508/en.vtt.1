00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.856
That's the TV production
company of Amazon.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.136
He's 47 years old, slim, spiky hair,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.976
describes himself on Twitter
as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.176
And Roy Price has a very responsible job,
because it's his responsibility

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.256
to pick the shows, the original content
that Amazon is going to make.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.616
And of course that's
a highly competitive space.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.376
I mean, there are so many
TV shows already out there,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.576
that Roy can't just choose any show.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.696
He has to find shows
that are really, really great.
