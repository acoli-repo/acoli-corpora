00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.976
actually, they are being watched.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.336
They are being watched
by Roy Price and his team,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.736
who record everything.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.136
They record when somebody presses play,
when somebody presses pause,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.696
what parts they skip,
what parts they watch again.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.976
So they collect millions of data points,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.096
because they want
to have those data points

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.816
to then decide
which show they should make.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.016
And sure enough,
so they collect all the data,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.616
they do all the data crunching,
and an answer emerges,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.856
and the answer is,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.416
"Amazon should do a sitcom
about four Republican US Senators."
