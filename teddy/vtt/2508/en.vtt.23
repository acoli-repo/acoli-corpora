00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.816
But that does not change the basic setup.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.016
So the ball may get smarter
and smarter and smarter,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.856
but I believe it's still on us
to make the decisions

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.896
if we want to achieve
something extraordinary,

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.856
on the right end of the curve.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.376
And I find that a very encouraging
message, in fact,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.376
that even in the face
of huge amounts of data,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.496
it still pays off to make decisions,

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.176
to be an expert in what you're doing

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.296
and take risks.
