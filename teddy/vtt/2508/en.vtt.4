00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.896
So what he's worried about
is this middle bulge here,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.736
the bulge of average TV,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.616
you know, those shows
that aren't really good or really bad,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.295
they don't really get you excited.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.176
So he needs to make sure
that he's really on the right end of this.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.776
So the pressure is on,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.976
and of course it's also the first time

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.176
that Amazon is even
doing something like this,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.536
so Roy Price does not want
to take any chances.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.016
He wants to engineer success.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.816
He needs a guaranteed success,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.416
and so what he does is,
he holds a competition.
