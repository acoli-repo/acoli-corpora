00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.656
into the workplace,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.496
law enforcement,

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.720
medicine.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.736
So we should better make sure
that data is helping.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.896
Now, personally I've seen
a lot of this struggle with data myself,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.896
because I work in computational genetics,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.416
which is also a field
where lots of very smart people

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.096
are using unimaginable amounts of data
to make pretty serious decisions

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.680
like deciding on a cancer therapy
or developing a drug.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.896
And over the years,
I've noticed a sort of pattern

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.376
or kind of rule, if you will,
about the difference

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.096
between successful
decision-making with data
