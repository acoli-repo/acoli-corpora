00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.656
at least for the first two seasons.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.656
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.856
"House of Cards" gets
a 9.1 rating on this curve,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.056
so it's exactly
where they wanted it to be.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.496
Now, the question of course is,
what happened here?

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.176
So you have two very competitive,
data-savvy companies.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.056
They connect all of these
millions of data points,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.456
and then it works
beautifully for one of them,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.336
and it doesn't work for the other one.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.576
So why?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.056
Because logic kind of tells you
that this should be working all the time.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.536
I mean, if you're collecting
millions of data points
