00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.736
so all of these shows that are addictive,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.816
whereafter you've watched a season,
your brain is basically like,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.016
"Where can I get more of these episodes?"

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.240
That kind of show.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.416
On the left side, just for clarity,
here on that end,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.616

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.071
about what's going on
on that end of the curve.

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:55.256
Now, Roy Price is not worried about
getting on the left end of the curve,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.216
because I think you would have to have
some serious brainpower

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.936
to undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras."

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.896
So what he's worried about
is this middle bulge here,
