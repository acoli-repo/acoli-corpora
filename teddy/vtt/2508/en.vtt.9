00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.976
the viewing histories,
what shows people like, and so on.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.896
And then they use that data to discover

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.536
all of these little bits and pieces
about the audience:

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.016
what kinds of shows they like,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.136
what kind of producers,
what kind of actors.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.736
And once they had
all of these pieces together,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.416
they took a leap of faith,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.536
and they decided to license

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.016
not a sitcom about four Senators

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.920
but a drama series about a single Senator.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.416
You guys know the show?

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.736
(Laughter)

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.496
Yes, "House of Cards," and Netflix
of course, nailed it with that show,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.656
at least for the first two seasons.
