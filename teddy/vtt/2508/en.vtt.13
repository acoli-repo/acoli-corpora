00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.856
will be used in determining
whether to grant that parole.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.456
So it's the same principle
as Amazon and Netflix,

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.096
but now instead of deciding whether
a TV show is going to be good or bad,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.016
you're deciding whether a person
is going to be good or bad.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.536
And mediocre TV, 22 minutes,
that can be pretty bad,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.200
but more years in prison,
I guess, even worse.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.496
And unfortunately, there is actually
some evidence that this data analysis,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.736
despite having lots of data,
does not always produce optimum results.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.482
And that's not because a company
like Multi-Health Systems
