Before his death in California in 1991,

00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:09.954
a man named William Kane wrote a letter
to the children from his first marriage

00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:12.121
and to his fiancee, Deborah.

00:00:12.538 --> 00:00:13.829
It read,

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:18.913
"I address this to my children
because although I have only two of you,

00:00:18.913 --> 00:00:20.454
Everett and Katie,

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:24.454
it may be that Deborah decides,
as I hope she will,

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:27.996
to have a child by me after my death.

00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:32.746
I have been assiduously generating
sperm samples for that eventuality.
