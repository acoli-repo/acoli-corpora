They told me that they preferred
me on YouTube than in person.

00:02:00.472 --> 00:02:07.000
(Laughter)

00:02:07.473 --> 00:02:11.763
And once you get over
the backhanded nature of that,

00:02:11.787 --> 00:02:14.095
there was actually something
very profound there.

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:17.945
They were saying that they preferred
the automated version of their cousin

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.119
to their cousin.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.069
At first it's very unintuitive,

00:02:21.093 --> 00:02:24.851
but when you think about it from their
point of view, it makes a ton of sense.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:28.695
You have this situation where now
they can pause and repeat their cousin,

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.743
without feeling
like they're wasting my time.
