00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.740
That's analogous to --
imagine learning to ride a bicycle.

00:08:31.764 --> 00:08:34.633
Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,

00:08:34.657 --> 00:08:38.570
and I give you a bicycle for two weeks,
then I come back after two weeks,

00:08:38.594 --> 00:08:41.744
and say, "Well, let's see.
You're having trouble taking left turns.

00:08:41.768 --> 00:08:45.005
You can't quite stop.
You're an 80 percent bicyclist."

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:47.451
So I put a big "C" stamp
on your forehead --

00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:48.537
(Laughter)

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.323
and then I say, "Here's a unicycle."

00:08:50.347 --> 00:08:51.441
(Laughter)

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:53.300
But as ridiculous as that sounds,

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.976
that's exactly what's happening
in our classrooms right now.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.609
And the idea is you fast forward

00:08:59.633 --> 00:09:02.619
and good students start failing
algebra all of the sudden,
