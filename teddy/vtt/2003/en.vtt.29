00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.503
what's happening in education.

00:14:31.527 --> 00:14:33.828
And that brings up an interesting point.

00:14:33.852 --> 00:14:36.582
A lot of the effort
in humanizing the classroom

00:14:36.606 --> 00:14:39.526
is focused on student-to-teacher ratios.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.049
In our mind, the relevant metric is:

00:14:42.073 --> 00:14:45.975
student-to-valuable-human-time-
with-the-teacher ratio.

00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:48.524
So in a traditional model,
most of the teacher's time

00:14:48.548 --> 00:14:50.920
is spent doing lectures
and grading and whatnot.

00:14:50.944 --> 00:14:53.840
Maybe five percent of their time
is sitting next to students

00:14:53.864 --> 00:14:55.024
and working with them.

00:14:55.048 --> 00:14:57.055
Now, 100 percent of their time is.

00:14:57.079 --> 00:15:00.349
So once again, using technology,
not just flipping the classroom,
