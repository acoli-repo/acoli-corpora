00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:01.474
But it's fundamentally different

00:08:01.498 --> 00:08:03.785
than what's happening
in classrooms right now.

00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:05.711
In a traditional classroom,

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.976
you have homework, lecture,
homework, lecture,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.839
and then you have a snapshot exam.

00:08:10.863 --> 00:08:14.520
And that exam, whether you get
a 70 percent, an 80 percent,

00:08:14.544 --> 00:08:15.989
a 90 percent or a 95 percent,

00:08:16.013 --> 00:08:18.456
the class moves on to the next topic.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.225
And even that 95 percent student --

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:22.258
what was the five percent
they didn't know?

00:08:22.282 --> 00:08:26.103
Maybe they didn't know what happens when
you raise something to the zeroth power.

00:08:26.127 --> 00:08:28.376
Then you build on that
in the next concept.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.740
That's analogous to --
imagine learning to ride a bicycle.
