00:15:29.787 --> 00:15:31.976
about what they do or don't know.

00:15:32.406 --> 00:15:34.034
Now imagine what happens where --

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.969
we talked about the peers
teaching each other

00:15:36.993 --> 00:15:38.802
inside of a classroom.

00:15:38.826 --> 00:15:40.556
But this is all one system.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.882
There's no reason why you can't
have that peer-to-peer tutoring

00:15:43.906 --> 00:15:45.976
beyond that one classroom.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.976
Imagine what happens
if that student in Calcutta

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.168
all of the sudden can tutor your son,

00:15:51.192 --> 00:15:53.653
or your son can tutor
that kid in Calcutta.

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:55.976
And I think what you'll see emerging

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.903
is this notion of a global
one-world classroom.
