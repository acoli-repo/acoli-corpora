can enjoy the videos in the way
that my cousins did,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.476
they can pause, repeat at their
own pace, at their own time.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.681
But the more interesting thing --

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.993
by removing the one-size-fits-all
lecture from the classroom,

00:06:42.017 --> 00:06:45.017
and letting students have
a self-paced lecture at home,

00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:46.692

having the teacher walk around,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.326
having the peers actually be able

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.984

00:06:58.008 --> 00:07:00.470
They took a fundamentally
