00:05:25.507 --> 00:05:30.269
If Isaac Newton had done
YouTube videos on calculus,

00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:31.531
I wouldn't have to.

00:05:31.555 --> 00:05:33.340
(Laughter)

00:05:33.364 --> 00:05:35.976
Assuming he was good. We don't know.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.602
(Laughter)

00:05:38.626 --> 00:05:41.666
The other thing that happened --
and even at this point, I said,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.904
"OK, maybe it's a good supplement.
It's good for motivated students.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.754
It's good for maybe home-schoolers."

00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:50.053
But I didn't think it would somehow
penetrate the classroom.

00:05:50.077 --> 00:05:52.203
Then I started getting
letters from teachers,

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.052
and the teachers would write, saying,

00:05:54.076 --> 00:05:56.297
"We've used your videos
to flip the classroom.

00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.898
You've given the lectures,
so now what we do --"

00:05:58.922 --> 00:06:02.460
And this could happen in every classroom
in America tomorrow --
