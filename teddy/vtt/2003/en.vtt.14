00:06:58.008 --> 00:07:00.470
They took a fundamentally
dehumanizing experience --

00:07:00.494 --> 00:07:02.985
30 kids with their fingers on their lips,

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:04.963
not allowed to interact with each other.

00:07:04.987 --> 00:07:06.479
A teacher, no matter how good,

00:07:06.503 --> 00:07:09.812
has to give this one-size-fits-all
lecture to 30 students --

00:07:09.836 --> 00:07:12.199
blank faces, slightly antagonistic --

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.794
and now it's a human experience,

00:07:13.818 --> 00:07:16.127
now they're actually
interacting with each other.

00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:18.936
So once the Khan Academy --

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.112
I quit my job,

00:07:20.136 --> 00:07:22.580
and we turned into a real organization --

00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:24.397
we're a not-for-profit --

00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:27.515
the question is, how do we take this
to the next level?

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:31.047
How do we take what those teachers
were doing to its natural conclusion?
