00:09:29.643 --> 00:09:32.707
We encourage you to experiment.
We encourage you to fail.

00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:34.381
But we do expect mastery.

00:09:35.921 --> 00:09:37.841
This is just another one of the modules.

00:09:37.865 --> 00:09:39.285
This is trigonometry.

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:41.824
This is shifting and reflecting functions.

00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:43.975
And they all fit together.

00:09:43.999 --> 00:09:45.957
We have about 90 of these right now.

00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:47.590
You can go to the site right now,

00:09:47.614 --> 00:09:49.686
it's all free,
not trying to sell anything.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.850
But the general idea is that they all
fit into this knowledge map.

00:09:52.874 --> 00:09:55.993
That top node right there,
that's literally single-digit addition,

00:09:56.017 --> 00:09:58.292
it's like one plus one is equal to two.

00:09:58.316 --> 00:10:00.668
The paradigm is, once you get
10 in a row on that,
