00:13:28.895 --> 00:13:33.339
Because every time we've done this,
in every classroom we've done,

00:13:33.363 --> 00:13:35.687
over and over again,
if you go five days into it,

00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:37.724
there's a group of kids who've raced ahead

00:13:37.748 --> 00:13:39.661
and a group who are a little bit slower.

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:42.088
In a traditional model,
in a snapshot assessment,

00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:45.024
you say, "These are the gifted kids,
these are the slow kids.

00:13:45.048 --> 00:13:47.016
Maybe they should be tracked differently.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.270
Maybe we should put them
in different classes."

00:13:49.294 --> 00:13:51.698
But when you let students
work at their own pace --

00:13:51.722 --> 00:13:53.323
we see it over and over again --

00:13:53.347 --> 00:13:55.772
you see students who took
a little bit extra time

00:13:55.796 --> 00:13:57.647
on one concept or the other,

00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.867
but once they get through that concept,

00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:01.239
they just race ahead.
