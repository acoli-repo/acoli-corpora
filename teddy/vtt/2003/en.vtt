Khan Academy is most known
for its collection of videos,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.976
so before I go any further,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.339
let me show you a little bit of a montage.

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:12.435
(Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse
is now going to be five.

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.752
This animal's fossils are only found
in this area of South America --

00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:17.356
a nice clean band here --

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.569
and this part of Africa.

00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:21.759
We can integrate over the surface,

00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:24.624
and the notation
usually is a capital sigma.

00:00:24.648 --> 00:00:27.814
National Assembly: They create
the Committee of Public Safety,

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:29.799
which sounds like a very nice committee.

00:00:29.823 --> 00:00:33.528
Notice, this is an aldehyde,
and it's an alcohol.
