00:04:29.553 --> 00:04:32.976
This is just an excerpt
from one of those letters:

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.471
"My 12 year-old son has autism,

00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:37.717
and has had a terrible time with math.

00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:38.976
We have tried everything,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.976
viewed everything, bought everything.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.685
We stumbled on your video
on decimals, and it got through.

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:46.693
Then we went on to the dreaded fractions.

00:04:46.717 --> 00:04:47.868
Again, he got it.

00:04:47.892 --> 00:04:49.058
We could not believe it.

00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:50.299
He is so excited."

00:04:51.184 --> 00:04:52.550
And so you can imagine,

00:04:52.574 --> 00:04:56.708
here I was, an analyst at a hedge fund --

00:04:56.732 --> 00:05:00.001
it was very strange for me to do
something of social value.
