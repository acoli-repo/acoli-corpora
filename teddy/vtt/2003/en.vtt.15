00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:31.047
How do we take what those teachers
were doing to its natural conclusion?

00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:32.976
And so, what I'm showing over here,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.634
these are actual exercises

00:07:35.658 --> 00:07:37.976
that I started writing for my cousins.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.096
The ones I started
were much more primitive.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.490
This is a more competent version of it.

00:07:43.514 --> 00:07:46.903
But the paradigm here is, we'll generate
as many questions as you need,

00:07:46.927 --> 00:07:49.976
until you get that concept,
until you get 10 in a row.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.976
And the Khan Academy videos are there.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.333
You get hints, the actual
steps for that problem,

00:07:54.357 --> 00:07:56.314
if you don't know how to do it.

00:07:56.338 --> 00:07:58.648
The paradigm here seems
like a very simple thing:

00:07:58.672 --> 00:07:59.870
10 in a row, you move on.

00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:01.474
But it's fundamentally different
