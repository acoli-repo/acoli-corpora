00:09:58.316 --> 00:10:00.668
The paradigm is, once you get
10 in a row on that,

00:10:00.692 --> 00:10:03.875
it keeps forwarding you
to more and more advanced modules.

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:06.978
Further down the knowledge map,

00:10:07.002 --> 00:10:09.249
we're getting into more
advanced arithmetic.

00:10:09.273 --> 00:10:12.446
Further down, you start getting
into pre-algebra and early algebra.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.213
Further down, you start getting
into algebra one, algebra two,

00:10:16.237 --> 00:10:17.769
a little bit of precalculus.

00:10:18.142 --> 00:10:21.339
And the idea is, from this we can
actually teach everything --

00:10:21.363 --> 00:10:25.205
well, everything that can be taught
in this type of a framework.

00:10:25.229 --> 00:10:28.038
So you can imagine -- and this
is what we are working on --

00:10:28.062 --> 00:10:31.625
from this knowledge map, you have
logic, you have computer programming,
