00:10:58.676 --> 00:11:01.564
this is data from a pilot
in the Los Altos school district,

00:11:01.588 --> 00:11:04.904
where they took two fifth-grade classes
and two seventh-grade classes,

00:11:04.928 --> 00:11:07.179
and completely gutted
their old math curriculum.

00:11:07.203 --> 00:11:10.638
These kids aren't using textbooks,
or getting one-size-fits-all lectures.

00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:14.655
They're doing Khan Academy, that software,
for roughly half of their math class.

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:17.886
I want to be clear: we don't view this
as a complete math education.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.808
What it does is -- this is
what's happening in Los Altos --

00:11:20.832 --> 00:11:23.233
it frees up time --
it's the blocking and tackling,

00:11:23.257 --> 00:11:26.233
making sure you know how to move
through a system of equations,

00:11:26.257 --> 00:11:28.892
and it frees up time
for the simulations, for the games,

00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:30.932
for the mechanics, for the robot-building,
