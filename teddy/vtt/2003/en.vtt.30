00:14:57.079 --> 00:15:00.349
So once again, using technology,
not just flipping the classroom,

00:15:00.373 --> 00:15:02.731
you're humanizing
the classroom, I'd argue,

00:15:02.755 --> 00:15:04.769
by a factor of five or 10.

00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:07.126
As valuable as that is in Los Altos,

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.191
imagine what it does to the adult learner,

00:15:09.215 --> 00:15:11.278
who's embarrassed to go back
and learn stuff

00:15:11.302 --> 00:15:13.754
they should have known
before going back to college.

00:15:13.778 --> 00:15:19.711
Imagine what it does
to a street kid in Calcutta,

00:15:19.735 --> 00:15:22.477
who has to help his family during the day,

00:15:22.501 --> 00:15:24.907
and that's the reason
he or she can't go to school.

00:15:24.931 --> 00:15:27.414
Now they can spend two hours
a day and remediate,

00:15:27.438 --> 00:15:29.763
or get up to speed
and not feel embarrassed

00:15:29.787 --> 00:15:31.976
about what they do or don't know.
