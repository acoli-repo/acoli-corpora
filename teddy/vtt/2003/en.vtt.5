without feeling
like they're wasting my time.

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:34.139
If they have to review something

00:02:34.163 --> 00:02:36.718
that they should have learned
a couple of weeks ago,

00:02:36.742 --> 00:02:38.964
or maybe a couple of years ago,

00:02:38.988 --> 00:02:41.646
they don't have to be embarrassed
and ask their cousin.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.012
They can just watch those videos;
if they're bored, they can go ahead.

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:47.060
They can watch at their own time and pace.

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:51.885
Probably the least-appreciated aspect
of this

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.480
is the notion that the very first time

00:02:54.504 --> 00:02:58.352
that you're trying to get
your brain around a new concept,

00:02:58.376 --> 00:02:59.976
the very last thing you need

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.742
is another human being saying,
"Do you understand this?"
