00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:31.266
about five years ago,
I was an analyst at a hedge fund,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.758
and I was in Boston,

00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:36.870
and I was tutoring my cousins
in New Orleans, remotely.

00:01:36.894 --> 00:01:39.235
And I started putting
the first YouTube videos up,

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.093
really just as a kind of nice-to-have,

00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:43.242
just kind of a supplement for my cousins,

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:46.274
something that might give them
a refresher or something.

00:01:46.298 --> 00:01:48.938
And as soon as I put those
first YouTube videos up,

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:50.466
something interesting happened.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.834
Actually, a bunch of interesting
things happened.

00:01:52.858 --> 00:01:55.096
The first was the feedback
from my cousins.

00:01:55.707 --> 00:02:00.448
They told me that they preferred
me on YouTube than in person.
