00:00:01.722 --> 00:00:04.135
So I want to talk today
about money and happiness,

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:07.717
which are two things a lot of us
spend a lot of our time thinking about,

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.571
either trying to earn them
or trying to increase them.

00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:12.874
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase,

00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:15.707
we see it in religions
and self-help books:

00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:17.026
money can't buy happiness.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.825
And I want to suggest today
that, in fact, that's wrong.

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.900
(Laughter)

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:24.141
I'm at a business school,
so that's what we do.

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:25.318
So that's wrong,

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:28.565
and in fact, if you think that,
you're just not spending it right.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.237
So instead of spending it
the way you usually spend it,
