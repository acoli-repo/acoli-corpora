I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
playing with blocks.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
As you figured out how to reach out and grasp,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
pick them up and move them around,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you were actually learning how to think and solve problems

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Spatial reasoning is deeply connected

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to how we understand a lot of the world around us.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So, as a computer scientist

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip
