A thin film will creep up the inside wall,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.634
flow over the top and right out the outside.

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:07.591
Now of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment,

00:03:07.591 --> 00:03:11.307
and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree,

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:13.430
it immediately turns back into normal matter.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.996
Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.357
And this is the great pleasure of science:

00:03:19.357 --> 00:03:23.572
the defeat of our intuition through experimentation.

00:03:23.572 --> 00:03:25.261
But the experiment is not the end of the story,

00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:28.787
because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people.

00:03:28.787 --> 00:03:31.163
I have a Ph.D in molecular biology.
