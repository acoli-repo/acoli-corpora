00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:30.988
we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems.

00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:33.848
Imagine our politicians using dance

00:08:33.848 --> 00:08:37.626
to explain why we must invade a foreign country

00:08:37.626 --> 00:08:40.498
or bail out an investment bank.

00:08:40.498 --> 00:08:42.460
It's sure to help.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.212
Of course someday, in the deep future,

00:08:46.212 --> 00:08:48.593
a technology of persuasion

00:08:48.593 --> 00:08:52.022
even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented,

00:08:52.022 --> 00:08:55.566
rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric.

00:08:55.566 --> 00:08:58.142
However, I trust that by that day,

00:08:58.142 --> 00:09:01.457
we shall have passed this present financial calamity.
