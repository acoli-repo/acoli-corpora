00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.334
and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:34.786
For example, if you shine light through a superfluid,

00:02:34.786 --> 00:02:37.811
it is able to slow photons down

00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:40.970
to 60 kilometers per hour.

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:50.638
Another spooky property is that it flows

00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:53.274
with absolutely no viscosity or friction,

00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:55.538
so if you were to take the lid off that bottle,

00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:57.633
it won't stay inside.

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:00.410
A thin film will creep up the inside wall,
