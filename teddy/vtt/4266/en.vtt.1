As you're all aware, we face difficult economic times.

00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:34.325
I come to you with a modest proposal

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.857
for easing the financial burden.

00:00:36.857 --> 00:00:38.390
This idea came to me while talking to

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.362
a physicist friend of mine at MIT.

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:44.051
He was struggling to explain something to me:

00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:48.627
a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter.

00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:50.534
Now he confused me from the very start,

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:52.888
because light doesn't cool things down.

00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:56.337
It makes it hotter. It's happening right now.

00:00:56.337 --> 00:00:58.880
The reason that you can see me standing here is because

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.652
this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons,
