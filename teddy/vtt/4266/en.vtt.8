00:03:58.474 --> 00:04:01.606
that entire experiment with a dance.

00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:05.974
Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.

00:04:05.974 --> 00:04:07.863
Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.

00:04:07.863 --> 00:04:11.365
I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.

00:04:11.365 --> 00:04:13.980
Instead of explaining their research with words,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.880
scientists have to explain it with dance.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.249
Now surprisingly, it seems to work.

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.521
Dance really can make science easier to understand.

00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:24.317
But don't take my word for it.

00:04:24.317 --> 00:04:27.204
Go on the Internet and search for "Dance Your Ph.D."

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:30.462
There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.
