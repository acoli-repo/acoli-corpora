00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.652
this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons,

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:06.187
and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light.

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:07.703
All of them are different colors,

00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:09.643
they're rippling with different frequencies,

00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:12.518
and they're bouncing off every surface, including me,

00:01:12.518 --> 00:01:14.928
and some of those are flying directly into your eyes,

00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:18.128
and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.

00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:19.783
Now a laser is different.

00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:23.786
It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized,

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:26.493
and if you focus them into a beam,

00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:28.888
what you have is an incredibly useful tool.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.024
The control of a laser is so precise
