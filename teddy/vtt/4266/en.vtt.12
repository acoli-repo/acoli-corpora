(Laughter) (Applause)

00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:08.346
Now it does depend on how you measure it, of course,

00:06:08.346 --> 00:06:13.115
but one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day.

00:06:13.115 --> 00:06:15.296
Now that assumes half-hour presentations

00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:17.353
for an average audience of four people

00:06:17.353 --> 00:06:19.672
with salaries of 35,000 dollars,

00:06:19.672 --> 00:06:21.632
and it conservatively assumes that

00:06:21.632 --> 00:06:25.564
about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time,

00:06:25.564 --> 00:06:28.143
and given that there are some apparently

00:06:28.143 --> 00:06:31.415
30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day,
