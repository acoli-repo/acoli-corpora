but before he does that, he works with dancers

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:34.410
to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.503
It's basically efficient brainstorming,

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:39.758
and when I visited David to learn about his research,

00:05:39.758 --> 00:05:43.102
he used dancers to explain it to me

00:05:43.102 --> 00:05:47.644
rather than the usual method: PowerPoint.

00:05:47.644 --> 00:05:49.997
And this brings me to my modest proposal.

00:05:49.997 --> 00:05:52.866
I think that bad PowerPoint presentations

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:55.538
are a serious threat to the global economy.

00:05:55.538 --> 00:06:03.467
