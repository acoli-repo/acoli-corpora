The control of a laser is so precise

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:33.698
that you can perform surgery inside of an eye,

00:01:33.698 --> 00:01:36.343
you can use it to store massive amounts of data,

00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:38.673
and you can use it for this beautiful experiment

00:01:38.673 --> 00:01:41.146
that my friend was struggling to explain.

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:44.401
First you trap atoms in a special bottle.

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:47.361
It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:49.547
from the noise of the environment.

00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:52.030
And the atoms themselves are quite violent,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.074
but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency,

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:58.702
an atom will briefly absorb those photons

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.585
and tend to slow down.
