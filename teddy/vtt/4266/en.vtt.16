00:07:55.188 --> 00:08:00.095
All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.

00:08:00.095 --> 00:08:03.336
I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts,

00:08:03.336 --> 00:08:07.118
which I hope will not be liable to the least objection.

00:08:07.118 --> 00:08:09.011
Once we eliminate public funding for the artists,

00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:10.598
let's put them back to work

00:08:10.598 --> 00:08:13.619
by using them instead of PowerPoint.

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:17.102
As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers.

00:08:17.102 --> 00:08:19.255
After all, they are the most perishable of their kind,

00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:21.414
prone to injury and very slow to heal

00:08:21.414 --> 00:08:24.231
due to our health care system.

00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.374
Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds,

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:30.988
we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems.
