00:04:57.011 --> 00:05:00.982
So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions.

00:05:00.982 --> 00:05:04.920
But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.349
is really more like chaos inside,

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.752
because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers,

00:05:11.752 --> 00:05:14.597
and those fibers are constantly falling apart.

00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:17.166
But just as quickly as they explode,

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:19.583
more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer,

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:21.766
so it's constantly changing

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:24.764
just to remain exactly the same.

00:05:24.764 --> 00:05:27.934
Now, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab,

00:05:27.934 --> 00:05:30.709
but before he does that, he works with dancers
