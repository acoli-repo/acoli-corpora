00:03:28.787 --> 00:03:31.163
I have a Ph.D in molecular biology.

00:03:31.163 --> 00:03:34.696
I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about.

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:37.646
So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment,

00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:40.592
it seemed like the more he said,

00:03:40.592 --> 00:03:43.565
the less I understood.

00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:45.936
Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture

00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:50.015
of a complex idea, to really capture its essence,

00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:53.598
the fewer words you use, the better.

00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:56.917
In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:58.474
I remember thinking, my friend could have explained

00:03:58.474 --> 00:04:01.606
that entire experiment with a dance.
