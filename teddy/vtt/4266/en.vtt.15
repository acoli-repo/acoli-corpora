00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:32.211
slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt

00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:35.572
by about one one-thousandth of a percent.

00:07:35.572 --> 00:07:37.312
One certainly can't argue with those numbers.

00:07:37.312 --> 00:07:42.594
However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts,

00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:45.266
there will be some drawbacks.

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:49.662
The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed.

00:07:49.662 --> 00:07:52.069
Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution,

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:55.188
and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods.

00:07:55.188 --> 00:08:00.095
All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.
