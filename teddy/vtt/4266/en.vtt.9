There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.

00:04:30.462 --> 00:04:32.545
The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest

00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:37.834
is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research.

00:04:37.834 --> 00:04:39.714
For example, at the University of Minnesota,

00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:42.219
there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde,

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.377
and he works with dancers to study how cells move.

00:04:45.377 --> 00:04:47.786
They do it by changing their shape.

00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:50.605
When a chemical signal washes up on one side,

00:04:50.605 --> 00:04:53.730
it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side,

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.011
because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment.

00:04:57.011 --> 00:05:00.982
So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions.
