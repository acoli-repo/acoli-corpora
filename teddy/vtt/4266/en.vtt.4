00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.585
and tend to slow down.

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:03.897
Little by little it gets colder

00:02:03.897 --> 00:02:08.410
until eventually it approaches absolute zero.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.586
Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough,

00:02:11.586 --> 00:02:15.363
something truly bizarre happens.

00:02:15.363 --> 00:02:18.185
It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.

00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:22.125
It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:24.412
The atoms lose their individual identity,

00:02:24.412 --> 00:02:27.239
and the rules from the quantum world take over,

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.334
and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.
