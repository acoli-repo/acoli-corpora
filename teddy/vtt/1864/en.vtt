Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.636
in a 1968 speech where he reflects
upon the Civil Rights Movement,

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:09.330
states, "In the end,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.413
we will remember not the words of our enemies

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:15.280
but the silence of our friends."

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.800
As a teacher, I've internalized this message.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.780
Every day, all around us,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.456
we see the consequences of silence

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:23.893
manifest themselves in the form of discrimination,

00:00:23.893 --> 00:00:27.701
violence, genocide and war.

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:29.897
In the classroom, I challenge my students

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:32.328
to explore the silences in their own lives
