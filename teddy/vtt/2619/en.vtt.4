00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:01.293
so they could tell just at a glance
which was which.

00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:04.949
So they took their two
anti-malarial, red-eyed mosquitos

00:02:04.973 --> 00:02:07.632
and put them in a box
with 30 ordinary white-eyed ones,

00:02:07.656 --> 00:02:08.830
and let them breed.

00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:13.240
In two generations, those had produced
3,800 grandchildren.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:16.010
That is not the surprising part.

00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:18.638
This is the surprising part:

00:02:18.662 --> 00:02:21.569
given that you started
with just two red-eyed mosquitos

00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:22.927
and 30 white-eyed ones,

00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:25.712
you expect mostly white-eyed descendants.

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:29.538
Instead, when James opened the box,

00:02:29.562 --> 00:02:32.903
all 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes.
