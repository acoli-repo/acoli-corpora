WEBVTT

00:10:29.017 --> 00:10:30.183
Should we?

00:10:30.552 --> 00:10:31.917
Are we gods now?

00:10:33.972 --> 00:10:35.305
I'm not sure I'd say that.

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:37.321
But I would say this:

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:40.187
first, some very smart people

00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:43.067
are even now debating
how to regulate gene drives.

00:10:43.598 --> 00:10:46.162
At the same time,
some other very smart people

00:10:46.186 --> 00:10:48.297
are working hard to create safeguards,

00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:51.873
like gene drives that self-regulate
or peter out after a few generations.

00:10:52.644 --> 00:10:53.844
That's great.

00:10:54.313 --> 00:10:56.860
But this technology still requires
a conversation.

00:10:58.059 --> 00:10:59.789
And given the nature of gene drives,

00:10:59.813 --> 00:11:01.503
that conversation has to be global.
