00:06:29.715 --> 00:06:31.838
like get Asian carp
out of the Great Lakes.

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.458
All you have to do is release a gene drive

00:06:34.482 --> 00:06:36.799
that makes the fish produce
only male offspring.

00:06:37.386 --> 00:06:41.584
In a few generations,
there'll be no females left, no more carp.

00:06:41.608 --> 00:06:44.687
In theory, this means we could restore
hundreds of native species

00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:46.378
that have been pushed to the brink.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.697
OK, that's the good news,

00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:52.013
this is the bad news.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.098
Gene drives are so effective

00:06:55.122 --> 00:06:58.947
that even an accidental release
could change an entire species,

00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:00.161
and often very quickly.
