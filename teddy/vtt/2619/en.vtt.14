00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:00.161
and often very quickly.

00:07:01.178 --> 00:07:03.304
Anthony James took good precautions.

00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:05.494
He bred his mosquitos
in a bio-containment lab

00:07:05.518 --> 00:07:08.106
and he also used a species
that's not native to the US

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.685
so that even if some did escape,

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:12.724
they'd just die off, there'd be nothing
for them to mate with.

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:16.771
But it's also true that if a dozen
Asian carp with the all-male gene drive

00:07:16.795 --> 00:07:20.724
accidentally got carried
from the Great Lakes back to Asia,

00:07:20.748 --> 00:07:24.177
they could potentially wipe out
the native Asian carp population.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.842
And that's not so unlikely,
given how connected our world is.

00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:31.437
In fact, it's why we have
an invasive species problem.
