You'd end up with a perpetual
motion machine for gene editing.

00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:36.192
And that's exactly what happened.

00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:39.915
This CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt created

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:43.582
not only guarantees
that a trait will get passed on,

00:04:43.606 --> 00:04:46.044
but if it's used in the germline cells,

00:04:46.068 --> 00:04:48.644
it will automatically copy and paste
your new gene

00:04:48.668 --> 00:04:51.314
into both chromosomes
of every single individual.

00:04:51.743 --> 00:04:54.140
It's like a global search and replace,

00:04:54.164 --> 00:04:57.385
or in science terms, it makes
a heterozygous trait homozygous.

00:04:59.045 --> 00:05:01.656
So, what does this mean?
