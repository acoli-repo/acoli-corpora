00:09:56.478 --> 00:10:00.005
that will require years of meticulous
lab work and still might not pan out,

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:01.376
or just blowing stuff up?

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.055
You'll probably choose the later.

00:10:03.498 --> 00:10:05.918
This is especially true
because at least in theory,

00:10:05.942 --> 00:10:09.076
it should be pretty easy
to build what's called a reversal drive.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.798
That's one that basically overwrites
the change made by the first gene drive.

00:10:12.822 --> 00:10:15.116
So if you don't like
the effects of a change,

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.973
you can just release a second drive
that will cancel it out,

00:10:17.997 --> 00:10:19.147
at least in theory.

00:10:21.374 --> 00:10:23.096
OK, so where does this leave us?

00:10:24.604 --> 00:10:28.199
We now have the ability
to change entire species at will.

00:10:29.017 --> 00:10:30.183
Should we?
