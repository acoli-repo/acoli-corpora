00:00:00.844 --> 00:00:03.306
So this is a talk about gene drives,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.883
but I'm going to start
by telling you a brief story.

00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:09.844
20 years ago, a biologist
named Anthony James

00:00:09.868 --> 00:00:12.187
got obsessed with the idea
of making mosquitos

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.790
that didn't transmit malaria.

00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:19.739
It was a great idea,
and pretty much a complete failure.

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:23.256
For one thing, it turned out
to be really hard

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.287
to make a malaria-resistant mosquito.

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:29.913
James managed it, finally,
just a few years ago,

00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:32.008
by adding some genes
that make it impossible
