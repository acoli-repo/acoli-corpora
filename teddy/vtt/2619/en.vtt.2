00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:03.111
literally 10 times the number
of native mosquitos to work.

00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:05.222
So in a village with 10,000 mosquitos,

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:07.325
you release an extra 100,000.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.379
As you might guess,

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:12.157
this was not a very popular strategy
with the villagers.

00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:13.331
(Laughter)

00:01:14.963 --> 00:01:18.667
Then, last January,
Anthony James got an email

00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:20.642
from a biologist named Ethan Bier.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.259
Bier said that he
and his grad student Valentino Gantz

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:27.227
had stumbled on a tool
that could not only guarantee

00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:29.925
that a particular genetic trait
would be inherited,

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:32.028
but that it would spread
incredibly quickly.
