00:02:29.562 --> 00:02:32.903
all 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes.

00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:35.355
When I asked Ethan Bier about this moment,

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.894
he became so excited that he was literally
shouting into the phone.

00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:42.049
That's because getting
only red-eyed mosquitos

00:02:42.073 --> 00:02:45.021
violates a rule that is the absolute
cornerstone of biology,

00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:46.287
Mendelian genetics.

00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:48.081
I'll keep this quick,

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:50.869
but Mendelian genetics
says when a male and a female mate,

00:02:50.893 --> 00:02:53.535
their baby inherits half
of its DNA from each parent.

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:57.154
So if our original mosquito was aa
and our new mosquito is aB,

00:02:57.178 --> 00:02:58.980
where B is the anti-malarial gene,

00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.391
the babies should come out
in four permutations:
