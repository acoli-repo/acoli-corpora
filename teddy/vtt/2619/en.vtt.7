It does this by harnessing a mechanism
that already existed in bacteria.

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:35.912
Basically, there's a protein
that acts like a scissors

00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:37.170
and cuts the DNA,

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:39.677
and there's an RNA molecule
that directs the scissors

00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:41.419
to any point on the genome you want.

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:44.133
The result is basically
a word processor for genes.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.783
You can take an entire gene
out, put one in,

00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:49.252
or even edit just a single
letter within a gene.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.599
And you can do it in nearly any species.

00:03:53.328 --> 00:03:57.042
OK, remember how I said that gene drives
originally had two problems?

00:03:57.835 --> 00:04:00.955
The first was that it was hard
to engineer a mosquito
