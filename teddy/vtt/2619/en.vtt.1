00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:32.008
by adding some genes
that make it impossible

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.746
for the malaria parasite
to survive inside the mosquito.

00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:37.373
But that just created another problem.

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:40.885
Now that you've got
a malaria-resistant mosquito,

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.495
how do you get it to replace
all the malaria-carrying mosquitos?

00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:47.580
There are a couple options,

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:49.627
but plan A was basically to breed up

00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.738
a bunch of the new
genetically-engineered mosquitos

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:54.088
release them into the wild

00:00:54.112 --> 00:00:56.079
and hope that they pass on their genes.

00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:58.787
The problem was that you'd have to release

00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:03.111
literally 10 times the number
of native mosquitos to work.
