00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.391
the babies should come out
in four permutations:

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:03.988
aa, aB, aa, Ba.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:07.173
Instead, with the new gene drive,

00:03:07.197 --> 00:03:08.709
they all came out aB.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.452
Biologically, that shouldn't
even be possible.

00:03:12.476 --> 00:03:13.780
So what happened?

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.153
The first thing that happened

00:03:16.177 --> 00:03:19.447
was the arrival of a gene-editing tool
known as CRISPR in 2012.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.811
Many of you have probably
heard about CRISPR,

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:26.136
so I'll just say briefly that CRISPR
is a tool that allows researchers

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.739
to edit genes very precisely,
easily and quickly.

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:33.262
It does this by harnessing a mechanism
that already existed in bacteria.
