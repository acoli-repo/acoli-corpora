A talented high schooler
with some equipment can do it.

00:08:32.526 --> 00:08:34.835
Now, I'm guessing
that this sounds terrifying.

00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:37.557
(Laughter)

00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:40.471
Interestingly though,
nearly every scientist I talk to

00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:44.376
seemed to think that gene drives were not
actually that frightening or dangerous.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.028
Partly because they believe
that scientists will be

00:08:47.052 --> 00:08:49.256
very cautious and responsible
about using them.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.294
(Laughter)

00:08:50.318 --> 00:08:51.548
So far, that's been true.

00:08:52.302 --> 00:08:54.998
But gene drives also have
some actual limitations.

00:08:55.022 --> 00:08:58.331
So for one thing, they work
only in sexually reproducing species.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:02.132
So thank goodness, they can't be used
to engineer viruses or bacteria.
