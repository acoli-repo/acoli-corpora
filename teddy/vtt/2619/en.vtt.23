Humans have a tendency to assume
that the safest option

00:11:32.112 --> 00:11:33.904
is to preserve the status quo.

00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:36.477

00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:41.112
Gene drives have risks,
and those need to be discussed,

00:11:48.565 --> 00:11:50.135
including amphibians and birds.

00:11:56.834 --> 00:11:58.378
remember that.

00:11:58.402 --> 00:12:00.422
It can be frightening to act,
