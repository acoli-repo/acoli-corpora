00:03:57.835 --> 00:04:00.955
The first was that it was hard
to engineer a mosquito

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.366
to be malaria-resistant.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.517
That's basically gone now,
thanks to CRISPR.

00:04:05.117 --> 00:04:06.879
But the other problem was logistical.

00:04:07.307 --> 00:04:09.109
How do you get your trait to spread?

00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:11.672
This is where it gets clever.

00:04:12.943 --> 00:04:16.545
A couple years ago, a biologist
at Harvard named Kevin Esvelt

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:17.919
wondered what would happen

00:04:17.943 --> 00:04:21.570
if you made it so that
CRISPR inserted not only your new gene

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:24.435
but also the machinery
that does the cutting and pasting.

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:29.073
In other words, what if CRISPR
also copied and pasted itself.
