00:05:59.115 --> 00:06:01.315
in just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes,

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:03.091
the species that transmits malaria,

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:07.607
researchers estimate that it would spread
to the entire population in a year.

00:06:08.178 --> 00:06:11.047
So in a year, you could virtually
eliminate malaria.

00:06:11.455 --> 00:06:15.327
In practice, we're still a few years out
from being able to do that,

00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:18.069
but still, a 1,000 children
a day die of malaria.

00:06:18.093 --> 00:06:20.283
In a year, that number
could be almost zero.

00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:23.862
The same goes for dengue fever,
chikungunya, yellow fever.

00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:26.616
And it gets better.

00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:29.691
Say you want to get rid
of an invasive species,

00:06:29.715 --> 00:06:31.838
like get Asian carp
out of the Great Lakes.
