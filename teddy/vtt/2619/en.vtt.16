That's not so bad if your drive
just promotes a trait, like eye color.

00:08:03.437 --> 00:08:05.684
In fact, there's a decent
chance that we'll see

00:08:05.708 --> 00:08:08.279
a wave of very weird fruit flies
in the near future.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.653
But it could be a disaster

00:08:10.677 --> 00:08:13.581
if your drive is deigned
to eliminate the species entirely.

00:08:14.351 --> 00:08:17.879
The last worrisome thing
is that the technology to do this,

00:08:17.903 --> 00:08:21.594
to genetically engineer an organism
and include a gene drive,

00:08:21.618 --> 00:08:24.952
is something that basically any lab
in the world can do.

00:08:24.976 --> 00:08:26.316
An undergraduate can do it.

00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:30.491
A talented high schooler
with some equipment can do it.
