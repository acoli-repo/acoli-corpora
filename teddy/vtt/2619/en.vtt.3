00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:32.028
but that it would spread
incredibly quickly.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:35.400
If they were right,
it would basically solve the problem

00:01:35.424 --> 00:01:37.805
that he and James had been
working on for 20 years.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.108
As a test, they engineered two mosquitos
to carry the anti-malaria gene

00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:45.291
and also this new tool, a gene drive,

00:01:45.315 --> 00:01:46.806
which I'll explain in a minute.

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.839
Finally, they set it up
so that any mosquitos

00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:51.801
that had inherited the anti-malaria gene

00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:55.824
wouldn't have the usual white eyes,
but would instead have red eyes.

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:58.732
That was pretty much just for convenience

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:01.293
so they could tell just at a glance
which was which.
