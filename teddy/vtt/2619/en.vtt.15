00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:31.437
In fact, it's why we have
an invasive species problem.

00:07:31.912 --> 00:07:33.080
And that's fish.

00:07:33.428 --> 00:07:36.016
Things like mosquitos and fruit flies,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.000
there's literally no way to contain them.

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.135
They cross borders
and oceans all the time.

00:07:41.754 --> 00:07:43.936
OK, the other piece of bad news

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.278
is that a gene drive
might not stay confined

00:07:46.302 --> 00:07:48.115
to what we call the target species.

00:07:48.556 --> 00:07:50.055
That's because of gene flow,

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:52.676
which is a fancy way of saying
that neighboring species

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.948
sometimes interbreed.

00:07:53.972 --> 00:07:57.123
If that happens, it's possible
a gene drive could cross over,

00:07:57.147 --> 00:07:59.674
like Asian carp could infect
some other kind of carp.

00:07:59.698 --> 00:08:03.413
That's not so bad if your drive
just promotes a trait, like eye color.
