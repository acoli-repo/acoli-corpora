00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:31.059
the sure sign of intelligent
life out there

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:33.476
is that they haven't bothered
trying to contact us.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.143
It was actually my newborn son
I was trying to explain things to.

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:38.809
We'd never been parents before,

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:40.101
my wife and I,

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:43.726
and so treated him like most guests
when he arrived home for the first time,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.018
by giving him the tour.

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:46.643
This is where you live, son.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:48.351
This room is where we make food at.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.684
This is the room we keep
our collection of chairs, and so on.

00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:52.976
It's refreshing,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.684
explaining how our planet works
to a zero-year-old.

00:01:55.708 --> 00:01:56.976
But after the laughs,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.184
and once the magnitude that new humans
know absolutely nothing
