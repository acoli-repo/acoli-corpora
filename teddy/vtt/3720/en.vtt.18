00:08:59.417 --> 00:09:00.684
that we are alive at all.

00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:02.268
That we are still alive.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:05.226
A million and a half years
after finding a box of matches,

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.184
we haven't totally burned the house down.

00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:09.476
Yet.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.726
The chances of being here
are infinitesimal.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.018
Yet here we are.

00:09:13.042 --> 00:09:14.351
Perils and all.

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:16.768
There have never been
more people living on Earth.

00:09:16.792 --> 00:09:18.226
Using more stuff.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.768
And it's become obvious
that many of the old systems

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:22.726
we invented for ourselves

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.018
are obsolete.

00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:25.976
And we have to build new ones.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.434
If it wasn't germs,

00:09:27.458 --> 00:09:30.559
our collective fire
might suffocate us before long.
