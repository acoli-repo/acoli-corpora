00:09:27.458 --> 00:09:30.559
our collective fire
might suffocate us before long.

00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:33.643
As we watch the wheels
of industry grind to a halt,

00:09:33.667 --> 00:09:35.726
the machinery of progress become silent,

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.143
we have the wildest of opportunities

00:09:38.167 --> 00:09:40.059
to hit the reset button.

00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:41.934
To take a different path.

00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.434
Here we are on Earth.

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:47.059
And life on Earth is a wonderful thing.

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:48.351
It looks big, this Earth,

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:50.226
but there are lots of us on here.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.809
Seven and a half billion at last count,

00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:55.601
with more showing up every day.

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:56.893
Even so,

00:09:56.917 --> 00:09:58.643
there is still enough for everyone,

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:00.000
if we all share a little.
