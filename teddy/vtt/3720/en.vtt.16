00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.893
mostly we look down and in.

00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:03.934
Looking up and by drawing lines
between the lights in the sky,

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.726
we've attempted to make
sense out of chaos.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.268
Looking down, we've drawn lines

00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:11.559

00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:16.184

00:08:18.542 --> 00:08:21.018
They, too, are stories.

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.393
We carry out our everyday
routines and rituals

00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:25.476
according to the stories
we most believe in,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.977
and these days, the story
is changing as we write it.

00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:30.143
There is a lot of fear
in this current story,
