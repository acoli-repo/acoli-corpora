00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:01.684
"People live here."

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:04.184
And off on the Moon, it was written,

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:05.976
"No one lives here."

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.601
Often, the obvious things

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:10.684
aren't all that obvious
until you think about them.

00:05:10.708 --> 00:05:13.184
Seeing anything
from a vast enough distance

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:14.643
changes everything,

00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:16.893
as many astronauts have experienced.

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:19.309
And human eyes
have only ever seen our Earth

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:21.184
from as far as the Moon, really.

00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:22.476
It's quite a ways further

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.934
before we get to the edges
of our own Solar System.

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.351
And even out to other stars,
to the constellations.

00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:31.518
There is actually only one point
in the entire cosmos
