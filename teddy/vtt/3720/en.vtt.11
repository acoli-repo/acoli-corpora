00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:31.518
There is actually only one point
in the entire cosmos

00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:34.393
that is present in all
constellations of stars,

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.684
and that presence is

00:05:36.708 --> 00:05:39.059
here, planet Earth.

00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:41.703
Those pictures we have made up
for the clusters of stars

00:05:41.727 --> 00:05:45.144
only make sense from
this point of view down here.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.684
Their stories only make sense
here on Earth.

00:05:48.708 --> 00:05:51.184
And only something to us.

00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:52.559
To people.

00:05:52.583 --> 00:05:55.268
We are creatures of stories.

00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:56.893
We are the stories we tell,

00:05:56.917 --> 00:05:59.143
we're the stories we're told.

00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:03.018
Consider briefly the story
of human civilization on Earth.
