00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.143
a man who believed he owned everything

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:03.726
and set out to survey what was his.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.101
He easily claims ownership of a flower,

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:08.684
a sheep, a tree and a field.

00:07:08.708 --> 00:07:11.059
The lake and the mountain
prove harder to conquer,

00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:13.101
but they, too, surrender.

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:15.309
It is in trying to own the open sea

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:17.768
where his greed proves his undoing,

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:19.851
when, in a fit of arrogance,

00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:22.851
he climbs overboard
to show that sea who is boss.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.601
But he does not understand,

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.458
slips beneath the waves,
sinks to the bottom.

00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:29.601
The sea was sad for him

00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:31.750
but carried on being the sea.
