00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.809
and I'd need almost 200 feet,

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:03.268
a New York City block,

00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:05.559
to build a large-scale model of the moon,

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:07.809
the Earth and us.

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:11.024
This project managed to take place
on New York City's High Line park

00:04:11.048 --> 00:04:12.268
last winter,

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:15.309
on the 50th anniversary
of Apollo 11's mission around the Moon.

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:16.684
After its installation,

00:04:16.708 --> 00:04:19.226
I was able to put on
a space helmet with my son

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.184
and launch, like Apollo 11 did
half a century ago,

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:24.018
towards the Moon.

00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:25.309
We circled around

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:27.809
and looked back at us.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.309
What I felt was

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:31.809
how lonely it was there in the dark.
