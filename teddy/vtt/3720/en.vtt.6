00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:00.393
but don't be fooled.

00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:01.684
We are all people.

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:04.934
It doesn't skip me that of all
the places in the universe,

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.226
people only live on Earth,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.851
can only live on Earth.

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:10.059
And even then,
only on some of the dry bits.

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:12.934
There's only a very small
part of the surface of our planet

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.934
that is actually habitable to human life,

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.309
and squeezed in here
is where all of us live.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:20.143
It's easy to forget
when you're up close to the dirt,

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:22.518
the rocks, the foliage,
the concrete of our lands,

00:03:22.542 --> 00:03:25.684
just how limited the room
for maneuvering is.

00:03:25.708 --> 00:03:28.143
From a set of eyes close to the ground,

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:30.684
the horizon feels like it goes forever.
