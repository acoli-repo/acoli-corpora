00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:31.809
how lonely it was there in the dark.

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:33.559
And I was just pretending.

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:35.101
The Moon is the only object

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:37.351
even remotely close to us.

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:39.268
And at the scale of this project,

00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:41.309
where our planet was 10 feet in diameter,

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:43.893
Mars, the next planet,
will be the size of a yoga ball

00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:46.434
and a couple of miles away.

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.643
Although borders
are not visible from space,

00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:49.976
on my sculpture,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.572
every single border was drawn in.

00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:54.601
But rather than writing the country names
on the carved-up land,

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:56.476
I wrote over and over again,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.268
"people live here, people live here."

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:01.684
"People live here."
