00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:03.018
Consider briefly the story
of human civilization on Earth.

00:06:03.042 --> 00:06:05.601
It tells of the ingenuity, elegance,

00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:07.934
generous and nurturing nature of a species

00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.768
that is also self-focused, vulnerable

00:06:10.792 --> 00:06:12.601
and defiantly protective.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:15.559
We, the people, shield
the flame of our existence

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.268
from the raw, vast elements
outside our control,

00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:20.268
the great beyond.

00:06:20.292 --> 00:06:23.292
Yet it is always to the flame we look.

00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:26.059
"For all we know,"

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:27.351
when said as a statement,

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:30.143
it means the sum total of all knowledge.
