[Oliver Jeffers]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.833
[An ode to living on Earth]

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.601
Hello.

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:09.601
I'm sure by the time
I get to end of this sentence,

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:11.101
given how I talk,

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:13.976
you'll all have figured out
that I'm from a place called

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.268
planet Earth.

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:17.018
Earth is pretty great.

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:18.875
It's home to us.

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:21.393
And germs.

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:23.726
Those [blip] take a back seat
for the time being,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.726
because believe it or not,
they're not the only thing going on.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.393
This planet is also home
to cars, brussels sprouts;

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:32.018
those weird fish things
that have their own headlights;
