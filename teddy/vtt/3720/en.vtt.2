00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:00.208
floating in a cold and lonely
part of the cosmos.

00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:04.434
Oh, the accent is from Belfast,
by the way, which is ...

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:05.726
here.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.000
Roughly.

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:10.226
You may think you know this planet Earth,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.518
as you're from here.

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:12.809
But chances are,

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:15.500
you probably haven't thought
about the basics in a while.

00:01:15.524 --> 00:01:16.934
I thought I knew it.

00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.393
Thought I was an expert, even.

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:21.351
Until, that is, I had to explain
the entire place,

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:22.851
and how it's supposed to work,

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.518
to someone who had never been here before.

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:26.809
Not what you might think,

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:29.018
although my dad always did say

00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:31.059
the sure sign of intelligent
life out there
