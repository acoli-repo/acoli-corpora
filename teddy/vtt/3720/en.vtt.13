00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:30.143
it means the sum total of all knowledge.

00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:31.601
But when said another way,

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:33.559
"for all we know,"

00:06:33.583 --> 00:06:36.393
it means that we do not know at all.

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:40.518
This is the beautiful,
fragile drama of civilization.

00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:42.851
We are the actors and spectators
of a cosmic play

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:44.518

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:46.684
but means nothing anywhere else.

00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:48.976
Possibly not even that much

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.684
If we truly thought about
our relationship with our boat,

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:52.976
with our Earth,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.875
it might be more of a story
of ignorance and greed.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.226
As is the case with Fausto,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.143
a man who believed he owned everything
