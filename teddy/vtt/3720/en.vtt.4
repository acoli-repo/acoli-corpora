00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.184
and once the magnitude that new humans
know absolutely nothing

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:03.226
settles on you and how little
you know either,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.393
explaining the whole planet
becomes quite intimidating.

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:07.809
But I tried anyway.

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:10.893
As I walked around those first few weeks,

00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:13.226
narrating the world as I saw it,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.393
I began to take notes
of the ridiculous things I was saying.

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:18.726
The notes slowly morphed into a letter

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.059
intended for my son
once he learned to read.

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:22.559
And that letter became a book

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:25.268
about the basic principles
of what it is to be a human

00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:28.226
living on Earth in the 21st century.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.726
Some things are really obvious.
