00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:30.684
the horizon feels like it goes forever.

00:03:30.708 --> 00:03:32.601
After all, it's not an every-day ritual

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:35.018
to consider where we are
on the ball of our planet

00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:37.018
and where that ball is in space.

00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:39.976
I didn't want to tell my son
the same story of countries

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.893
that we were told where I was growing up
in Northern Ireland.

00:03:42.917 --> 00:03:44.768
That we were from just a small parish,

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:47.143
which ignores life
outside its immediate concerns.

00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:50.809
I wanted to try to feel
what it was like to see our planet

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:53.184
as one system, as a single object,

00:03:53.208 --> 00:03:54.643
hanging in space.

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:55.934
To do this,

00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.434
I would need to switch
from flat drawings for books

00:03:58.458 --> 00:03:59.976
to 3D sculpture for the street,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.809
and I'd need almost 200 feet,
