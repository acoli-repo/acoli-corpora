00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:32.018
those weird fish things
that have their own headlights;

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:33.518
art, fire,

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:34.809
fire extinguishers,

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:36.934
laws, pigeons, bottles of beer,

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.226
lemons and light bulbs;

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.893
Pinot noir and paracetamol;

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:42.476
ghosts, mosquitoes, flamingos, flowers,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.059
the ukulele, elevators and cats,

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:45.559
cat videos, the internet;

00:00:45.583 --> 00:00:47.351
iron beams, buildings and batteries,

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.851
all ingenuity and bright ideas,
all known life ...

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:51.518
and a whole bunch of other stuff.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:54.059
Pretty much everything we know
and ever heard of.

00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:56.059
It's my favorite place, actually.

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:57.643
This small orb,

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:00.208
floating in a cold and lonely
part of the cosmos.
