00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:30.143
There is a lot of fear
in this current story,

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:31.434
and until recently,

00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:33.643
the stories that seemed
to have the most power

00:08:33.667 --> 00:08:34.934
are those of bitterness,

00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.101
of how it had all gone wrong for us
individually and collectively.

00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:41.434
It has been inspiring to watch
how the best comes from the worst.

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:44.226
How people are waking up
in this time of global reckoning

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.726
to the realization that our
connections with each other

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.893
are some of the most
important things we have.

00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:51.184
But stepping back.

00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:52.643
For all we've had to lament,

00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:55.684
we spend very little time relishing
the single biggest thing

00:08:55.708 --> 00:08:57.643
that has ever gone right for us.

00:08:57.667 --> 00:08:59.393
That we are here in the first place,

00:08:59.417 --> 00:09:00.684
that we are alive at all.
