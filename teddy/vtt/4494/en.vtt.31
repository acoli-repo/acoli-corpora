00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.760
He wasn't the only man
in America who suffered

00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:32.562
in a pre-civil rights America.

00:15:32.586 --> 00:15:34.976
In fact, some of his ideas were bad.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.023
But he had a gift.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.231
He didn't go around telling people
what needed to change in America.

00:15:40.255 --> 00:15:42.572
He went around
and told people what he believed.

00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:45.976
"I believe, I believe, I believe,"
he told people.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.531
And people who believed what he believed

00:15:48.555 --> 00:15:51.976
took his cause, and they made it
their own, and they told people.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.048
And some of those people
created structures

00:15:54.072 --> 00:15:56.567
to get the word out to even more people.

00:15:56.591 --> 00:15:59.976
And lo and behold,
250,000 people showed up

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.246
on the right day at the right time
to hear him speak.
