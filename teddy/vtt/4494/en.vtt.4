00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.976
This little idea explains

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.976
why some organizations and some leaders
are able to inspire where others aren't.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.976
Let me define the terms really quickly.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.976
Every single person, every single
organization on the planet

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.722
knows what they do, 100 percent.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.976
Some know how they do it,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.684
whether you call it
your differentiated value proposition

00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:20.976
or your proprietary process or your USP.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.747
But very, very few people or organizations
know why they do what they do.

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.976
And by "why" I don't mean
"to make a profit."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.976
That's a result. It's always a result.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.976
By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?
