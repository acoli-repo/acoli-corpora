00:08:27.793 --> 00:08:30.770
under-capitalized, the wrong people,
bad market conditions.

00:08:30.794 --> 00:08:33.605
It's always the same three things,
so let's explore that.

00:08:34.422 --> 00:08:35.976
Samuel Pierpont Langley

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.976
was given 50,000 dollars
by the War Department

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.976
to figure out this flying machine.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.571
Money was no problem.

00:08:42.595 --> 00:08:44.976
He held a seat at Harvard

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and worked at the Smithsonian
and was extremely well-connected;

00:08:48.024 --> 00:08:49.976
he knew all the big minds of the day.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.976
He hired the best minds money could find

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.976
and the market conditions were fantastic.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.976
The New York Times
followed him around everywhere,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.976
and everyone was rooting for Langley.
