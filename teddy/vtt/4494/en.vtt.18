00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.976
and everyone was rooting for Langley.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.988
Then how come we've never heard
of Samuel Pierpont Langley?

00:09:04.485 --> 00:09:06.626
A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio,

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:08.976
Orville and Wilbur Wright,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.976
they had none of what we consider
to be the recipe for success.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.976
They had no money;

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.239
they paid for their dream
with the proceeds from their bicycle shop.

00:09:18.263 --> 00:09:20.549
Not a single person
on the Wright brothers' team

00:09:20.573 --> 00:09:21.976
had a college education,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.976
not even Orville or Wilbur.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.976
And The New York Times
followed them around nowhere.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.976
The difference was,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.976
Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause,
by a purpose, by a belief.
