00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.976
you cannot have it
until you achieve this tipping point

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.976
between 15 and 18 percent
market penetration,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.976
and then the system tips.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.245
I love asking businesses,
"What's your conversion on new business?"

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:45.902
They love to tell you,
"It's about 10 percent," proudly.

00:11:45.926 --> 00:11:48.069
Well, you can trip
over 10% of the customers.

00:11:48.093 --> 00:11:50.039
We all have about 10% who just "get it."

00:11:50.063 --> 00:11:51.776
That's how we describe them, right?

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.277
That's like that gut feeling,
"Oh, they just get it."

00:11:54.301 --> 00:11:56.737
The problem is: How do you
find the ones that get it

00:11:56.761 --> 00:11:59.405
before doing business
versus the ones who don't get it?

00:11:59.429 --> 00:12:02.976
So it's this here, this little gap
that you have to close,
