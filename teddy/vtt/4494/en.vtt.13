00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.143
yes, people can understand vast
amounts of complicated information

00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:32.976
like features and benefits
and facts and figures.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.976
It just doesn't drive behavior.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.096
When we can communicate
from the inside out,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.359
we're talking directly
to the part of the brain

00:06:39.383 --> 00:06:40.976
that controls behavior,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.976
and then we allow people to rationalize it

all the facts and figures,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.722
and they say, "I know
what all the facts and details say,

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.276
but it just doesn't feel right."

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.840
Why would we use that verb,
it doesn't "feel" right?

00:06:57.864 --> 00:07:00.639
Because the part of the brain
that controls decision-making
