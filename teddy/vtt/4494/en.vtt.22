00:10:57.515 --> 00:11:01.976
The first 2.5% of our population
are our innovators.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.213
The next 13.5% of our population
are our early adopters.

00:11:07.252 --> 00:11:09.096
The next 34% are your early majority,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.453
your late majority and your laggards.

00:11:12.445 --> 00:11:14.976
The only reason these people
buy touch-tone phones

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.239
is because you can't buy
rotary phones anymore.

00:11:17.263 --> 00:11:18.976
(Laughter)

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.976
We all sit at various places
at various times on this scale,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.976
but what the law of diffusion
of innovation tells us

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.976
is that if you want mass-market success
or mass-market acceptance of an idea,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.976
you cannot have it
until you achieve this tipping point
