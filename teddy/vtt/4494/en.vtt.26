in the first six hours,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.976
stood in line for six hours,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.381
was because of what they believed
about the world,

00:13:10.405 --> 00:13:12.405
and how they wanted everybody to see them:

00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:13.461
they were first.

00:13:13.485 --> 00:13:15.976

So let me give you a famous example,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.563
a famous failure and a famous success
of the law of diffusion of innovation.

As we said before, the recipe for success

00:13:28.261 --> 00:13:31.653
is money and the right people
and the right market conditions.
