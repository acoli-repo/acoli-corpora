all think, act and communicate
from the inside out.

00:03:02.547 --> 00:03:03.976
Let me give you an example.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.388
I use Apple because they're easy
to understand and everybody gets it.

00:03:07.412 --> 00:03:09.983

They're beautifully designed,

That's how most marketing
and sales are done,

00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:29.607
that's how we communicate interpersonally.

00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:31.402
We say what we do,
