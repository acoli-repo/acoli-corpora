00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.976
is perfectly comfortable buying
a computer from Apple.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.976
But we're also perfectly comfortable

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.976
buying an MP3 player from Apple,
or a phone from Apple,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.977
or a DVR from Apple.

00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:41.528
As I said before,
Apple's just a computer company.

00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:44.976
Nothing distinguishes them structurally
from any of their competitors.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.448
Their competitors are equally qualified
to make all of these products.

00:04:48.472 --> 00:04:49.976
In fact, they tried.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.976
A few years ago, Gateway
came out with flat-screen TVs.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.429
They're eminently qualified
to make flat-screen TVs.

00:04:55.453 --> 00:04:57.976
They've been making
flat-screen monitors for years.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.573
Nobody bought one.
