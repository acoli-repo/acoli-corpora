00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.976
By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.439
What's your cause? What's your belief?

00:02:34.463 --> 00:02:37.976
Why does your organization exist?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.368
Why do you get out of bed in the morning?

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:42.976
And why should anyone care?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.905
As a result, the way we think, we act,

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.745
the way we communicate
is from the outside in, it's obvious.

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.460
We go from the clearest thing
to the fuzziest thing.

00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:53.976
But the inspired leaders
and the inspired organizations --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.595
regardless of their size,
regardless of their industry --

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.745
all think, act and communicate
from the inside out.
