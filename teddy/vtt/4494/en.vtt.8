WEBVTT

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.976
We believe in thinking differently.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.431
The way we challenge the status quo

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:05.976
is by making our products
beautifully designed,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.976
simple to use and user friendly.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.639
We just happen to make great computers.

00:04:10.663 --> 00:04:11.717
Want to buy one?"

00:04:12.892 --> 00:04:14.195
Totally different, right?

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.176
You're ready to buy a computer from me.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.398
I just reversed
the order of the information.

00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:22.294
What it proves to us is
that people don't buy what you do;

00:04:22.318 --> 00:04:24.723
people buy why you do it.

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:28.976
This explains why
every single person in this room

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.976
is perfectly comfortable buying
a computer from Apple.
