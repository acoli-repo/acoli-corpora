00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:31.402
We say what we do,

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:33.195
we say how we're different or better

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.076
and we expect some sort of a behavior,

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.076
a purchase, a vote, something like that.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.376
Here's our new law firm:

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.822
We have the best lawyers
with the biggest clients,

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:42.468
we always perform for our clients.

00:03:42.492 --> 00:03:43.976
Here's our new car:

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.632
It gets great gas mileage,
it has leather seats.

00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:47.845
Buy our car.

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:48.976
But it's uninspiring.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.647
Here's how Apple actually communicates.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.976
"Everything we do,
we believe in challenging the status quo.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.976
We believe in thinking differently.
