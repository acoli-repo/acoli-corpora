00:07:59.274 --> 00:08:02.976
Nowhere else is there a better example
than with the Wright brothers.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.614
Most people don't know
about Samuel Pierpont Langley.

00:08:06.638 --> 00:08:08.976
And back in the early 20th century,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.143
the pursuit of powered man flight
was like the dot com of the day.

00:08:12.167 --> 00:08:13.976
Everybody was trying it.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.976
And Samuel Pierpont Langley
had, what we assume,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.673
to be the recipe for success.

00:08:19.697 --> 00:08:21.396
Even now, you ask people,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.039
"Why did your product
or why did your company fail?"

00:08:24.063 --> 00:08:26.324
and people always give
you the same permutation

00:08:26.348 --> 00:08:27.769
of the same three things:

00:08:27.793 --> 00:08:30.770
under-capitalized, the wrong people,
bad market conditions.
