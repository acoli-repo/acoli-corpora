"We don't believe you.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.548
We don't need it. We don't like it.

00:14:34.572 --> 00:14:35.635
You're scaring us."

00:14:36.691 --> 00:14:37.976
What if they had said,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.976
"If you're the kind of person
who likes to have total control

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.976
over every aspect of your life,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.976
boy, do we have a product for you.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.978
It pauses live TV, skips commercials,

00:14:51.002 --> 00:14:53.162
memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."

00:14:53.858 --> 00:14:56.372
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it,

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:59.757
and what you do simply serves
as the proof of what you believe.
