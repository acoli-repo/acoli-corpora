00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.976
The goal is not just
to hire people who need a job;

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.976

but if they believe what you believe,

00:07:56.815 --> 00:07:59.250
they'll work for you with blood
and sweat and tears.

00:07:59.274 --> 00:08:02.976
Nowhere else is there a better example
than with the Wright brothers.
