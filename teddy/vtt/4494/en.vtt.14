00:06:57.864 --> 00:07:00.639
Because the part of the brain
that controls decision-making

00:07:00.663 --> 00:07:01.976
doesn't control language.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.461
The best we can muster up is,

00:07:03.485 --> 00:07:05.538
"I don't know. 
It just doesn't feel right."

00:07:05.562 --> 00:07:08.976
Or sometimes you say you're leading
with your heart or soul.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.672
I hate to break it to you,
those aren't other body parts

00:07:11.696 --> 00:07:12.976
controlling your behavior.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.143
It's all happening here
in your limbic brain,

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:18.453
the part of the brain that controls
decision-making and not language.

00:07:18.477 --> 00:07:20.976
But if you don't know
why you do what you do,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.976
and people respond
to why you do what you do,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.976
then how will you ever get people

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.048
to vote for you,
or buy something from you,

00:07:29.072 --> 00:07:30.976
or, more importantly, be loyal
