Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.976
and they make great quality products,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.976
and they can make perfectly
well-designed products --

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.800
and nobody bought one.

00:05:14.824 --> 00:05:17.276
In fact, talking about it now,
we can't even imagine

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.848
buying an MP3 player from Dell.

00:05:18.872 --> 00:05:21.076
Why would you buy one
from a computer company?

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.697
But we do it every day.

00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:25.212
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it.

00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:30.761
The goal is not to do business
with everybody who needs what you have.
