00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.976
How do you explain
when things don't go as we assume?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.976
Or better, how do you explain

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.976
when others are able to achieve things
that seem to defy all of the assumptions?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.976
For example:

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.976
Why is Apple so innovative?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.976
Year after year, after year,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.976
they're more innovative
than all their competition.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.976
And yet, they're just a computer company.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.976
They're just like everyone else.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.190
They have the same access
to the same talent,

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:28.215
the same agencies,

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.095
the same consultants, the same media.
