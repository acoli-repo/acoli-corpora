00:13:28.261 --> 00:13:31.653
is money and the right people
and the right market conditions.

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:33.422
You should have success then.

00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:34.976
Look at TiVo.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.715
From the time TiVo came out
about eight or nine years ago

00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:38.977
to this current day,

00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:42.651
they are the single highest-quality
product on the market,

00:13:42.675 --> 00:13:44.548
hands down, there is no dispute.

00:13:45.595 --> 00:13:47.402
They were extremely well-funded.

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:49.125
Market conditions were fantastic.

00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:50.976
I mean, we use TiVo as verb.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.259
I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk
Time Warner DVR all the time.

00:13:54.283 --> 00:13:56.326
(Laughter)

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:58.976
But TiVo's a commercial failure.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.976
They've never made money.
