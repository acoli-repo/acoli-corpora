00:05:56.962 --> 00:06:00.185
"Ring the bells that still can ring.

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:03.349
Forget your perfect offering.

00:06:03.373 --> 00:06:06.274
There is a crack in everything.

00:06:06.298 --> 00:06:09.046
That's how the light gets in."

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.517
This is my bit of light.

00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:13.185
But we need more light.

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:16.653
In fact, we need huge spotlights
placed in the world of women's health

00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:18.975
if we need a better tomorrow.

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:23.492
We should never forget that women
are at the center of a sustainable world,

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:26.043
and we do not exist without them.

00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:27.226
Thank you.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.325
(Applause)
