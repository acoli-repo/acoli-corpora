00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.232
at three dollars, we were able
to deliver "janma,"

00:04:01.256 --> 00:04:03.133
a clean birth kit in a purse.

00:04:04.058 --> 00:04:06.878
Janma, meaning "birth," contained
a blood-absorbing sheet

00:04:06.902 --> 00:04:08.629
for the woman to give birth on,

00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:12.658
a surgical scalpel, a cord clamp,
a bar of soap, a pair of gloves

00:04:12.682 --> 00:04:15.345
and the first cloth
to wipe the baby clean.

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.557
All this came packaged
in a beautiful purse

00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:20.796
that was given to the mother
as a gift after all her hard work,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.103
that she carried home with pride
as a symbol of prosperity.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.323
One woman reacted to this gift.

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:31.167
She said, "Is this really mine?
Can I keep it?"
