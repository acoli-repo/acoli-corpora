She will not be alone.

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:35.658
Over one million mothers and babies
die every single year

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:37.211
in the developing world,

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:40.979
only because of lack of access
to basic cleanliness

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.210
while giving birth to their babies.

00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:47.259
My journey began on a hot summer afternoon

00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:49.451
in India in 2008,

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:53.148
when after a day of meeting women
and listening to their needs,

00:00:53.172 --> 00:00:56.099
I landed in a thatched hut with a midwife.

00:00:57.035 --> 00:01:01.785
As a mother, I was very curious
on how she delivered babies in her house.
