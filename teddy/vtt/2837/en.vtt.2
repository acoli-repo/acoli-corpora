00:00:57.035 --> 00:01:01.785
As a mother, I was very curious
on how she delivered babies in her house.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.512
After a deep and engaging
conversation with her

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:08.882
on how she considered it a profound
calling to do what she was doing,

00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:10.946
I asked her a parting question:

00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.822
Do you have the tools that you need
to deliver the babies?

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:17.628
I got to see her tool.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.736
"This is what I use to separate
the mother and the baby," she said.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.620
Unsure of how to react, I held this
agricultural tool in my hand in shock.

00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:32.710
I took a picture of this,
hugged her and walked away.
