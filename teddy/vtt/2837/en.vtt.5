The women said they would rather
deliver on a floor

00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:34.154
than on a plastic sheet
that smeared blood all over.

00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:37.593
They were absolutely right --
it would cause more infection.

00:02:37.617 --> 00:02:40.626
The thread provided was a highway
to bacterial infection

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.349
through the baby's umbilical cord,

00:02:42.373 --> 00:02:45.217
and the blade used was the kind
that men used for shaving,

00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:47.798
and they did not want it
anywhere close to them.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.583
There was no incentive for anybody
to redesign this product,

00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:53.518
because it was based on charity.

00:02:53.542 --> 00:02:56.282
The women were never
consulted in this process.

00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:59.383
And to my surprise, the need
was not only in homes

00:02:59.407 --> 00:03:02.736
but also in institutional settings
with high-volume births.
