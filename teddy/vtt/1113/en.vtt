00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Martin Luther King

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
did not say,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
"I have a nightmare,"

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when he inspired the civil rights movements.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
He said, "I have a dream."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I have a dream.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I have a dream that we can stop thinking

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that the future will be a nightmare,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and this is going to be a challenge,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because, if you think

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
of every major blockbusting film of recent times,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
nearly all of its visions for humanity
