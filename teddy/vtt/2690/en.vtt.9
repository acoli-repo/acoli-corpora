00:04:27.423 --> 00:04:33.092
The thing is that there's
a lot of talk about it being cheap

00:04:33.116 --> 00:04:34.858
and it being easy.

00:04:34.882 --> 00:04:37.694
And I run a community lab.

00:04:38.242 --> 00:04:41.798
I'm starting to get emails from people
that say stuff like,

00:04:41.822 --> 00:04:44.219
"Hey, can I come to your open night

00:04:44.243 --> 00:04:47.860
and, like, maybe use CRISPR
and engineer my genome?"

00:04:47.884 --> 00:04:48.994
(Laugher)

00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:50.519
Like, seriously.

00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:53.179
I'm, "No, you can't."

00:04:53.203 --> 00:04:54.213
(Laughter)

00:04:54.237 --> 00:04:56.592
"But I've heard it's cheap.
I've heard it's easy."

00:04:56.616 --> 00:04:58.799
We're going to explore that a little bit.

00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:00.772
So, how cheap is it?
