00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:31.116
that we consider harmful to humans

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.442
off the face of the Earth,

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.983
using this technology?

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:38.448
This type of science
is moving much faster

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:41.316
than the regulatory mechanisms
that govern it.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.407
And so, for the past six years,

00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:45.376
I've made it my personal mission

00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:48.873
to make sure that as many people
as possible understand

00:00:48.897 --> 00:00:51.997
these types of technologies
and their implications.

00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:56.550
Now, CRISPR has been the subject
of a huge media hype,

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.448
and the words that are used most often
are "easy" and "cheap."
