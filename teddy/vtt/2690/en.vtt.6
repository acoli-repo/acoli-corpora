00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.581
There are two major repair pathways.

00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:06.674
The first just takes the DNA
and shoves the two pieces back together.

00:03:06.698 --> 00:03:08.796
This isn't a very efficient system,

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.549
because what happens is
sometimes a base drops out

00:03:11.573 --> 00:03:13.000
or a base is added.

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:16.817
It's an OK way to maybe, like,
knock out a gene,

00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:20.074
but it's not the way that we really want
to do genome editing.

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:22.993
The second repair pathway
is a lot more interesting.

00:03:23.017 --> 00:03:24.653
In this repair pathway,

00:03:24.677 --> 00:03:27.358
it takes a homologous piece of DNA.

00:03:27.382 --> 00:03:30.022
And now mind you, in a diploid
organism like people,
