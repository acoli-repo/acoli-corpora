00:08:58.983 --> 00:09:02.292
to spend all their time doing research.

00:09:02.984 --> 00:09:06.355
That makes us all the inventors of CRISPR,

00:09:06.998 --> 00:09:11.466
and I would say that makes us all
the shepherds of CRISPR.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.297
We all have a responsibility.

00:09:13.749 --> 00:09:17.705
So I would urge you to really learn
about these types of technologies,

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.029
because, really, only in that way

00:09:20.415 --> 00:09:24.767
are we going to be able to guide
the development of these technologies,

00:09:24.791 --> 00:09:26.723
the use of these technologies

00:09:26.747 --> 00:09:30.502
and make sure that, in the end,
it's a positive outcome --
