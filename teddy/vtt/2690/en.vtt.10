00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:00.772
So, how cheap is it?

00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:03.206
Yeah, it is cheap in comparison.

00:05:03.665 --> 00:05:07.284
It's going to take the cost of the average
materials for an experiment

00:05:07.308 --> 00:05:09.840
from thousands of dollars
to hundreds of dollars,

00:05:09.864 --> 00:05:11.800
and it cuts the time a lot, too.

00:05:11.824 --> 00:05:13.904
It can cut it from weeks to days.

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:15.738
That's great.

00:05:15.762 --> 00:05:18.452
You still need a professional lab
to do the work in;

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:21.988
you're not going to do anything meaningful
outside of a professional lab.

00:05:22.012 --> 00:05:24.016
I mean, don't listen to anyone who says

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.771
you can do this sort of stuff
on your kitchen table.

00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:31.929
It's really not easy
to do this kind of work.
