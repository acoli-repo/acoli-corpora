It's a system that we stole

00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:04.316
from an ancient, ancient
bacterial immune system.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.209
The part that's amazing about it
is that the guide RNA,

00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:11.932
only 20 letters of it,

00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:13.594
are what target the system.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.713
This is really easy to design,

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:18.556
and it's really cheap to buy.

00:02:18.985 --> 00:02:22.990
So that's the part
that is modular in the system;

00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:24.812
everything else stays the same.

00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:28.912
This makes it a remarkably easy
and powerful system to use.
