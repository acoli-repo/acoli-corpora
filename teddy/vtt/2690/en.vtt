00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.753
So, has everybody heard of CRISPR?

00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:06.485
I would be shocked if you hadn't.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.711
This is a technology --
it's for genome editing --

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:12.569
and it's so versatile and so controversial

00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:15.834
that it's sparking all sorts
of really interesting conversations.

00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:18.694
Should we bring back the woolly mammoth?

00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:21.575
Should we edit a human embryo?

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:24.163
And my personal favorite:

00:00:24.997 --> 00:00:28.648
How can we justify
wiping out an entire species

00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:31.116
that we consider harmful to humans
