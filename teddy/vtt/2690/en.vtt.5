00:02:30.047 --> 00:02:34.287
The guide RNA and the Cas9
protein complex together

00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:36.243
go bouncing along the genome,

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:39.760
and when they find a spot
where the guide RNA matches,

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.639
then it inserts between the two strands
of the double helix,

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:44.231
it rips them apart,

00:02:44.692 --> 00:02:47.380
that triggers the Cas9 protein to cut,

00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:49.381
and all of a sudden,

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:51.716
you've got a cell that's in total panic

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.365
because now it's got a piece
of DNA that's broken.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.296
What does it do?

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.514
It calls its first responders.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.581
There are two major repair pathways.
