We don't know why some cells
want to do one repair pathway

00:06:31.193 --> 00:06:33.651
and some cells would rather do the other.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.554
And besides that,

00:06:35.578 --> 00:06:38.447
there's the whole problem
of getting the system into the cell

00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:39.735
in the first place.

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.761
In a petri dish, that's not that hard,

00:06:41.785 --> 00:06:44.230
but if you're trying to do it
on a whole organism,

00:06:44.254 --> 00:06:45.797
it gets really tricky.

00:06:46.224 --> 00:06:49.410
It's OK if you use something
like blood or bone marrow --

00:06:49.434 --> 00:06:51.661
those are the targets
of a lot of research now.

00:06:51.685 --> 00:06:53.936
There was a great story
of some little girl

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.612
who they saved from leukemia

00:06:55.636 --> 00:06:58.310
by taking the blood out, editing it,
and putting it back

00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:00.383
with a precursor of CRISPR.
