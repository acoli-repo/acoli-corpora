00:03:27.382 --> 00:03:30.022
And now mind you, in a diploid
organism like people,

00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:34.294
we've got one copy of our genome
from our mom and one from our dad,

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:35.593
so if one gets damaged,

00:03:35.617 --> 00:03:38.012
it can use the other
chromosome to repair it.

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:39.669
So that's where this comes from.

00:03:40.518 --> 00:03:41.982
The repair is made,

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:43.957
and now the genome is safe again.

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:46.139
The way that we can hijack this

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:50.205
is we can feed it a false piece of DNA,

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.373
a piece that has homology on both ends

00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:54.096
but is different in the middle.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.587
So now, you can put
whatever you want in the center

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.126
and the cell gets fooled.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.269
So you can change a letter,
