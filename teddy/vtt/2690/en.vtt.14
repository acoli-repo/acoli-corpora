00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:00.383
with a precursor of CRISPR.

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:03.665
And this is a line of research
that people are going to do.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.242
But right now, if you want to get
into the whole body,

00:07:06.266 --> 00:07:08.410
you're probably going
to have to use a virus.

00:07:08.434 --> 00:07:10.807
So you take the virus,
you put the CRISPR into it,

00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:12.537
you let the virus infect the cell.

00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:14.704
But now you've got this virus in there,

00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:17.416
and we don't know what the long-term
effects of that are.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.708
Plus, CRISPR has some off-target effects,

00:07:19.732 --> 00:07:22.693
a very small percentage,
but they're still there.

00:07:22.717 --> 00:07:25.515
What's going to happen
over time with that?

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:28.251
These are not trivial questions,

00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:30.915
and there are scientists
that are trying to solve them,
