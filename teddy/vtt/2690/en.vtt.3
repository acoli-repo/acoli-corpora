00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:31.596
and not a natural edit.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.865
That's how it works.

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.652
It's a two-part system.

00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:39.047
You've got a Cas9 protein
and something called a guide RNA.

00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:41.533
I like to think of it as a guided missile.

00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:44.203
So the Cas9 --
I love to anthropomorphize --

00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:47.457
so the Cas9 is kind of this Pac-Man thing

00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:49.026
that wants to chew DNA,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.206
and the guide RNA is the leash
that's keeping it out of the genome

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.079
until it finds the exact spot
where it matches.

00:01:56.912 --> 00:01:59.806
And the combination of those two
is called CRISPR.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.398
It's a system that we stole
