00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:30.915
and there are scientists
that are trying to solve them,

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:33.225
and they will eventually,
hopefully, be solved.

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:36.883
But it ain't plug-and-play,
not by a long shot.

00:07:36.907 --> 00:07:38.666
So: Is it really easy?

00:07:39.032 --> 00:07:43.365
Well, if you spend a few years
working it out in your particular system,

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:44.814
yes, it is.

00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:47.510
Now the other thing is,

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:53.893
we don't really know that much about how
to make a particular thing happen

00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:56.822
by changing particular spots
in the genome.

00:07:57.306 --> 00:07:59.473
We're a long way away from figuring out

00:07:59.497 --> 00:08:01.866
how to give a pig wings, for example.
