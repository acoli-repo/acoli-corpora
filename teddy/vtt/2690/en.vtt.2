00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.448
and the words that are used most often
are "easy" and "cheap."

00:01:02.337 --> 00:01:05.476
So what I want to do is drill down
a little bit deeper

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.684
and look into some of the myths
and the realities around CRISPR.

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:12.904
If you're trying to CRISPR a genome,

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:16.194
the first thing that you have to do
is damage the DNA.

00:01:17.098 --> 00:01:20.140
The damage comes in the form
of a double-strand break

00:01:20.164 --> 00:01:21.728
through the double helix.

00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:24.504
And then the cellular repair
processes kick in,

00:01:25.088 --> 00:01:27.727
and then we convince
those repair processes

00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:29.627
to make the edit that we want,
