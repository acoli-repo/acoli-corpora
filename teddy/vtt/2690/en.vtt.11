00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:31.929
It's really not easy
to do this kind of work.

00:05:31.953 --> 00:05:34.261
Not to mention,
there's a patent battle going on,

00:05:34.285 --> 00:05:36.111
so even if you do invent something,

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:42.771
the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley
are in this incredible patent battle.

00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:45.183
It's really fascinating
to watch it happen,

00:05:45.207 --> 00:05:48.455
because they're accusing each other
of fraudulent claims

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.210
and then they've got people saying,

00:05:50.234 --> 00:05:53.018
"Oh, well, I signed
my notebook here or there."

00:05:53.042 --> 00:05:55.143
This isn't going to be settled for years.

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:56.327
And when it is,

00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:59.636
you can bet you're going to pay someone
a really hefty licensing fee

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.009
in order to use this stuff.
