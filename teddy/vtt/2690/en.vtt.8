00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.269
So you can change a letter,

00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:01.558
you can take letters out,

00:04:01.582 --> 00:04:04.506
but most importantly,
you can stuff new DNA in,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.279
kind of like a Trojan horse.

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.274
CRISPR is going to be amazing,

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:12.916
in terms of the number of different
scientific advances

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.597
that it's going to catalyze.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:17.842
The thing that's special about it
is this modular targeting system.

00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:21.633
I mean, we've been shoving DNA
into organisms for years, right?

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:23.784
But because of the modular
targeting system,

00:04:23.808 --> 00:04:26.233
we can actually put it
exactly where we want it.

00:04:27.423 --> 00:04:33.092
The thing is that there's
a lot of talk about it being cheap
