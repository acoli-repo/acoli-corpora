00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.009
in order to use this stuff.

00:06:01.343 --> 00:06:03.124
So, is it really cheap?

00:06:03.148 --> 00:06:08.347
Well, it's cheap if you're doing
basic research and you've got a lab.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.496
How about easy?
Let's look at that claim.

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:14.905
The devil is always in the details.

00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:19.012
We don't really know
that much about cells.

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:20.706
They're still kind of black boxes.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.590
For example, we don't know
why some guide RNAs work really well

00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:27.677
and some guide RNAs don't.

00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:31.169
We don't know why some cells
want to do one repair pathway
