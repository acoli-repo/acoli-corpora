Seven years ago, a student came to me
and asked me to invest in his company.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.536
He said, "I'm working with three friends,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.000
and we're going to try to disrupt
an industry by selling stuff online."

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.696
And I said, "OK, you guys spent
the whole summer on this, right?"

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.856
"No, we all took internships
just in case it doesn't work out."

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.040
"All right, but you're going to
go in full time once you graduate."

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.720
"Not exactly. We've all
lined up backup jobs."

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.856
Six months go by,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.856
it's the day before the company launches,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.000
and there is still
not a functioning website.
