started with a leaflet that I picked up in London.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It was the early '90s,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I thought, "No way, no way."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I also thought, "How can I be like

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a hot-shot young full professor

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
who teaches human rights and not know this?
