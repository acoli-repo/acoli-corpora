00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.379
sun on one side, night pouring

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:36.759
her slow hand over the other: one fire
flying the kite of another.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.694
Her kiss, I swear—if the Great
Mother rushed open the moon

00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:47.244
like a gift and you were there
to feel your shadow finally

00:01:47.244 --> 00:01:49.214
unhooked from your wrist.

00:01:49.214 --> 00:01:51.074
That’d be it, but even sweeter—

00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:56.544
like a riot of peg-legged priests
on pogo-sticks, up and up,

00:01:56.544 --> 00:02:00.734
this way and this, not
falling but on and on
