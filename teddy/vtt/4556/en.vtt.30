00:14:57.194 --> 00:15:00.547
So I would have thought that perhaps
the most successful relationships

00:15:00.571 --> 00:15:03.851
were ones where there was
a really high negativity threshold.

00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:05.668
Where couples let things go

00:15:05.692 --> 00:15:08.463
and only brought things up
if they really were a big deal.

00:15:08.487 --> 00:15:12.738
But actually, the mathematics
and subsequent findings by the team

00:15:12.762 --> 00:15:15.294
have shown the exact opposite is true.

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:18.108
The best couples,
or the most successful couples,

00:15:18.132 --> 00:15:21.495
are the ones with a really low
negativity threshold.

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:25.153
These are the couples
that don't let anything go unnoticed

00:15:25.177 --> 00:15:28.375
and allow each other
some room to complain.

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:33.633
These are the couples that are continually
trying to repair their own relationship,
