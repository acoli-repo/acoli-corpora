It's actually more romantic
than I normally manage.

00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:33.216
(Laughter)

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.901
OK, so this method doesn't give you
a 100 percent success rate,

00:10:37.925 --> 00:10:41.360
but there's no other possible
strategy that can do any better.

00:10:41.384 --> 00:10:44.814
And actually, in the wild,
there are certain types of fish

00:10:44.838 --> 00:10:47.655
which follow and employ
this exact strategy.

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:50.432
So they reject every possible
suitor that turns up

00:10:50.456 --> 00:10:53.145
in the first 37 percent
of the mating season,

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:56.920
and then they pick the next fish
that comes along after that window

00:10:56.944 --> 00:10:59.099
that's, I don't know, bigger and burlier

00:10:59.123 --> 00:11:01.701
than all of the fish
that they've seen before.
