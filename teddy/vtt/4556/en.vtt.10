00:04:58.697 --> 00:05:01.486
(Laughter)

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.603
Now, I think that if you ask people
how attractive they thought

00:05:05.627 --> 00:05:07.535
Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were,

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:10.467
and you ask them to give
them a score between one and five

00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:13.511
I reckon that they'd average out
to have roughly the same score.

00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:16.299
But the way that people would vote
would be very different.

00:05:16.323 --> 00:05:19.025
So Portia's scores would
all be clustered around the four

00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:21.480
because everybody agrees
that she's very beautiful,

00:05:21.504 --> 00:05:24.218
whereas Sarah Jessica Parker
completely divides opinion.

00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:26.218
There'd be a huge spread in her scores.

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:28.591
And actually it's this spread that counts.

00:05:28.615 --> 00:05:30.841
It's this spread
that makes you more popular
