Today I want to talk to you
about the mathematics of love.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.829
Now, I think that we can all agree

00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:10.162
that mathematicians
are famously excellent at finding love.

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:11.882
(Laughter)

00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:14.873
But it's not just because
of our dashing personalities,

00:00:14.897 --> 00:00:19.520
superior conversational skills
and excellent pencil cases.

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:23.826
It's also because we've actually done
an awful lot of work into the maths

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.326
of how to find the perfect partner.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.029
Now, in my favorite paper
on the subject, which is entitled,
