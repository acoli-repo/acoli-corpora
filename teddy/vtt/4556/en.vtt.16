00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:01.172
to help us out here,
called optimal stopping theory.

00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:03.177
So let's imagine, then,

00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:05.803
that you start dating when you're 15

00:08:05.827 --> 00:08:09.596
and ideally, you'd like to be married
by the time that you're 35.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.062
And there's a number of people

00:08:11.086 --> 00:08:13.583
that you could potentially
date across your lifetime,

00:08:13.607 --> 00:08:15.735
and they'll be at varying
levels of goodness.

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:18.424
Now the rules are that once
you cash in and get married,

00:08:18.448 --> 00:08:20.878
you can't look ahead to see
what you could have had,

00:08:20.902 --> 00:08:23.435
and equally, you can't go back
and change your mind.

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:25.058
In my experience at least,

00:08:25.082 --> 00:08:27.880
I find that typically people
don't much like being recalled

00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:33.122
years after being passed up
for somebody else, or that's just me.
