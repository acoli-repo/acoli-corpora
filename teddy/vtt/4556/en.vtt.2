00:00:59.218 --> 00:01:04.008
And comes up with an estimate
of 26 women in the whole of the UK.

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:05.211
(Laughter)

00:01:05.235 --> 00:01:07.268
It's not looking very good, is it Peter?

00:01:07.292 --> 00:01:09.246
Now, just to put that into perspective,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.550
that's about 400 times fewer
than the best estimates

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:16.275
of how many intelligent
extraterrestrial life forms there are.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.593
And it also gives Peter
a 1 in 285,000 chance

00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:23.878
of bumping into any one
of these special ladies

00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:25.441
on a given night out.

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:27.467
I'd like to think
that's why mathematicians

00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:29.949
don't really bother
going on nights out anymore.
