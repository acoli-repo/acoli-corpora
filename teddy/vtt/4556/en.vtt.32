to say that you should never
let the sun go down on your anger.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.164
So those are my top three tips

00:16:04.188 --> 00:16:07.359
of how maths can help you
with love and relationships.

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:09.778
But I hope, that aside from
their use as tips,

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:13.904
they also give you a little bit of insight
into the power of mathematics.

00:16:13.928 --> 00:16:18.269
Because for me, equations
and symbols aren't just a thing.

00:16:18.684 --> 00:16:23.095
They're a voice that speaks out
about the incredible richness of nature

00:16:23.119 --> 00:16:24.905
and the startling simplicity

00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:29.742
in the patterns that twist and turn
and warp and evolve all around us,

00:16:29.766 --> 00:16:32.346
from how the world works to how we behave.
