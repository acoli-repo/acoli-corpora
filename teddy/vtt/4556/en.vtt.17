00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:33.122
years after being passed up
for somebody else, or that's just me.

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:36.339
So the math says then
that what you should do

00:08:36.363 --> 00:08:39.534
in the first 37 percent
of your dating window,

00:08:39.558 --> 00:08:43.315
you should just reject everybody
as serious marriage potential.

00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:45.489
(Laughter)

00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:49.137
And then, you should pick
the next person that comes along

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:52.130
that is better than everybody
that you've seen before.

00:08:52.154 --> 00:08:53.575
So here's the example.

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:56.466
Now if you do this, it can be
mathematically proven, in fact,

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.951
that this is the best possible way

00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:03.304
of maximizing your chances
of finding the perfect partner.
