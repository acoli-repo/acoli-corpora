Let me show you how this works.

00:03:30.337 --> 00:03:34.716
In a thankfully voluntary
section of OkCupid,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.541
you are allowed to rate
how attractive you think people are

00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:39.850
on a scale between one and five.

00:03:39.874 --> 00:03:42.855
Now, if we compare this score,
the average score,

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.020
to how many messages
a selection of people receive,

00:03:46.044 --> 00:03:47.567
you can begin to get a sense

00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:51.999
of how attractiveness links to popularity
on an online dating website.

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:55.365
This is the graph the OkCupid guys
have come up with.

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.383
And the important thing to notice
is that it's not totally true

00:03:58.407 --> 00:04:01.232
that the more attractive you are,
the more messages you get.
