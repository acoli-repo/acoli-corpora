of maximizing your chances
of finding the perfect partner.

00:09:03.328 --> 00:09:07.909
Now unfortunately, I have to tell you that
this method does come with some risks.

00:09:08.604 --> 00:09:13.413
For instance, imagine
if your perfect partner appeared

00:09:13.437 --> 00:09:16.119
during your first 37 percent.

00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:18.915
Now, unfortunately,
you'd have to reject them.

00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:21.628
(Laughter)

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:24.244
Now, if you're following the maths,

00:09:24.268 --> 00:09:25.901
I'm afraid no one else comes along

00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:28.196
that's better than anyone
you've seen before,

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.069
so you have to go on
rejecting everyone and die alone.
