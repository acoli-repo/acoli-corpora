that the more attractive you are,
the more messages you get.

00:04:01.256 --> 00:04:05.511
But the question arises then
of what is it about people up here

00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:09.398
who are so much more popular
than people down here,

00:04:09.422 --> 00:04:12.518
even though they have the same
score of attractiveness?

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:16.675
And the reason why is that it's not just
straightforward looks that are important.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.506
So let me try to illustrate
their findings with an example.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.448
So if you take someone like
Portia de Rossi, for example,

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:27.952
everybody agrees that Portia de Rossi
is a very beautiful woman.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:31.694
Nobody thinks that she's ugly,
but she's not a supermodel, either.
