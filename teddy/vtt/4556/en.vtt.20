00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:01.711
is just marginally less boring,
dull and terrible ...

00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:02.834
(Laughter)

00:10:02.858 --> 00:10:04.756
than everybody that you've seen before.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.375
Now, if you are following the maths,
I'm afraid you have to marry them ...

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.454
(Laughter)

00:10:09.478 --> 00:10:12.621
and end up in a relationship
which is, frankly, suboptimal.

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:13.798
Sorry about that.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:17.322
But I do think that there's an opportunity
here for Hallmark to cash in on

00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:18.928
and really cater for this market.

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.535
A Valentine's Day card like this.

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.715
(Laughter)

00:10:21.739 --> 00:10:24.741
"My darling husband,
you are marginally less terrible

00:10:24.765 --> 00:10:26.919
than the first 37 percent
of people I dated."

00:10:26.943 --> 00:10:28.573
(Laughter)

00:10:28.597 --> 00:10:31.435
It's actually more romantic
than I normally manage.
