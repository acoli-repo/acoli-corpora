are exactly neatly ordered
and easily predictable, either.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:18.144
Because I believe that mathematics
is so powerful that it has the potential

00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:21.489
to offer us a new way of looking
at almost anything.

00:02:21.513 --> 00:02:24.333
Even something as mysterious as love.

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.651
And so, to try to persuade you

and relevant mathematics is,
