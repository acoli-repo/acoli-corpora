00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.029
Now, in my favorite paper
on the subject, which is entitled,

00:00:30.053 --> 00:00:31.916
"Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend" --

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.347
(Laughter)

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:36.989
Peter Backus tries to rate
his chances of finding love.

00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:39.242
Now, Peter's not a very greedy man.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.518
Of all of the available women in the UK,

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:45.037
all Peter's looking for
is somebody who lives near him,

00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:46.867
somebody in the right age range,

00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:49.813
somebody with a university degree,

00:00:49.837 --> 00:00:51.819
somebody he's likely to get on well with,

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.786
somebody who's likely to be attractive,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.116
somebody who's likely
to find him attractive.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.194
(Laughter)

00:00:59.218 --> 00:01:04.008
And comes up with an estimate
of 26 women in the whole of the UK.
