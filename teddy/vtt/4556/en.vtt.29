But the really important term
in this equation

00:14:39.158 --> 00:14:40.890
Now, the negativity threshold,

00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:45.541

before the wife starts to get
really pissed off, and vice versa.

00:14:49.852 --> 00:14:54.384
Now, I always thought that good marriages
were about compromise and understanding

00:14:54.408 --> 00:14:57.170

So I would have thought that perhaps
