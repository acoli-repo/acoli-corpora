WEBVTT

00:02:56.844 --> 00:03:00.340
on everybody who uses their site
for almost a decade.

00:03:00.364 --> 00:03:02.514
And they've been trying
to search for patterns

00:03:02.538 --> 00:03:04.401
in the way that we talk about ourselves

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:06.484
and the way that we interact
with each other

00:03:06.508 --> 00:03:07.852
on an online dating website.

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:10.801
And they've come up with some
seriously interesting findings.

00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:12.423
But my particular favorite

00:03:12.447 --> 00:03:15.803
is that it turns out
that on an online dating website,

00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:21.487
how attractive you are
does not dictate how popular you are,

00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:25.367
and actually, having people
think that you're ugly

00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:27.286
can work to your advantage.

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.619
(Laughter)

00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:30.313
Let me show you how this works.
