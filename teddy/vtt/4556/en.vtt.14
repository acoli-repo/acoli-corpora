00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.346
and the unimportant losers who don't,
well, they only play up to your advantage.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.923
OK, Top Tip #2:
How to pick the perfect partner.

00:07:02.947 --> 00:07:05.600
So let's imagine then
that you're a roaring success

00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:07.165
on the dating scene.

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:11.724
But the question arises
of how do you then convert that success

00:07:11.748 --> 00:07:14.299
into longer-term happiness,

00:07:14.323 --> 00:07:19.413
and in particular, how do you decide
when is the right time to settle down?

00:07:19.437 --> 00:07:22.245
Now generally,
it's not advisable to just cash in

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:26.392
and marry the first person who comes along
and shows you any interest at all.

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:29.537
But, equally, you don't really
want to leave it too long

00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:32.331
if you want to maximize your chance
of long-term happiness.
