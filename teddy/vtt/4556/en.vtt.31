00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:33.633
These are the couples that are continually
trying to repair their own relationship,

00:15:33.657 --> 00:15:36.400
that have a much more positive
outlook on their marriage.

00:15:36.424 --> 00:15:38.492
Couples that don't let things go

00:15:38.516 --> 00:15:43.396
and couples that don't let trivial things
end up being a really big deal.

00:15:44.426 --> 00:15:49.684
Now of course, it takes a bit more
than just a low negativity threshold

00:15:49.708 --> 00:15:54.076
and not compromising
to have a successful relationship.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.626
But I think that it's quite interesting

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.004
to know that there is really
mathematical evidence

00:15:59.028 --> 00:16:02.456
to say that you should never
let the sun go down on your anger.
