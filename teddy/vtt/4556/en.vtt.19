00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.069
so you have to go on
rejecting everyone and die alone.

00:09:32.093 --> 00:09:34.092
(Laughter)

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.076
Probably surrounded by cats ...

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.719
(Laughter)

00:09:37.838 --> 00:09:39.405
nibbling at your remains.

00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:43.398
OK, another risk is,
let's imagine, instead,

00:09:43.422 --> 00:09:46.538
that the first people that you dated
in your first 37 percent

00:09:46.562 --> 00:09:50.483
are just incredibly dull,
boring, terrible people.

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:53.221
That's OK, because
you're in your rejection phase,

00:09:53.245 --> 00:09:54.960
so that's fine, you can reject them.

00:09:54.984 --> 00:09:58.357
But then imagine
the next person to come along

00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:01.711
is just marginally less boring,
dull and terrible ...
