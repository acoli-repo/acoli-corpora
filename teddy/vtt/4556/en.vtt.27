00:13:29.318 --> 00:13:31.209
that they really started to understand

00:13:31.233 --> 00:13:35.727
what causes these negativity spirals
and how they occur.

00:13:35.751 --> 00:13:37.284
And the results that they found,

00:13:37.308 --> 00:13:41.957
I think, are just incredibly
impressively simple and interesting.

00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:46.544
So these equations predict how the wife
or husband is going to respond

00:13:46.568 --> 00:13:48.456
in their next turn of the conversation,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.613
how positive or negative
they're going to be.

00:13:50.637 --> 00:13:52.022
And these equations depend on

00:13:52.046 --> 00:13:54.352
the mood of the person
when they're on their own,

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.990
the mood of the person when
they're with their partner,

00:13:57.014 --> 00:13:58.739
but most importantly, they depend on

00:13:58.763 --> 00:14:01.795
how much the husband and wife
influence one another.
