00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.191
The classic example is people
who are, perhaps, a little bit overweight

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:33.657
deliberately choosing
a very cropped photo,

00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:35.032
(Laughter)

00:06:35.056 --> 00:06:36.816
or bald men, for example,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.788
deliberately choosing pictures
where they're wearing hats.

00:06:39.812 --> 00:06:42.402
But actually this is the opposite
of what you should do

00:06:42.426 --> 00:06:43.816
if you want to be successful.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.174
You should really, instead,

00:06:45.198 --> 00:06:48.356
play up to whatever it is
that makes you different,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.531
even if you think that some people
will find it unattractive.

00:06:52.555 --> 00:06:55.766
Because the people who fancy you
are just going to fancy you anyway,

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.346
and the unimportant losers who don't,
well, they only play up to your advantage.
