It's this spread
that makes you more popular

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:33.041
on an online Internet dating website.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:34.253
So what that means then

00:05:34.277 --> 00:05:36.882
is that if some people
think that you're attractive,

00:05:36.906 --> 00:05:38.767
you're actually better off

00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:42.738
having some other people
think that you're a massive minger.

00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:46.149
That's much better
than everybody just thinking

00:05:46.173 --> 00:05:48.236
that you're the cute girl next door.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.585
Now, I think this begins
to make a bit more sense

00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:53.879
when you think in terms of the people
who are sending these messages.

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:56.261
So let's say that you think
somebody's attractive,

00:05:56.285 --> 00:06:00.250
but you suspect that other people
won't necessarily be that interested.
