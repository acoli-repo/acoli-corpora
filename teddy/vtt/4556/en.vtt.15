if you want to maximize your chance
of long-term happiness.

00:07:32.355 --> 00:07:35.819
As my favorite author,
Jane Austen, puts it,

00:07:35.843 --> 00:07:38.037
"An unmarried woman of seven and twenty

00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:41.493
can never hope to feel
or inspire affection again."

00:07:41.517 --> 00:07:44.182
(Laughter)

00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:45.388
Thanks a lot, Jane.

00:07:45.412 --> 00:07:46.825
What do you know about love?

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:47.932
(Laughter)

00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:49.865
So the question is then,

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:52.478
how do you know when
is the right time to settle down,

00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:55.130
given all the people
that you can date in your lifetime?

00:07:55.154 --> 00:07:58.604
Thankfully, there's a rather delicious bit
of mathematics that we can use

00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:01.172
to help us out here,
called optimal stopping theory.
