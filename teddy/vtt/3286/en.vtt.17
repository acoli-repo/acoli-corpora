00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.176
to make sure that I could comfortably
make the reach with my leg.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.456
As I practiced the moves,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.895
my visualization turned
to the emotional component

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.376
of a potential solo.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.176
Basically, what if I got up there
and it was too scary?

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.496
What if I was too tired?

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.378
What if I couldn't quite make the kick?

00:08:42.402 --> 00:08:45.656
I had to consider every possibility

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.376
so that when the time came and I was
actually making the moves without a rope,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.336
there was no room for doubt to creep in.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.836
Doubt is the precursor to fear,

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.256
and I knew that I couldn't experience
my perfect moment if I was afraid.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.096
I had to visualize and rehearse
enough to remove all doubt.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.576
But beyond that, I also
visualized how it would feel
