00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.936
very similar to the one that had
given me so much trouble on Half Dome,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.416
but this time was different.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.016
I'd scouted every option, including
hundreds of feet of wall to either side.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.336
I knew exactly what to do
and how to do it.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.680
I had no doubts.
I just climbed right through.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.536
Even the difficult and strenuous
sections passed by with ease.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.480
I was perfectly executing my routine.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.856
I rested for a moment
below the Boulder Problem

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.456
and then climbed it just as I had
practiced so many times with the rope on.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.496
My foot shot across to the wall
on the left without hesitation,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.960
and I knew that I had done it.
