00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.776
Climbing Half Dome had been a big goal

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.016
and I did it,

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.896
but I didn't get what I really wanted.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.216
I didn't achieve mastery.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.896
I was hesitant and afraid, and it wasn't
the experience that I wanted.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.576
But El Cap was different.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.336
With 600 feet to go, I felt like the
mountain was offering me a victory lap.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.976
I climbed with a smooth precision

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.936
and enjoyed the sounds of the birds
swooping around the cliff.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.456
It all felt like a celebration.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.896
And then I reached the summit

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.456
after three hours and 56 minutes
of glorious climbing.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.176
It was the climb that I wanted,
and it felt like mastery.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.416
Thank you.
