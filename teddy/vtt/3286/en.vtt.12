00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.176
"No frickin' way."

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.056
(Laughter)

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.656
It's too big and too scary.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.416
But eventually I came to accept that
I wanted to test myself against El Cap.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.616
It represented true mastery,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.336
but I needed it to feel different.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.216
I didn't want to get away with anything
or barely squeak by.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.880
This time I wanted to do it right.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.336
The thing that makes El Cap
so intimidating

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.976
is the sheer scale of the wall.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.816
Most climbers take three to five days

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.696
to ascend the 3,000 feet
of vertical granite.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.896
The idea of setting out
up a wall of that size

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.216
with nothing but shoes and
a chalk bag seemed impossible.
