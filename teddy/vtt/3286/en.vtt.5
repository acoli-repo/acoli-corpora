00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.480
which, unsurprisingly,
was not the best strategy.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.136
I did at least climb the route
roped up with a friend two days before

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.496
just to make sure
that I knew roughly where to go

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.176
and that I could physically do it.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.376
But when I came back
by myself two days later,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.496
I decided that I didn't
want to go that way.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.536
I knew that there was a 300-foot variation

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.296
that circled around
one of the hardest parts of the climb.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.336
I suddenly decided to skip the hard part
and take the variation,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.296
even though I'd never climbed it before,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.256
but I immediately began to doubt myself.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.656
Imagine being by yourself
in the dead center of a 2,000-foot face,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.920
wondering if you're lost.
