00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.496
you have a rope and a bunch
of climbing gear on you,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.136
and tourists gasp and they
flock around you for photos.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.016
This time I popped over the edge
shirtless, panting, jacked.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.096
I was amped, but nobody batted an eye.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.080
(Laughter)

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.736
I looked like a lost hiker
that was too close to the edge.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.736
I was surrounded by people
talking on cell phones and having picnics.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.136
I felt like I was in a mall.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.296
(Laughter)

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.336
I took off my tight climbing shoes
and started hiking back down,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.016
and that's when people stopped me.
