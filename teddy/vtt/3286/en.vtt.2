00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.536
Seems scary? Yeah, it is,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.576
which is why I spent so many years
dreaming about soloing El Cap

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.856
and not actually doing it.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.016
But on the day that that video was taken,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.616
it didn't feel scary at all.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.376
It felt as comfortable and natural
as a walk in the park,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.376
which is what most folks
were doing in Yosemite that day.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.536
Today I'd like to talk about
how I was able to feel so comfortable

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.896
and how I overcame my fear.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.896
I'll start with a very brief version
of how I became a climber,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.856
and then tell the story
of my two most significant free solos.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.216
They were both successful,
which is why I'm here.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.456
