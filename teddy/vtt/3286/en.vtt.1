(Applause)

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.416
So that was El Capitan
in California's Yosemite National Park,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.976
and in case you couldn't tell,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.016
I was climbing by myself without a rope,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.696
a style of a climbing
known as free soloing.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.336
That was the culmination
of a nearly decade-long dream,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.976
and in the video I'm over
2,500 feet off the ground.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.536
Seems scary? Yeah, it is,
