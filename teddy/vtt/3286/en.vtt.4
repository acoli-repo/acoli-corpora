00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.016
And there have been
many free soloists before me,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.136
so I had plenty of
inspiration to draw from.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.296
But by 2008, I'd repeated
most of their previous solos in Yosemite

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.856
and was starting to imagine
breaking into new terrain.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.776
The obvious first choice was Half Dome,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.066
an iconic 2,000-foot wall that
lords over the east end of the valley.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.256
The problem, though also the allure,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.696
was that it was too big.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.656
I didn't really know how to prepare
for a potential free solo.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.496
So I decided to skip the preparations

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.136
and just go up there
and have an adventure.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.056
I figured I would rise to the occasion,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.480
which, unsurprisingly,
was not the best strategy.
