That's not supposed to be funny,
but if it is, it is.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.176
(Laughter)

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.976
I worked to cultivate that mindset
through visualization,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.176
which basically just means imagining
the entire experience of soloing the wall.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.736
Partially, that was to help me
remember all the holds,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.296
but mostly visualization
was about feeling the texture

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.536
of each hold in my hand

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.296
and imagining the sensation of my leg
reaching out and placing my foot just so.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.896
I'd imagine it all like a choreographed
dance thousands of feet up.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.416
The most difficult part of the whole route
was called the Boulder Problem.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.296
It was about 2,000 feet off the ground
