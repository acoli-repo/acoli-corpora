00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.136
I was disappointed in my performance,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.656
because I knew that I had
gotten away with something.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.896
I didn't want to be a lucky climber.
I wanted to be a great climber.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.656
I actually took the next year or so
off from free soloing,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.696
because I knew that I shouldn't
make a habit of relying on luck.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.736
But even though
I wasn't soloing very much,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.776
I'd already started to think about El Cap.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.256
It was always in the back of my mind
as the obvious crown jewel of solos.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.616
It's the most striking wall in the world.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.696
Each year, for the next seven years,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.616
I'd think, "This is the year
that I'm going to solo El Cap."

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.896
And then I would drive into Yosemite,
look up at the wall, and think,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.176
"No frickin' way."
