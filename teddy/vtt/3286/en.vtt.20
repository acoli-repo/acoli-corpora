00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.096
if I was ever going to climb
the route without a rope.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.936
After two seasons of working specifically
toward a potential free solo of El Cap,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.856
I finally finished all my preparations.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.406
I knew every handhold
and foothold on the whole route,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.856
and I knew exactly what to do.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.336
Basically, I was ready.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.880
It was time to solo El Cap.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.936
On June 3, 2017,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.176
I woke up early, ate my usual
breakfast of muesli and fruit

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.656
and made it to the base
of the wall before sunrise.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.656
I felt confident as I looked up the wall.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.640
I felt even better as I started climbing.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.576
About 500 feet up, I reached a slab

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.936
very similar to the one that had
given me so much trouble on Half Dome,
