00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.456
(Laughter)

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.976
But the first felt largely unsatisfying,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.600
whereas the second, El Cap, was by far
the most fulfilling day of my life.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.976
Through these two climbs,
you'll see my process for managing fear.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.936
So I started climbing in a gym
when I was around 10 years old,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.496
which means that my life
has been centered on climbing

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.736
for more than 20 years.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.096
After nearly a decade
of climbing mostly indoors,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.576
I made the transition to the outdoors
and gradually started free soloing.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.136
I built up my comfort over time

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.656
and slowly took on
bigger and more challenging walls.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.016
And there have been
many free soloists before me,
