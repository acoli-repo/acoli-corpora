00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.576
I switched my feet and tried
a foot further out.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.816
It seemed even worse.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.056
I started to panic.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.776
I could hear people laughing
on the summit just above me.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.936
I wanted to be anywhere but on that slab.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.816
My mind was racing in every direction.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.456
I knew what I had to do,
but I was too afraid to do it.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.576
I just had to stand up on my right foot.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.976
And so after what felt like an eternity,
I accepted what I had to do

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.736
and I stood up on the right foot,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.736
and it didn't slip, and so I didn't die,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.256
and that move marked the end
of the hardest climbing.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.936
And so I charged from there
towards the summit.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.016
And so normally when you summit Half Dome,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.496
you have a rope and a bunch
of climbing gear on you,
