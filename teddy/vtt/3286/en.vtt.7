00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.776
There were no cracks
or edges to hold on to,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.016
just small ripples of texture
up a slightly less than vertical wall.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.056
I had to trust my life to the friction
between my climbing shoes

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.376
and the smooth granite.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.096
I carefully balanced my way upward,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.896
shifting my weight back and forth
between the small smears.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.576
But then I reached a foothold
that I didn't quite trust.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.016
Two days ago, I'd have just
stepped right up on it,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.945
but that would have been with a rope on.

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.856
Now it felt too small and too slippery.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.416
I doubted that my foot
would stay on if I weighted it.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.296
I considered a foot further to the side,
which seemed worse.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.576
I switched my feet and tried
a foot further out.
