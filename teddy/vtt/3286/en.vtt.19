00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.776
that made that section
difficult and potentially dangerous,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.456
because any missed step
might knock a rock to the ground

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.216
and kill a passing climber or hiker.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.096
So we carefully removed the rocks,
loaded them into the pack

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.376
and rappelled back down.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.656
Take a second to imagine
how ridiculous it feels

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.896
to climb 1,500 feet up a wall
just to fill a backpack full of rocks.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.536
(Laughter)

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.296
It's never that easy to carry
a pack full of rocks around.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.256
It's even harder on the side of a cliff.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.776
It may have felt silly,
but it still had to get done.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.496
I needed everything to feel perfect

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.096
if I was ever going to climb
the route without a rope.
