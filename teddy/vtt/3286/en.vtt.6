00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.816
(Laughter)

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.136
Thankfully, it was
pretty much the right way

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.136
and I circled back to the route.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.696
I was slightly rattled,
I was pretty rattled,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.536
but I tried not to let it
bother me too much

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.536
because I knew that all the hardest
climbing was up at the top.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.976
I needed to stay composed.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.936
It was a beautiful September morning,
and as I climbed higher,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.376
I could hear the sounds of tourists
chatting and laughing on the summit.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.736
They'd all hiked up
the normal trail on the back,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.896
which I was planning on using
for my descent.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.656
But between me and the summit
lay a blank slab of granite.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.776
There were no cracks
or edges to hold on to,
