00:03:26.224 --> 00:03:30.302
I did notice the barren shops
in Wagner, South Dakota,

00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:35.403
and the VFW gathering hall

00:03:36.314 --> 00:03:38.106
that stood in mockery

00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:41.725
of a community's dream to endure.

00:03:43.352 --> 00:03:44.566
I did notice

00:03:45.323 --> 00:03:48.748
at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania Wal-Mart,

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:53.804
that far too many people
in their 20s and 30s

00:03:53.828 --> 00:03:56.335
looked a decade or two from death,

00:03:57.295 --> 00:03:59.641
with patchy, flared-up skin

00:03:59.665 --> 00:04:02.141
and thinning, stringy hair
