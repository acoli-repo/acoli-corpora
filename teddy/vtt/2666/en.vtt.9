because of an economy
that creates wealth --

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:32.748
just not jobs.

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:40.138
I did notice the news about those parts
of London becoming ghost quarters,

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:46.693
where the global super-rich
turn fishy money into empty apartments

00:04:47.962 --> 00:04:52.064
and price lifelong residents of a city,
young couples starting out,

00:04:52.088 --> 00:04:53.803
out of their own home.

00:04:56.332 --> 00:04:59.253
And I heard that the fabric of your life

00:04:59.277 --> 00:05:00.522
was tearing.
