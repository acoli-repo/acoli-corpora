00:06:59.664 --> 00:07:01.044
I wonder now

00:07:02.408 --> 00:07:04.686
if you would be less eager to deal it

00:07:05.438 --> 00:07:07.378
if I had stood with you

00:07:07.402 --> 00:07:09.686
when you merely felt it.

00:07:11.313 --> 00:07:12.590
I ask myself

00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:15.448
why I didn't stand with you then.

00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:20.251
One reason is that I became entranced

00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:22.364
by the gurus of change,

00:07:23.187 --> 00:07:27.522
became a worshiper of the religion
of the new for novelty's sake,

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:29.699
and of globalization and open borders

00:07:29.723 --> 00:07:32.660
and kaleidoscopic diversity.
