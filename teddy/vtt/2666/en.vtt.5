all these years when you said
that this amazing new world

00:02:36.204 --> 00:02:37.754
wasn't amazing for you,

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.483
for many of you,

00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:43.030
across the industrialized world;

00:02:43.918 --> 00:02:46.739
that the open, liquid world I relished,

00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:51.066
of people and goods
and technologies flowing freely,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.530
going where they pleased, globally,

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.279
was not, for you, an emancipation.
