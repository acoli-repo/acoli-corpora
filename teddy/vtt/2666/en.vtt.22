00:10:58.794 --> 00:11:00.080
and freedom.

00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:07.162
Language is one of the only things
that we truly share,

00:11:08.549 --> 00:11:12.028
and I sometimes used
this joint inheritance

00:11:12.052 --> 00:11:13.263
to obfuscate

00:11:13.821 --> 00:11:15.025
and deflect

00:11:15.479 --> 00:11:16.995
and justify myself;

00:11:17.933 --> 00:11:19.813
to re-brand what was good for me

00:11:19.837 --> 00:11:22.629
as something appearing good for us both,

00:11:23.324 --> 00:11:27.310
when I threw around terms
like "the sharing economy,"

00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:29.310
and "disruption"

00:11:29.845 --> 00:11:31.690
and "global resourcing."
