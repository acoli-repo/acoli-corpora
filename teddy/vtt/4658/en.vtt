Greg Gage: If I asked you
to think of a ferocious killer animal,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.776
you'd probably think of a lion,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.616
and for all the wonderful
predatory skills that a lion has,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.336
it still only has about a 20 percent
success rate at catching a meal.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.376
Now, one of the most successful hunters

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.456
in the entire animal kingdom
is surprising:

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.736
the dragonfly.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.536
Now, dragonflies are killer flies,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.136
and when they see a smaller fly,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.136
they have about a 97 percent
chance of catching it for a meal.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.416
And this is in mid-flight.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.616
But how can such
a small insect be so precise?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.496
In this episode, we're going to see

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.200
how the dragonfly's brain is highly
specialized to be a deadly killer.
