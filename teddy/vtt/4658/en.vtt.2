00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.661
To study this, Jaimie's been
spending a lot of time

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:03.336
socializing with dragonflies.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.296
What do you need to do your experiments?

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.656
Jaimie Spahr: First of all,
you need dragonflies.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.136
Oliver: I have a mesh cage
to catch the dragonflies.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.296
JS: The more I worked with them,
the more terrified I got of them.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.096
They're actually very scary,
especially under a microscope.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.256
They have really sharp mandibles,
are generally pretty aggressive,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.016
which I guess also helps them
to be really good predators.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.176
GG: In order to learn what's going on
inside the dragonfly's brain

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.416
when it sees a prey,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.576
we're going to eavesdrop in
on a conversation

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.136
between the eyes and the wings,
