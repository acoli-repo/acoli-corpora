00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.216
In the dragonfly, there's only 16 neurons;

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.496
that's eight per eye

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.976
that tell the wings
exactly where the target is.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.216
We've placed the electrodes
so that we can record from these neurons

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.936
that connect the eyes to the wings.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.816
Whenever a message is being passed
from the eye to the wing,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.576
our electrode intercepts that conversation
in the form of an electrical current,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.816
and it amplifies it.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.896
Now, we can both hear it and see it
in the form of a spike,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.176
which we also call an action potential.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.456
Now let's listen in.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.936
Right now, we have the dragonfly
flipped upside down,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.576
so he's looking down towards the ground.
