00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.976
and along its axons
it sends messages only to the neurons

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.696
that control the parts of the wings

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.056
that are needed
to keep that dragonfly on target.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.056
So if the prey is
on the left of the dragonfly,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.856
only the neurons that are tugging
the wings to the left are fired.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.376
And if the prey moves
to the right of the dragonfly,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.576
those same neurons are not needed,
so they're going to remain quiet.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.536
And the dragonfly speeds toward the prey

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.816
at a fixed angle that's communicated
by this crosshairs to the wings,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.856
and then boom, dinner.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.576
Now, all this happens in a split second,
and it's effortless for the dragonfly.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.176
It's almost like a reflex.
