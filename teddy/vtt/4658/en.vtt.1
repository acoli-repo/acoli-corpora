how the dragonfly's brain is highly
specialized to be a deadly killer.

[DIY Neuroscience]

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.496
So what makes the dragonfly
one of the most successful predators

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.736
in the animal kingdom?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.016
One, it's the eyes.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.896
It has near 360-degree vision.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.336
Two, the wings.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.176
With individual control of its wings,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.576
the dragonfly can move
precisely in any direction.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.976
But the real secret
to the dragonfly's success

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.096
is how its brain coordinates
this complex information

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.656
between the eyes and the wings

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.256
and turns hunting into a simple reflex.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.661
To study this, Jaimie's been
spending a lot of time
