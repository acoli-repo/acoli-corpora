In our experiments,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.616
we were able to see
that the neurons of the dragonfly

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.896
fired when we moved the target
in one direction but not the other.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.176
Now, why is that?

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.058
Remember when I said that the dragonfly

00:03:09.082 --> 00:03:11.136
had near 360-degree vision.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.656
Well, there's a section
of the eye called the fovea

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.576
and this is the part
that has the sharpest visual acuity,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.296
and you can think of it as its crosshairs.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.496
Remember when I told you the dragonfly had
individual precise control of its wings?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.576
When a dragonfly sees its prey,
it trains its crosshairs on it

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.976
and along its axons
it sends messages only to the neurons
