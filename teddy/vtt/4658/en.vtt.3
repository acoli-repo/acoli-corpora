00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.136
between the eyes and the wings,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.922
and to do that, we need
to anesthetize the dragonfly on ice

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:36.336
and make sure we protect its wings
so that we can release it afterwards.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.016
Now, the dragonfly's brain is made up
of specialized cells called neurons

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.216
and these neurons
are what allow the dragonfly

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.896
to see and move so quickly.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.976
The individual neurons form circuits
by connecting to each other

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.616
via long, tiny threads called axons

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.896
and the neurons communicate
over these axons using electricity.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.376
In the dragonfly, we're going to place
little metal wires, or electrodes,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.656
along the axon tracks,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.176
and this is what's really cool.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.216
In the dragonfly, there's only 16 neurons;
