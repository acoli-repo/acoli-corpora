00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.216
Oh, yeah!

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.456
JS: Yeah, it prefers that one.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.736
GG: Out of all the sizes,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.280
we found that the dragonfly responded
to smaller targets over larger ones.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.736
In other words, the dragonfly
was programmed to go after smaller flies

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.096
versus something much larger, like a bird.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.696
And as soon as it recognizes
something as prey,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.536
that poor little fly
only has seconds to live.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.136
Today we got to see
how the dragonfly's brain works

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.840
to make it a very efficient killer.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.176
And let's be thankful
that we didn't live 300 million years ago

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.080
when dragonflies were the size of cats.
