00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:02.889
When I wrote my memoir,

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.566
the publishers were really confused.

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:10.800
Was it about me as a child refugee,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.304
or as a woman who set up a high-tech
software company back in the 1960s,

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:18.380
one that went public

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.963
and eventually employed over 8,500 people?

00:00:22.963 --> 00:00:27.470
Or was it as a mother
of an autistic child?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.925
Or as a philanthropist that's
now given away serious money?
