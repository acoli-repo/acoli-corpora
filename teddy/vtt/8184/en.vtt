00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:03.796
What's the worst thing
we've ever done to the planet?

00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:06.236
The answer is tough to hear

00:00:06.276 --> 00:00:08.036
and many people recoil from it

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:12.516
because it conflicts
with some of our most cherished beliefs.

00:00:13.796 --> 00:00:15.036
Farming.

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:19.676
Farming is the greatest cause
of habitat destruction,

00:00:19.716 --> 00:00:21.516
the greatest cause of wildlife loss,

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:24.396
the world's greatest cause of extinction.

00:00:24.436 --> 00:00:29.836
It's caused roughly 80 percent
of the deforestation this century.
