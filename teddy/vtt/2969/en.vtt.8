00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.256
I don't like this path.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.536
Even if that reaches perfection,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.336
I see the beauty
in authenticity of making,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.840
and that's impossible without flaws.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.296
A digitally manipulated photograph

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.976
is not true for me.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.696
It doesn't capture anything real.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.839
It's not experienced, not motivating.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.816
It's like, instead of going traveling,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.240
you look at someone else's
travel photographs.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.216
What I find so exciting

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.696
is the ability to make people's dreams
of being someone else a reality.
