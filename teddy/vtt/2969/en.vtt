00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.656
I'm often asked

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.976
why I do art,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.936
what do I want to say
with my art photography,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.440
and what is the use of it?

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.016
Once in a while I start to worry

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.696
how to actually measure
the impact from the art

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.016
like we do with medicine or technology,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.160
where we can see the results
and calculate it.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.616
Then I would finally be able
to explain to my mother my art

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.055
with real numbers.
