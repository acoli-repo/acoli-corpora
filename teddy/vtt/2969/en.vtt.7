00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.256
when they believe
in being someone else entirely.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.816
In order to create
a new reality in its entirety,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.736
I physically create
every single thing in my work,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.736
sometimes from outfits to the stage.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.576
Because I work with analogues,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.696
and I don't make any digital
manipulations to my photographs,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.080
I need everything
to take place in reality,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.016
in spite of the fact that nowadays,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.320
digitally, you can create
pretty much everything.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.256
I don't like this path.
