with real numbers.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.416
But my art is so far from metrics,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.120
and moreover, my photography
is widely exposing the theme of escapism.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.776
My theory is that all of us

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.656
struggle sometimes to escape

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.456
in order to analyze our reality,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.720
appreciate it or change.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.896
I don't work with daily life as it is,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.256
and I'm not a documentary photographer
