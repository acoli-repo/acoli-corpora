Cloe's going to be our volunteer today.

00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:37.783
So over the past five years, we've moved
from being a research project at MIT

00:04:37.783 --> 00:04:38.939
to a company,

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:42.131
where my team has worked really hard
to make this technology work,

00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:44.540
as we like to say, in the wild.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.210
And we've also shrunk it so that
the core emotion engine

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.530
works on any mobile device
with a camera, like this iPad.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.316
So let's give this a try.

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:58.680
As you can see, the algorithm
has essentially found Cloe's face,

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.372
so it's this white bounding box,
