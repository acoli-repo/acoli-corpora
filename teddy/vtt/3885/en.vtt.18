so it auto-locks to prevent you
from binge eating. (Laughter)

00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:03.668
I would like that, yeah.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.595
What if, when I was in Cambridge,

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:07.908
I had access to my real-time
emotion stream,

00:09:07.908 --> 00:09:11.437
and I could share that with my family
back home in a very natural way,

00:09:11.437 --> 00:09:15.408
just like I would've if we were all
in the same room together?

00:09:15.408 --> 00:09:18.550
I think five years down the line,

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.887
all our devices are going
to have an emotion chip,

00:09:20.887 --> 00:09:24.951
and we won't remember what it was like
when we couldn't just frown at our device

00:09:24.951 --> 00:09:29.200
and our device would say, "Hmm,
you didn't like that, did you?"

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.961
Our biggest challenge is that there are
so many applications of this technology,
