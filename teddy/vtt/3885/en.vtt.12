00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:03.643
Try to remember what it was like
when Zayn left One Direction.

00:06:03.643 --> 00:06:05.153
(Laughter)

00:06:05.153 --> 00:06:09.495
Yeah, wrinkle your nose. Awesome.

00:06:09.495 --> 00:06:13.226
And the valence is actually quite
negative, so you must have been a big fan.

00:06:13.226 --> 00:06:15.926
So valence is how positive
or negative an experience is,

00:06:15.926 --> 00:06:18.712
and engagement is how
expressive she is as well.

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:22.126
So imagine if Cloe had access
to this real-time emotion stream,

00:06:22.126 --> 00:06:24.935
and she could share it
with anybody she wanted to.

00:06:24.935 --> 00:06:27.858
Thank you.

00:06:27.858 --> 00:06:32.479
