00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:32.703
I felt that all my emotions
disappeared in cyberspace.

00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:37.858
I was homesick, I was lonely,
and on some days I was actually crying,

00:01:37.858 --> 00:01:42.786
but all I had to communicate
these emotions was this.

00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:44.806
(Laughter)

00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:49.780
Today's technology
has lots of I.Q., but no E.Q.;

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.956
lots of cognitive intelligence,
but no emotional intelligence.

00:01:52.956 --> 00:01:55.153
So that got me thinking,

00:01:55.153 --> 00:01:58.777
what if our technology
could sense our emotions?

00:01:58.777 --> 00:02:02.853
What if our devices could sense
how we felt and reacted accordingly,
