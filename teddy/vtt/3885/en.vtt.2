00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:02.844
At Cambridge, thousands of miles
away from home,

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:06.257
I realized I was spending
more hours with my laptop

00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:08.486
than I did with any other human.

00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:13.339
Yet despite this intimacy, my laptop
had absolutely no idea how I was feeling.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:16.550
It had no idea if I was happy,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.538
having a bad day, or stressed, confused,

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:22.460
and so that got frustrating.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.831
Even worse, as I communicated
online with my family back home,

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:32.703
I felt that all my emotions
disappeared in cyberspace.
