00:05:28.477 --> 00:05:31.439
And then eyebrow raised,
indicator of surprise.

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.688
Brow furrow, which is
an indicator of confusion.

00:05:35.688 --> 00:05:39.695
Frown. Yes, perfect.

00:05:39.695 --> 00:05:43.188
So these are all the different
action units. There's many more of them.

00:05:43.188 --> 00:05:45.220
This is just a slimmed-down demo.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.368
But we call each reading
an emotion data point,

00:05:48.368 --> 00:05:51.337
and then they can fire together
to portray different emotions.

00:05:51.337 --> 00:05:55.990
So on the right side of the demo --
look like you're happy.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.444
So that's joy. Joy fires up.

00:05:57.444 --> 00:05:59.371
And then give me a disgust face.

00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:03.643
Try to remember what it was like
when Zayn left One Direction.
