WEBVTT

00:06:57.865 --> 00:07:00.100
and we can do it at this scale.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.277
So what have we learned to date?

00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:05.388
Gender.

00:07:05.388 --> 00:07:09.034
Our data confirms something
that you might suspect.

00:07:09.034 --> 00:07:10.891
Women are more expressive than men.

00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:13.574
Not only do they smile more,
their smiles last longer,

00:07:13.574 --> 00:07:16.478
and we can now really quantify
what it is that men and women

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.614
respond to differently.

00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:20.904
Let's do culture: So in the United States,

00:07:20.904 --> 00:07:24.108
women are 40 percent
more expressive than men,

00:07:24.108 --> 00:07:27.753
but curiously, we don't see any difference
in the U.K. between men and women.

00:07:27.753 --> 00:07:30.259
(Laughter)
