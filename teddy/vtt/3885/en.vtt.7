Sometimes a smirk
can make you become famous.

00:03:33.136 --> 00:03:35.960
But seriously, it's important
for a computer to be able

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.815
to tell the difference
between the two expressions.

00:03:38.815 --> 00:03:40.627
So how do we do that?

00:03:40.627 --> 00:03:42.414
We give our algorithms

00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:46.524
tens of thousands of examples
of people we know to be smiling,

00:03:46.524 --> 00:03:49.589
from different ethnicities, ages, genders,

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:52.400
and we do the same for smirks.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.954
And then, using deep learning,

00:03:53.954 --> 00:03:56.810
the algorithm looks for all these
textures and wrinkles

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.390
and shape changes on our face,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.592
and basically learns that all smiles
have common characteristics,
