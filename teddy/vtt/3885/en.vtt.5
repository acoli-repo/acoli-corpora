empathy and curiosity.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:37.907
In emotion science, we call each
facial muscle movement an action unit.

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:40.832
So for example, action unit 12,

00:02:40.832 --> 00:02:42.870
it's not a Hollywood blockbuster,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.312
it is actually a lip corner pull,
which is the main component of a smile.

00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:49.300
Try it everybody. Let's get
some smiles going on.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.954
Another example is action unit 4.
It's the brow furrow.

00:02:51.954 --> 00:02:54.192
It's when you draw your eyebrows together

00:02:54.192 --> 00:02:56.459
and you create all
these textures and wrinkles.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.754
We don't like them, but it's
a strong indicator of a negative emotion.
