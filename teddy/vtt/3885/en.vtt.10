00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.372
so it's this white bounding box,

00:05:00.372 --> 00:05:02.943
and it's tracking the main
feature points on her face,

00:05:02.943 --> 00:05:05.799
so her eyebrows, her eyes,
her mouth and her nose.

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:08.786
The question is,
can it recognize her expression?

00:05:08.786 --> 00:05:10.457
So we're going to test the machine.

00:05:10.457 --> 00:05:14.643
So first of all, give me your poker face.
Yep, awesome. (Laughter)

00:05:14.643 --> 00:05:17.456
And then as she smiles,
this is a genuine smile, it's great.

00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:19.756
So you can see the green bar
go up as she smiles.

00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:20.978
Now that was a big smile.

00:05:20.978 --> 00:05:24.021
Can you try a subtle smile
to see if the computer can recognize?

00:05:24.021 --> 00:05:26.352
It does recognize subtle smiles as well.

00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:28.477
We've worked really hard
to make that happen.

00:05:28.477 --> 00:05:31.439
And then eyebrow raised,
indicator of surprise.
