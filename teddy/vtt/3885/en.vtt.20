00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:01.930
And I invite you all to be
part of the conversation.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.484
The more people who know
about this technology,

00:10:04.484 --> 00:10:07.661
the more we can all have a voice
in how it's being used.

00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:13.655
So as more and more
of our lives become digital,

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:17.153
we are fighting a losing battle
trying to curb our usage of devices

00:10:17.153 --> 00:10:19.382
in order to reclaim our emotions.

00:10:20.622 --> 00:10:24.536
So what I'm trying to do instead
is to bring emotions into our technology

00:10:24.536 --> 00:10:26.765
and make our technologies more responsive.

00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:29.435
So I want those devices
that have separated us

00:10:29.435 --> 00:10:31.897
to bring us back together.
