00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.754
We don't like them, but it's
a strong indicator of a negative emotion.

00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:02.960
So we have about 45 of these action units,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.350
and they combine to express
hundreds of emotions.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.251
Teaching a computer to read
these facial emotions is hard,

00:03:10.251 --> 00:03:13.223
because these action units,
they can be fast, they're subtle,

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:15.777
and they combine in many different ways.

00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:19.515
So take, for example,
the smile and the smirk.

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:23.268
They look somewhat similar,
but they mean very different things.

00:03:23.268 --> 00:03:24.986
(Laughter)

00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:27.990
So the smile is positive,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.260
a smirk is often negative.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.136
Sometimes a smirk
can make you become famous.
