00:06:27.858 --> 00:06:32.479
(Applause)

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:39.019
So, so far, we have amassed
12 billion of these emotion data points.

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:41.630
It's the largest emotion
database in the world.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.593
We've collected it
from 2.9 million face videos,

00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:47.193
people who have agreed
to share their emotions with us,

00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:50.398
and from 75 countries around the world.

00:06:50.398 --> 00:06:52.113
It's growing every day.

00:06:52.603 --> 00:06:54.670
It blows my mind away

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.865
that we can now quantify something
as personal as our emotions,

00:06:57.865 --> 00:07:00.100
and we can do it at this scale.
