00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.592
and basically learns that all smiles
have common characteristics,

00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:05.773
all smirks have subtly
different characteristics.

00:04:05.773 --> 00:04:08.141
And the next time it sees a new face,

00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.440
it essentially learns that

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.473
this face has the same
characteristics of a smile,

00:04:13.473 --> 00:04:17.751
and it says, "Aha, I recognize this.
This is a smile expression."

00:04:18.381 --> 00:04:21.181
So the best way to demonstrate
how this technology works

00:04:21.181 --> 00:04:23.317
is to try a live demo,

00:04:23.317 --> 00:04:27.230
so I need a volunteer,
preferably somebody with a face.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.564
(Laughter)

00:04:29.564 --> 00:04:32.335
Cloe's going to be our volunteer today.
