on the autism spectrum interpret emotion,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.458
something that they really struggle with.

00:08:35.918 --> 00:08:38.777
In education, imagine
if your learning apps

00:08:38.777 --> 00:08:41.587
sense that you're confused and slow down,

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:43.444
or that you're bored, so it's sped up,

00:08:43.444 --> 00:08:46.413
just like a great teacher
would in a classroom.

00:08:47.043 --> 00:08:49.644
What if your wristwatch tracked your mood,

00:08:49.644 --> 00:08:52.337
or your car sensed that you're tired,

00:08:52.337 --> 00:08:54.885
or perhaps your fridge
knows that you're stressed,

00:08:54.885 --> 00:09:00.951
so it auto-locks to prevent you
from binge eating. (Laughter)
