What if our devices could sense
how we felt and reacted accordingly,

00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:05.866
just the way an emotionally
intelligent friend would?

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:10.230
Those questions led me and my team

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.607
to create technologies that can read
and respond to our emotions,

00:02:14.607 --> 00:02:17.697
and our starting point was the human face.

00:02:18.577 --> 00:02:21.750
So our human face happens to be
one of the most powerful channels

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.766
that we all use to communicate
social and emotional states,

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:28.776
everything from enjoyment, surprise,

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:32.979
empathy and curiosity.
