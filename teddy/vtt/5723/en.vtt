00:00:01.163 --> 00:00:03.912
The last day of school was barely school.

00:00:04.413 --> 00:00:06.079
I fielded complicated questions

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:09.454
from students who braved
public transit to attend,

00:00:09.454 --> 00:00:12.496
I wiped down every desk between classes

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:14.204
and reminded myself to breathe.

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.954
I held it together so hard
when students said goodbye,

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:20.913
with a strange,
scared weight on that word.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.163
Colleagues and I
exchanged glances in the hallway,

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:26.163
at once tense and comforting.

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.246
We were in this together,

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:30.829
even if we were about to part ways
for several months.
