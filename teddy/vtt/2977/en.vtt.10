00:04:56.282 --> 00:05:00.188
is that the machines are,
in a limited sense, beginning to think.

00:05:00.212 --> 00:05:02.669
And by this, I don't mean human-level AI,

00:05:02.693 --> 00:05:05.629
or science fiction
artificial intelligence;

00:05:05.653 --> 00:05:10.115
I simply mean that machines and algorithms
are making decisions.

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.999
They're solving problems,
and most importantly, they're learning.

00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:17.326
In fact, if there's one technology
that is truly central to this

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.427
and has really become
the driving force behind this,

00:05:20.451 --> 00:05:21.623
it's machine learning,

00:05:21.647 --> 00:05:24.367
which is just becoming
this incredibly powerful,

00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:27.029
disruptive, scalable technology.

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:30.030
One of the best examples
I've seen of that recently
