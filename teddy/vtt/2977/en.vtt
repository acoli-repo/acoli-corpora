00:00:00.787 --> 00:00:03.635
I'm going to begin with a scary question:

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.409
Are we headed toward
a future without jobs?

00:00:06.987 --> 00:00:09.056
The remarkable progress that we're seeing

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.941
in technologies like self-driving cars

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:14.030
has led to an explosion
of interest in this question,

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:16.204
but because it's something
that's been asked

00:00:16.228 --> 00:00:17.484
so many times in the past,

00:00:17.508 --> 00:00:19.348
maybe what we should really be asking

00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:22.272
is whether this time is really different.

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:26.213
The fear that automation
might displace workers

00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:28.354
and potentially lead
to lots of unemployment

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:32.266
goes back at a minimum 200 years
to the Luddite revolts in England.
