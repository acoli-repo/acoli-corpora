00:13:29.174 --> 00:13:32.985
for the way we structure
our society and our economy,

00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:36.451
And I think eventually, it's going to go
beyond simply being an option,

00:13:36.475 --> 00:13:38.376
and it's going to become an imperative.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.222
The reason, of course,
is that all of this is going to put

00:13:41.246 --> 00:13:43.260
such a degree of stress on our society,

00:13:43.284 --> 00:13:45.798
and also because jobs are that mechanism

00:13:45.822 --> 00:13:47.787
that gets purchasing power to consumers

00:13:47.811 --> 00:13:50.327
so they can then drive the economy.

00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:53.898
If, in fact, that mechanism
begins to erode in the future,

00:13:53.922 --> 00:13:56.737
then we're going to need to replace
it with something else

00:13:56.761 --> 00:13:58.324
or we're going to face the risk

00:13:58.348 --> 00:14:00.915
that our whole system simply
may not be sustainable.
