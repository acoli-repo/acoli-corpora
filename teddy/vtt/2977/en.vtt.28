that our whole system simply

But the bottom line here
is that I really think

00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:05.781
that solving these problems,

00:14:05.805 --> 00:14:09.205
and especially finding a way
to build a future economy

00:14:09.229 --> 00:14:11.242
that works for everyone,

00:14:11.266 --> 00:14:13.127
at every level of our society,

00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:16.691
is going to be one of the most important
challenges that we all face

00:14:16.715 --> 00:14:18.758
in the coming years and decades.

00:14:18.782 --> 00:14:20.030
Thank you very much.
