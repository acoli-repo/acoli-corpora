00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.247
And we know that these jobs
might be in different industries,

00:07:00.271 --> 00:07:03.644
they might be in different occupations
and at different skill levels,

00:07:03.668 --> 00:07:05.878
but because they are innately predictable,

00:07:05.902 --> 00:07:09.029
we know they're probably at some point
going to be susceptible

00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:10.230
to machine learning,

00:07:10.254 --> 00:07:11.673
and therefore, to automation.

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:13.794
And make no mistake --
that's a lot of jobs.

00:07:13.818 --> 00:07:16.497
That's probably something
on the order of roughly half

00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:18.088
the jobs in the economy.

00:07:18.112 --> 00:07:20.271
But then on the other side of that line,

00:07:20.295 --> 00:07:24.366
we have all the jobs
that require some capability

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.762
that we perceive as being uniquely human,

00:07:26.786 --> 00:07:29.009
and these are the jobs
that we think are safe.

00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:31.298
Now, based on what I know
about the game of Go,
