00:03:55.641 --> 00:04:00.050
The first thing is that we have seen
this ongoing process

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:01.962
of exponential acceleration.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.515
I know you all know about Moore's law,

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:06.835
but in fact, it's more
broad-based than that;

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.009
it extends in many cases,
for example, to software,

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:13.033
it extends to communications,
bandwidth and so forth.

00:04:13.057 --> 00:04:15.041
But the really key thing to understand

00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:18.936
is that this acceleration has now
been going on for a really long time.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.885
In fact, it's been going on for decades.

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.665
If you measure from the late 1950s,

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:26.114
when the first integrated
circuits were fabricated,

00:04:26.138 --> 00:04:30.923
we've seen something on the order
of 30 doublings in computational power
