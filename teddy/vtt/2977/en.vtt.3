00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:31.895
It may wipe out whole occupations
and types of work.

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:33.527
But at the same time, of course,

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.902
progress is going to lead
to entirely new things.

00:01:35.926 --> 00:01:38.888
So there will be new industries
that will arise in the future,

00:01:38.912 --> 00:01:41.770
and those industries, of course,
will have to hire people.

00:01:41.794 --> 00:01:44.032
There'll be new kinds of work
that will appear,

00:01:44.056 --> 00:01:47.266
and those might be things that today
we can't really even imagine.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.037
And that has been the story so far,

00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:50.555
and it's been a positive story.

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:54.420
It turns out that the new jobs
that have been created

00:01:54.444 --> 00:01:56.914
have generally been
a lot better than the old ones.

00:01:56.938 --> 00:01:59.594
They have, for example,
been more engaging.

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:03.047
They've been in safer,
more comfortable work environments,
