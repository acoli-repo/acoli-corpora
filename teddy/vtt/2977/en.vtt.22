00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:01.232
And the best, more straightforward
way I know to do that

00:11:01.256 --> 00:11:04.824
is some kind of a guaranteed income
or universal basic income.

00:11:04.848 --> 00:11:07.336
Now, basic income is becoming
a very important idea.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.499
It's getting a lot
of traction and attention,

00:11:09.523 --> 00:11:11.796
there are a lot of important
pilot projects

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.995
and experiments going on
throughout the world.

00:11:14.628 --> 00:11:17.828
My own view is that a basic income
is not a panacea;

00:11:17.852 --> 00:11:20.384
it's not necessarily
a plug-and-play solution,

00:11:20.408 --> 00:11:22.043
but rather, it's a place to start.

00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:24.849
It's an idea that we can
build on and refine.

00:11:24.873 --> 00:11:27.690
For example, one thing that I have
written quite a lot about

00:11:27.714 --> 00:11:32.306
is the possibility of incorporating
explicit incentives into a basic income.
