00:00:57.903 --> 00:01:01.005
because industrial automation
was going to put millions of people

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:02.181
out of work.

00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:05.862
Now, that report was delivered
to President Lyndon Johnson

00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:07.687
in March of 1964.

00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:09.927
So that's now over 50 years,

00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:12.009
and, of course, that
hasn't really happened.

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:14.177
And that's been the story again and again.

00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:16.310
This alarm has been raised repeatedly,

00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:18.347
but it's always been a false alarm.

00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:20.180
And because it's been a false alarm,

00:01:20.204 --> 00:01:23.011
it's led to a very conventional way
of thinking about this.

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:25.567
And that says essentially that yes,

00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:28.139
technology may devastate
entire industries.

00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:31.895
It may wipe out whole occupations
and types of work.
