00:09:59.017 --> 00:10:02.189
and the reason, of course,
is that there is no market

00:10:02.213 --> 00:10:04.999
for him to scale
his incredible talents across.

00:10:05.023 --> 00:10:08.493
So access to this market
is really critical to us as individuals,

00:10:08.517 --> 00:10:12.539
and also to the entire system
in terms of it being sustainable.

00:10:13.063 --> 00:10:16.907
So the question then becomes:
What exactly could we do about this?

00:10:17.285 --> 00:10:20.517
And I think you can view this
through a very utopian framework.

00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:23.184
You can imagine a future
where we all have to work less,

00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:26.209
we have more time for leisure,

00:10:26.233 --> 00:10:28.161
more time to spend with our families,

00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:31.440
more time to do things that we find
genuinely rewarding
