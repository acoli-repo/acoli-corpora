00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:30.030
One of the best examples
I've seen of that recently

00:05:30.054 --> 00:05:32.805
was what Google's DeepMind
division was able to do

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:34.382
with its AlphaGo system.

00:05:34.406 --> 00:05:38.706
Now, this is the system that was able
to beat the best player in the world

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.709
at the ancient game of Go.

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:41.883
Now, at least to me,

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:45.024
there are two things that really
stand out about the game of Go.

00:05:45.048 --> 00:05:47.344
One is that as you're playing the game,

00:05:47.368 --> 00:05:50.234
the number of configurations
that the board can be in

00:05:50.258 --> 00:05:51.669
is essentially infinite.

00:05:51.693 --> 00:05:55.526
There are actually more possibilities
than there are atoms in the universe.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.164
So what that means is,

00:05:57.188 --> 00:06:00.785
you're never going to be able to build
a computer to win at the game of Go
