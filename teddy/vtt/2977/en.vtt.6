People, on the other hand,
are intelligent;

00:03:00.228 --> 00:03:02.013
we can learn, we can adapt.

00:03:02.037 --> 00:03:03.201
And in theory,

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:06.352
that ought to mean that we can
always find something new to do,

00:03:06.376 --> 00:03:09.682
and that we can always remain
relevant to the future economy.

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:12.143
But here's the really
critical thing to understand.

And what that really means

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:29.706
is that technology is finally
beginning to encroach

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.579
on that fundamental human capability --
