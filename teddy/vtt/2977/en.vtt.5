00:02:28.393 --> 00:02:31.143
So I can ask a very provocative question:

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:34.602
Is it possible that at some
point in the future,

00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:39.254
a significant fraction of the human
workforce is going to be made redundant

00:02:39.278 --> 00:02:40.980
in the way that horses were?

00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:44.485
Now, you might have a very visceral,
reflexive reaction to that.

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:46.156
You might say, "That's absurd.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.849
How can you possibly compare
human beings to horses?"

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:52.206
Horses, of course, are very limited,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.123
and when cars and trucks
and tractors came along,

00:02:55.147 --> 00:02:57.192
horses really had nowhere else to turn.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.204
People, on the other hand,
are intelligent;
