They've been in safer,
more comfortable work environments,

00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:04.751
and, of course, they've paid more.

00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:06.640
So it has been a positive story.

00:02:06.664 --> 00:02:08.872
That's the way things
have played out so far.

00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:12.240
But there is one particular
class of worker

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:14.516
for whom the story

decimated their work,

00:02:20.157 --> 00:02:23.371
and it really hasn't created
any new opportunities at all.

00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:25.590
And these workers, of course,

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:26.902
are horses.

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:28.369
(Laughter)

00:02:28.393 --> 00:02:31.143
So I can ask a very provocative question:
