00:11:56.776 --> 00:12:02.092
Instead, let's pay people who graduate
from high school somewhat more

00:12:02.116 --> 00:12:03.812
than those who simply drop out.

00:12:04.329 --> 00:12:07.807
And we can take that idea of building
incentives into a basic income,

00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:09.498
and maybe extend it to other areas.

00:12:09.522 --> 00:12:13.099
For example, we might create
an incentive to work in the community

00:12:13.123 --> 00:12:14.281
to help others,

00:12:14.305 --> 00:12:17.369
or perhaps to do positive
things for the environment,

00:12:17.393 --> 00:12:18.563
and so forth.

00:12:18.587 --> 00:12:21.598
So by incorporating incentives
into a basic income,

00:12:21.622 --> 00:12:23.251
we might actually improve it,

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.901
and also, perhaps, take at least
a couple of steps

00:12:25.925 --> 00:12:28.350
towards solving another problem

00:12:28.374 --> 00:12:31.318
that I think we're quite possibly
going to face in the future,
