00:04:26.138 --> 00:04:30.923
we've seen something on the order
of 30 doublings in computational power

00:04:30.947 --> 00:04:32.103
since then.

00:04:32.127 --> 00:04:35.815
That's just an extraordinary number
of times to double any quantity,

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.079
and what it really means

00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:39.627
is that we're now at a point
where we're going to see

00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:42.062
just an extraordinary amount
of absolute progress,

00:04:42.086 --> 00:04:45.061
and, of course, things are going
to continue to also accelerate

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:46.244
from this point.

00:04:46.268 --> 00:04:48.808
So as we look forward
to the coming years and decades,

00:04:48.832 --> 00:04:51.170
I think that means
that we're going to see things

00:04:51.194 --> 00:04:52.867
that we're really not prepared for.

00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:54.968
We're going to see things
that astonish us.

00:04:54.992 --> 00:04:56.258
The second key thing

00:04:56.282 --> 00:05:00.188
is that the machines are,
in a limited sense, beginning to think.
