00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:02.238
Let's play a game.

00:00:02.825 --> 00:00:05.701
Imagine that you are in Las Vegas,

00:00:05.725 --> 00:00:07.076
in a casino,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.116
and you decide to play a game
on one of the casino's computers,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.726
just like you might play
solitaire or chess.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.670
The computer can make moves
in the game, just like a human player.

00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:20.138
This is a coin game.

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:23.787
It starts with a coin showing heads,

00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:25.612
and the computer will play first.

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:28.492
It can choose to flip the coin or not,

00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:30.325
but you don't get to see the outcome.
