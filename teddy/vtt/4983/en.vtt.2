00:00:56.578 --> 00:01:00.936
that keeps the internet humming,
called integrated photonics.

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:06.006
To understand LIDAR, it helps to start 
with a related technology— radar.

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:07.165
In aviation,

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:11.866
radar antennas launch pulses 
of radio or microwaves at planes

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:16.620
to learn their locations by timing 
how long the beams take to bounce back.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.593
That’s a limited way of seeing, though,

00:01:18.593 --> 00:01:22.679
because the large beam-size 
can’t visualize fine details.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.127
In contrast, a self-driving car’s 
LIDAR system,

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:28.634
which stands for Light Detection 
and Ranging,

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:32.190
uses a narrow invisible infrared laser.
