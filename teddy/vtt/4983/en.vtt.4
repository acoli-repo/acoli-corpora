00:01:55.853 --> 00:02:00.721
while the next may travel to the tip 
of one antler before bouncing back.

00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:04.278
Measuring how much longer 
the second pulse takes to return

00:02:04.278 --> 00:02:06.882
provides data about the antler’s shape.

00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:13.192
With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system
quickly renders a detailed profile.

00:02:13.192 --> 00:02:18.557
The most obvious way to create a pulse 
of light is to switch a laser on and off.

00:02:18.557 --> 00:02:23.428
But this makes a laser unstable and 
affects the precise timing of its pulses,

00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:25.669
which limits depth resolution.

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.044
Better to leave it on,

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:33.031
and use something else to periodically 
block the light reliably and rapidly.
