00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:02.925
The first generation of automobile LIDAR 
has relied on complex spinning assemblies

00:04:02.925 --> 00:04:05.777
that scan from rooftops or hoods.

00:04:05.777 --> 00:04:07.494
With integrated photonics,

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:12.508
modulators and detectors are being shrunk 
to less than a tenth of a millimeter,

00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:17.837
and packed into tiny chips that’ll one 
day fit inside a car’s lights.

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:21.806
These chips will also include a clever 
variation on the modulator

00:04:21.806 --> 00:04:27.275
to help do away with moving parts 
and scan at rapid speeds.

00:04:27.275 --> 00:04:31.097
By slowing the light in a modulator 
arm only a tiny bit,
