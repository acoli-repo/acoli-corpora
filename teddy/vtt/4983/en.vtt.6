00:02:57.613 --> 00:03:01.550
as the ripples spread and overlap, 
a pattern forms.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.464
In some places, wave peaks add 
up to become very large;

00:03:05.464 --> 00:03:08.450
in other places, they completely 
cancel out.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.517
The Mach-Zehnder modulator 
does something similar.

00:03:11.517 --> 00:03:17.292
It splits waves of light along two 
parallel arms and eventually rejoins them.

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:20.784
If the light is slowed down and 
delayed in one arm,

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:25.703
the waves recombine out of sync and 
cancel, blocking the light.

00:03:25.703 --> 00:03:28.335
By toggling this delay in one arm,

00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:33.606
the modulator acts like an on/off switch, 
emitting pulses of light.
