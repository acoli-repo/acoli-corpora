00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:34.208
so that its control algorithms 
can plot the safest course.

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:35.762
With no human at the wheel,

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:40.547
the car needs smart eyes, sensors 
that’ll resolve these details—

00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:43.898
no matter the environment, 
weather, or how dark it is—

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:45.920
all in a split-second.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.159
That’s a tall order, but there’s a 
solution that partners two things:

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.849
a special kind of laser-based probe 
called LIDAR,

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:56.578
and a miniature version of 
the communications technology

00:00:56.578 --> 00:01:00.936
that keeps the internet humming,
called integrated photonics.
