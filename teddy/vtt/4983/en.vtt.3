00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:32.190
uses a narrow invisible infrared laser.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.660
It can image features as small as the 
button on a pedestrian’s shirt

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.123
across the street.

00:01:38.123 --> 00:01:42.483
But how do we determine the shape, 
or depth, of these features?

00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:48.267
LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser 
pulses to give depth resolution.

00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:50.746
Take the moose on the country road.

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:55.853
As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse 
scatters off the base of its antlers,

00:01:55.853 --> 00:02:00.721
while the next may travel to the tip 
of one antler before bouncing back.
