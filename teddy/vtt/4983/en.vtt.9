00:04:27.275 --> 00:04:31.097
By slowing the light in a modulator 
arm only a tiny bit,

00:04:31.097 --> 00:04:36.208
this additional device will act more 
like a dimmer than an on/off switch.

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:40.708
If an array of many such arms, each with 
a tiny controlled delay,

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:44.786
is stacked in parallel, something novel 
can be designed:

00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:47.492
a steerable laser beam.

00:04:47.492 --> 00:04:48.848
From their new vantage,

00:04:48.848 --> 00:04:52.248
these smart eyes will probe and 
see more thoroughly

00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:54.681
than anything nature could’ve imagined—

00:04:54.681 --> 00:04:57.544
and help navigate any number 
of obstacles.

00:04:57.544 --> 00:05:00.098
All without anyone breaking a sweat—
