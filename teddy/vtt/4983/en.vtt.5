00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:33.031
and use something else to periodically 
block the light reliably and rapidly.

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:35.987
That’s where integrated photonics come in.

00:02:35.987 --> 00:02:37.829
The digital data of the internet

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.051
is carried by precision-timed 
pulses of light,

00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:44.473
some as short as a hundred picoseconds.

00:02:44.473 --> 00:02:49.104
One way to create these pulses is 
with a Mach-Zehnder modulator.

00:02:49.104 --> 00:02:52.865
This device takes advantage of a 
particular wave property,

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:54.658
called interference.

00:02:54.658 --> 00:02:57.613
Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond:

00:02:57.613 --> 00:03:01.550
as the ripples spread and overlap, 
a pattern forms.
