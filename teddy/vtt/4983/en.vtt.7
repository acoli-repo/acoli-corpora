00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:33.606
the modulator acts like an on/off switch, 
emitting pulses of light.

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:36.380
A light pulse lasting a hundred 
picoseconds

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.790
leads to a depth resolution of a 
few centimeters,

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.303
but tomorrow’s cars will need 
to see better than that.

00:03:43.303 --> 00:03:47.595
By pairing the modulator with a super-
sensitive, fast-acting light detector,

00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:50.878
the resolution can be refined 
to a millimeter.

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:52.781
That’s more than a hundred times better 


00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:57.337
than what we can make out with 
20/20 vision, from across a street.

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:02.925
The first generation of automobile LIDAR 
has relied on complex spinning assemblies
