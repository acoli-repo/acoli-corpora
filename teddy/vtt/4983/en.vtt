00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:15.132
It’s late, pitch dark, and a self-driving 
car winds down a narrow country road.

00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:18.724
Suddenly, three hazards appear 
at the same time.

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:20.846
What happens next?

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:24.043
Before it can navigate this 
onslaught of obstacles,

00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:26.083
the car has to detect them—

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:29.846
gleaning enough information about 
their size, shape, and position,

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:34.208
so that its control algorithms 
can plot the safest course.
