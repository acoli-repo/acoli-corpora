I've got a great idea
that's going to change the world.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.174
It's fantastic, it's going
to blow your mind.

00:00:05.198 --> 00:00:06.599
It's my beautiful baby.

00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:09.052
Here's the thing:
everybody loves a beautiful baby.

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:11.017
I mean, I was a beautiful baby.

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:13.517
Here's me and my dad
a couple days after I was born.

00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:15.180
So in the world of product design,

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:17.572
the beautiful baby's like the concept car.

00:00:17.596 --> 00:00:19.482
It's the knockout.

00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:22.645
You see it and you go, "Oh, my God.
I'd buy that in a second!"

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.040
So why is it that this year's new cars

00:00:25.064 --> 00:00:28.328
look pretty much exactly
like last year's new cars?

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:30.124
(Laughter)
