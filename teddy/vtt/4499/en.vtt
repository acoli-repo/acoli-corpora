Hello. My name is Birke Baehr,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I'm 11 years old.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
First of all, I would like to say

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
all the marketing and advertising

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
on TV, at public schools

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and pretty much everywhere else you look.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It seems to me like corporations

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
are always trying to get kids, like me,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to get their parents to buy stuff

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that really isn't good for us or the planet.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Little kids, especially,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
are attracted by colorful packaging
