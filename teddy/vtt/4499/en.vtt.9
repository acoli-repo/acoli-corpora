00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
My little cousin told his dad

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
one kid at a time.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So next time you're at the grocery store, think local,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
choose organic, know your farmer and know your food.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Thank you.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
