00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
where the meat I eat comes from.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I want you to know that I believe

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
if they know more about it and where it really comes from.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
in every community popping up.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I want you to know that me, my brother and sister

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
actually like eating baked kale chips.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I try to share this everywhere I go.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Not too long ago,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
or the sugarcoated flakes --

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.
