They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
from growing the same crop over and over again.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
like pesticides and herbicides,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to kill weeds and bugs.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or run off into our waterways,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
poisoning our water too.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
so it can travel thousands of miles

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
from where it's grown to the supermarkets.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So I ask myself,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
how can I change? How can I change these things?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is what I found out.
