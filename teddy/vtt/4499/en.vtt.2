First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to do something not intended by nature --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
like taking the DNA of a fish

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but this is just creepy.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
(Laughter)

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The seeds are then planted, then grown.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The food they produce have been proven

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and people have been eating food produced this way

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
since the 1990s.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And most folks don't even know they exist.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn
