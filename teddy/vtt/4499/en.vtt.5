00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
how can I change? How can I change these things?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is what I found out.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I discovered that there's a movement for a better way.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now a while back,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I wanted to be an NFL football player.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.000
(Applause)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Thank you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
because he grows against the system.
