00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Yet almost all the corn we eat

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
has been altered genetically in some way.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And let me tell you,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
corn is in everything.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
called CAFOS.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
(Laughter)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
made from fossil fuels

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients
