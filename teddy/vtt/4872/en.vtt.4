00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:00.332
but in largely unsurprising ways.

00:02:00.332 --> 00:02:03.849
Leaks, mold, bug 
and rodent infestations -

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.326
all the usual enemies of the homeowner-

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.469
now go uncontested.

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:14.269
Within 75 years, most houses' 
supporting beams have rotted and sagged,

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.397
and the resulting collapsed heap 
is now home to local rodents and lizards.

00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:23.315
But in this post-human world, 
“local” has a new meaning.

00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:26.097
Our cities are full of imported plants,

00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:29.580
which now run wild across 
their adopted homes.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.652
Water hyacinth coat the waterways 
of Shanghai in a thick green carpet.
