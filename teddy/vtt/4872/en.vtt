Human beings are everywhere.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.126
With settlements on every continent,

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:14.870
we can be found in the most isolated 
corners of Earthâ€™s jungles,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.711
oceans,

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:17.010
and tundras.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.219

most scientists believe

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:24.992
humanity has left a permanent mark 
on Earthâ€™s geological record.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:32.280
So what would happen if suddenly, 
every human on Earth disappeared?
