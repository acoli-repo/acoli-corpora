00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:32.280
So what would happen if suddenly, 
every human on Earth disappeared?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.957
With no one maintaining them, some
of our creations backfire immediately.

00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:40.800
Hours after we disappear,
oil refineries malfunction,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.536
producing month-long blazes at
plants like the ones in western India,

00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:47.124
the southern United States,

00:00:47.124 --> 00:00:48.948
and South Korea.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:52.457
In underground rail systems 
like those in London,

00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:53.409
Moscow,

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.634
and New York City,

00:00:54.634 --> 00:01:00.525
hundreds of drainage pumps are abandoned,
flooding the tunnels in just three days.
