Conversely, the reduced light pollution 
saves over a billion birds each year

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:43.224
whose migrations were disrupted 
by blinking communication tower lights

00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:45.424
and high-tension wires.

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:50.722
And mosquitos multiply endlessly in one
of their favorite manmade nurseries –

00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:55.111
rubber tires, which last 
for almost a thousand years.

00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:57.560
