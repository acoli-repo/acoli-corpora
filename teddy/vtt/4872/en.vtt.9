00:04:25.368 --> 00:04:30.173
America’s Mt. Rushmore 
survives for 7.2 million years.

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:33.432
The chemical composition 
of our bronze sculptures

00:04:33.432 --> 00:04:36.703
keeps them recognizable 
for over 10 million.

00:04:36.703 --> 00:04:38.485
And buried deep underground,

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:41.310
the remnants of cities 
built on floodplains

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.504
have been preserved in time 
as a kind of technofossil.

00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:49.960
Eventually, these traces, too, 
will be wiped from the planet’s surface.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.236
Humanity hasn’t always been here, 
and we won’t be here forever.

00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:56.527
But by investigating the world without us,

00:04:56.527 --> 00:05:00.318
perhaps we can learn more 
about the world we live in now.
