00:02:59.823 --> 00:03:04.134
Animals follow the unchecked 
spread of native and non-native plants,

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:08.788
venturing into new habitats 
with the help of our leftover bridges.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:13.486
In general, our infrastructure 
saves some animals and dooms others.

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:17.320
Cockroaches continue to thrive 
in their native tropical habitats,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.315
but without our heating systems,

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:24.805
their urban cousins likely freeze
and die out in just two winters.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:28.902
And most domesticated animals 
are unable to survive without us –

00:03:28.902 --> 00:03:33.824
save for a handful of resourceful pigs, 
dogs, and feral housecats.
