00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.811
Earth’s climate slowly recovers 
from millennia of human impact.

00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.047
Within 35,000 years,

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:07.394
the plant cycle removes
the last traces of lead

00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:10.889
left by the Industrial Revolution 
from Earth’s soil,

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.285
and it may take 
up to 65,000 years beyond that

00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:17.838
for CO2 to return pre-human levels.

00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:22.807
But even after several million years,
humanity’s legacy lives on.

00:04:22.807 --> 00:04:25.368
Carved in unyielding granite,

00:04:25.368 --> 00:04:30.173
America’s Mt. Rushmore 
survives for 7.2 million years.
