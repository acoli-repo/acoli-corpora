00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:31.694
the cycle of seasons freezes 
and thaws these waterways,

00:01:31.694 --> 00:01:34.918
cracking pavement 
and concrete foundations.

00:01:34.918 --> 00:01:38.661
Leaking pipes cause the same reaction 
in concrete buildings,

00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:44.295
and within 200 winters, most skyscrapers 
buckle and tumble down.

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:47.275
In cities built in river deltas 
like Houston,

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:50.495
these buildings 
eventually wash away completely -

00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:54.214
filling nearby tributaries 
with crushed concrete.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.705
Rural and suburban areas 
decay more slowly,

00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:00.332
but in largely unsurprising ways.
