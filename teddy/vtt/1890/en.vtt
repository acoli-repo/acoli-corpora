00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.749
Let me introduce you to

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:04.652
something I've been working on.

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:06.463
It's what the Victorian illusionists

00:00:06.463 --> 00:00:10.909
would have described as a mechanical marvel,

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:12.392
an automaton,

00:00:12.392 --> 00:00:14.355
a thinking machine.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:16.605
Say hello to EDI.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:18.972

00:00:18.972 --> 00:00:22.943
EDI, EDI.

00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:25.820
These mechanical performers were popular

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.280
throughout Europe.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.980
Audiences marveled at the way they moved.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.555
It was science fiction made true,
