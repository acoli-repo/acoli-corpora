00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.216
and the risk of political
and social instability rises,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.800
and societies become dimmer,
coarser and smaller.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.296
The context matters.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.936
And countries in emerging markets

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.800
do not need to grow at the same
rates as developed countries.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.680
Now, I know some of you in this room
find this to be a risky proposition.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.536
There are some people here

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.096
who will turn around
and be quite disillusioned

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.896
by what's happened around the world

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.520
and basically ascribe that
to economic growth.
