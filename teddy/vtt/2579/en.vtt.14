00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.776
Of course, in this system
governments do tax,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.536
and they use part of their revenues
to fund social programs,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.416
recognizing that government's role
is not just regulation

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.720
but also to be arbiter of social goods.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.616
But nevertheless,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.976
this framework --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.976
this two-stage framework --

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.976
is the basis from which we must now start

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.600
to think about how we can
improve the capitalist model.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.920
I would argue that there are
two sides to this challenge.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.736
First of all,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.696
we can draw on the right-wing policies

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.576
to see what could be beneficial for us
