Bruno Giussani: I want to ask
a couple of questions, Dambisa,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.216
because one could react
to your last sentence

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.056
by saying growth is also an ideology,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.416
it's possibly the dominant
ideology of our times.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.536
What do you say
to those who react that way?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.016
DM: Well, I think that that's
completely legitimate,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.616
and I think that we're already
having that discussion.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.856
There's a lot of work
going on around happiness

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.376
and other metrics being used
for measuring people's success

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.216
and improvements in living standards.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.296
And so I think that we should be open

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.296
to what could deliver improvements
in people's living standards
