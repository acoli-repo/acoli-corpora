00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.136
we could get quite negative

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.376
and quite concerned
about the way the world is.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.696
However, we've seen the Club of Rome,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.136
we've seen previous claims

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.496
that the world would be
running out of resources,

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.096
and it's not to argue
that those things are not valid.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.776
But I think, with ingenuity
we could see desalination,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.736
I think we could reinvest in energy,

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.896
so that we can actually
get better outcomes.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.136
And so in that sense,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.536
I'm much more optimistic
about what humans can do.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.976
BG: The thing that strikes me

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.376
about your proposals
for rehabilitating growth

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.016
and taking a different direction
