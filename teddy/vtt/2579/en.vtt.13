how does capitalism work today?

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.360
Very simplistically,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.736
capitalism is set on the basis
of an individual utility maximizer --

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.056
a selfish individual
who goes after what he or she wants.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.216
And only after they've
maximized their utility

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.736
do they then decide it's important

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.840

to other social contracts.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.776
Of course, in this system
governments do tax,
