to the emerging markets

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.696
without developed countries themselves

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.096
also taking quite a swipe
at what they're doing

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.896
both in demand and supply
in developed markets.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.016
BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.
DM: Thank you very much.
