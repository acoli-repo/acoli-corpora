00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.216
Economic growth needs capitalism,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.920
but it needs it to work properly.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.136
And as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.120
the core of the capitalist system
has been defined by private actors.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.776
And even this, however,
is a very simplistic dichotomy.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.720
Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.776
When in practical experience,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.256
capitalism is much more of a spectrum.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.536
And we have countries such as China,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.976
which have practiced
more state capitalism,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.096
and we have countries
like the Unites States
