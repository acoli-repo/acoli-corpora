00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:06.456
Our ability to create
and sustain economic growth

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.216
is the defining challenge of our time.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.776
Of course there are other challenges --

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.936
health care, disease burdens
and pandemics,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.760
environmental challenges

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.080
and, of course, radicalized terrorism.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.016
However,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.616
to the extent that we can actually
solve the economic growth challenge,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.976
it will take us a long way

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.600
to solving the challenges
that I've just elucidated.
