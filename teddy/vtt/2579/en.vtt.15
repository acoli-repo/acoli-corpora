In particular,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.456
right-leaning policies

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.936
have tended to focus on things
like conditional transfers,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.976
where we pay and reward people
for doing the things

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.456

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.976
or getting their children

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.880
parents could get paid for doing that.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.456
Now, quite apart from the debate
