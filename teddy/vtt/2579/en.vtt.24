00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.336
has democracy,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.456
liberal democracy,
as it's core political stance

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.656
and it has free market capitalism --

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.256
to the extent that it is free --

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.456
free market capitalism
as its economic stance.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.616
The second largest economy is China.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.776
It has deprioritized democracy

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.976
and it has state capitalism,
which is a completely different model.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.736
These two countries,
completely different political models

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.736
and completely different economic models,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.176
and yet they have the same
income inequality number

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.696
measured as a Gini coefficient.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.856
I think those are the debates
we should have,

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.016
because it's not clear at all
