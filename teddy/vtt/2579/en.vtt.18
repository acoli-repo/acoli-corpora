Of course, left-leaning policies
have also tended to blur the lines

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.880
between government,
NGOs and private sector.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.776
Two very good examples of this
are the 19th-century United States,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.416
when the infrastructure rollout

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.536
was really about
public-private partnerships.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.976
More recently, of course,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.616
the advent of the Internet
has also proven to the world

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.480
that public and private can work together
for the betterment of society.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.296
My fundamental message to you is this:

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.736
We cannot continue to try and solve
the world economic growth challenges
