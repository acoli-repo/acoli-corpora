the decline and erosion
of both the quality and quantity of labor

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.720
and they also see productivity stalling.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.296
In a similar vein,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.736
how are we going to create
economic growth in the emerging markets,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.016
where 90 percent
of the world's population lives

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.576
and where, on average,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.120
70 percent of the population
is under the age of 25?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.096
In these countries,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.296
it is essential that they grow
at a minimum of seven percent a year

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.416
in order to put a dent in poverty

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.640
and to double per capita incomes
in one generation.
