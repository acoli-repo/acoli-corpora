to what could deliver improvements
in people's living standards

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.576
and continue to reduce
poverty around the world.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.416
BG: So you're basically pleading
for rehabilitating growth,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.016
but the only way for that happen

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.376
without compromising
the capacity of the earth,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.936
to take us on a long journey,

from the underlying use of resources.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.656
Do you see that happening?

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.216
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic
about human ability and ingenuity.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.416

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.496
using the finite, scarce
and depleting resources

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.776
that we know today,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.136
we could get quite negative
