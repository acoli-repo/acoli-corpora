00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.016
because it's not clear at all

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.856
what model we should be adopting,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.216
and I think there needs to be
much more discourse

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.656
and much more humility
about what we know and what we don't know.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.056
BG: One last question.
The COP21 is going on in Paris.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.576
If you could send a tweet

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.896
to all the heads of state
and heads of delegations there,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.296
what would you say?

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.976
DM: Again, I would be very much
about being open-minded.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.216
As you're aware,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.336
the issues around
the environmental concerns

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.336
have been on the agenda many times now --

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.616
in Copenhagen,
'72 in Stockholm --

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.936
and we keep revisiting these issues

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.536
partly because there is not
a fundamental agreement,
