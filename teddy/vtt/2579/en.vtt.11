00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.096
and we have countries
like the Unites States

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.720
which are more market capitalist.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.296
Our efforts to critique
the capitalist system, however,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.536
have tended to focus
on countries like China

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.960
that are in fact
not blatantly market capitalism.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.256
However, there is
a real reason and real concern

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.936
for us to now focus our attentions
on purer forms of capitalism,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.680
particularly those embodied
by the United States.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.056
This is really important

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.536
because this type of capitalism

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.816
has increasingly
been afforded the critique
