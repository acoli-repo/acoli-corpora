00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.736
We cannot continue to try and solve
the world economic growth challenges

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.920
by being dogmatic
and being unnecessarily ideological.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.616
In order to create sustainable,
long-term economic growth

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.936
and solve the challenges and social ills
that continue to plague the world today,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.256
we're going to have to be
more broad-minded

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.800
about what might work.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.856
Ultimately,

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.016
we have to recognize
that ideology is the enemy of growth.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.256
Thank you.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.520
