00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:31.921
So if you are a software house
like Google or Facebook,

00:05:31.945 --> 00:05:34.662
something like this costs you
at least six months of work.

00:05:34.686 --> 00:05:36.888
So we figured 48 hours is great.

00:05:36.912 --> 00:05:40.379
And within 48 hours, we got about
100 submissions from students,

00:05:40.403 --> 00:05:43.773
and the top four got it perfectly right.

00:05:43.797 --> 00:05:46.437
It drives better than I could
drive on this imagery,

00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:47.650
using deep learning.

00:05:47.674 --> 00:05:49.473
And again, it's the same methodology.

00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:50.661
It's this magical thing.

00:05:50.685 --> 00:05:52.770
When you give enough data
to a computer now,

00:05:52.794 --> 00:05:54.934
and give enough time
to comprehend the data,

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.403
it finds its own rules.

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:02.184
CA: And so that has led to the development
of powerful applications
