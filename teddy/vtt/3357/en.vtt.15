00:07:24.808 --> 00:07:30.881
if you train it on 129,000 images
of skin conditions,

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:33.470
including melanoma and carcinomas,

00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:36.795
you can do as good a job

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:39.016
as the best human dermatologists.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.589
And to convince ourselves
that this is the case,

00:07:41.613 --> 00:07:45.603
we captured an independent dataset
that we presented to our network

00:07:45.627 --> 00:07:49.969
and to 25 board-certified
Stanford-level dermatologists,

00:07:49.993 --> 00:07:51.665
and compared those.

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:53.193
And in most cases,

00:07:53.217 --> 00:07:57.092
they were either on par or above
the performance classification accuracy

00:07:57.116 --> 00:07:58.583
of human dermatologists.

00:07:58.607 --> 00:08:00.353
