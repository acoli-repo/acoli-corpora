It's not quite on par with Google
after seven years of Google work,

00:11:01.777 --> 00:11:04.305
but it's getting there.

00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:07.413
And it took us only two engineers
and three months to do this.

00:11:07.437 --> 00:11:10.293
And the reason is, we have
an army of students

00:11:10.317 --> 00:11:12.167
who participate in competitions.

00:11:12.191 --> 00:11:14.411
We're not the only ones
who use crowdsourcing.

00:11:14.435 --> 00:11:16.658
Uber and Didi use crowdsource for driving.

00:11:16.682 --> 00:11:19.441
Airbnb uses crowdsourcing for hotels.

00:11:19.465 --> 00:11:23.472
There's now many examples
where people do bug-finding crowdsourcing

00:11:23.496 --> 00:11:26.300
or protein folding, of all things,
in crowdsourcing.

00:11:26.324 --> 00:11:29.239
But we've been able to build
this car in three months,

00:11:29.263 --> 00:11:32.918
so I am actually rethinking
