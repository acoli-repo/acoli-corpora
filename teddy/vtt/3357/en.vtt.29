00:14:29.219 --> 00:14:31.668
and because of the speed
of computers and so forth,

00:14:31.692 --> 00:14:33.595
things have gone crazy, and suddenly --

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:35.639
ST: I would say this is a possibility,

00:14:35.663 --> 00:14:37.579
but it's a very remote possibility.

00:14:37.603 --> 00:14:40.940
So let me just translate
what I heard you say.

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:43.668
In the AlphaGo case,
we had exactly this thing:

00:14:43.692 --> 00:14:46.007
the computer would play
the game against itself

00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:47.281
and then learn new rules.

00:14:47.305 --> 00:14:50.540
And what machine learning is
is a rewriting of the rules.

00:14:50.564 --> 00:14:52.333
It's the rewriting of code.

00:14:52.357 --> 00:14:55.202
But I think there was
absolutely no concern

00:14:55.226 --> 00:14:57.652
that AlphaGo would take over the world.

00:14:57.676 --> 00:14:59.140
It can't even play chess.

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:04.311
CA: No, no, no, but now,
these are all very single-domain things.
