00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:31.861
on El Camino Real on a rainy day,

00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:35.409
with bicyclists and pedestrians
and 133 traffic lights.

00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:38.069
And the novel thing here is,

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:41.213
many, many moons ago, I started
the Google self-driving car team.

00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:44.418
And back in the day, I hired
the world's best software engineers

00:03:44.442 --> 00:03:46.049
to find the world's best rules.

00:03:46.073 --> 00:03:47.827
This is just trained.

00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:51.187
We drive this road 20 times,

00:03:51.211 --> 00:03:53.658
we put all this data
into the computer brain,

00:03:53.682 --> 00:03:55.764
and after a few hours of processing,

00:03:55.788 --> 00:03:59.714
it comes up with behavior
that often surpasses human agility.

00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:01.755
So it's become really easy to program it.
