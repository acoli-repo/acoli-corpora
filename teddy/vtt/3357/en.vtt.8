00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:01.755
So it's become really easy to program it.

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:05.582
This is 100 percent autonomous,
about 33 miles, an hour and a half.

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:09.236
CA: So, explain it -- on the big part
of this program on the left,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.517
you're seeing basically what
the computer sees as trucks and cars

00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:15.427
and those dots overtaking it and so forth.

00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:19.213
ST: On the right side, you see the camera
image, which is the main input here,

00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:21.913
and it's used to find lanes,
other cars, traffic lights.

00:04:21.937 --> 00:04:24.426
The vehicle has a radar
to do distance estimation.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.071
This is very commonly used
in these kind of systems.

00:04:27.095 --> 00:04:29.087
On the left side you see a laser diagram,

00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:32.311
where you see obstacles like trees
and so on depicted by the laser.
