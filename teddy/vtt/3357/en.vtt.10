00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:01.356
of how the actual
learning part takes place.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.838
Maybe we can see that. Talk about this.

00:05:03.862 --> 00:05:07.505
ST: This is an example where we posed
a challenge to Udacity students

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.660
to take what we call
a self-driving car Nanodegree.

00:05:10.684 --> 00:05:12.179
We gave them this dataset

00:05:12.203 --> 00:05:15.257
and said "Hey, can you guys figure out
how to steer this car?"

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.905
And if you look at the images,

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:21.002
it's, even for humans, quite impossible
to get the steering right.

00:05:21.026 --> 00:05:24.617
And we ran a competition and said,
"It's a deep learning competition,

00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:25.814
AI competition,"

00:05:25.838 --> 00:05:27.725
and we gave the students 48 hours.

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:31.921
So if you are a software house
like Google or Facebook,
