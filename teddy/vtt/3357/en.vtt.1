00:00:29.022 --> 00:00:31.659
that was necessary to make machines smart.

00:00:31.683 --> 00:00:33.434
So here's how it works.

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:36.955
If you program a computer today,
say, your phone,

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.314
then you hire software engineers

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:43.192
that write a very,
very long kitchen recipe,

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:46.348
like, "If the water is too hot,
turn down the temperature.

00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:48.651
If it's too cold, turn up
the temperature."

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:51.524
The recipes are not just 10 lines long.

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:54.151
They are millions of lines long.

00:00:54.175 --> 00:00:58.259
A modern cell phone
has 12 million lines of code.

00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:00.929
A browser has five million lines of code.
