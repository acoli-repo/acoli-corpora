00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.090
thrives on massive amounts of data,
and it can't do anything else.

00:16:03.114 --> 00:16:04.841
It can't even control a motorcycle.

00:16:04.865 --> 00:16:07.627
It's a very specific,
domain-specific function,

00:16:07.651 --> 00:16:09.558
and the same is true for our cancer app.

00:16:26.524 --> 00:16:29.410
But if I were to think about one thing,

00:16:29.434 --> 00:16:34.997
I would ask myself the question,
"What if we can take anything repetitive
