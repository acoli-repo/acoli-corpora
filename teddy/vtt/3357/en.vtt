Chris Anderson: Help us understand
what machine learning is,

00:00:03.814 --> 00:00:05.868
because that seems to be the key driver

00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:08.629
of so much of the excitement
and also of the concern

00:00:08.653 --> 00:00:10.147
around artificial intelligence.

00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:11.814
How does machine learning work?

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:15.734
Sebastian Thrun: So, artificial
intelligence and machine learning

00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:17.760
is about 60 years old

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:22.053
and has not had a great day
in its past until recently.

00:00:22.077 --> 00:00:25.001
And the reason is that today,

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:28.998
we have reached a scale
of computing and datasets

00:00:29.022 --> 00:00:31.659
that was necessary to make machines smart.
