00:08:29.267 --> 00:08:32.658
who is a world-famous dermatologist,
one of the three best, apparently,

00:08:32.682 --> 00:08:35.617
looked at this mole and said,
"This is not skin cancer."

00:08:35.641 --> 00:08:38.117
And then he had
a second moment, where he said,

00:08:38.141 --> 00:08:40.007
"Well, let me just check with the app."

00:08:40.031 --> 00:08:42.730
So he took out his iPhone
and ran our piece of software,

00:08:42.754 --> 00:08:44.875
our "pocket dermatologist," so to speak,

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.893
and the iPhone said: cancer.

00:08:47.917 --> 00:08:49.223
It said melanoma.

00:08:49.849 --> 00:08:51.082
And then he was confused.

00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:55.657
And he decided, "OK, maybe I trust
the iPhone a little bit more than myself,"

00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:58.416
and he sent it out to the lab
to get it biopsied.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.909
And it came up as an aggressive melanoma.
