00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.807
and choose not to consult
the assistance of a doctor

00:10:00.831 --> 00:10:02.414
because we get it wrong,

00:10:02.438 --> 00:10:04.091
I would feel really bad about it.

00:10:04.115 --> 00:10:06.040
So we're currently doing clinical tests,

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:08.862
and if these clinical tests commence
and our data holds up,

00:10:08.886 --> 00:10:11.876

and take it out of the Stanford clinic

00:10:13.816 --> 00:10:15.474
and bring it to the entire world,

00:10:15.498 --> 00:10:17.954
places where Stanford
doctors never, ever set foot.

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:21.197
CA: And do I hear this right,

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:23.187
that it seemed like what you were saying,

00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:27.465
because you are working
with this army of Udacity students,

00:10:27.489 --> 00:10:30.710
that in a way, you're applying
a different form of machine learning
