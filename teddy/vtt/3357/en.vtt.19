00:09:25.224 --> 00:09:30.197
ST: So my in-box is flooded
about cancer apps,

00:09:30.221 --> 00:09:32.524
with heartbreaking stories of people.

00:09:32.548 --> 00:09:35.752
I mean, some people have had
10, 15, 20 melanomas removed,

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:39.728
and are scared that one
might be overlooked, like this one,

00:09:39.752 --> 00:09:41.493
and also, about, I don't know,

00:09:41.517 --> 00:09:44.249
flying cars and speaker inquiries 
these days, I guess.

00:09:44.273 --> 00:09:47.011
My take is, we need more testing.

00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:49.227
I want to be very careful.

00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:52.917
It's very easy to give a flashy result
and impress a TED audience.

00:09:52.941 --> 00:09:55.568
It's much harder to put
something out that's ethical.

00:09:55.592 --> 00:09:57.986
And if people were to use the app

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.807
and choose not to consult
the assistance of a doctor
