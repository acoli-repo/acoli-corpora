A browser has five million lines of code.

00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:05.922
And each bug in this recipe
can cause your computer to crash.

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:09.021
That's why a software engineer
makes so much money.

00:01:09.953 --> 00:01:13.613
The new thing now is that computers
can find their own rules.

00:01:13.637 --> 00:01:17.243
So instead of an expert
deciphering, step by step,

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:19.415
a rule for every contingency,

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.513
what you do now is you give
the computer examples

00:01:22.537 --> 00:01:24.118
and have it infer its own rules.

00:01:24.142 --> 00:01:28.448
A really good example is AlphaGo,
which recently was won by Google.

00:01:28.472 --> 00:01:32.159
Normally, in game playing,
you would really write down all the rules,
