00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:01.026
try a bunch of different code versions,

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.825
possibly even at random,

00:14:02.849 --> 00:14:06.481
and then check them out and see
if a goal is achieved and improved.

00:14:06.505 --> 00:14:10.146
So, say the goal is to do better
on an intelligence test.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.064
You know, a computer
that's moderately good at that,

00:14:14.088 --> 00:14:16.597
you could try a million versions of that.

00:14:16.621 --> 00:14:18.711
You might find one that was better,

00:14:18.735 --> 00:14:20.739
and then, you know, repeat.

00:14:20.763 --> 00:14:23.803
And so the concern is that you get
some sort of runaway effect

00:14:23.827 --> 00:14:26.835
where everything is fine
on Thursday evening,

00:14:26.859 --> 00:14:29.195
and you come back into the lab
on Friday morning,

00:14:29.219 --> 00:14:31.668
and because of the speed
of computers and so forth,
