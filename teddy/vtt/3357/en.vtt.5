CA: So instead of looking ahead
to, "If he does that, I will do that,"

00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:36.528
it's more saying, "Here is what
looks like a winning pattern,

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:38.631
here is what looks like
a winning pattern."

00:02:38.655 --> 00:02:41.172
ST: Yeah. I mean, think about
how you raise children.

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:44.840
You don't spend the first 18 years
giving kids a rule for every contingency

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:47.211
and set them free
and they have this big program.

00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:49.954
They stumble, fall, get up,
they get slapped or spanked,

00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:52.862
and they have a positive experience,
a good grade in school,

00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:54.720
and they figure it out on their own.

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:56.481
That's happening with computers now,

00:02:56.505 --> 00:02:59.534
which makes computer programming
so much easier all of a sudden.

00:02:59.558 --> 00:03:02.733
Now we don't have to think anymore.
We just give them lots of data.
