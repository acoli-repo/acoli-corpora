In the very first stage, it takes
the visual input and extracts edges

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.032
and rods and dots.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:07.093
And the next one becomes
more complicated edges

00:07:07.117 --> 00:07:10.308
and shapes like little half-moons.

00:07:10.332 --> 00:07:14.775
And eventually, it's able to build
really complicated concepts.

00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:16.847
Andrew Ng has been able to show

00:07:16.871 --> 00:07:20.351
that it's able to find
cat faces and dog faces

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:22.036
in vast amounts of images.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.784
What my student team
at Stanford has shown is that

00:07:24.808 --> 00:07:30.881
if you train it on 129,000 images
of skin conditions,
