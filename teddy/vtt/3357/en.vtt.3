Normally, in game playing,
you would really write down all the rules,

00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:33.968
but in AlphaGo's case,

00:01:33.992 --> 00:01:36.058
the system looked over a million games

00:01:36.082 --> 00:01:38.274
and was able to infer its own rules

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:41.036
and then beat the world's
residing Go champion.

00:01:41.853 --> 00:01:45.362
That is exciting, because it relieves
the software engineer

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:47.205
of the need of being super smart,

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.554
and pushes the burden towards the data.

00:01:49.578 --> 00:01:54.112
As I said, the inflection point
where this has become really possible --

00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:56.882
very embarrassing, my thesis
was about machine learning.

00:01:56.906 --> 00:01:59.111
It was completely
insignificant, don't read it,

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:00.485
because it was 20 years ago
