00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:00.485
because it was 20 years ago

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.416
and back then, the computers
were as big as a cockroach brain.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.771
Now they are powerful enough
to really emulate

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:07.871
kind of specialized human thinking.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.208
And then the computers
take advantage of the fact

00:02:10.232 --> 00:02:12.732
that they can look at
much more data than people can.

00:02:12.756 --> 00:02:15.836
So I'd say AlphaGo looked at
more than a million games.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.699
No human expert can ever
study a million games.

00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:21.905
Google has looked at over
a hundred billion web pages.

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:24.579
No person can ever study
a hundred billion web pages.

00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:27.317
So as a result,
the computer can find rules

00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:29.096
that even people can't find.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.432
CA: So instead of looking ahead
to, "If he does that, I will do that,"
