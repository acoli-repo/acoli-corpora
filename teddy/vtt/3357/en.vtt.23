00:11:29.263 --> 00:11:32.918
so I am actually rethinking

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.180
how we organize corporations.

00:11:35.204 --> 00:11:39.900
We have a staff of 9,000 people
who are never hired,

00:11:39.924 --> 00:11:41.232
that I never fire.

00:11:41.256 --> 00:11:43.618
They show up to work
and I don't even know.

00:11:43.642 --> 00:11:46.700
Then they submit to me
maybe 9,000 answers.

00:11:46.724 --> 00:11:48.900
I'm not obliged to use any of those.

00:11:48.924 --> 00:11:50.915
I end up -- I pay only the winners,

00:11:50.939 --> 00:11:54.657
so I'm actually very cheapskate here,
which is maybe not the best thing to do.

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:57.866
But they consider it part
of their education, too, which is nice.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:02.091
But these students have been able
to produce amazing deep learning results.
