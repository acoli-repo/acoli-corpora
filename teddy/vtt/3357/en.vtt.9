00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:32.311
where you see obstacles like trees
and so on depicted by the laser.

00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:35.771
But almost all the interesting work
is centering on the camera image now.

00:04:35.795 --> 00:04:39.271
We're really shifting over from precision
sensors like radars and lasers

00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:41.137
into very cheap, commoditized sensors.

00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:43.148
A camera costs less than eight dollars.

00:04:43.172 --> 00:04:45.965
CA: And that green dot
on the left thing, what is that?

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:47.360
Is that anything meaningful?

00:04:47.384 --> 00:04:51.052
ST: This is a look-ahead point
for your adaptive cruise control,

00:04:51.076 --> 00:04:53.553
so it helps us understand
how to regulate velocity

00:04:53.577 --> 00:04:56.211
based on how far
the cars in front of you are.

00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:58.951
CA: And so, you've also
got an example, I think,

00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:01.356
of how the actual
learning part takes place.
