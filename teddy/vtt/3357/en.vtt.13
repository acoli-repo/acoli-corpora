00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:31.907
It takes more than a decade of training
to be a good dermatologist.

00:06:31.931 --> 00:06:35.127
What you see here is
the machine learning version of it.

00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:36.992
It's called a neural network.

00:06:37.016 --> 00:06:40.758
"Neural networks" is the technical term
for these machine learning algorithms.

00:06:40.782 --> 00:06:42.571
They've been around since the 1980s.

00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:47.235
This one was invented in 1988
by a Facebook Fellow called Yann LeCun,

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:50.817
and it propagates data stages

00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:53.419
through what you could think of
as the human brain.

00:06:53.443 --> 00:06:56.409
It's not quite the same thing,
but it emulates the same thing.

00:06:56.433 --> 00:06:57.735
It goes stage after stage.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.396
In the very first stage, it takes
the visual input and extracts edges
