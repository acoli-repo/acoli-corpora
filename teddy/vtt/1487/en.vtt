00:00:00.827 --> 00:00:02.858
I've always written primarily about architecture,

00:00:02.858 --> 00:00:05.383
about buildings, and writing about architecture

00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:08.124
is based on certain assumptions.

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:10.582

or many architects design many buildings, and it becomes

00:00:13.062 --> 00:00:16.336

00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:26.065
You can smell them. You can get a feel for them.

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:29.558
You can experience their sense of place.

00:00:29.558 --> 00:00:31.907
But what was striking to me over the last several years
