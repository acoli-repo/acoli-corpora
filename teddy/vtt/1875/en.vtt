When I'm starting talks like this,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
because a lot of people out there don't know what that is.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a crowd that does know what it is,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Fill in the blanks.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, you know, sustainability, small planet.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Right? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You know, about a million years ago,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
got a little clever, harnessed fire,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
invented the printing press,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
made, you know, luggage with wheels on it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And, you know, built the society that we now live in.
