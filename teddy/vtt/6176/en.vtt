I have to admit that it's a lot of fun

00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:05.147
when people ask me what I do for my job,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.897
because I tell them
I literally rub things together.

00:00:08.524 --> 00:00:10.233
This sounds ridiculous,

00:00:10.257 --> 00:00:12.385
just rubbing things together.

00:00:13.403 --> 00:00:15.984
But it has a technical name:

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:18.308
tribology.

00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:21.869
T-r-i-b-o-l-o-g-y,

00:00:21.893 --> 00:00:23.714
from the ancient Greek word "tribos,"

00:00:23.738 --> 00:00:25.071
which means "to rub."

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:28.770
It's a funny-sounding word
you've probably never heard before,

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:29.948
but I promise you,

00:00:29.972 --> 00:00:33.076
discovering it changes your experience
with the physical world.
