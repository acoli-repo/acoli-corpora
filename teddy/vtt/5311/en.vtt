In Physics,

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.130
the concepts of work and power help us understand

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.103
and explain lots of things in our universe.

00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:23.153
Let's start with work.

00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:26.214
Positive work is the energy we put into a system,

00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:29.690
and negative work is energy that is transferred out.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.942
Think of positive work as money being added to your bank account,
