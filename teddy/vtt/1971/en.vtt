00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:06.615
You know, we wake up in the morning,

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:09.135
you get dressed, put on your shoes,

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:11.647
you head out into the world.

00:00:11.647 --> 00:00:15.898
You plan on coming back, getting undressed,

00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:18.123
going to bed,

00:00:18.123 --> 00:00:19.877
waking up, doing it again,

00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:23.025
and that anticipation, that rhythm,

00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:25.295
helps give us a structure

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:28.883
to how we organize ourselves and our lives,

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:32.363
and gives it a measure of predictability.
