You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And it comes in a male form, too --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
very glamorous.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
there actually is a little wine in there --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and of course, always wears a tuxedo.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,
