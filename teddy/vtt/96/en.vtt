00:00:00.661 --> 00:00:03.372
Nearly 100 years ago,

00:00:03.396 --> 00:00:04.826
almost today,

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.206
most women in the United States
finally won the right to vote.

00:00:08.862 --> 00:00:14.502
Now, it would take decades more
for women of color to earn that right,

00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:16.226
and we've come a long way since,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.421
but I would argue not nearly far enough.

00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:21.603
I think what women want today,

00:00:21.627 --> 00:00:24.674
not just only in the United States
but around the globe,

00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:27.000
is to no longer be an afterthought.

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:31.669
We don't want to continue to try to,
like, look at the next 100 years
