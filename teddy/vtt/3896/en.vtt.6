Several weeks later
I was at a friend's house,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.560
and I was very upset and angry
about all the hate and racism I had met.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.856
It was he who suggested
that I should call them up

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.080
and visit them.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.120
"They will kill me," I said.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.096
"They would never attack a member
of the Danish Parliament," he said.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.136
"And anyway, if they killed you,
you would become a martyr."

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.296
(Laughter)

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.896
"So it's pure win-win situation for you."

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.160
(Laughter)
