00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.576
I was born in Turkey from Kurdish parents

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.280
and we moved to Denmark
when I was a young child.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.136
In 2007, I ran for a seat
in the Danish parliament

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.080
as one of the first women
with a minority background.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.536
I was elected,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.536
but I soon found out
that not everyone was happy about it

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.760
as I had to quickly get used
to finding hate messages in my inbox.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.936
Those emails would begin
with something like this:

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.800
"What's a raghead like you
doing in our parliament?"
