and when we meet people
who are discriminating

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.136
or dehumanizing people or groups,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.640
we don't insist on speaking with them
to challenge their opinions.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.176
That's how healthy democratic
societies break down --

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.520
when we don't check the personal
responsibility for the democracy.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.160
We take the democracy for granted.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.400
It is not.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.880
Conversation is the most difficult
thing in a democracy

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.000
and also the most important.
