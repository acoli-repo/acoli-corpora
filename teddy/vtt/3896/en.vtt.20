00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.080
and on my journey I have met many people
who have insisted on speaking to me.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.680
They have changed my views.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.280
They have formed me as a democratic
citizen and a bridge builder.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.296
If you want to prevent hate and violence,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.736
we have to talk to as many
people as possible

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.056
for as long as possible

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.280
while being as open as possible.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.376
That can only be achieved through debate,

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.296
critical conversation

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.320
and insisting on dialogue
that doesn't demonize people.
