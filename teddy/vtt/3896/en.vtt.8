00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.576
To my surprise and shock,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.920
he answered the phone.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.896
I blurted out, "Hello, my name is Özlem.
You have sent me so many hate mails.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.656
You don't know me, I don't know you.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.136
I was wondering if I could come around
and we can drink a coffee together

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.416
and talk about it?"
