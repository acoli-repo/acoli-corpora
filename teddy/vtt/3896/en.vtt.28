So here's my challenge.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.416
Find your Ingolf.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.456
(Laughter)

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.160
Start a conversation.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.296
Trenches have been dug
between people, yes,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.720

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.496
And let me end by quoting my friend,

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.720

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.656

in a terror attack
