00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.216
that the people I visit are just
as afraid of people they don't know

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.320
as I was afraid of them before
I started inviting myself for coffee.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.936
During these meetings,
a specific theme keeps coming up.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.296
It shows up regardless whether
I'm talking to a humanist or a racist,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.816
a man, a woman,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.896
a Muslim or an atheist.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.856
They all seem to think

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.016
that other people
are to blame for the hate

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.296
and for the generalization of groups.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.056
They all believe that other people
have to stop demonizing.
