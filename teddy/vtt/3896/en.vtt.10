00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.136
(Laughter)

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.240
because he looked
nothing like I'd imagined.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.296
I had expected a horrible person --

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.456
dirty, messy house.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.720
It was not.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.496
His house smelled of coffee

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.520
which was served from a coffee set
identical to the one my parents used.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.320
I ended up staying
for two and a half hours.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.960
And we had so many things in common.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.936
Even our prejudices were alike.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.856
