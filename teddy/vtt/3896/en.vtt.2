00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.800
"What's a raghead like you
doing in our parliament?"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.616
I never answered.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.736
I'd just delete the emails.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.920
I just thought that the senders
and I had nothing in common.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.936
They didn't understand me,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.280
and I didn't understand them.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.976
Then one day, one of my colleagues
in the parliament said

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.040
that I should save the hate mails.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.360
"When something happens to you,
it will give the police a lead."

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.856
(Laughter)

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.136
I noticed that she said,
"When something happens" and not "if."
