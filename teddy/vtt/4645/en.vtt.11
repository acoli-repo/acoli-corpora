00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:31.505
Some of the greatest
mathematicians of Cantor's day

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.053
were very upset with this stuff.

00:05:33.077 --> 00:05:35.697
They tried to make these different
infinities irrelevant,

00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:38.013
to make mathematics work
without them somehow.

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:40.070
Cantor was even vilified personally,

00:05:40.094 --> 00:05:42.999
and it got so bad for him
that he suffered severe depression,

00:05:43.023 --> 00:05:46.309
and spent the last half of his life
in and out of mental institutions.

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:48.662
But eventually, his ideas won out.

00:05:48.686 --> 00:05:51.644
Today, they're considered
fundamental and magnificent.

00:05:51.668 --> 00:05:54.245
All research mathematicians
accept these ideas,

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:56.064
every college math major learns them,

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:58.327
and I've explained them
to you in a few minutes.

00:05:58.351 --> 00:06:00.844
Some day, perhaps,
they'll be common knowledge.
