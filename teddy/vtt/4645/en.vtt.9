00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:32.413
And, no matter what list you give me,
I can do the same thing,

00:04:32.437 --> 00:04:34.650
and produce a decimal
that's not on that list.

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:37.195
So we're faced with this
astounding conclusion:

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.084
The decimal numbers
cannot be put on a list.

00:04:40.108 --> 00:04:44.026
They represent a bigger infinity
that the infinity of whole numbers.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.812
So, even though we're familiar
with only a few irrationals,

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:48.617
like square root of two and pi,

00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:50.134
the infinity of irrationals

00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:52.594
is actually greater
than the infinity of fractions.

00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:54.387
Someone once said that the rationals

00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:57.335
-- the fractions -- are
like the stars in the night sky.

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:01.119
The irrationals are like the blackness.
