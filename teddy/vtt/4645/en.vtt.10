The irrationals are like the blackness.

00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:03.664
Cantor also showed that,
for any infinite set,

00:05:03.688 --> 00:05:07.094
forming a new set made of
all the subsets of the original set

00:05:07.118 --> 00:05:10.386
represents a bigger infinity
than that original set.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.459
This means that,
once you have one infinity,

00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:14.041
you can always make a bigger one

00:05:14.065 --> 00:05:16.966
by making the set of all subsets
of that first set.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.406
And then an even bigger one

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.739
by making the set
of all the subsets of that one.

00:05:20.763 --> 00:05:21.989
And so on.

00:05:22.013 --> 00:05:25.601
And so, there are an infinite number
of infinities of different sizes.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:29.090
If these ideas make you
uncomfortable, you are not alone.

00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:31.505
Some of the greatest
mathematicians of Cantor's day
