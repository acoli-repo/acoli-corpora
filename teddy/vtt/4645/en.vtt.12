Some day, perhaps,
they'll be common knowledge.

00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:02.042
There's more.

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:04.496
We just pointed out
that the set of decimal numbers

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.970
-- that is, the real numbers --
is a bigger infinity

00:06:06.994 --> 00:06:08.429
than the set of whole numbers.

00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:10.510
Cantor wondered
whether there are infinities

00:06:10.534 --> 00:06:12.794
of different sizes
between these two infinities.

00:06:12.818 --> 00:06:15.315
He didn't believe there were,
but couldn't prove it.

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.250
Cantor's conjecture became known
as the continuum hypothesis.

00:06:19.402 --> 00:06:21.859
In 1900, the great
mathematician David Hilbert

00:06:21.883 --> 00:06:23.634
listed the continuum hypothesis

00:06:23.658 --> 00:06:26.417
as the most important
unsolved problem in mathematics.

00:06:26.441 --> 00:06:29.254
The 20th century saw
a resolution of this problem,

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:32.236
but in a completely unexpected,
paradigm-shattering way.
