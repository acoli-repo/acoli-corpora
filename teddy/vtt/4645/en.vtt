When I was in fourth grade,
my teacher said to us one day:

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:19.275
"There are as many even numbers
as there are numbers."

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:21.098
"Really?", I thought.

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:23.458
Well, yeah, there are
infinitely many of both,

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.878
so I suppose there are
the same number of them.

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:28.933
But even numbers are only part
of the whole numbers,

00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:30.584
all the odd numbers are left over,
