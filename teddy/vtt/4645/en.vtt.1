00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:30.584
all the odd numbers are left over,

00:00:30.608 --> 00:00:33.657
so there's got to be more whole numbers
than even numbers, right?

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:35.529
To see what my teacher was getting at,

00:00:35.553 --> 00:00:39.061
let's first think about what it means
for two sets to be the same size.

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:41.885
What do I mean when I say
I have the same number of fingers

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.357
on my right hand as I do on left hand?

00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:48.015
Of course, I have five fingers on each,
but it's actually simpler than that.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.490
I don't have to count, I only need to see
that I can match them up, one to one.

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:54.620
In fact, we think that some ancient people

00:00:54.644 --> 00:00:58.087
who spoke languages that didn't have words
for numbers greater than three

00:00:58.111 --> 00:00:59.483
used this sort of magic.

00:00:59.507 --> 00:01:02.233
For instance, if you let
your sheep out of a pen to graze,
