00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.729
the elements in some way
and it doesn't work,

00:02:01.753 --> 00:02:03.515
that doesn't convince us of anything.

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.730
If you can find one way

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:06.978
in which the elements
of two sets do match up,

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.895
then we say those two sets have
the same number of elements.

00:02:10.472 --> 00:02:12.487
Can you make a list of all the fractions?

00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:15.170
This might be hard,
there are a lot of fractions!

00:02:15.194 --> 00:02:17.071
And it's not obvious what to put first,

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.238
or how to be sure
all of them are on the list.

00:02:19.262 --> 00:02:21.918
Nevertheless, there is a very clever way

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:24.115
that we can make a list
of all the fractions.

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.985
This was first done by Georg Cantor,
in the late eighteen hundreds.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.017
First, we put all
the fractions into a grid.
