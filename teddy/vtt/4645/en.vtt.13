00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:32.236
but in a completely unexpected,
paradigm-shattering way.

00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:34.899
In the 1920s, Kurt Gödel showed

00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:37.923
that you can never prove
that the continuum hypothesis is false.

00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:41.003
Then, in the 1960s, Paul J. Cohen showed

00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:44.027
that you can never prove
that the continuum hypothesis is true.

00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:46.200
Taken together, these results mean

00:06:46.224 --> 00:06:48.748
that there are unanswerable
questions in mathematics.

00:06:48.772 --> 00:06:50.286
A very stunning conclusion.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.435
Mathematics is rightly considered
the pinnacle of human reasoning,

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:56.568
but we now know that even mathematics
has its limitations.

00:06:57.094 --> 00:07:00.809
Still, mathematics has some truly
amazing things for us to think about.
