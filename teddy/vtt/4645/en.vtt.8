00:03:58.432 --> 00:04:00.388
otherwise I'll make mine a one.

00:04:00.412 --> 00:04:02.520
For the second place of my number,

00:04:02.544 --> 00:04:05.021
I'll look at the second place
of your second number.

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.560
Again, if yours is a one,
I'll make mine a two,

00:04:07.584 --> 00:04:09.894
and otherwise I'll make mine a one.

00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:11.221
See how this is going?

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.220
The decimal I've produced
can't be on your list.

00:04:14.244 --> 00:04:17.531
Why? Could it be, say, your 143rd number?

00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:20.713
No, because the 143rd place of my decimal

00:04:20.737 --> 00:04:24.374
is different from the 143rd place
of your 143rd number.

00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:25.965
I made it that way.

00:04:25.989 --> 00:04:27.466
Your list is incomplete.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.484
It doesn't contain my decimal number.

00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:32.413
And, no matter what list you give me,
I can do the same thing,
