00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.017
First, we put all
the fractions into a grid.

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:32.131
They're all there.

00:02:32.155 --> 00:02:35.912
For instance, you can find, say, 117/243,

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:38.996
in the 117th row and 243rd column.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.821
Now we make a list out of this

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:44.245
by starting at the upper left
and sweeping back and forth diagonally,

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.596
skipping over any fraction, like 2/2,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.659
that represents the same number
as one the we've already picked.

00:02:49.683 --> 00:02:51.561
We get a list of all the fractions,

00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:53.698
which means we've created
a one-to-one match

00:02:53.722 --> 00:02:55.800
between the whole numbers
and the fractions,

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:59.199
despite the fact that we thought
maybe there ought to be more fractions.

00:02:59.223 --> 00:03:01.330
OK, here's where it gets
really interesting.
