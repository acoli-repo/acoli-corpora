OK, here's where it gets
really interesting.

00:03:01.354 --> 00:03:03.319
You may know that not all real numbers

00:03:03.343 --> 00:03:06.491
-- that is, not all the numbers
on a number line -- are fractions.

00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:08.662
The square root
of two and pi, for instance.

00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:11.113
Any number like this is called irrational.

00:03:11.137 --> 00:03:13.064
Not because it's crazy, or anything,

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:16.102
but because the fractions are
ratios of whole numbers,

00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:17.593
and so are called rationals;

00:03:17.617 --> 00:03:20.828
meaning the rest are
non-rational, that is, irrational.

00:03:20.852 --> 00:03:24.694
Irrationals are represented
by infinite, non-repeating decimals.

00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:26.853
So, can we make a one-to-one match

00:03:26.877 --> 00:03:29.606
between the whole numbers
and the set of all the decimals,

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.518
both the rationals and the irrationals?
