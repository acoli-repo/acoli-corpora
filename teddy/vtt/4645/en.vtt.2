00:00:59.507 --> 00:01:02.233
For instance, if you let
your sheep out of a pen to graze,

00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:05.938
you can keep track of how many went out
by setting aside a stone for each one,

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:09.092
and putting those stones back
one by one when the sheep return,

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:11.909
so you know if any are missing
without really counting.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:15.172
As another example of matching being
more fundamental than counting,

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:17.339
if I'm speaking to a packed auditorium,

00:01:17.363 --> 00:01:19.667
where every seat is taken
and no one is standing,

00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:23.221
I know that there are the same number
of chairs as people in the audience,

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:25.771
even though I don't know
how many there are of either.

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:28.938
So, what we really mean when we say
that two sets are the same size

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:30.690
is that the elements in those sets
