00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:30.690
is that the elements in those sets

00:01:30.714 --> 00:01:32.943
can be matched up one by one in some way.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.634
My fourth grade teacher showed us

00:01:34.658 --> 00:01:37.999
the whole numbers laid out in a row,
and below each we have its double.

00:01:38.023 --> 00:01:40.892
As you can see, the bottom row
contains all the even numbers,

00:01:40.916 --> 00:01:42.457
and we have a one-to-one match.

00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:45.386
That is, there are as many
even numbers as there are numbers.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.700
But what still bothers us is our distress

00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:51.203
over the fact that even numbers
seem to be only part of the whole numbers.

00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:52.681
But does this convince you

00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:54.880
that I don't have
the same number of fingers

00:01:54.904 --> 00:01:56.630
on my right hand as I do on my left?

00:01:56.654 --> 00:01:57.669
Of course not.

00:01:57.693 --> 00:01:59.536
It doesn't matter if you try to match

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.729
the elements in some way
and it doesn't work,
