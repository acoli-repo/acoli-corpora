00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.518
both the rationals and the irrationals?

00:03:31.542 --> 00:03:34.114
That is, can we make
a list of all the decimal numbers?

00:03:34.138 --> 00:03:36.188
Cantor showed that you can't.

00:03:36.212 --> 00:03:39.509
Not merely that we don't know how,
but that it can't be done.

00:03:40.045 --> 00:03:43.900
Look, suppose you claim you have made
a list of all the decimals.

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:46.142
I'm going to show you
that you didn't succeed,

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.452
by producing a decimal
that is not on your list.

00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:50.795
I'll construct my decimal
one place at a time.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.144
For the first decimal place of my number,

00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:55.930
I'll look at the first decimal place
of your first number.

00:03:55.954 --> 00:03:58.408
If it's a one, I'll make mine a two;

00:03:58.432 --> 00:04:00.388
otherwise I'll make mine a one.
