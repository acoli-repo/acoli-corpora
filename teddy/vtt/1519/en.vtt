00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You know, what I do is write for children,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I'm probably America's

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
most widely read children's author, in fact.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I always tell people

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and no one has ever chose farmer.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm here today to talk to you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about circles and epiphanies.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And you know, an epiphany

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You've just got to go around the block

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to see it as an epiphany.
