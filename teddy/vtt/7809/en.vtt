00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:03.436
I have a confession to make.

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.036
I feel bad about flying.

00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:08.636
And I know I'm not the only one here.

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:12.596
I love to travel, but I know
it's hurting our environment.

00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:17.516
When I was six years old,
I moved to Taiwan.

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:21.396
My family, we boarded
a regional jet in Iowa,

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:26.036
and 30 hours later
we stepped off a 747 in Taiwan.

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:30.716
Airplanes had taken us
halfway across the globe.
