00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.976
I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time, never.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.976
And these allegations are false.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.572
And I need to go back to work
for the American people.

00:07:38.596 --> 00:07:40.572
Thank you.

00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:42.108
(Applause)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.976
Pamela Meyer: Okay,
what were the telltale signs?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.976
Well first we heard what's known
as a non-contracted denial.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Studies show that people
who are overdetermined in their denial

00:07:53.024 --> 00:07:55.976
will resort to formal rather
than informal language.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.976
We also heard
distancing language: "that woman."

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.715
We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves
