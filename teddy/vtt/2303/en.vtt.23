00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.976
We say "yes," we shake our heads "no."

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.096
We tell very convincing stories,
we slightly shrug our shoulders.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.976
We commit terrible crimes,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.976
and we smile at the delight
in getting away with it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.976
Now, that smile is known
in the trade as "duping delight."

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.976
And we're going to see that
in several videos moving forward,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.076

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.176
this is presidential
candidate John Edwards

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.976
who shocked America by fathering
a child out of wedlock.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.976
We're going to see him talk
about getting a paternity test.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
See now if you can spot him
saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no,"
