00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.776
There are going to be times
when someone makes one expression

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.976
while masking another that just
kind of leaks through in a flash.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.976
Murderers are known to leak sadness.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.576
Your new joint venture partner
might shake your hand,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.976
celebrate, go out to dinner with you
and then leak an expression of anger.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.576
And we're not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.078
but there's one I can teach you
that's very dangerous

00:12:52.102 --> 00:12:53.315
and it's easy to learn,

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:55.176
and that's the expression of contempt.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.200
Now with anger, you've got
two people on an even playing field.

00:12:58.224 --> 00:13:00.415
It's still somewhat
of a healthy relationship.
