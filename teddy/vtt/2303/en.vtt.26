00:12:58.224 --> 00:13:00.415
It's still somewhat
of a healthy relationship.

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:03.976
But when anger turns to contempt,
you've been dismissed.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.976
It's associated with moral superiority.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.976
And for that reason, it's very,
very hard to recover from.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.976
Here's what it looks like.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.976
It's marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.976
It's the only asymmetrical expression.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.976
And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows --

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.976
and it doesn't always follow --

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.048
look the other way,
go the other direction,

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:27.976
reconsider the deal,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.976
say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you."
