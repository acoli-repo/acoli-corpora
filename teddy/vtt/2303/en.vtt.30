drove them to the hospital
while they bled all over the car,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.976
claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.976
And you'll see when you see the video,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.334
she can't even pretend
to be an agonizing mother.

00:15:07.358 --> 00:15:10.976
What you want to look for here
is an incredible discrepancy

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.976
between horrific events that she describes
and her very, very cool demeanor.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.476
And if you look closely, you'll see
duping delight throughout this video.

(Video) Diane Downs:
At night when I close my eyes,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.096
I can see Christie reaching
her hand out to me while I'm driving,

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.376
and the blood just kept
coming out of her mouth.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.543
And that -- maybe
it'll fade too with time --

00:15:28.567 --> 00:15:29.976
but I don't think so.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
That bothers me the most.
