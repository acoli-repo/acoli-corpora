00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.976
Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.976
Women lie more to protect other people.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.976
If you're an average married couple,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.976
you're going to lie to your spouse
in one out of every 10 interactions.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.976
Now, you may think that's bad.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.286
If you're unmarried,
that number drops to three.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.976
Lying's complex.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It's woven into the fabric
of our daily and our business lives.

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:53.976
We're deeply ambivalent about the truth.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.976
We parse it out on an as-needed basis,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.976
sometimes for very good reasons,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.191
other times just because
we don't understand the gaps in our lives.
