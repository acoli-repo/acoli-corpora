00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.976
Okay, now I don't want
to alarm anybody in this room,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.976
but it's just come to my attention
that the person to your right is a liar.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.976
(Laughter)

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.976
Also, the person to your left is a liar.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.976
Also the person sitting
in your very seats is a liar.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.976
We're all liars.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.976
What I'm going to do today

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.576
is I'm going to show you what the research
says about why we're all liars,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.176
how you can become a liespotter

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.976
and why you might want
to go the extra mile

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.976
and go from liespotting to truth seeking,
