say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you."

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.976
Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.976
We know, for example,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
we know liars will shift their blink rate,

00:13:40.024 --> 00:13:41.976
point their feet towards an exit.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.976
They will take barrier objects

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.429
and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them.

00:13:47.453 --> 00:13:48.976
They'll alter their vocal tone,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.976
often making their vocal tone much lower.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.976
Now here's the deal.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.976
These behaviors are just behaviors.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.976
They're not proof of deception.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.976
They're red flags.
