00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.976
But a trained liespotter
can spot a fake smile a mile away.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Can you all spot the fake smile here?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.976
You can consciously contract
the muscles in your cheeks.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.976
But the real smile's in the eyes,
the crow's feet of the eyes.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.976
They cannot be consciously contracted,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.976
especially if you overdid the Botox.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.976
Don't overdo the Botox;
nobody will think you're honest.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.976
Now we're going to look at the hot spots.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.286
Can you tell what's happening
in a conversation?

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.976
Can you start to find the hot spots

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.976
to see the discrepancies

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.191
between someone's words
and someone's actions?
