Ask a deceptive person
to tell their story,

00:11:00.072 --> 00:11:02.976
they're going to pepper it
with way too much detail

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.976
in all kinds of irrelevant places.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.476
And then they're going to tell their story
in strict chronological order.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.276
And what a trained interrogator does

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.976
is they come in and in very subtle ways
over the course of several hours,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.976
they will ask that person
to tell that story backwards,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.976
and then they'll watch them squirm,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.429
and track which questions produce
the highest volume of deceptive tells.

00:11:23.453 --> 00:11:25.976
Why do they do that?
Well, we all do the same thing.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.976
We rehearse our words,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.976
but we rarely rehearse our gestures.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.976
We say "yes," we shake our heads "no."
