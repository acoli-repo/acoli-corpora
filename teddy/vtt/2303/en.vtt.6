This con man, Henry Oberlander,
he was such an effective con man,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.976
British authorities say

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.476
he could have undermined the entire
banking system of the Western world.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.676
And you can't find this guy on Google;
you can't find him anywhere.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.176
He was interviewed once,
and he said the following.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.876
He said, "Look, I've got one rule."

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.976
And this was Henry's rule, he said,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.376
"Look, everyone is willing
to give you something.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.972
They're ready to give you something
for whatever it is they're hungry for."

00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:25.376
And that's the crux of it.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.829
If you don't want to be
deceived, you have to know,

00:03:27.853 --> 00:03:29.529
what is it that you're hungry for?

00:03:29.553 --> 00:03:31.976
And we all kind of hate to admit it.
