00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.976
Why is it so easy to learn?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.215
There are good liars and bad liars.

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:05.876
There are no real original liars.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.876
We all make the same mistakes.
We all use the same techniques.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.529
So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you two patterns of deception.

00:07:12.553 --> 00:07:14.752
And then we're going
to look at the hot spots

00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:16.629
and see if we can find them ourselves.

00:07:16.653 --> 00:07:18.276
We're going to start with speech.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.634
(Video) Bill Clinton:
I want you to listen to me.

00:07:20.658 --> 00:07:22.076
I'm going to say this again.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.976
I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.976
I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time, never.
