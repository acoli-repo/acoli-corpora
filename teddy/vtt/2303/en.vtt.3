00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.976
And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.976
and that proposition is the following:

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.468
Lying is a cooperative act.

00:01:38.777 --> 00:01:41.976
Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.976
Its power emerges

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.096
when someone else agrees
to believe the lie.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.096
So I know it may sound like tough love,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.976
but look, if at some point
you got lied to,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.976
it's because you agreed to get lied to.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.976
Truth number one about lying:
Lying's a cooperative act.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.976
Now not all lies are harmful.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.976
Sometimes we're willing
participants in deception
