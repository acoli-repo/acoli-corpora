00:03:29.553 --> 00:03:31.976
And we all kind of hate to admit it.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.976
We wish we were
better husbands, better wives,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.976
smarter, more powerful, taller, richer --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.976
the list goes on.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.976
Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.976
to connect our wishes and our fantasies

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.976
about who we wish we were,
how we wish we could be,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.976
with what we're really like.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.239
And boy are we willing to fill in
those gaps in our lives with lies.

00:03:54.263 --> 00:03:56.976
On a given day, studies show
that you may be lied to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.976
anywhere from 10 to 200 times.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.976
Now granted, many of those are white lies.
