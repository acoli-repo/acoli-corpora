Sometimes we're willing
participants in deception

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.976
for the sake of social dignity,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.976
maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.976
We say, "Nice song."

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.976
"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no."

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.976
Or we say, favorite of the digiratti,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.976
"You know, I just fished
that email out of my Spam folder.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.976
So sorry."

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.239
But there are times when we are unwilling
participants in deception.

00:02:24.263 --> 00:02:26.976
And that can have dramatic costs for us.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.976
Last year saw 997 billion dollars

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.579
in corporate fraud alone
in the United States.
