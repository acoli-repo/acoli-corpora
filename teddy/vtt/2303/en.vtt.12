00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.976
pause, wait to see who's coming

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.976

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.976

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.976
Two-year-olds bluff.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.976
Five-year-olds lie outright.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.276
By the time we enter this work world
and we're breadwinners,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.976
we enter a world that is just cluttered
with Spam, fake digital friends,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.976
partisan media,
