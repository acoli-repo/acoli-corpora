00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.976
Now granted, many of those are white lies.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.976
But in another study,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.976
it showed that strangers lied three times

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.381
within the first 10 minutes
of meeting each other.

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:09.976
(Laughter)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.976
Now when we first hear
this data, we recoil.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.976
We can't believe how prevalent lying is.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.976
We're essentially against lying.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.976
But if you look more closely,
the plot actually thickens.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.976
We lie more to strangers
than we lie to coworkers.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.976
Extroverts lie more than introverts.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.976
Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people.
