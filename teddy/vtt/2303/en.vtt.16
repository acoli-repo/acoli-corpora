We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves

00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:02.976
from their subject,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.976
using language as their tool.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.048
Now if Bill Clinton had said,
"Well, to tell you the truth ..."

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.363
or Richard Nixon's favorite,
"In all candor ..."

00:08:11.387 --> 00:08:13.076
he would have been a dead giveaway

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.976
for any liespotter that knows

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.429
that qualifying language, as it's called,
qualifying language like that,

00:08:18.453 --> 00:08:19.976
further discredits the subject.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.976
Now if he had repeated
the question in its entirety,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.976
or if he had peppered his account
with a little too much detail --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.191
and we're all really glad
he didn't do that --

00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:31.215
he would have further discredited himself.
