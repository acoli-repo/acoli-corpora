00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.191
between someone's words
and someone's actions?

00:10:01.215 --> 00:10:02.976
Now, I know it seems really obvious,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.976
but when you're having a conversation
with someone you suspect of deception,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.076
attitude is by far the most overlooked
but telling of indicators.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.296
An honest person
is going to be cooperative.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.368
They're going to show
they're on your side.

00:10:15.392 --> 00:10:16.976
They're going to be enthusiastic.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.276
They're going to be willing and helpful
to getting you to the truth.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.076
They're going to be willing
to brainstorm, name suspects,

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.376
provide details.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.976
They're going to say,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.176
"Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll
that forged those checks."

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.476
They're going to be infuriated
if they sense they're wrongly accused
