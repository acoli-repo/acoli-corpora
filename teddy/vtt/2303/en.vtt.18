00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.976
Now this brings us to our next pattern,
which is body language.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.976
With body language,
here's what you've got to do.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.976
You've really got to just throw
your assumptions out the door.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.429
Let the science temper
your knowledge a little bit.

00:09:10.453 --> 00:09:12.976
Because we think liars
fidget all the time.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.762
Well guess what, they're known to freeze
their upper bodies when they're lying.

00:09:16.786 --> 00:09:18.976
We think liars won't look you in the eyes.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.876
Well guess what, they look
you in the eyes a little too much

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.476
just to compensate for that myth.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.976
We think warmth and smiles
convey honesty, sincerity.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.976
But a trained liespotter
can spot a fake smile a mile away.
