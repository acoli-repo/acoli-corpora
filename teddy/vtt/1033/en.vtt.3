One year our fortune turned very bad.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
My family ate one meal per day, at night.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The food passes through our bodies.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We drop down to nothing.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In Malawi, the secondary school,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you have to pay school fees.
