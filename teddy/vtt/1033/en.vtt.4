00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In Malawi, the secondary school,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you have to pay school fees.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I looked at my father

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and looked at those dry fields.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It was the future I couldn't accept.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I felt very happy to be at the secondary school,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so I was determined to do anything possible

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to receive education.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So I went to a library.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I read books, science books, especially physics.
