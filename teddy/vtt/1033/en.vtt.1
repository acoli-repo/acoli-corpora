00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I had never seen an Internet.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
On the stage that day, I was so nervous.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
My English lost,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I wanted to vomit.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
(Laughter)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I had never been surrounded by so many azungu,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
white people.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
(Laughter)

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There was a story I wouldn't tell you then.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But well, I'm feeling good right now.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I would like to share that story today.
