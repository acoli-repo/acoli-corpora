00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I read books, science books, especially physics.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I couldn't read English that well.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I used diagrams and pictures

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
to learn the words around them.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Another book put that knowledge in my hands.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Pump water meant irrigation,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
a defense against hunger,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
which we were experiencing by that time.
