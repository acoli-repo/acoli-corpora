00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So, on stage that day in Arusha,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
my English lost,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I said something like,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
"I tried. And I made it."

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So I would like to say something

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to all the people out there like me

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
to the Africans, and the poor

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
who are struggling with your dreams.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
God bless.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I say to you, trust yourself and believe.
