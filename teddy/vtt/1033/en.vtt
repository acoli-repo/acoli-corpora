00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Thank you.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Two years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It was a simple machine that changed my life.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Before that time,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I had never been away from my home

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in Malawi.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I had never used a computer.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I had never seen an Internet.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
On the stage that day, I was so nervous.
