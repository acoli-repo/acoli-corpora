00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.417
I was fascinated by all of it.

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.722
But then I got my first taste of lighting.

00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:40.230
Lighting in practice is placing lights
inside this three-dimensional world.

00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:42.974
I actually have icons of lights
I move around in there.

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:44.720
Here you can see I've added a light,

00:01:44.744 --> 00:01:47.608
I'm turning on the rough version
of lighting in our software,

00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:48.863
turn on shadows

00:01:48.887 --> 00:01:50.291
and placing the light.

00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:51.482
As I place a light,

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:54.218
I think about what it might
look like in real life,

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:58.168
but balance that out with what we need
artistically and for the story.

00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:02.131
So it might look like this at first,
