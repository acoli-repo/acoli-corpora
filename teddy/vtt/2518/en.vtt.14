00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:00.268
when you are trying
to convince an audience

00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:03.775
that a robot has a personality
and he's capable of falling in love.

00:07:04.498 --> 00:07:08.022
So we went to work on these optically
perfect binoculars,

00:07:08.046 --> 00:07:11.748
trying to find a solution that would
maintain his true robot materials

00:07:11.772 --> 00:07:13.763
but solve this reflection problem.

00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:15.554
So we started with the lenses.

00:07:15.578 --> 00:07:16.970
Here's the flat-front lens,

00:07:16.994 --> 00:07:18.500
we have a concave lens

00:07:18.524 --> 00:07:19.781
and a convex lens.

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:21.910
And here you see all three together,

00:07:21.934 --> 00:07:23.819
showing us all these reflections.

00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:25.838
We tried turning them down,

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.558
we tried blocking them,

00:07:27.582 --> 00:07:29.022
nothing was working.

00:07:29.786 --> 00:07:30.937
You can see here,
