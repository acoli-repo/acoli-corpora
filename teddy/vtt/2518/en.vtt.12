00:05:58.677 --> 00:06:00.717
we're trying to create a believable world,

00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:04.688
one the audience can immerse
themselves in to experience the story.

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:08.067
We use science to create
something wonderful.

00:06:08.522 --> 00:06:12.818
We use story and artistic touch
to get us to a place of wonder.

00:06:13.578 --> 00:06:16.054
This guy, WALL-E, is a great
example of that.

00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:18.508
He finds beauty in the simplest things.

00:06:18.532 --> 00:06:21.621
But when he came in to lighting,
we knew we had a big problem.

00:06:21.978 --> 00:06:25.423
We got so geeked-out on making
WALL-E this convincing robot,

00:06:25.447 --> 00:06:28.827
that we made his binoculars
practically optically perfect.

00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:30.381
