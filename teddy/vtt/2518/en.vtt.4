00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:02.131
So it might look like this at first,

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.569
but as we adjust this and move that

00:02:04.593 --> 00:02:06.138
in weeks of work,

00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:08.377
in rough form it might look like this,

00:02:09.252 --> 00:02:11.401
and in final form, like this.

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:20.357
There's this moment in lighting
that made me fall utterly in love with it.

00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:22.131
It's where we go from this

00:02:22.807 --> 00:02:24.021
to this.

00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:26.581
It's the moment where
all the pieces come together,

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:29.208
and suddenly the world comes to life

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:31.620
as if it's an actual place that exists.
