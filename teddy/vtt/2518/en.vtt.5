00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:31.620
as if it's an actual place that exists.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.716
This moment never gets old,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.608
especially for that little seven-year-old
girl that wanted to be an artist.

00:02:37.632 --> 00:02:38.785
As I learned to light,

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.340
I learned about using light
to help tell story,

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:44.173
to set the time of day,

00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:46.810
to create the mood,

00:02:47.978 --> 00:02:49.879
to guide the audience's eye,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.009
how to make a character look appealing

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:54.990
or stand out in a busy set.

00:02:56.224 --> 00:02:57.534
Did you see WALL-E?

00:02:57.558 --> 00:02:58.597
(Laughter)

00:02:58.621 --> 00:02:59.834
There he is.
