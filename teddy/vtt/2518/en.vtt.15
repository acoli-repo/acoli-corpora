00:07:29.786 --> 00:07:30.937
You can see here,

00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:34.085
sometimes we needed something specific
reflected in his eyes --

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:35.260
usually Eve.

00:07:35.284 --> 00:07:38.815
So we couldn't just use some faked
abstract image on the lenses.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:40.989
So here we have Eve on the first lens,

00:07:41.013 --> 00:07:43.064
we put Eve on the second lens,

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.333
it's not working.

00:07:44.357 --> 00:07:45.517
We turn it down,

00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:47.217
it's still not working.

00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:49.571
And then we have our eureka moment.

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:53.411
We add a light to WALL-E
that accidentally leaks into his eyes.

00:07:54.092 --> 00:07:57.482
You can see it light up
these gray aperture blades.

00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:01.560
Suddenly, those aperture blades
are poking through that reflection
