00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:00.773
so that as it goes in and out
of those ribbons of light,

00:05:00.797 --> 00:05:02.310
it appears and disappears,

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:05.403
lending a subtle, magical
sparkle to the underwater.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.072
You can see how we're using the science --

00:05:09.096 --> 00:05:11.972
the physics of water,
light and movement --

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:14.042
to tether that artistic freedom.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.891
But we are not beholden to it.

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:18.714
We considered each of these elements

00:05:18.738 --> 00:05:21.752
and which ones had to be
scientifically accurate

00:05:21.776 --> 00:05:25.858
and which ones we could push and pull
to suit the story and the mood.

00:05:25.882 --> 00:05:29.691
We realized early on that color
was one we had some leeway with.

00:05:29.715 --> 00:05:32.327
So here's a traditionally colored
underwater scene.
