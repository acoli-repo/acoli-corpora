00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.713
As you can see,

00:03:02.737 --> 00:03:05.444
we can create any world that we want
inside the computer.

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:08.166
We can make a world with monsters,

00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:10.666
with robots that fall in love,

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.335
we can even make pigs fly.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.772
(Laughter)

00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:20.138
While this is an incredible thing,

00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:22.637
this untethered artistic freedom,

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.643
it can create chaos.

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:27.518
It can create unbelievable worlds,

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:29.026
unbelievable movement,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.200
things that are jarring to the audience.
