00:03:59.526 --> 00:04:01.133
One of the most critical elements

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:03.339
was how the light travels
through the water.

00:04:03.363 --> 00:04:06.159
So we coded up a light
that mimics this physics --

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:07.927
first, the visibility of the water,

00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:10.060
and then what happens with the color.

00:04:10.503 --> 00:04:14.045
Objects close to the eye
have their full, rich colors.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.272
As light travels deeper into the water,

00:04:16.296 --> 00:04:18.206
we lose the red wavelengths,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.574
then the green wavelengths,

00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:21.948
leaving us with blue at the far depths.

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:25.766
In this clip you can see
two other important elements.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.812
The first is the surge and swell,

00:04:27.836 --> 00:04:29.553
or the invisible underwater current

00:04:29.577 --> 00:04:32.762
that pushes the bits of particulate
around in the water.
