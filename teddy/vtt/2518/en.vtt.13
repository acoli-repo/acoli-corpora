(Laughter)

00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:35.322
His binoculars are one of the most
critical acting devices he has.

00:06:35.346 --> 00:06:38.888
He doesn't have a face or even
traditional dialogue, for that matter.

00:06:38.912 --> 00:06:41.839
So the animators were heavily
dependent on the binoculars

00:06:41.863 --> 00:06:44.116
to sell his acting and emotions.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.219
We started lighting and we realized

00:06:46.243 --> 00:06:50.457
the triple lenses inside his binoculars
were a mess of reflections.

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:53.042
He was starting to look glassy-eyed.

00:06:53.066 --> 00:06:54.790
(Laughter)

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:58.228
Now, glassy-eyed
is a fundamentally awful thing

00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:00.268
when you are trying
to convince an audience
