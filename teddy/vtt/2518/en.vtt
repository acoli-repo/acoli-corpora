00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.626
When I was seven years old,

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.761
some well-meaning adult asked me
what I wanted to be when I grew up.

00:00:06.785 --> 00:00:08.803
Proudly, I said: "An artist."

00:00:08.827 --> 00:00:10.188
"No, you don't," he said,

00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:12.494
"You can't make a living being an artist!"

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:15.990
My little seven-year-old
Picasso dreams were crushed.

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:17.686
But I gathered myself,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.569
went off in search of a new dream,

00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:22.451
eventually settling on being a scientist,

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:25.119
perhaps something like
the next Albert Einstein.

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:27.724
(Laughter)

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.087
I have always loved math and science,
