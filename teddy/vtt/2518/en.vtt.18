00:08:57.985 --> 00:09:01.551
when you find the key
to unlocking a robot's soul,

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:04.738
the moment when you discover
what you want to do with your life.

00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:08.437
The jellyfish in "Finding Nemo"
was one of those moments for me.

00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:12.052
There are scenes in every movie
that struggle to come together.

00:09:12.076 --> 00:09:14.011
This was one of those scenes.

00:09:14.035 --> 00:09:16.169
The director had a vision for this scene

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:20.001
based on some wonderful footage
of jellyfish in the South Pacific.

00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:22.996
As we went along,

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.473
we were floundering.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:26.586
The reviews with the director

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.299
turned from the normal
look-and-feel conversation

00:09:29.323 --> 00:09:33.450
into more and more questions
about numbers and percentages.
