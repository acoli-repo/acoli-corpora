00:09:58.149 --> 00:10:01.440
As I worked to balance
the blues and the pinks,

00:10:01.464 --> 00:10:04.280
the caustics dancing
on the jellyfish bells,

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:06.478
the undulating fog beams,

00:10:06.502 --> 00:10:08.924
something promising began to appear.

00:10:09.686 --> 00:10:12.913
I came in one morning and checked
the previous night's work.

00:10:12.937 --> 00:10:14.413
And I got excited.

00:10:14.437 --> 00:10:16.545
And then I showed it
to the lighting director

00:10:16.569 --> 00:10:17.744
and she got excited.

00:10:17.768 --> 00:10:22.184
Soon, I was showing to the director
in a dark room full of 50 people.

00:10:22.563 --> 00:10:23.826
In director review,

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.908
you hope you might get some nice words,

00:10:26.349 --> 00:10:28.645
then you get some notes
and fixes, generally.

00:10:29.408 --> 00:10:31.845
And then, hopefully, you get a final,
