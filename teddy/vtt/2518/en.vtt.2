00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.587
and stories I connected with,

00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:03.142
was pure magic for me.

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:06.015
Just two years later, I started working

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.058
at the place that made those films,
Pixar Animation Studios.

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:11.812
It was here I learned how
we actually execute those films.

00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:13.462
To create our movies,

00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:16.255
we create a three-dimensional
world inside the computer.

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:20.525
We start with a point that makes
a line that makes a face

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.257
that creates characters,

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.953
or trees and rocks
that eventually become a forest.

00:01:25.326 --> 00:01:27.438
And because it's
a three-dimensional world,

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.858
we can move a camera
around inside that world.
