00:05:29.715 --> 00:05:32.327
So here's a traditionally colored
underwater scene.

00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:35.192
But here, we can take Sydney Harbor
and push it fairly green

00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:37.476
to suit the sad mood of what's happening.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:41.574
In this scene, it's really important
we see deep into the underwater,

00:05:41.598 --> 00:05:44.265
so we understand what
the East Australian Current is,

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.677
that the turtles are diving into
and going on this roller coaster ride.

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:49.638
So we pushed the visibility of the water

00:05:49.662 --> 00:05:52.365
well past anything you would
ever see in real life.

00:05:52.843 --> 00:05:54.005
Because in the end,

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:58.653
we are not trying to recreate
the scientifically correct real world,

00:05:58.677 --> 00:06:00.717
we're trying to create a believable world,
