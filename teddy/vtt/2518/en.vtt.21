signaling to move on to the next stage.

00:10:34.462 --> 00:10:37.830
I gave my intro, and I played
the jellyfish scene.

00:10:38.703 --> 00:10:42.555
And the director was silent
for an uncomfortably long amount of time.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.747
Just long enough for me to think,

00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:47.627
"Oh no, this is doomed."

00:10:48.919 --> 00:10:50.679
And then he started clapping.

00:10:51.381 --> 00:10:53.773
And then the production
designer started clapping.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.384
And then the whole room was clapping.
