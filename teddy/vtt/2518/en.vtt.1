00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.087
I have always loved math and science,

00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:31.622
later, coding.

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:34.665
And so I decided to study
computer programming in college.

00:00:35.312 --> 00:00:36.463
In my junior year,

00:00:36.487 --> 00:00:40.278
my computer graphics professor
showed us these wonderful short films.

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:44.128
It was the first computer animation
any of us had ever seen.

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.346
I watched these films
in wonder, transfixed,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.581
fireworks going off in my head,

00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:52.403
thinking, "That is what
I want to do with my life."

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.539
The idea that all the math, science
and code I had been learning

00:00:56.563 --> 00:00:59.701
could come together to create
these worlds and characters

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.587
and stories I connected with,
