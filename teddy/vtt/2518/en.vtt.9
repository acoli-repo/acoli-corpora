00:04:29.577 --> 00:04:32.762
that pushes the bits of particulate
around in the water.

00:04:32.786 --> 00:04:34.803
The second is the caustics.

00:04:34.827 --> 00:04:36.337
These are the ribbons of light,

00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:38.385
like you might see
on the bottom of a pool,

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.959
that are created when the sun
bends through the crests

00:04:40.983 --> 00:04:43.657
of the ripples and waves
on the ocean's surface.

00:04:45.038 --> 00:04:46.336
Here we have the fog beams.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.015
These give us color depth cues,

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.134
but also tells which direction is up

00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:52.434
in shots where we don't
see the water surface.

00:04:52.788 --> 00:04:54.907
The other really cool thing
you can see here

00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:58.091
is that we lit that particulate
only with the caustics,

00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:00.773
so that as it goes in and out
of those ribbons of light,
