things that are jarring to the audience.

00:03:31.224 --> 00:03:33.985
So to combat this, we tether
ourselves with science.

00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:36.406
We use science and the world we know

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.780
as a backbone,

00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:41.278
to ground ourselves in something
relatable and recognizable.

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:44.335
"Finding Nemo" is an excellent
example of this.

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.004
A major portion of the movie
takes place underwater.

00:03:47.028 --> 00:03:49.278
But how do you make it look underwater?

00:03:49.302 --> 00:03:50.933
In early research and development,

00:03:50.957 --> 00:03:54.855
we took a clip of underwater footage
and recreated it in the computer.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.140
Then we broke it back down

00:03:56.164 --> 00:03:58.938
to see which elements make up
that underwater look.

00:03:59.526 --> 00:04:01.133
One of the most critical elements
