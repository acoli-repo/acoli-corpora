00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So often, we look at dollar terms --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
people making less than a dollar or two or three a day.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
income as only one variable.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Because really, it's a condition about choice,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the lack of freedom.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the understanding that I have.
