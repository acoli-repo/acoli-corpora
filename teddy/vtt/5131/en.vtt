When you think about money and your dreams

00:00:02.224 --> 00:00:03.950
and you're looking at your account,

00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:06.867
you're like, "My bank account
does not align with my dreams."

Financial health for a typical
American household can be stressful.

00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:18.075
We know that 46 percent
of all Americans would struggle

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.950
coming up with 400 dollars
in the event of an emergency.

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:24.950
And 60 percent of all Americans
will face that emergency

00:00:24.974 --> 00:00:26.284
within 12 months or less.

00:00:26.308 --> 00:00:29.200
When you ask the question,
"What does money mean to you,"

00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:32.450
most people will say things like,
"I feel anxious."
