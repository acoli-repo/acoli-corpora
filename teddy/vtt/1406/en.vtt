If you go on the TED website,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
you can currently find there

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
over a full week of TEDTalk videos,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
over 1.3 million

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
words of transcripts

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and millions of user ratings.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that's a huge amount of data.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it got me wondering:

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If you took all this data

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and put it through statistical analysis,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Could you create

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the ultimate TEDTalk?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
