00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.752
Imagine a farmer
growing coffee in Nkongsamba,

00:00:05.752 --> 00:00:07.670
in the Moungo region of Cameroon.

00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:10.173
Let’s call him Mr. Ewané.

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:14.177
Mr. Ewané lives
out of a small plot of land,

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:16.387
growing food to feed his family,

00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:18.890
and coffee, to earn a very modest income.

00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:23.644
While many of us in the Western world
debate about climate change,

00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:26.105
Mr. Ewané knows it is real.

00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:29.901
The rainy season is becoming more erratic,

00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:31.903
impacting his coffee production
