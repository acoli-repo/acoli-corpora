Today I'm going to talk
about technology and society.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.736
The Department of Transport
estimated that last year

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.840
35,000 people died
from traffic crashes in the US alone.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.840
Worldwide, 1.2 million people
die every year in traffic accidents.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.856
If there was a way we could eliminate
90 percent of those accidents,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.080
would you support it?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.016
Of course you would.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.695
This is what driverless car technology
promises to achieve
