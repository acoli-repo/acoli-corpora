00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.360
We learned directly how to struggle
through really tough medical decisions.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.895
The day we took Paul
into the hospital for the last time

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.960
was the most difficult day of my life.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.536
When he turned to me at the end

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.040
and said, "I'm ready,"

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.680
I knew that wasn't just a brave decision.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.600
It was the right one.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.560
Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.856
In that moment,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.480
the most important thing to Paul
