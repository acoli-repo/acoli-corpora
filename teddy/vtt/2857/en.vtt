A few days after my husband Paul
was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.856
we were lying in our bed at home,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.656
and Paul said,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.880
"It's going to be OK."

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.536
And I remember answering back,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.776
"Yes.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.560
We just don't know what OK means yet."

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.816
Paul and I had met as first-year
medical students at Yale.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.280
He was smart and kind and super funny.
