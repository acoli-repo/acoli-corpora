talking together through his choices --

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.256
those experiences taught me

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.536
that resilience does not mean
bouncing back to where you were before,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.240
or pretending that
the hard stuff isn't hard.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.120
It is so hard.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.440
It's painful, messy stuff.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.736
But it's the stuff.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.000
And I learned that when we
approach it together,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.800
we get to decide what success looks like.
