Paul's oncologist tailored his chemo

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.616
so he could continue
working as a neurosurgeon,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.080
which initially we thought
was totally impossible.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.816
When the cancer advanced

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.360
and Paul shifted from surgery to writing,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.536
his palliative care doctor
prescribed a stimulant medication

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.160
so he could be more focused.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.280
They asked Paul about
his priorities and his worries.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.720
They asked him what trade-offs
he was willing to make.
