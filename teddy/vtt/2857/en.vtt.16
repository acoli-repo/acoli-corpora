00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.256
And his answer astounded me.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.976
He said,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.240
"Wouldn't it be great if it did?"

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.240
And we did it.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.400
Not in order to spite cancer,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.376
but because we were learning

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.560
that living fully
means accepting suffering.
