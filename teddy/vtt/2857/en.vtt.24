00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.616
Are you most worried
about the quality of that time,

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.840
rather than quantity?

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.000
Both of those choices
are thoughtful and brave,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.040
but for all of us, it's our choice.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.920
That's true at the end of life

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.496
and for medical care throughout our lives.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.376
If you're pregnant,
do you want genetic screening?

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.320
Is a knee replacement right or not?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.920
Do you want to do dialysis
in a clinic or at home?

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.800
The answer is:

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.840
it depends.
