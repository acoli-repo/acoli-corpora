00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.456
Early in Paul's illness,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.840
we agreed we would
just keep saying things out loud.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.696
Tasks like making a will,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.376
or completing our advance directives --

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.976
tasks that I had always avoided --

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.280
were not as daunting as they once seemed.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.399
I realized that completing
an advance directive is an act of love --

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.040
like a wedding vow.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.976
A pact to take care of someone,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.296
codifying the promise

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.240
that til death do us part,
