When Paul said, "It's going to be OK,"

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.680
that didn't mean
that we could cure his illness.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:42.120
Instead, we learned to accept
both joy and sadness at the same time;

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.536
to uncover beauty and purpose

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.720
both despite and because we are all born

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.720
and we all die.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.080
And for all the sadness
and sleepless nights,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.320
it turns out there is joy.
