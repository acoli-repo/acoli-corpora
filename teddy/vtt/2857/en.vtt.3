a CT scan revealed tumors
in Paul's lungs and in his bones.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.240
We had both cared for patients
with devastating diagnoses;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.560
now it was our turn.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.320
We lived with Paul's illness
for 22 months.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.440
He wrote a memoir about facing mortality.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.480
I gave birth to our daughter Cady,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.920
and we loved her and each other.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.360
We learned directly how to struggle
through really tough medical decisions.
