He was smart and kind and super funny.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.696
He used to keep a gorilla suit
in the trunk of his car,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.136
and he'd say, "It's for emergencies only."

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.360
(Laughter)

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.920
I fell in love with Paul as I watched
the care he took with his patients.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.576
He stayed late talking with them,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.056
seeking to understand
the experience of illness

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.200
and not just its technicalities.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.776
He later told me he fell in love with me

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.840
when he saw me cry over an EKG
of a heart that had ceased beating.
