00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:00.345
grab this distributed knowledge

00:09:00.345 --> 00:09:06.409
in society and use it to make better
and more fair decisions.

00:09:06.409 --> 00:09:09.697
So we reached out to traditional political parties

00:09:09.697 --> 00:09:11.892
and we offered them DemocracyOS.

00:09:11.892 --> 00:09:16.216
We said, "Look, here you have a platform
that you can use to build

00:09:16.216 --> 00:09:20.124
a two-way conversation with your constituencies."

00:09:20.124 --> 00:09:22.687
And yes, we failed.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:25.683
We failed big time.

00:09:25.683 --> 00:09:30.009
We were sent to play 
outside like little kids.
