very, very best to interact with 19th century-designed
institutions

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:40.395
that are based on an information technology of the 15th century.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:41.806
Let's have a look at some of the

00:00:41.806 --> 00:00:44.242
characteristics of this system.

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:47.747
First of all, it's designed for an information technology

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:50.846
that's over 500 years old.

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:53.082
And the best possible system

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:54.617

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:58.841
is one where the few make daily decisions

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.275
in the name of the many.
