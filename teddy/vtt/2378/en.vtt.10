00:05:02.846 --> 00:05:08.244
to successfully articulate an alternative
to what we're seeing

00:05:08.244 --> 00:05:13.061
and find the consensus and build 
the alliances that are needed

00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:15.079
to make it happen.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:17.575
And so the risk that we face

00:05:17.575 --> 00:05:21.208
is that we can create these huge power vacuums

00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:25.295
that will very quickly get filled up by de facto

00:05:25.295 --> 00:05:28.176
powers, like the military or highly

00:05:28.176 --> 00:05:31.075
motivated and already organized groups
