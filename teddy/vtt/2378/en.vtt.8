00:03:58.082 --> 00:04:01.734
of our modern democracies, "No taxation

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:04.037
without representation,"

00:04:04.037 --> 00:04:11.168
can now be updated to "No representation
without a conversation."

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:15.704
We want our seat at the table.

00:04:15.704 --> 00:04:18.010
And rightly so.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.390
But in order to be part of this conversation,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.901
we need to know what we want to do next,

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:27.108
because political action is being able

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:29.429
to move from agitation

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:31.293
to construction.
