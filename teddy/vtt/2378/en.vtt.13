Two years ago, with a group of friends
from Argentina,

00:06:31.438 --> 00:06:35.487
we started thinking, "how can 
we get our representatives,

00:06:35.487 --> 00:06:37.371
our elected representatives,

00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:41.719
to represent us?"

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:45.724
Marshall McLuhan once said that politics

00:06:45.724 --> 00:06:50.419
is solving today's problems with yesterday's tools.

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.933
So the question that motivated us was,

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:56.827
can we try and solve some of today's problems

00:06:56.827 --> 00:07:00.929
with the tools that we use every single
day of our lives?
