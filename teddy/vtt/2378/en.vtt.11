00:05:28.176 --> 00:05:31.075
motivated and already organized groups

00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:34.745
that generally lie on the extremes.

00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:36.697
But our democracy is neither

00:05:36.697 --> 00:05:39.466
just a matter of voting once every

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:40.721
couple of years.

00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:46.657
But it's not either the ability to bring millions
onto the streets.

00:05:46.657 --> 00:05:49.478
So the question I'd like to raise here,

00:05:49.478 --> 00:05:53.000
and I do believe it's the most important 
question we need to answer,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.357
is this one:

00:05:54.357 --> 00:05:58.036
If Internet is the new printing press,

00:05:58.036 --> 00:06:02.872
then what is democracy for the Internet era?
