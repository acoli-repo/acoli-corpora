00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.275
in the name of the many.

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:05.810
And the many get to vote once every 
couple of years.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.159
In the second place, the costs of

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.451
participating in this system are

00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:10.658
incredibly high.

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:13.700
You either have to have a fair 
bit of money

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.052
and influence, or you have to devote your entire

00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:19.890
life to politics.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830
You have to become a party member

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.448
and slowly start working up the ranks

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:29.364
until maybe, one day, you'll get 
to sit at a table

00:01:29.364 --> 00:01:31.933
where a decision is being made.
