00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:30.140
voting on a certain issue,

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.024
you can always delegate your vote

00:08:32.024 --> 00:08:33.767
to someone else, allowing

00:08:33.767 --> 00:08:39.346
for a dynamic and emerging social leadership.

00:08:39.346 --> 00:08:40.729
It suddenly became very easy for us

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.444
to simply compare these results

00:08:43.444 --> 00:08:45.148
with how our representatives were

00:08:45.148 --> 00:08:46.551
voting in Congress.

00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:48.984
But, it also became very evident that

00:08:48.984 --> 00:08:52.942
technology was not going to do the trick.

00:08:52.942 --> 00:08:54.821
What we needed to do to was to find

00:08:54.821 --> 00:08:57.441
actors that were able to

00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:00.345
grab this distributed knowledge
