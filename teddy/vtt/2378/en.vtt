I have the feeling that we can all agree

00:00:03.851 --> 00:00:06.078
that we're moving towards a new

00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:08.943
model of the state and society.

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:13.424
But, we're absolutely clueless as to what this is

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:15.110
or what it should be.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.137
It seems like we need to have

00:00:17.137 --> 00:00:20.139
a conversation about democracy

00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:22.494
in our day and age.

00:00:22.494 --> 00:00:24.990
Let's think about it this way:

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.976
We are 21st-century citizens, doing our

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:35.072
very, very best to interact with 19th century-designed
institutions
