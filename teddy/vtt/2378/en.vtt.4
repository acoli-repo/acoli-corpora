WEBVTT

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.456
allows us to participate globally
in any conversation,

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:07.609
our barriers of information are completely lowered

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:11.088
and we can, more than ever before,

00:02:11.088 --> 00:02:14.766
express our desires and our concerns.

00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:17.519
Our political system remains the same

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.135
for the past 200 years

00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:26.918
and expects us to be contented with being 
simply passive recipients

00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:28.661
of a monologue.

00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:31.104
So, it's really not surprising that
