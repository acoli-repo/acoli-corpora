WEBVTT

00:09:58.044 --> 00:10:00.869
and in August last year, we founded

00:10:00.869 --> 00:10:02.965
our own political party,

00:10:02.965 --> 00:10:04.078
El Partido de la Red,

00:10:04.078 --> 00:10:08.250
or the Net Party, in the city of 
Buenos Aires.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.927
And taking an even bigger leap of faith,

00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:16.173
we ran for elections in October last year

00:10:16.173 --> 00:10:17.769
with this idea:

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:20.366
if we want a seat in Congress,

00:10:20.366 --> 00:10:22.384
our candidate, our representatives

00:10:22.384 --> 00:10:25.758
were always going to vote according to

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:29.267
what citizens decided on DemocracyOS.

00:10:29.267 --> 00:10:32.119
Every single project that got introduced
