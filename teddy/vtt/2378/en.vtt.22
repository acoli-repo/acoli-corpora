00:10:59.105 --> 00:11:03.193
we were radically changing the way a political party

00:11:03.193 --> 00:11:04.612
makes its decisions.

00:11:04.612 --> 00:11:08.115
For the first time, we were making our decisions

00:11:08.115 --> 00:11:10.868
together with those who we were

00:11:10.868 --> 00:11:15.247
affecting directly by those decisions.

00:11:15.247 --> 00:11:18.985
It was a very, very bold move for a two-month-old party

00:11:18.985 --> 00:11:20.664
in the city of Buenos Aires.

00:11:20.664 --> 00:11:22.239
But it got attention.

00:11:22.239 --> 00:11:26.952
We got 22,000 votes, that's 1.2 percent of the votes,

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:31.128
and we came in second for the local options.
