00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:31.383
gets immediately translated and explained

00:07:31.383 --> 00:07:34.318
in plain language on this platform.

00:07:34.318 --> 00:07:37.614
But we all know that social change

00:07:37.614 --> 00:07:40.372
is not going to come from just knowing

00:07:40.372 --> 00:07:41.644
more information,

00:07:41.644 --> 00:07:44.143
but from doing something with it.

00:07:44.143 --> 00:07:46.362
So better access to information

00:07:46.362 --> 00:07:48.693
should lead to a conversation

00:07:48.693 --> 00:07:50.544
about what we're going to do next,

00:07:50.544 --> 00:07:52.626
and DemocracyOS allows for that.

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:54.912
Because we believe that democracy is

00:07:54.912 --> 00:07:56.957
not just a matter of stacking up

00:07:56.957 --> 00:07:59.776
preferences, one on top of each other,

00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:03.484
but that our healthy and robust public debate
