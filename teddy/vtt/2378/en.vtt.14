00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.255
DemocracyOS is an open-source web application

that is designed to become a bridge

00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:16.531
between citizens and their elected representatives

00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:22.239
to make it easier for us to participate 
from our everyday lives.

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:25.578
