Knowing that this is about
fostering the good

00:13:31.453 --> 00:13:35.092
just as much as trying to shelter
yourself from the bad

00:13:35.116 --> 00:13:37.180
had a very calming effect on me.

00:13:37.753 --> 00:13:39.209
So in that sense,

00:13:39.233 --> 00:13:42.923
I hope today I told you
mostly good and helpful things,

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.493
and thank you for your time,

00:13:44.517 --> 00:13:45.928
for listening to me.

00:13:45.952 --> 00:13:48.761
