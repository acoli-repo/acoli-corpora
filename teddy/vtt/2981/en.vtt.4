00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:00.283
We have 100 trillion bacteria
doing all sorts of things --

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:01.808
producing little molecules.

00:02:01.832 --> 00:02:04.131
Then there's about 20 different hormones,

00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:07.913
so we are on a very different level
than our genitals, for example.

00:02:07.937 --> 00:02:11.058
And the nervous system
of our gut is so complex

00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:12.810
that when we cut out a piece,

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:15.161
it's independent enough
that when we poke it,

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:17.533
it mumbles back at us, friendly.

00:02:17.557 --> 00:02:19.579
(Laughter)

00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:25.068
But at least those reasons are also
the reasons why it's so fascinating

00:02:25.092 --> 00:02:26.460
and important.

00:02:27.295 --> 00:02:30.547
It took me three steps to love the gut.
