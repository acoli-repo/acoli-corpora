00:08:27.435 --> 00:08:30.661
deliver information
from our gut to our brain.

00:08:31.296 --> 00:08:33.250
And when you think about it a little bit,

00:08:33.274 --> 00:08:36.493
it does make sense,
because our brain is very isolated.

00:08:36.902 --> 00:08:41.247
It's in this bony skull
surrounded by a thick skin,

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:44.258
and it needs information
to put together a feeling

00:08:44.282 --> 00:08:47.419
of "How am I, as a whole body, doing?"

00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:52.319
And the gut, actually, is possibly
the most important advisor for the brain

00:08:52.343 --> 00:08:55.050
because it's our largest sensory organ,

00:08:55.074 --> 00:08:58.846
collecting information not only
on the quality of our nutrients,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.962
but really also on how are so many
of our immune cells doing,
