00:06:29.877 --> 00:06:32.803
Or this weird, crooked shape
of our stomach --

00:06:32.827 --> 00:06:34.436
a bit Quasimodo-ish.

00:06:34.865 --> 00:06:38.173
This actually makes us be able
to put pressure on our belly

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.368
without vomiting,

00:06:39.392 --> 00:06:40.670
like when we're laughing

00:06:40.694 --> 00:06:42.043
and when we're doing sports,

00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:45.383
because the pressure will go up
and not so much sideways.

00:06:45.407 --> 00:06:47.292
This also creates this air bubble

00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:51.511
that's usually always very visible
in X-rays, for example,

00:06:51.535 --> 00:06:53.328
and can sometimes, with some people,

00:06:53.352 --> 00:06:55.193
when it gets too big,

00:06:55.217 --> 00:06:58.445
create discomfort
or even some sensations of pain.

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:00.619
But for most of the people,
is just results
