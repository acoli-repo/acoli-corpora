00:10:58.469 --> 00:11:03.343
Step three took me further
away from our body,

00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:06.468
and to really understanding
bacteria differently.

00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:10.233
The research we have today
is creating a new definition

00:11:10.257 --> 00:11:12.480
of what real cleanliness is.

00:11:13.366 --> 00:11:16.899
And it's not the hygiene hypothesis --

00:11:16.923 --> 00:11:18.304
I think many maybe know this.

00:11:18.328 --> 00:11:21.870
So it states that when you have
too little microbes in your environment

00:11:21.894 --> 00:11:23.495
because you clean all the time,

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:25.121
that's not really a good thing,

00:11:25.145 --> 00:11:28.819
because people get more allergies
or autoimmune diseases then.

00:11:28.843 --> 00:11:31.061
So I knew this hypothesis,
