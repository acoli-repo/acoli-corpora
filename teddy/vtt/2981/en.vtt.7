00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:30.152
they're being delivered
to the inner one first.

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:32.622
This inner one will open in a reflex

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:34.776
and let through a little bit for testing.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.453
(Laughter)

00:03:36.477 --> 00:03:38.682
So, there are sensory cells

00:03:38.706 --> 00:03:44.015
that will analyze what has been delivered:
Is it gaseous or is it solid?

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.134
And they will then send
this information up to our brain,

00:03:47.158 --> 00:03:49.318
and this is the moment
when our brain knows,

00:03:49.342 --> 00:03:51.339

00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:53.000
(Laughter)

00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:56.781
The brain will then do
what it's designed to do

00:03:56.805 --> 00:03:58.569
with its amazing consciousness.

00:03:58.593 --> 00:04:01.362
It will mediate with our surroundings,
