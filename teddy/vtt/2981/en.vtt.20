And maybe -- because science is not
clear on that right now --

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:03.978
it's really just that the brain
is feeling sympathy with their gut.

00:10:05.117 --> 00:10:09.575
This has yet to grow in evidence
until it can come to practice.

00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:12.190
But just knowing about
these kinds of research

00:10:12.214 --> 00:10:14.260
that's out there at the moment

00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:16.499
helps me in my daily life.

00:10:16.523 --> 00:10:18.843
And it makes me think
differently of my moods

00:10:18.867 --> 00:10:21.679
and not externalize so much all the time.

00:10:21.703 --> 00:10:25.972
I feel oftentimes during the day
we are a brain and a screen,

00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:28.823
and we will tend to look
for answers right there

00:10:28.847 --> 00:10:31.122
and maybe the work is stupid
or our neighbor --
