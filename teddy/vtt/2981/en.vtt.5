00:02:27.295 --> 00:02:30.547
It took me three steps to love the gut.

00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:34.353
So today, I invite you to follow me
on those three steps.

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:37.946
The very first was just looking at it

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.010
and asking questions
like, "How does it work?"

00:02:41.034 --> 00:02:45.208
and "Why does it have to look
so weird for that sometimes?"

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.467
And it actually wasn't me asking
the first kind of these questions,

00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:50.772
but my roommate.

00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:53.554
After one heavy night of partying,

00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:56.723
he came into our shared-room kitchen,

00:02:56.747 --> 00:03:01.822
and he said, "Giulia, you study medicine.
How does pooping work?"
