00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:33.012
like we're all trying
to figure out this magic trick,

00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:35.402
but nobody's checking out the magician,

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:36.711
just because he has, like,

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:39.113
an embarrassing hairstyle or something.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.785
And actually,

00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:46.326
there are reasons science
disliked the gut for a long time;

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.501
I have to say this.

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:48.736
So, it's complex.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.294
There's a lot of surface area --

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.522
about 40 times the area of our skin.

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:54.125
Then, in such a tight pipe,

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.072
there are so many immune cells
that are being trained there.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:00.283
We have 100 trillion bacteria
doing all sorts of things --
