We know this, for example,
in stressful situations,

00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:05.048
when there are transmitters from the brain
that are being sensed by our gut,

00:08:05.072 --> 00:08:08.642
so the gut will try to lower all the work,

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:13.184
and not be working
and taking away blood and energy

00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:15.495
to save energy for problem-solving.

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:19.016
This can go as far as nervous vomiting
or nervous diarrhea

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.155
to get rid of food that it then
doesn't want to digest.

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.129
Maybe more interestingly,

00:08:24.153 --> 00:08:27.411
90 percent of the nervous fibers
that connect gut and brain

00:08:27.435 --> 00:08:30.661
deliver information
from our gut to our brain.
