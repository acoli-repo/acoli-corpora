and maybe the work is stupid
or our neighbor --

00:10:31.146 --> 00:10:33.484
but really, moods can also
come from within.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.345
And just knowing this helped me,

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:38.599
for example, when I sometimes

and make myself a tea,

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.170
I think it's been
surprisingly good for me.
