I thought: Could the gut have
something to do with it?

00:07:31.077 --> 00:07:34.293
And I frantically started searching
if there were scientific papers

00:07:34.317 --> 00:07:36.880
on the connection of gut and brain.

00:07:36.904 --> 00:07:39.262
And to my surprise, I found many.

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:43.123
It turns out it's maybe not as simple
as we sometimes think.

00:07:43.147 --> 00:07:45.494
We tend to think our brain
makes these commands

00:07:45.518 --> 00:07:47.677
and then sends them down
to the other organs,

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.393
and they all have to listen.

00:07:49.417 --> 00:07:54.611
But really, it's more that 10 percent
of the nerves that connect brain and gut

00:07:54.635 --> 00:07:57.850
deliver information
from the brain to the gut.

00:07:57.874 --> 00:08:01.005
We know this, for example,
in stressful situations,
