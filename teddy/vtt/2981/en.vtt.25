So what really the whole deal is
when you look at a clean gut,

00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:36.615
it's about having good bacteria,
enough of them,

00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:37.874
and then some bad.

00:12:38.444 --> 00:12:40.332
Our immune system needs the bad, too,

00:12:40.356 --> 00:12:42.894
so it knows what it's looking out for.

00:12:42.918 --> 00:12:46.353
So I started having this different
perspective on cleanliness

00:12:46.377 --> 00:12:47.763
and a few weeks later,

00:12:47.787 --> 00:12:49.919
I held a talk at my university,

00:12:49.943 --> 00:12:52.039
and I made a mistake by 1,000.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:54.497
And I went home and I realized
in that moment,

00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:57.536
I was like, "Ah! I made
a mistake by 1,000.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.643
Oh God, that's so much,
and that's so embarrassing."
