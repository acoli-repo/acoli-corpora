but really also on how are so many
of our immune cells doing,

00:09:02.986 --> 00:09:05.884
or things like the hormones
in our blood that it can sense.

00:09:05.908 --> 00:09:08.990
And it can package this information,
and send it up to the brain.

00:09:09.014 --> 00:09:13.759
It can, there, not reach areas
like visual cortex or word formations --

00:09:13.783 --> 00:09:15.578
otherwise, when we digest,

00:09:15.602 --> 00:09:20.099
we would see funny colors
or we would make funny noises -- no.

00:09:20.123 --> 00:09:22.990
But it can reach areas
for things like morality,

00:09:23.014 --> 00:09:24.873
fear or emotional processing

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.836
or areas for self-awareness.

00:09:27.377 --> 00:09:28.824
So it does make sense

00:09:28.848 --> 00:09:32.496
that when our body and our brain
are putting together this feeling
