Since our outer sphincter and the brain
is connected with nervous cells,

00:04:31.418 --> 00:04:33.436
they coordinate, cooperate,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.781
and they put it back in a waiting line --

00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:38.030
(Laughter)

00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:39.232
for other times,

00:04:39.256 --> 00:04:42.136
like, for example, when we're at home
sitting on the couch,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.719
we have nothing better to do,

00:04:43.743 --> 00:04:45.020
we are free to go.

00:04:45.044 --> 00:04:46.906
(Laughter)

00:04:49.954 --> 00:04:54.045
Us humans are actually one
of the very few animals that do this

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.816
in such an advanced and clean way.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.425
To be honest, I had some newfound respect

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.980
for that nice, inner sphincter dude --
