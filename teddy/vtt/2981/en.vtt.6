00:02:56.747 --> 00:03:01.822
and he said, "Giulia, you study medicine.
How does pooping work?"

00:03:01.846 --> 00:03:03.254
(Laughter)

00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.292
And I did study medicine
but I had no idea,

00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:09.516
so I had to go up to my room
and look it up in different books.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.528
And I found something interesting,
I thought, at that time.

00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:16.409
So it turns out, we don't only have
this outer sphincter,

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:18.341
we also have an inner sphincter muscle.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.758
The outer sphincter we all know,
we can control it,

00:03:20.782 --> 00:03:22.309
we know what's going on there;

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:23.925
the inner one, we really don't.

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.145
So what happens is,

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.634
when there are leftovers from digestion,

00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:30.152
they're being delivered
to the inner one first.
