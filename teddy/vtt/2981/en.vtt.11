00:05:26.872 --> 00:05:31.107
looking closely at something
I might have shied away from --

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:34.148
maybe the weirdest part of myself --

00:05:34.172 --> 00:05:36.396
left me feeling more fearless,

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.644
and also appreciating myself more.

00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:41.183
And I think this happens a lot of times

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:43.221
when you look at the gut, actually.

00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:45.992
Like those funny rumbling
noises that happen

00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:47.649
when you're in a group of friends

00:05:47.673 --> 00:05:49.399
or at the office conference table,

00:05:49.423 --> 00:05:51.461
going, like, "Merrr, merrr..."

00:05:52.815 --> 00:05:54.821
This is not because we're hungry.

00:05:54.845 --> 00:05:58.772
This is because our small intestine
is actually a huge neat freak,

00:05:58.796 --> 00:06:03.041
and it takes the time in between digestion
to clean everything up,
