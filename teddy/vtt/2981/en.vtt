A few years ago,

00:00:02.598 --> 00:00:05.357
I always had this thing happening to me,

00:00:05.381 --> 00:00:07.141
especially at family gatherings

00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:10.295
like teas with aunts and uncles
or something like this.

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.694
When people come up to you,

00:00:11.718 --> 00:00:14.515
and they ask you,
"So, what are you doing?"

00:00:15.068 --> 00:00:18.959
And I would have
this magical one-word reply,

00:00:18.983 --> 00:00:21.175
which would make everybody happy:

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.525
"Medicine.

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:23.975
I'm going to be a doctor."

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.469
Very easy, that's it,
everybody's happy and pleased.

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:29.087
And it could be so easy,

00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:33.678
but this effect really only lasts
for 30 seconds with me,
