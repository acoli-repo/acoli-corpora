00:11:28.843 --> 00:11:31.061
So I knew this hypothesis,

00:11:31.085 --> 00:11:32.938
and I thought I wouldn't learn so much

00:11:32.962 --> 00:11:35.426
from looking at cleanliness in the gut.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.777
But I was wrong.

It turns out,

When we look at the facts,

00:11:47.532 --> 00:11:52.372
95 percent of all bacteria on this planet
don't harm us -- they can't,

they don't have the genes to do so.

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:56.937
Many, actually, help us a lot,

00:11:56.961 --> 00:12:00.198
and scientists at the moment
are looking into things like:
