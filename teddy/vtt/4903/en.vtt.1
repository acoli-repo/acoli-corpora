00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.683
the smallest things in the universe.

00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:35.742
Particles interact with each other according
to a theory called the “Standard Model”.

00:00:35.742 --> 00:00:39.040
The Standard Model is a remarkably 
elegant encapsulation

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.397
of the strange quantum world of
indivisible, infinitely small particles.

00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:47.593
It also covers the forces that govern
how particles move,

00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:52.216
interact, and bind together to give shape
to the world around us.

00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:53.726
So how does it work?

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:55.941
Zooming in on the fragments of the cup,

00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:59.637
we see molecules, made of atoms
bound up together.

00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:03.965
A molecule is the smallest unit 
of any chemical compound.
