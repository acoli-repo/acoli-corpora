All these particles also have 
antimatter versions,

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:05.547
which have the opposite charge 
but are otherwise identical.

00:04:05.547 --> 00:04:10.150
Matter and antimatter particles are 
produced in pairs in high-energy collisions,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.505
and they annihilate each other
when they meet.

00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:16.226
The final particle of the Standard Model
is the Higgs boson

00:04:16.226 --> 00:04:20.019
– a quantum ripple in the background 
energy field of the universe.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.584
Interacting with this field is how all the
fundamental matter particles acquire mass,

00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:27.759
according to the Standard Model.
