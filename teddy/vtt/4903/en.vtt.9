00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.788
The ATLAS Experiment on 
the Large Hadron Collider

00:04:30.788 --> 00:04:33.589
is studying the Standard Model in-depth.

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:37.913
By taking precise measurements of the particles
and forces that make up the universe, 


00:04:37.913 --> 00:04:40.911
ATLAS physicists can look for
answers to mysteries

00:04:40.911 --> 00:04:43.421
not explained by the Standard Model.

00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:46.135
For example, how does gravity fit in?

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:50.456
What is the real relationship between 
force carriers and matter particles?

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.389
How can we describe “Dark Matter”,

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.649
which makes up most of the mass in the 
universe but remains unaccounted for?

00:04:56.649 --> 00:05:01.240
While the Standard Model provides a beautiful 
explanation for the world around us,
