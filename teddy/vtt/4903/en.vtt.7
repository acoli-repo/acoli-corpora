WEBVTT

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:30.227
a vital part of the fusion interactions 
that drive the Sun.

00:03:30.227 --> 00:03:32.586
To observe the W and Z directly,

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:36.972
we needed the high energy collisions
provided by particle accelerators.

00:03:36.972 --> 00:03:40.467
There’s another kind of Standard Model 
particle, called neutrinos.

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:44.915
These only interact with other particles
through the weak force.

00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:50.962
Trillions of neutrinos, many generated
by the sun, fly through us every second.

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:54.920
Measurements of weak interactions found that
there are different kinds of neutrinos

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.744
associated with the electron, 
muon, and tau.

00:03:58.744 --> 00:04:02.008
All these particles also have 
antimatter versions,
