00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:30.102
It was the first Standard Model
particle ever discovered.

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:34.235
Electrons are bound to an atom’s 
nucleus by electromagnetism.

00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:38.066
They attract each other by exchanging 
particles called photons,

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:42.130
which are quanta of light that carry 
the electromagnetic force,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.401
one of the fundamental 
forces of the Standard Model.

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:50.882
The nucleus has more secrets to reveal, 
as it contains protons and neutrons.

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:55.039
Though once thought to be fundamental 
particles on their own, in 1968

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.369
physicists found that protons and neutrons
are actually made of quarks,

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.673
which are indivisible.
