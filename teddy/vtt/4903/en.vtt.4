00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.673
which are indivisible.

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:05.732
A proton contains two “up” quarks 
and one “down” quark.

00:02:05.732 --> 00:02:09.652
A neutron contains two down 
quarks and one up.

00:02:09.652 --> 00:02:12.803
The nucleus is held together
by the strong force, 


00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:15.979
another fundamental force 
of the Standard Model.

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.573
Just as photons carry
the electromagnetic force,

00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:22.302
particles called gluons
carry the strong force.

00:02:22.302 --> 00:02:24.862
Electrons, together with up
and down quarks,

00:02:24.862 --> 00:02:29.754
seem to be all we need to build atoms 
and therefore describe normal matter.

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:34.252
However, high energy experiments reveal 
that there are actually six quarks–
