00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:34.252
However, high energy experiments reveal 
that there are actually six quarks–

00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:39.693
down &amp; up, strange &amp; charm,
and bottom &amp; top

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:42.245
- and they come in a wide range of masses.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.101
The same was found for electrons,

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:48.187
which have heavier siblings
called the muon and the tau.

00:02:48.187 --> 00:02:51.459
Why are there three (and only three) 
different versions

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.469
of each of these particles?

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.281
This remains a mystery.

00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:59.316
These heavy particles are only produced, 
for very brief moments,

00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:03.757
in high energy collisions,
and are not seen in everyday life.
