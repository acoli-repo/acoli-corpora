00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:03.757
in high energy collisions,
and are not seen in everyday life.

00:03:03.757 --> 00:03:07.423
This is because they decay very 
quickly into the lighter particles.

00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:11.839
Such decays involve the exchange 
of force-carrying particles,

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:16.338
called the W and Z, which
– unlike the photon – have mass.

00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:21.171
They carry the weak force, 
the final force of the Standard Model.

00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:25.928
This same force allows protons and 
neutrons to transform into each other,

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:30.227
a vital part of the fusion interactions 
that drive the Sun.
