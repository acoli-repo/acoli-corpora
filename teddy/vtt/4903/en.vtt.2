A molecule is the smallest unit 
of any chemical compound.

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:08.419
An atom is the smallest unit of any 
element in the periodic table.

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:11.873
But the atom is not the 
smallest unit of matter.

00:01:11.873 --> 00:01:15.842
Experiments found that each atom 
has a tiny, dense nucleus,

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:20.114
surrounded by a cloud 
of even tinier electrons.

00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:22.267
The electron is, as far as we know,

00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:26.031
one of the fundamental, indivisible 
building blocks of the universe.

00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:30.102
It was the first Standard Model
particle ever discovered.
