If you were to take any everyday object, 
say a coffee cup, and break it in half,

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:16.412
then in half again, and keep carrying on, 
where would you end up?

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:18.143
Could you keep on going forever?

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:21.157
Or would you find a set of 
indivisible building blocks

00:00:21.157 --> 00:00:23.679
out of which everything is made?

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.400
Physicists have found the latter- that 
matter is made of fundamental particles,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.683
the smallest things in the universe.
