00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:31.909
in a robot at the same size scale?

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.513
Well, first we need to figure out
how to make them move

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:35.923
when they're so small.

00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:38.223
We need mechanisms like legs
and efficient motors

00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:40.072
in order to support that locomotion,

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:42.563
and we need the sensors,
power and control

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.525
in order to pull everything together
in a semi-intelligent ant robot.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:49.071
And finally, to make
these things really functional,

00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:53.019
we want a lot of them working together
in order to do bigger things.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.710
So I'll start with mobility.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.871
Insects move around amazingly well.

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:00.559
