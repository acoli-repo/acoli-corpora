00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.228
We all move in this 
kind of bouncy way when we run.

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:06.513
But when I'm really small, 
the forces between my feet and the ground

00:03:06.513 --> 00:03:09.288
are going to affect my locomotion
a lot more than my mass,

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:11.642
which is what causes that bouncy motion.

00:03:11.642 --> 00:03:13.317
So this guy doesn't work quite yet,

00:03:13.317 --> 00:03:16.392
but we do have slightly larger versions
that do run around.

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:20.277
So this is about a centimeter cubed,
a centimeter on a side, so very tiny,

00:03:20.277 --> 00:03:23.179
and we've gotten this to run
about 10 body lengths per second,

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:24.565
so 10 centimeters per second.

00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:26.598
It's pretty quick for a little, small guy,

00:03:26.598 --> 00:03:28.960
and that's really only limited 
by our test setup.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.607
But this gives you some idea
of how it works right now.
