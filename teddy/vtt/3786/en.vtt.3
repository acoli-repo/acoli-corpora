00:01:29.403 --> 00:01:32.153
has been to combine
rigid and soft materials

00:01:32.153 --> 00:01:34.367
in very, very small mechanisms.

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:37.532
So this jumping mechanism
is about four millimeters on a side,

00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:39.220
so really tiny.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.058
The hard material here is silicon,
and the soft material is silicone rubber.

00:01:43.058 --> 00:01:45.953
And the basic idea is that
we're going to compress this,

00:01:45.953 --> 00:01:48.654
store energy in the springs,
and then release it to jump.

00:01:48.654 --> 00:01:52.037
So there's no motors
on board this right now, no power.

00:01:52.037 --> 00:01:54.800
This is actuated with a method
that we call in my lab

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.472
"graduate student with tweezers."
(Laughter)

00:01:57.472 --> 00:01:59.306
So what you'll see in the next video

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:02.333
is this guy doing
amazingly well for its jumps.
