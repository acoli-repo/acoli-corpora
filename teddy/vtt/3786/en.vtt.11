and they build these incredible
eight-meter-high mounds,

00:05:31.108 --> 00:05:35.196
effectively well ventilated
apartment buildings for other termites

00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:37.287
in Africa and Australia.

00:05:37.287 --> 00:05:39.717
So I think I've given you
some of the possibilities

00:05:39.717 --> 00:05:42.154
of what we can do with these small robots.

00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:46.561
And we've made some advances so far,
but there's still a long way to go,

00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:49.419
and hopefully some of you
can contribute to that destination.

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.187
Thanks very much.

00:05:51.187 --> 00:05:53.391
