00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.139
So there was that big flash,

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.336
and you can see the robot
jumping up through the air.

00:04:33.336 --> 00:04:36.368
So there's no tethers on this,
no wires connecting to this.

00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:38.862
Everything is onboard,
and it jumped in response

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:43.243
to the student just flicking on
a desk lamp next to it.

00:04:43.243 --> 00:04:46.897
So I think you can imagine
all the cool things that we could do

00:04:46.897 --> 00:04:51.604
with robots that can run and crawl
and jump and roll at this size scale.

00:04:51.604 --> 00:04:55.394
Imagine the rubble that you get after 
a natural disaster like an earthquake.

00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:57.953
Imagine these small robots
running through that rubble

00:04:57.953 --> 00:05:00.171
to look for survivors.
