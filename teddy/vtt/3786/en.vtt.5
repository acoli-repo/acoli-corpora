00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:30.686
to eventually integrate onto
small, autonomous robots.

00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:34.267
But in order to look at mobility and
locomotion at this size scale to start,

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:36.241
we're cheating and using magnets.

00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:39.317
So this shows what would eventually
be part of a micro-robot leg,

00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:41.334
and you can see the silicone rubber joints

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:43.963
and there's an embedded magnet
that's being moved around

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:46.266
by an external magnetic field.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.949
So this leads to the robot
that I showed you earlier.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.110
The really interesting thing
that this robot can help us figure out

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.117
is how insects move at this scale.

00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:57.342
We have a really good model
for how everything

00:02:57.342 --> 00:02:59.304
from a cockroach up to an elephant moves.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.228
We all move in this 
kind of bouncy way when we run.
