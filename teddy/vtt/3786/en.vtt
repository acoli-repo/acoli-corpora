00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:04.209
My students and I
work on very tiny robots.

00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:06.426
Now, you can think of these
as robotic versions

00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:10.016
of something that you're all
very familiar with: an ant.

00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:12.776
We all know that ants
and other insects at this size scale

00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:15.012
can do some pretty incredible things.

00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:18.197
We've all seen a group of ants,
or some version of that,

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:22.467
carting off your potato chip
at a picnic, for example.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.910
But what are the real challenges
of engineering these ants?

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.861
Well, first of all, how do we get
the capabilities of an ant

00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:31.909
in a robot at the same size scale?
