This video is from UC Berkeley.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.342
It shows a cockroach moving
over incredibly rough terrain

00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:05.195
without tipping over,

00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:09.192
and it's able to do this because its legs
are a combination of rigid materials,

00:01:09.192 --> 00:01:11.545
which is what we traditionally
use to make robots,

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:13.144
and soft materials.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:18.201
Jumping is another really interesting way
to get around when you're very small.

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:22.270
So these insects store energy in a spring
and release that really quickly

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.281
to get the high power they need
to jump out of water, for example.

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:29.403
So one of the big
contributions from my lab

00:01:29.403 --> 00:01:32.153
has been to combine
rigid and soft materials
