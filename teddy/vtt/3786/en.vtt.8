00:03:58.274 --> 00:04:00.940
So this is a micro-fabricated
energetic material,

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.539
and we can create tiny pixels of this,

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:07.326
and we can put one of these pixels
on the belly of this robot,

00:04:07.326 --> 00:04:11.722
and this robot, then, is going to jump
when it senses an increase in light.

00:04:12.645 --> 00:04:14.618
So the next video is one of my favorites.

00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:17.658
So you have this 300-milligram robot

00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:20.064
jumping about eight
centimeters in the air.

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:22.974
It's only four by four
by seven millimeters in size.

00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:25.130
And you'll see a big flash
at the beginning

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.622
when the energetic is set off,

00:04:26.622 --> 00:04:28.530
and the robot tumbling through the air.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.139
So there was that big flash,
