00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.607
But this gives you some idea
of how it works right now.

00:03:32.027 --> 00:03:35.781
We can also make 3D-printed versions 
of this that can climb over obstacles,

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:39.280
a lot like the cockroach
that you saw earlier.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.166
But ultimately we want to add
everything onboard the robot.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:45.859
We want sensing, power, control,
actuation all together,

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.765
and not everything
needs to be bio-inspired.

00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:51.900
So this robot's about
the size of a Tic Tac.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.849
And in this case, instead of magnets
or muscles to move this around,

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.274
we use rockets.

00:03:58.274 --> 00:04:00.940
So this is a micro-fabricated
energetic material,
