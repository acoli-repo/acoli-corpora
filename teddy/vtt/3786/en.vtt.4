00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:02.333
is this guy doing
amazingly well for its jumps.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:05.947
So this is Aaron, the graduate student
in question, with the tweezers,

00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:08.630
and what you see is this 
four-millimeter-sized mechanism

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.841
jumping almost 40 centimeters high.

00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:13.265
That's almost 100 times its own length.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.221
And it survives, bounces on the table,

00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:18.735
it's incredibly robust, and of course
survives quite well until we lose it

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:21.361
because it's very tiny.

00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:23.970
Ultimately, though, we want
to add motors to this too,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.086
and we have students in the lab
working on millimeter-sized motors

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:30.686
to eventually integrate onto
small, autonomous robots.
