to look for survivors.

00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:03.127
Or imagine a lot of small robots
running around a bridge

00:05:03.127 --> 00:05:05.286
in order to inspect it
and make sure it's safe

00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:07.326
so you don't get collapses like this,

00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:11.233
which happened outside of 
Minneapolis in 2007.

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:12.995
Or just imagine what you could do

00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:15.518
if you had robots that could
swim through your blood.

Right? "Fantastic Voyage," Isaac Asimov.

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:22.206
Or they could operate without having
to cut you open in the first place.

00:05:22.206 --> 00:05:24.936
Or we could radically change
the way we build things

00:05:24.936 --> 00:05:28.343
if we have our tiny robots
work the same way that termites do,

00:05:28.343 --> 00:05:31.108
and they build these incredible
eight-meter-high mounds,
