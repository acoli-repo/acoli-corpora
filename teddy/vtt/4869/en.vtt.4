00:01:56.341 --> 00:02:00.120
which means you need the water level 
to be at 1, 3, or 4

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.286
when control switches to you.

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:03.904
If the water level were at 2,

00:02:03.904 --> 00:02:07.068
your only option would be
to lower it 1 story,

00:02:07.068 --> 00:02:09.760
which would lead 
to NIM making the winning move.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.935
If we color code the water levels,

00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:14.572
we can see a simple principle at play:

00:02:14.572 --> 00:02:16.632
there are “losing” levels like 2,

00:02:16.632 --> 00:02:21.482
where no matter what whoever starts 
their turn there does, they’ll lose.

00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:24.883
And there are winning levels,
where whoever starts their turn there

00:02:24.883 --> 00:02:28.859
can either win or leave their opponent 
with a losing level.

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.260
So not only are 1, 3, 
and 4 winning levels,
