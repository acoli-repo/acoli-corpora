00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:31.908
by ejecting it from grates 
in the sides of the room.

00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:34.232
If you can lower the water level to 0,

00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:36.192
you can hit the manual override,

00:00:36.192 --> 00:00:37.328
shut NIM off,

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.643
and save the day.

00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:43.170
However, the AI knows that you’re here,
and it can lower the water level, too,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.706
by sucking it through a trapdoor 
at the bottom of the lab.

00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:49.742
If NIM is the one to lower 
the water level to 0,

00:00:49.742 --> 00:00:51.587
you’ll be sucked out of the lab,

00:00:51.587 --> 00:00:53.545
resulting in a failed mission.

00:00:53.545 --> 00:00:57.449
Control over water drainage 
alternates between you and NIM,

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.292
and neither can skip a turn.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.346
Each of you can lower the water level 
by exactly 1,
