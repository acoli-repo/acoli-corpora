How can you survive 
and shut off the artificial intelligence?

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:36.566
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:37.921
Answer in: 3

00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:38.992
Answer in: 2

00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:40.411
Answer in: 1

00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:44.829
You can’t leave anything up to chance -
NIM will take any advantage it can get.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.905
And you’ll need to have a response 
to any possible move it makes.

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:53.370
The trick here is to start from where 
you want to end and work backwards.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.341
You want to be the one to lower 
the water level to 0,

00:01:56.341 --> 00:02:00.120
which means you need the water level 
to be at 1, 3, or 4
