00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.260
So not only are 1, 3, 
and 4 winning levels,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.533
but so are 5 and 6,

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:37.713
since you can send your opponent 
to 2 from there.

00:02:37.713 --> 00:02:39.529
What about 7?

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:44.174
From 7, all possible moves would 
send your opponent to a winning level,

00:02:44.174 --> 00:02:46.724
making this another losing level.

00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:50.258
And we can continue up 
the lab in this way.

00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:55.456
If you start your turn 1, 3,
or 4 levels above a losing level,

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:57.524
then you’re at a winning level.

00:02:57.524 --> 00:03:00.273
Otherwise, you’re destined to lose.
