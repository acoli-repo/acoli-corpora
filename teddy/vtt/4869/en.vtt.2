00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.346
Each of you can lower the water level 
by exactly 1,

00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:03.034
3,

00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:05.158
or 4 stories at a time.

00:01:05.158 --> 00:01:08.223
Whoever gets the level
exactly to 0 on their turn

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:10.435
will win this deadly duel.

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:13.613
Note that neither of you can lower 
the water below 0;

00:01:13.613 --> 00:01:15.186
if the water level is at 2,

00:01:15.186 --> 00:01:19.034
then the only move is to lower 
the water level 1 story.

00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:23.821
You know that NIM has already computed 
all possible outcomes of the contest,

00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:27.550
and will play in a way that maximizes 
its chance of success.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.060
You go first.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.661
How can you survive 
and shut off the artificial intelligence?
