00:02:57.524 --> 00:03:00.273
Otherwise, you’re destined to lose.

00:03:00.273 --> 00:03:03.766
You could continue like this 
all the way to level 25.

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:05.520
But as a shortcut,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.575
you might notice that levels 8 through 11
are colored identically to 1 through 4.

00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:16.416
Since a level’s color is determined by
the levels 1, 3, and 4 stories below it,

00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:20.746
this means that level 12 
will be the same color as level 5,

00:03:20.746 --> 00:03:22.365
13 will match 6,

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:25.323
14 will match 7, and so on,

00:03:25.323 --> 00:03:29.732
In particular, the losing levels 
will always be multiple of 7,

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:32.257
and two greater than multiples of 7.
