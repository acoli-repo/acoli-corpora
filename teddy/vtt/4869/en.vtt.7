00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:32.257
and two greater than multiples of 7.

00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:35.529
Now, from your original 
starting level of 25,

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:40.663
you have to make sure your opponent starts
on a losing level every single turn—

00:03:40.663 --> 00:03:43.344
if NIM starts on a winning level 
even once,

00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:45.375
it’s game over for you.

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:50.732
So your only choice on turn 1 
is to lower the water level by 4 stories.

00:03:50.732 --> 00:03:52.757
No matter what the AI does,

00:03:52.757 --> 00:03:55.549
you can continue giving it losing levels

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.364
until you reach 0 
and trigger the manual override.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.475
And with that, the crisis is averted.
