00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:33.357
the mysterious images were said to draw
out the workings of a person’s mind.

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:35.885
But what can inkblots really tell us,

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:38.425
and how does this test work?

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:43.205
Invented in the early 20th century 
by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach,

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:47.645
the Rorschach Test is actually less about 
the specific things we see,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:50.920
and more about our general approach 
to perception.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.300
As an amateur artist

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.220
Hermann was fascinated by how visual 
perception varies from person to person.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.687
He carried this interest to 
medical school,

00:00:59.687 --> 00:01:03.347
where he learned all our senses 
are deeply connected.
