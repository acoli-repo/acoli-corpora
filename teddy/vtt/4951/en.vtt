Take a look at this image.

00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:10.657
What might this be?

00:00:10.657 --> 00:00:12.067
A frightening monster?

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:13.597
Two friendly bears?

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:16.557
Or something else entirely?

00:00:16.557 --> 00:00:17.957
For nearly a century,

00:00:17.957 --> 00:00:20.427
ten inkblots like these have been used

00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:24.117
as what seems like an almost 
mystical personality test.

00:00:24.117 --> 00:00:27.697
Long kept confidential for psychologists 
and their patients,

00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:33.357
the mysterious images were said to draw
out the workings of a personâ€™s mind.
