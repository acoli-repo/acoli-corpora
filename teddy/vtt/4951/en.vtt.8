00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.609
its reputation among medical 
professionals plummeted,

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.279
and the blots began to fall 
out of clinical use.

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.009
Today, the test is still controversial,

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.909
and many people assume 
it has been disproven.

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.929
But a massive 2013 review of all the 
existing Rorschach research

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:20.349
showed that when administered properly 
the test yields valid results,

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.569
which can help diagnose mental illness

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:26.349
or round out a patient’s 
psychological profile.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.419
It’s hardly a stand-alone key 
to the human mind–

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:30.799
no test is.
