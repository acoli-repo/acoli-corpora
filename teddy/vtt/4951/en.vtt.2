where he learned all our senses 
are deeply connected.

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:08.087
He studied how our process of perception 
doesn’t just register sensory inputs,

00:01:08.087 --> 00:01:09.868
but transforms them.

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:13.898
And when he started working at a 
mental hospital in eastern Switzerland,

00:01:13.898 --> 00:01:17.308
he began designing a series 
of puzzling images

00:01:17.308 --> 00:01:21.358
to gain new insight into this 
enigmatic process.

00:01:21.358 --> 00:01:23.578
Using his inkblot paintings,

00:01:23.578 --> 00:01:26.688
Rorschach began quizzing hundreds 
of healthy subjects

00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:29.608
and psychiatric patients with 
the same question:

00:01:29.608 --> 00:01:31.648
what might this be?
