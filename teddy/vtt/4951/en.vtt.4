Now he had empirical measures to quantify 
all kinds of test takers:

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.945
the creative and imaginative,

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:08.955
the detail-oriented, the 
big-picture perceivers,

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:12.655
and flexible participants able 
to adapt their approach.

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:14.375
Some people would get stuck,

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:17.055
offering the same answer 
for multiple blots.

00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:20.275
Others gave unusual and 
delightful descriptions.

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:22.985
Responses were as varied as the inkblots,

00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:26.035
which offered different kinds of 
perceptual problems–

00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:28.855
some easier to interpret than others.

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:31.905
But analyzing the test-taker’s 
overall approach
