However, it wasn’t what the test subjects 
saw that was most important to Rorschach,

00:01:36.278 --> 00:01:39.102
but rather, how they approached the task.

Which parts of the image did they 
focus on or ignore?

00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:44.682
Did they see the image moving?

or distract and overwhelm them?

00:01:51.462 --> 00:01:54.492
He developed a system to code

reducing the wide range of interpretations

Now he had empirical measures to quantify 
all kinds of test takers:
