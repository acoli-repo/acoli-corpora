00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:31.905
But analyzing the test-taker’s 
overall approach

00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:34.785
yielded real insights into 
their psychology.

00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:37.505
And as Rorschach tested more 
and more people,

00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:39.775
patterns began to pile up.

00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:42.355
Healthy subjects with the same 
personalities

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:45.295
often took remarkably similar approaches.

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:47.945
Patients suffering from the same 
mental illnesses

It could even diagnose some conditions

difficult to pinpoint with other 
available methods.

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:00.465
