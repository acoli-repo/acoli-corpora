Now, in space flights to the Moon,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.016
we can rely upon
mission control in Houston

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.016
to watch over all aspects of a flight.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.576
However, Mars is 200 times further away,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.816
and as a result it takes
on average 13 minutes

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.976
for a signal to travel
from the Earth to Mars.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.400
If there's trouble,
there's not enough time.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.336
And so a reasonable engineering solution

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.936
calls for us to put mission control

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.976
inside the walls of the Orion spacecraft.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.896
Another fascinating idea
in the mission profile
