00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.880
something that offers
the illusion of intelligence.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.136
The art and the science of computing
have come a long way

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.656
since HAL was onscreen,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.896
and I'd imagine if his inventor
Dr. Chandra were here today,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.256
he'd have a whole lot of questions for us.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.376
Is it really possible for us

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.416
to take a system of millions
upon millions of devices,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.896
to read in their data streams,

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.176
to predict their failures
and act in advance?

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.416
Yes.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.616
Can we build systems that converse
with humans in natural language?

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.856
Yes.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.856
Can we build systems
that recognize objects, identify emotions,
