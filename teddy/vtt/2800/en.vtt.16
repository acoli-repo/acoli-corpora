00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.176
to these brilliant minds,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.456
I believe that they
are fundamentally wrong.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.656
Now, there are a lot of pieces
of Dr. Bostrom's argument to unpack,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.816
and I don't have time to unpack them all,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.536
but very briefly, consider this:

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.296
super knowing is very different
than super doing.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.216
HAL was a threat to the Discovery crew

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.656
only insofar as HAL commanded
all aspects of the Discovery.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.176
So it would have to be
with a superintelligence.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.696
It would have to have dominion
over all of our world.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.536
This is the stuff of Skynet
from the movie "The Terminator"

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.416
in which we had a superintelligence
