Another fascinating idea
in the mission profile

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.816
places humanoid robots
on the surface of Mars

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.696
before the humans themselves arrive,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.376
first to build facilities

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.760
and later to serve as collaborative
members of the science team.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.136
Now, as I looked at this
from an engineering perspective,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.336
it became very clear to me
that what I needed to architect

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.536
was a smart, collaborative,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.936
socially intelligent
artificial intelligence.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.256
In other words, I needed to build
something very much like a HAL

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.696
but without the homicidal tendencies.
