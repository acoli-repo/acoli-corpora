00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.176
Indeed, we stand at a remarkable time

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.736
in human history,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.736
where, driven by refusal to accept
the limits of our bodies and our minds,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.456

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.096
of exquisite, beautiful
complexity and grace

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.176
that will extend the human experience

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.880
in ways beyond our imagining.

to Space Command to now,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.976
I became a systems engineer,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.736
and recently I was drawn
into an engineering problem

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.336
associated with NASA's mission to Mars.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.856
Now, in space flights to the Moon,
