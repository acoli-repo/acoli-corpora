00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.696
but without the homicidal tendencies.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.080
(Laughter)

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.736
Let's pause for a moment.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.656
Is it really possible to build
an artificial intelligence like that?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.136
Actually, it is.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.416
In many ways,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.416
this is a hard engineering problem

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.896
with elements of AI,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.616
not some wet hair ball of an AI problem
that needs to be engineered.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.296
To paraphrase Alan Turing,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.696
I'm not interested
in building a sentient machine.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.296
I'm not building a HAL.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.736
All I'm after is a simple brain,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.880
something that offers
the illusion of intelligence.
