00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.016
We don't program them. We teach them.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.696
In order to teach a system
how to recognize flowers,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.736
I show it thousands of flowers
of the kinds I like.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.016
In order to teach a system
how to play a game --

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.000
Well, I would. You would, too.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.640
I like flowers. Come on.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.296
To teach a system
how to play a game like Go,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.376
I'd have it play thousands of games of Go,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.056
but in the process I also teach it

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.496
how to discern
a good game from a bad game.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.216
If I want to create an artificially
intelligent legal assistant,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.016
I will teach it some corpus of law
