00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.976
Now, HAL was a sentient computer

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.456
designed to guide the Discovery spacecraft

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.016
from the Earth to Jupiter.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.096
HAL was also a flawed character,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.400
for in the end he chose
to value the mission over human life.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.936
Now, HAL was a fictional character,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.616
but nonetheless he speaks to our fears,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.736
our fears of being subjugated

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.776
by some unfeeling, artificial intelligence

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.760
who is indifferent to our humanity.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.456
I believe that such fears are unfounded.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.176
Indeed, we stand at a remarkable time
