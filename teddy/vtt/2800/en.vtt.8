00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.856
Can we build systems
that recognize objects, identify emotions,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.256
emote themselves,
play games and even read lips?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.496
Yes.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.656
Can we build a system that sets goals,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.296
that carries out plans against those goals
and learns along the way?

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.536
Yes.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.896
Can we build systems
that have a theory of mind?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.416
This we are learning to do.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.920
Can we build systems that have
an ethical and moral foundation?

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.520
This we must learn how to do.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.736
So let's accept for a moment

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.656
that it's possible to build
such an artificial intelligence

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.816
for this kind of mission and others.
