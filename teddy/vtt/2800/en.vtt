00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.600
When I was a kid,
I was the quintessential nerd.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.496
I think some of you were, too.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.736
(Laughter)

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.976
And you, sir, who laughed the loudest,
you probably still are.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.256
(Laughter)

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.776
I grew up in a small town
in the dusty plains of north Texas,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.136
the son of a sheriff
who was the son of a pastor.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.080
Getting into trouble was not an option.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.296
And so I started reading
calculus books for fun.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.856
(Laughter)

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.576
You did, too.
