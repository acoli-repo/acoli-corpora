These things are all true to a degree,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.176
but it's also the case
that these technologies

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.576
brought to us things
that extended the human experience

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.480
in some profound ways.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.120
So let's take this a little further.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.856
I do not fear the creation
of an AI like this,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.696
because it will eventually
embody some of our values.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.216
Consider this: building a cognitive system
is fundamentally different

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.536
than building a traditional
software-intensive system of the past.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.016
We don't program them. We teach them.
