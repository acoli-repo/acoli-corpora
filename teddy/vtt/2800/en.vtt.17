00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.416
in which we had a superintelligence

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.816
that commanded human will,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.696
that directed every device
that was in every corner of the world.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.176
Practically speaking,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.296
it ain't gonna happen.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.376
We are not building AIs
that control the weather,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.736
that direct the tides,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.136
that command us
capricious, chaotic humans.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.056
And furthermore, if such
an artificial intelligence existed,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.016
it would have to compete
with human economies,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.560
and thereby compete for resources with us.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.416
And in the end --

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.680
don't tell Siri this --
