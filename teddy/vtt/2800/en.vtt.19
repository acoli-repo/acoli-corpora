00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.176
How shall I best organize society

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.536
when the need for human labor diminishes?

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.376
How can I bring understanding
and education throughout the globe

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.176
and still respect our differences?

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.456
How might I extend and enhance human life
through cognitive healthcare?

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.336
How might I use computing

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.120
to help take us to the stars?

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.800
And that's the exciting thing.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.736
The opportunities to use computing

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.296
to advance the human experience

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.736
are within our reach,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.616
here and now,

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.320
and we are just beginning.
