00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.256
Now, these kinds of substances
are much larger,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.995
and we'll certainly see them coming.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.576
Do I fear that such
an artificial intelligence

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.560
might threaten all of humanity?

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.656
If you look at movies
such as "The Matrix," "Metropolis,"

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.856
"The Terminator,"
shows such as "Westworld,"

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.016
they all speak of this kind of fear.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.336
Indeed, in the book "Superintelligence"
by the philosopher Nick Bostrom,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.896
he picks up on this theme

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.936
and observes that a superintelligence
might not only be dangerous,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.816
it could represent an existential threat
to all of humanity.
