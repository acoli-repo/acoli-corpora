00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
your acceptance.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Many times when I talk to people,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I keep telling them one thing:

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
don't tell me hundred ways

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
how you cannot respond to this problem.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Can you ply your mind for that one way

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that you can respond to the problem?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And that's what I'm here for,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
asking for your support,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
demanding for your support,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
requesting for your support.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Can you break your culture of silence?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story?
