00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I'm asking you, for these children,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
whose faces you see, they're no more.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
They died of AIDS last year.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I'm asking you to help them,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
accept as human beings --

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
not as philanthropy, not as charity,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
but as human beings who deserve all our support.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I'm asking you this because no child, no human being,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
deserves what these children have gone through.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Thank you.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:20.000
