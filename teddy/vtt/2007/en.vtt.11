00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And we are silent about them.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We think it is easy money.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
We think it is shortcut.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
We think the person likes to do what she's doing.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
But the extra bonuses that she gets

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
is various infections, sexually transmitted infections,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And one day she gives up on you and me,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
because we have no options for her.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
She believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about."
