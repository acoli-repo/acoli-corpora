00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
was where do I begin.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Because I had lots of them

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
who were already HIV infected.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
One third of the people I rescue

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
are HIV positive.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And therefore my challenge was to

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
understand how can I get out

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the power from this pain.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And for me, I was my greatest experience.
