00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
as young as three, as young as four,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
are sold into sexual slavery.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
They are sold in the name of adoption.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
They are sold in the name of organ trade.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
They are sold in the name of forced labor,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
camel jockeying, anything, everything.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And I tell you stories from there.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
My own journey to work with these children

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
started as a teenager.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.
