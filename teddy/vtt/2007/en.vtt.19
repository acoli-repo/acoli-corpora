00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Can you get somebody in my house to work,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
so that she can look after my mother?"

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And there is a long pause.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And then she says, "Not one of our girls."

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
in this fantastic A-C hall.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
It's very nice for discussion, discourse,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
making films and everything.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.
