No matter how hard you might try,

00:00:01.906 --> 00:00:04.875
you can't just flip a switch
when you step into the office

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:06.282
and turn your emotions off.

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:09.341
Feeling feelings is part of being human.

[The Way We Work]

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:17.642
A pervasive myth exists
that emotions don't belong at work,

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.032
and this often leads us

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:23.212
to mistakenly equate professionalism
with being stoic or even cold.

00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:25.975
But research shows that in the moments
when our colleagues

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.122
drop their glossy
professional presentation,

00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:31.303
we're actually much more likely
to believe what they're telling us.
