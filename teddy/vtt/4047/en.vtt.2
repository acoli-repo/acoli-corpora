00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:03.792
When you look
at all of this wonderful world,

00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:07.008
every species has
its own learning program.

00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:10.346
The learning program is genome,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.974
and the code of that program is DNA.

00:01:15.157 --> 00:01:21.134
The different genomes of each species
represent different survival strategies.

00:01:21.618 --> 00:01:25.832
They represent hundreds of millions
of years of evolution.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:30.671
The interaction between
every species' ancestor
