00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:30.671
The interaction between
every species' ancestor

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:32.665
and the environment.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.589
I was really fascinated about the world,

00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:37.795
about the DNA,

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.762
about, you know, the language of life,

00:01:40.786 --> 00:01:42.432
the program of learning.

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:47.500
So I decided to co-found
the institute to read them.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:48.886
I read many of them.

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:53.718
We probably read more than half
of the prior animal genomes in the world.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:55.719
I mean, up to date.

00:01:57.443 --> 00:01:58.678
We did learn a lot.

00:01:59.297 --> 00:02:03.165
We did sequence, also,
one species many, many times ...
