00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.287
to understand what kind
of learning process

00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.685
the genome has been through
for the millions of years.

00:03:05.498 --> 00:03:08.421
By reading a genome,
it can give you a lot of information --

00:03:08.445 --> 00:03:10.118
tells you the bugs in the genome --

00:03:10.142 --> 00:03:13.322
I mean, birth defects,
monogenetic disorders.

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:14.652
Reading a drop of blood

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:16.784
could tell you why you got a fever,

00:03:16.808 --> 00:03:19.912
or it tells you which medicine
and dosage needs to be used

00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:22.657
when you're sick, especially for cancer.

00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:26.795
A lot of things could be studied,
but look at that:

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.779
30 years ago, we were still poor in China.
