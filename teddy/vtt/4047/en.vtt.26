00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:01.801
Is this going to lead to a kind of,

00:13:01.825 --> 00:13:04.142
you know, increasing inequality?

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:08.077
Or do you have this vision
that the knowledge that you get

00:13:08.101 --> 00:13:09.453
from the pioneers

00:13:09.477 --> 00:13:11.573
can actually be
pretty quickly disseminated

00:13:11.597 --> 00:13:15.721
to help a broader set of recipients?

00:13:15.745 --> 00:13:17.279
Jun Wang: Well, good question.

00:13:17.303 --> 00:13:20.854
I'll tell you that seven years ago,
when I co-founded BGI,

00:13:20.878 --> 00:13:24.283
and served as the CEO
of the company there,

00:13:24.307 --> 00:13:26.688
the only goal there for me to do

00:13:26.712 --> 00:13:28.695
was to drive the sequencing cost down.

00:13:29.044 --> 00:13:31.819
It started from 100 million dollars
per human genome.
