00:01:59.297 --> 00:02:03.165
We did sequence, also,
one species many, many times ...

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.348
human genome.

00:02:04.372 --> 00:02:06.134
We sequenced the first Asian.

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.996
I sequenced it myself many, many times,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.579
just to take advantage of that platform.

00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:15.874
Look at all those repeating base pairs:

00:02:15.898 --> 00:02:17.366
ATCG.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.304
You don't understand anything there.

00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:20.922
But look at that one base pair.

00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:23.469
Those five letters, the AGGAA.

00:02:23.884 --> 00:02:27.361
These five SNPs represent
a very specific haplotype

00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:29.226
in the Tibetan population

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.249
around the gene called EPAS1.
