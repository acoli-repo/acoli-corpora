00:08:28.794 --> 00:08:30.883
and I totally delivered
a different speech.

00:08:30.907 --> 00:08:33.776
(Laughter)

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.101
What if I work less, right?

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:38.007
I have been less stressed, right?

00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:39.841
So that probably never happened to me,

00:08:39.865 --> 00:08:41.963

00:08:51.512 --> 00:08:52.898
over different individuals.

00:08:52.922 --> 00:08:54.072
How about me?

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:56.414
What is the right breakfast for me?

00:08:56.438 --> 00:08:59.356
I need to do two weeks
of controlled experiments,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.125

food ingredients on me,
