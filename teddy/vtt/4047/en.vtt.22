00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:03.154
but we do have seven billion
learning programs on this planet.

00:11:03.178 --> 00:11:04.444
Seven billion.

00:11:04.468 --> 00:11:08.119
And every program
is running in different conditions

00:11:08.143 --> 00:11:09.924
and doing different experiments.

00:11:09.948 --> 00:11:11.799
Can we all measure them?

00:11:12.962 --> 00:11:16.177
Seven years ago,
I wrote an essay in "Science"

00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:19.493
to celebrate the human genome's
10-year anniversary.

00:11:20.175 --> 00:11:21.829
I said, "Sequence yourself,

00:11:21.853 --> 00:11:23.476
for one and for all."

00:11:23.798 --> 00:11:25.666
But now I'm going to say,

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.436
"Digitalize yourself for one and for all."
