00:05:29.642 --> 00:05:33.105
25 years ago, I made
the digital lady beetles

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.913
to try to simulate real lady beetles.

00:05:35.503 --> 00:05:37.288
Can I make a digital me ...

00:05:37.897 --> 00:05:39.221
to simulate me?

00:05:39.955 --> 00:05:42.516
I understand the neural
network could become

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.626
much more sophisticated
and complicated there.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.204
Can I make that one,

00:05:47.228 --> 00:05:51.110
and try to run multiple options
on that digital me --

00:05:51.134 --> 00:05:52.394
to compute that?

00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:55.988
Then I could live in different universes,

00:05:56.012 --> 00:05:58.776
in parallel, at the same time.

00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:01.661
Then I would choose
whatever is good for me.
