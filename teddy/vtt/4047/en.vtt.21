00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:32.071
it's already there, in the book.

00:10:32.608 --> 00:10:33.935
But I still hate the smell.

00:10:34.237 --> 00:10:35.387
(Laughter)

00:10:35.411 --> 00:10:37.817
I want to find out the true way to do it,

00:10:37.841 --> 00:10:42.195
maybe find a combination of cocktails
of bacterias and drink it,

00:10:42.219 --> 00:10:43.743
it probably will make me better.

00:10:43.767 --> 00:10:44.958
So I'm trying to do that.

00:10:44.982 --> 00:10:47.984
Even though I'm trying this hard,

00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:53.034
it's so difficult to test out
all possible conditions.

00:10:53.058 --> 00:10:58.295
It's not possible to do
all kinds of experiments at all ...

00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:03.154
but we do have seven billion
learning programs on this planet.
