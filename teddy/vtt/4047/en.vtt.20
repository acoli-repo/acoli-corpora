00:09:59.918 --> 00:10:03.051
And my antibody regulates my proteins

00:10:03.075 --> 00:10:04.611
for that dramatic change.

00:10:04.635 --> 00:10:06.016
And everybody was doing that.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.372
Even if we're essentially
totally different at the very beginning.

00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:12.441
And that probably will be
an interesting treatment in the future

00:10:12.465 --> 00:10:14.108
for cancer and things like that.

00:10:14.132 --> 00:10:15.762
It becomes very, very interesting.

00:10:16.286 --> 00:10:18.987
But something you probably
don't want to try,

00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:22.687
like drinking fecal water
from a healthier individual,

00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:24.378
which will make you feel healthier.

00:10:24.402 --> 00:10:26.117
This is from old Chinese wisdom.

00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:27.577
Look at that, right?

00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:29.767
Like 1,700 years ago,

00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:32.071
it's already there, in the book.
