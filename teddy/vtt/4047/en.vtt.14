00:07:00.113 --> 00:07:03.996
And the digital me told me
I have a genetic defect.

00:07:04.797 --> 00:07:06.868
I have a very high risk of gout.

00:07:07.868 --> 00:07:09.465
I don't feel anything now,

00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:10.861
I'm still healthy.

00:07:10.885 --> 00:07:12.386
But look at my uric acid level.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.225
It's double the normal range.

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.740
And the digital me searched
all the medicine books,

00:07:17.764 --> 00:07:21.932
and it tells me, "OK, you could
drink burdock tea" --

00:07:21.956 --> 00:07:23.654
I cannot even pronounce it right --

00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:24.713
(Laughter)

00:07:24.737 --> 00:07:26.551
That is from old Chinese wisdom.

00:07:27.076 --> 00:07:29.835
And I drank that tea for three months.

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:32.400
My uric acid has now gone back to normal.
