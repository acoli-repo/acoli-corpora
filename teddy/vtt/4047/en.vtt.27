00:13:29.044 --> 00:13:31.819
It started from 100 million dollars
per human genome.

00:13:31.843 --> 00:13:34.434
Now, it's a couple hundred dollars
for a human genome.

00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:38.072
The only reason to do it
is to get more people to benefit from it.

00:13:38.378 --> 00:13:40.535
So for the digital me,
it's the same thing.

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:42.048
Now, you probably need,

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:45.301
you know, one million dollars
to digitize a person.

00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:47.476
I think it has to be 100 dollars.

00:13:47.987 --> 00:13:52.036
It has to be free for many of those people
that urgently need that.

00:13:52.372 --> 00:13:53.639
So this is our goal.

00:13:53.993 --> 00:13:57.416
And it seems that with all
this merging of the technology,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.032
I'm thinking that in the very near future,
