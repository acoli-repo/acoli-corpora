You have to ask a lot
of questions about yourself:

00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:03.194
"What if?" --

00:08:03.218 --> 00:08:05.021
I'm being jet-lagged now here.

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:07.003
You don't probably see it, but I do.

00:08:08.073 --> 00:08:09.865
What if I eat less?

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.837
When I took metformin,
supposedly to live longer?

00:08:13.574 --> 00:08:14.921
What if I climb Mt. Everest?

00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:16.247
It's not that easy.

00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:17.601
Or run a marathon?

00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:20.446
What if I drink a bottle of mao-tai,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.806
which is a Chinese liquor,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.024
and I get really drunk?

00:08:23.048 --> 00:08:27.477
I was doing a video rehearsal last time
with the folks here,

00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:28.770
when I was drunk,

00:08:28.794 --> 00:08:30.883
and I totally delivered
a different speech.
