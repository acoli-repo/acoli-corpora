00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.249
around the gene called EPAS1.

00:02:31.273 --> 00:02:33.004
That gene has been proved --

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.291
it's highly selective --

00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:38.662
it's the most significant signature
of positive selection of Tibetans

00:02:38.686 --> 00:02:40.368
for the higher altitude adaptation.

00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:42.316
You know what?

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.127
These five SNPs were the result
of integration of Denisovans,

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:51.403
or Denisovan-like individuals into humans.

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.760
This is the reason
why we need to read those genomes.

00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:56.165
To understand history,

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.287
to understand what kind
of learning process
