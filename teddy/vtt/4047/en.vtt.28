00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.032
I'm thinking that in the very near future,

00:14:00.056 --> 00:14:02.421
let's say three to five years,

00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:03.927
it will come to reality.

00:14:03.951 --> 00:14:07.930
And this is the whole idea
of why I founded iCarbonX,

00:14:07.954 --> 00:14:09.173
my second company.

00:14:09.197 --> 00:14:12.065
It's really trying to get the cost down

00:14:12.089 --> 00:14:15.509
to a level where every individual
could have the benefit.

00:14:15.533 --> 00:14:18.581
CA: All right, so the dream is not
elite health services for few,

00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:19.839
it's to really try

00:14:19.863 --> 00:14:22.974
and actually make overall health care
much more cost effective --

00:14:22.998 --> 00:14:25.428
JW: But we started
from some early adopters,

00:14:25.452 --> 00:14:27.958
people believing ideas and so on,

00:14:27.982 --> 00:14:31.624
but eventually, it will become
everybody's benefit.
