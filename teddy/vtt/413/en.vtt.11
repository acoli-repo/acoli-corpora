00:05:28.616 --> 00:05:30.251
I still have Tourette syndrome.

00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:32.531
I deal with it every day, every hour.

00:05:32.555 --> 00:05:34.997
I'm going to deal with it
for the rest of my life.

00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:38.537
And that means that I have to frequently
excuse myself from my classroom,

00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:41.383
because my verbal tics
can be extremely distracting.

00:05:41.957 --> 00:05:45.149

when I wink my eyes involuntarily,

00:05:45.173 --> 00:05:48.123
the guy sitting opposite from me
thinks I'm flirting with him,

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:49.298
when I'm really not.

00:05:49.322 --> 00:05:50.325
(Laughter)

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.680
And I have to tell him,
"Sorry -- I wasn't trying to flirt."

00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:56.188
But the most amazing thing is

00:05:56.212 --> 00:06:00.641
that when I sing, play music
and even just listen to music,
