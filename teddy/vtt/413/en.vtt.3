00:01:29.347 --> 00:01:31.769
I would see green people running after me,

00:01:31.793 --> 00:01:34.506
threatening to boil me in a pot
and drink me as soup.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.130
And it was really scary.

00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:38.213
We tried drug after drug

00:01:38.237 --> 00:01:41.522
to find something that would bring me
some sort of relief.

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:45.331
But every single attempt
just ended up making things worse.

00:01:47.038 --> 00:01:52.265
It is estimated that in 2013
in the United States alone,

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:53.964
the prescription drug expenditure

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:56.932
to treat neurological conditions
and mental illness

00:01:56.956 --> 00:02:01.107
was about 89 billion dollars annually.
