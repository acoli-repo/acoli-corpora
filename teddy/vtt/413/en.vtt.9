to sing her thoughts,

Music helped heal Gabby Giffords.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.728
Scientists have found that music causes
our brains to release a natural painkiller

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.133
known as oxytocin

00:04:47.157 --> 00:04:49.315
and a feel-good chemical, dopamine.

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:52.260
Dopamine is essential
for a healthy nervous system

00:04:52.284 --> 00:04:54.817
and strongly impacts emotional health.

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:59.005
Music also affects our heart rate,
breathing and pulse rate,

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:00.829
as it stimulates blood flow.
