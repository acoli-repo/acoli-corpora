every waking moment, seven days a week.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:32.926
(Tic)

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.362
And these were only some of my symptoms.

00:00:36.298 --> 00:00:39.973
When these symptoms surfaced,
my life literally changed overnight.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:44.593
I could no longer go to school,
see my friends or even eat out,

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:48.786
because my tics would attract
the attention of everyone in the room.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.263
In search for a cure, we flew to New York

00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:56.468
to meet with the best pediatric
neuropsychologist my parents could find.

00:00:57.388 --> 00:00:58.911
(Tic)

00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:03.009
But the doctor did not give us
the easy remedy we had hoped for.
