00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:32.712
When I found myself slipping
into my bouts of sadness and self-pity,

00:03:32.736 --> 00:03:35.299
I would rush to the 88 keys of my piano,

00:03:35.323 --> 00:03:39.664
knowing in my heart that the tones
and rhythms from each one of those keys

00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:41.222
would soon set me free.

00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.259
At the time, I didn't realize
how much music was helping me.

00:03:45.283 --> 00:03:47.416
It was just something I did by default.

00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:50.513
When I wrote my songs,
it wasn't to impress anybody.

00:03:50.537 --> 00:03:52.003
It was just a release.

00:03:52.807 --> 00:03:55.553
But the more I played,
the less my symptoms surfaced,

00:03:55.577 --> 00:03:58.013
and the intensity of my attacks reduced.

00:03:58.466 --> 00:04:02.236
So I became curious as to how
these songs were soothing my symptoms.
