00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You all know this story.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In the summer of 1950,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and atomic-pile builder,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
"Where is everybody?"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This confused his colleagues, obviously,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because they were sitting right there with him.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
He was talking about the space aliens.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You see, this was only a few years after

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the supposed flying saucer crash
