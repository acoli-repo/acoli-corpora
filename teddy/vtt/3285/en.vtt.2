00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:00.003
I slid down in my chair,

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:02.199
and I couldn't wait
for that meeting to end.

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:05.845
That was my introduction to Airbnb.

00:01:06.907 --> 00:01:10.967
I was asked and invited
by the three millennial cofounders

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:12.149
to join their company

00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:14.835
to help them take
their fast-growing tech start-up

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.529
and turn it into a global
hospitality brand,

00:01:17.553 --> 00:01:21.834
as well as to be the in-house
mentor for CEO Brian Chesky.

00:01:21.858 --> 00:01:26.754
Now, I'd spent from age 26 to 52
being a boutique hotel entrepreneur,

00:01:26.778 --> 00:01:29.307
and so I guess I'd learned
a few things along the way

00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:31.429
and accumulated
some hospitality knowledge.
