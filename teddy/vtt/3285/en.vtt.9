WEBVTT

00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:30.648
have actually expanded that strategy

00:04:30.672 --> 00:04:35.901
to include age as just as important
of a demographic as gender or race?

00:04:36.422 --> 00:04:38.199
Maybe they didn't get the memo:

00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:39.959
the world is getting older!

00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:42.935
One of the paradoxes of our time

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:48.086
is that baby boomers are more vibrant
and healthy longer into life,

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.420
we're actually working later into life,

00:04:50.444 --> 00:04:53.210
and yet we're feeling
less and less relevant.

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.604
Some of us feel like a carton
of milk -- an old carton of milk --

00:04:57.628 --> 00:05:01.504
with an expiration date stamped
on our wrinkled foreheads.
