It was my third day on the job
at a hot Silicon Valley start-up

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:07.441
in early 2013.

00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:12.329
I was twice the age

the tech geniuses.

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:25.465
I was listening to them talk

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.512

00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:33.546
And then suddenly, the 25-year-old
wizard leading the meeting stared at me
