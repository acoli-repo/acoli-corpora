and accumulated
some hospitality knowledge.

00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:33.797
But after my first week,

00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:36.752
I realized that the brave new
home-sharing world

00:01:36.776 --> 00:01:41.304
didn't need much of my old-school
bricks-and-mortar hotel insights.

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:44.033
A stark reality rocked me:

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.569
What do I have to offer?

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.410
I'd never been in a tech company before.

00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:55.244
Five and a half years ago, I had never
heard of the "sharing economy,"

00:01:55.268 --> 00:01:57.949
nor did I have an Uber
or Lyft app on my phone.

00:01:58.534 --> 00:02:01.116
This was not my natural habitat.
