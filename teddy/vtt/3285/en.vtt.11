When it comes to power
in the workplace today,

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:32.546
30 is the new 50.

00:05:33.797 --> 00:05:36.671
All right, well, this is all
pretty exciting, right?

00:05:36.695 --> 00:05:37.765
(Laughter)

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.743
Truthfully, power is moving
10 years younger.

00:05:41.048 --> 00:05:42.966
We're all going to live 10 years longer.

00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:44.457
Do the math.

00:05:44.834 --> 00:05:48.472
Society has created a new
20-year irrelevancy gap.

00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:51.539
Midlife used to be 45 to 65,

00:05:51.563 --> 00:05:56.260
but I would suggest it now stretches
into a midlife marathon 40 years long,

00:05:56.284 --> 00:05:57.859
from 35 to 75.

00:05:58.607 --> 00:06:00.319
But wait -- there is a bright spot.
