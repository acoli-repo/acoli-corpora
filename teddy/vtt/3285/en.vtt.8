This is a very important question,
because for the first time ever,

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.735
we have five generations in the workplace
at the same time, unintentionally.

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.205
Maybe it's time we got
a little more intentional

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.027
about how we work collectively.

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.732
There have been a number
of European studies

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:19.416
that have shown that age-diverse teams
are more effective and successful.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.367
So why is that only eight percent
of the companies

00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:28.462
that have a diversity
and inclusion program

00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:30.648
have actually expanded that strategy
