00:06:00.954 --> 00:06:06.867
Why is it that we actually get smarter
and wiser about our humanity as we age?

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.616
Our physical peak may be our 20s,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.514
our financial and salary peak
may be age 50,

00:06:15.538 --> 00:06:19.448
but our emotional peak
is in midlife and beyond,

00:06:19.472 --> 00:06:24.485
because we have developed pattern
recognition about ourselves and others.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.513
So how can we get companies
to tap into that wisdom

00:06:28.537 --> 00:06:30.857
of the midlife folks,
