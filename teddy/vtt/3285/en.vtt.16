might not be all that important
in a home-sharing world.

00:08:01.912 --> 00:08:06.211
My process knowledge
of "How do you get things done?"

00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:10.937
based upon understanding the underlying
motivations of everybody in the room,

00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:12.715
was incredibly valuable,

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:17.013
in a company where most people didn't have
a lot of organizational experience.

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:20.333
As I spent more time at Airbnb,

00:08:20.357 --> 00:08:24.847
I realized it's possible
a new kind of elder was emerging

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:26.333
in the workplace.

00:08:26.357 --> 00:08:31.176
Not the elder of the past, who actually
was regarded with reverence.
