The more I've seen and learned
about our respective generations,

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.396
the more I realize that we often
don't trust each other enough

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.135
to actually share our respective wisdom.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.410
We may share a border,

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:46.078
but we don't necessarily trust
each other enough

00:02:46.102 --> 00:02:48.428
to share that respective wisdom.

00:02:49.654 --> 00:02:52.934
I believe, looking at
the modern workplace,

00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.703
that the trade agreement of our time

00:02:56.727 --> 00:03:02.098
is opening up these intergenerational
pipelines of wisdom
