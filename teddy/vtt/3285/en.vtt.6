WEBVTT

00:02:56.727 --> 00:03:02.098
is opening up these intergenerational
pipelines of wisdom

00:03:02.122 --> 00:03:04.617
so that we can all learn from each other.

00:03:05.336 --> 00:03:09.767
Almost 40 percent of us
in the United States

00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.052
have a boss that's younger than us,

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:14.427
and that number is growing quickly.

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.339
Power is cascading to the young
like never before

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:22.079
because of our increasing reliance on DQ:

00:03:22.103 --> 00:03:23.627
digital intelligence.

00:03:24.213 --> 00:03:28.024
We're seeing young founders
of companies in their early 20s

00:03:28.048 --> 00:03:32.975
scale them up to global giants
by the time they get to 30,
