00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:32.716
business is fundamentally H-to-H:

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.322
human to human.

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:37.530
And yet, Laura's approach to leadership

00:07:37.554 --> 00:07:40.713
was really formed
in the technocratic world,

00:07:40.737 --> 00:07:42.712
and it was purely metric driven.

00:07:43.236 --> 00:07:46.174
One of the things she said to me
in the first few months was,

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:48.524
"I love the fact that your
approach to leadership

00:07:48.548 --> 00:07:52.189
is to create a compelling vision
that becomes a North Star for us."

00:07:52.782 --> 00:07:54.507
Now, my fact knowledge,

00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:58.488
as in, how many rooms a maid cleans
in an eight-hour shift,

00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:01.390
might not be all that important
in a home-sharing world.
