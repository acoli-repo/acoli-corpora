I want to talk about penguins today.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
But first, I want to start by saying that

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we need a new operating system,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
for the oceans and for the Earth.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When I came to the Galapagos 40 years ago,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
there were 3,000 people

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that lived in the Galapagos.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now there are over 30,000.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, there are around a thousand trucks

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and buses and cars there.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So the fundamental problems that we face

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
are overconsumption and too many people.
