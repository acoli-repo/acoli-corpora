00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:03.116
This is me building a prototype

00:00:03.116 --> 00:00:06.036
for six hours straight.

00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:09.957
This is slave labor to my own project.

00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:14.947
This is what the DIY and maker movements really look like.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:19.713
And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:22.501
with brute-force assembly techniques.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.335
And this is exactly why I started studying

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:29.604
how to program physical materials to build themselves.

00:00:29.604 --> 00:00:31.364
But there is another world.
