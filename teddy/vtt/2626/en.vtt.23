We were trying to understand
the threat against us.

00:11:30.218 --> 00:11:34.297
We were trying to help
ourselves and the world.

00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:37.122
But that's changed.

00:11:38.392 --> 00:11:40.738
Now, American soldiers,

00:11:40.762 --> 00:11:44.582
American veterans are coming back
to a country that is so bitterly divided

00:11:45.716 --> 00:11:49.138
that the two political parties
are literally accusing each other

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.510
of treason, of being
an enemy of the state,

00:11:54.265 --> 00:11:59.025
of trying to undermine the security
and the welfare of their own country.

00:11:59.049 --> 00:12:03.182
The gap between rich and poor
is the biggest it's ever been.
