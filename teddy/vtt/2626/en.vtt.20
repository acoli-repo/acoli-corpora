It's as if they're all in one big tribe.

00:10:02.282 --> 00:10:04.316
We know that if you take a lab rat

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.012
and traumatize it and put it
in a cage by itself,

00:10:08.036 --> 00:10:11.193
you can maintain its trauma symptoms
almost indefinitely.

00:10:11.717 --> 00:10:16.804
And if you take that same lab rat
and put it in a cage with other rats,

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:21.374
after a couple of weeks,
it's pretty much OK.

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:24.771
After 9/11,

00:10:26.549 --> 00:10:29.842
the murder rate in New York City
went down by 40 percent.

00:10:29.866 --> 00:10:31.688
The suicide rate went down.
