00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:33.497
and I thought, I bet the Navajo,
the Apache, the Comanche --

00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:36.085
I mean, these are very warlike nations --

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:39.891
I bet they weren't getting
PTSD like we do.

00:05:40.814 --> 00:05:43.806
When their warriors came back
from fighting the US military

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.438
or fighting each other,

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:50.184
I bet they pretty much just slipped
right back into tribal life.

00:05:51.635 --> 00:05:53.889
And maybe what determines

00:05:53.913 --> 00:05:56.607
the rate of long-term PTSD

00:05:56.631 --> 00:05:58.619
isn't what happened out there,

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.347
but the kind of society you come back to.
