00:11:59.049 --> 00:12:03.182
The gap between rich and poor
is the biggest it's ever been.

00:12:03.206 --> 00:12:04.391
It's just getting worse.

00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:06.823
Race relations are terrible.

00:12:06.847 --> 00:12:09.703
There are demonstrations
and even riots in the streets

00:12:09.727 --> 00:12:11.706
because of racial injustice.

00:12:12.727 --> 00:12:16.988
And veterans know that any tribe
that treated itself that way -- in fact,

00:12:17.012 --> 00:12:21.942
any platoon that treated itself
that way -- would never survive.

00:12:23.068 --> 00:12:24.959
We've gotten used to it.

00:12:24.983 --> 00:12:28.836
Veterans have gone away
and are coming back

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.301
and seeing their own country
with fresh eyes.
