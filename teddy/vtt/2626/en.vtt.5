00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:31.142
wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.560
They are not adapted to temporary danger.

00:02:33.584 --> 00:02:36.345
They are maladapted for everyday life,

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.547
unless they get help.

00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:41.533
We know that the people
who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:44.273
are people who were abused as children,

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:46.028
who suffered trauma as children,

00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:48.670
people who have low education levels,

00:02:48.694 --> 00:02:51.252
people who have psychiatric
disorders in their family.

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:52.554
If you served in Vietnam

00:02:52.578 --> 00:02:55.272
and your brother is schizophrenic,

00:02:55.296 --> 00:02:59.412
you're way more likely to get
long-term PTSD from Vietnam.
