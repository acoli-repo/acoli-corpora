00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:05.112
I worked as a war reporter for 15 years

00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:08.601
before I realized
that I really had a problem.

00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:11.207
There was something really wrong with me.

00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:14.569
This was about a year before 9/11,
and America wasn't at war yet.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:17.824
We weren't talking about PTSD.

00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:22.044
We were not yet talking
about the effect of trauma and war

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:23.852
on the human psyche.

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:26.956
I'd been in Afghanistan
for a couple of months

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.988
with the Northern Alliance
as they were fighting the Taliban.
