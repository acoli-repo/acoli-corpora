00:03:00.571 --> 00:03:03.199
So I started to study this
as a journalist,

00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:07.391
and I realized that there was something
really strange going on.

00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:10.158
The numbers seemed to be going
in the wrong direction.

00:03:10.597 --> 00:03:12.969
Every war that we have
fought as a country,

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:14.967
starting with the Civil War,

00:03:14.991 --> 00:03:18.047
the intensity of the combat has gone down.

00:03:18.878 --> 00:03:22.258
As a result, the casualty rates
have gone down.

00:03:22.707 --> 00:03:24.662
But disability rates have gone up.

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:26.888
They should be going
in the same direction,

00:03:27.702 --> 00:03:29.951
but they're going in different directions.
