00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.075
They're shooting at people,
killing people,

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.437
getting shot at,
seeing their friends get killed.

00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:06.014
It's incredibly traumatic.

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:08.848
But it's only about 10 percent
of our military.

00:04:08.872 --> 00:04:11.105
But about half of our military has filed

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.351
for some kind of PTSD compensation
from the government.

00:04:16.922 --> 00:04:21.617
And suicide doesn't even fit into this
in a very logical way.

00:04:22.173 --> 00:04:27.959
We've all heard the tragic statistic
of 22 vets a day, on average,

00:04:27.983 --> 00:04:30.590
in this country, killing themselves.
