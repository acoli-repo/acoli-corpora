Modern society has probably produced
the highest rates of suicide

00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:05.792
and depression and anxiety
and loneliness and child abuse

00:07:05.816 --> 00:07:07.561
ever in human history.

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:10.268
I saw one study

00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:13.334
that compared women in Nigeria,

00:07:13.358 --> 00:07:15.855
one of the most chaotic
and violent and corrupt

00:07:16.627 --> 00:07:18.833
and poorest countries in Africa,

00:07:19.358 --> 00:07:20.649
to women in North America.

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:25.863
And the highest rates of depression
were urban women in North America.

00:07:25.887 --> 00:07:27.882
That was also the wealthiest group.

00:07:28.637 --> 00:07:32.486
So let's go back to the US military.
