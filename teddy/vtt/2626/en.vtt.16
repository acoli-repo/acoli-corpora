What's going on with those people,

00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:06.786
the phantom 40 percent that are troubled
but don't understand why?

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.134
Maybe it's this:

00:08:08.158 --> 00:08:12.802
maybe they had an experience
of sort of tribal closeness

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.056
in their unit when they were overseas.

00:08:16.075 --> 00:08:18.708
They were eating together,
sleeping together,

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:21.031
doing tasks and missions together.

00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:23.594
They were trusting each other
with their lives.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.833
And then they come home

00:08:26.857 --> 00:08:28.857
and they have to give all that up

00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:33.590
and they're coming back
to a society, a modern society,
