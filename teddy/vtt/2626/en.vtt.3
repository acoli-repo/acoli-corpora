00:01:29.648 --> 00:01:33.827
Later, I found out that what I had
was short-term PTSD:

00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:35.754
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:01:36.993 --> 00:01:40.221
We evolved as animals, as primates,
to survive periods of danger,

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:43.166
and if your life has been in danger,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.831
you want to react to unfamiliar noises.

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:49.607
You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.

00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:51.825
You want to have nightmares and flashbacks

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.658
of the thing that could kill you.

00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:57.813
You want to be angry because it makes you
predisposed to fight,

00:01:57.837 --> 00:02:01.210
or depressed, because it keeps you out
of circulation a little bit.
