00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:33.269
And at that point the Taliban
had an air force,

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:36.522
they had fighter planes,
they had tanks, they had artillery,

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:39.837
and we really got hammered
pretty badly a couple of times.

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:41.827
We saw some very ugly things.

00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:45.074
But I didn't really think it affected me.

00:00:45.098 --> 00:00:46.626
I didn't think much about it.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.601
I came home to New York, where I live.

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.506
Then one day I went down into the subway,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.941
and for the first time in my life,

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:56.799
I knew real fear.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.162
I had a massive panic attack.
