00:02:28.923 --> 00:02:30.843
habitat is just too dense,

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:32.840
real estate, too expensive

00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:34.924
and public finances, too fragile.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.385
Our city's vascular system
is getting clogged, it's getting sick,

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.016
and we should pay attention.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.743
Our current way
of thinking is not working.

00:02:44.172 --> 00:02:46.093
For our transportation to flow,

00:02:46.117 --> 00:02:48.468
we need a new source of inspiration.

00:02:50.187 --> 00:02:52.879
So after 16 years
working in transportation,

00:02:53.437 --> 00:02:56.983
my "aha moment" happened
when speaking with a biotech customer.

00:02:57.622 --> 00:02:59.650
She was telling me how her treatment

00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:02.917
was leveraging specific properties
of our vascular system.
