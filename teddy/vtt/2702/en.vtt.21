00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:30.254
(Laughter)

00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:32.233
Traffic will be functionally exuberant.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.698
It will be liquid like our blood.

00:10:34.722 --> 00:10:36.478
And by a strange paradox,

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:39.313
the more robotized
our traffic grid will be,

00:10:39.337 --> 00:10:42.093
the more organic and alive
its movement will feel.

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:44.852
So yes,

00:10:44.876 --> 00:10:48.574
biology has all the attributes
of a transportation genius today.

00:10:48.598 --> 00:10:51.407
But this process has taken
billions of years,

00:10:51.431 --> 00:10:54.433
and went through all sorts
of iterations and mutations.

00:10:54.892 --> 00:10:58.320
We can't wait billions of years
to evolve our transportation system.

00:10:58.979 --> 00:11:00.807
We now have the dreams,
