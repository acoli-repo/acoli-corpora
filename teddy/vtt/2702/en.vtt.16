00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:00.594
and the efficiencies of trains and buses.

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:02.864
Just imagine.

00:08:02.888 --> 00:08:07.136
You're comfortably sitting
in a fast and smooth urban train,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.271
along with 1,200 passengers.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.637
The problem with urban trains

00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:16.056
is that sometimes you have to stop
five, ten, fifteen times

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.621
before your final destination.

00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:21.332
What if in this train
you didn't have to stop?

00:08:21.929 --> 00:08:23.198
In this train,

00:08:23.222 --> 00:08:26.451
wagons can detach dynamically
while you're moving

00:08:27.012 --> 00:08:29.494
and become express, driverless buses

00:08:29.518 --> 00:08:31.571
that move on a secondary road network.
