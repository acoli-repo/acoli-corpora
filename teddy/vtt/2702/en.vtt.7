It really is the world's most
sophisticated transportation laboratory.

00:03:31.326 --> 00:03:36.829
So, what if the solution to our traffic
challenges was inside us?

00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:39.160
I wanted to know:

00:03:39.184 --> 00:03:42.980
Why is it that blood flows
in our veins most of our lives,

00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:46.596
when our big cities get clogged
on a daily basis?

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.554
And the reality is that you're looking
at two very different networks.

00:03:52.013 --> 00:03:53.832
I don't know if you realize,

00:03:54.223 --> 00:03:58.920
but each of us has 60,000 miles
of blood vessels in our bodies --

00:03:58.944 --> 00:04:00.238
60,000 miles.
