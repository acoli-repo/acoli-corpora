00:03:58.944 --> 00:04:00.238
60,000 miles.

00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:02.854
That's two-and-a-half times
the Earth's circumference,

00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:04.131
inside you.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.179
What it means is that blood vessels
are everywhere inside us,

00:04:08.203 --> 00:04:10.230
not just under the surface of our skin.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.819
But if you look at our cities,

and also some helicopters in the sky.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.768
But the vast majority of our traffic
is focused on the ground,

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:25.969
on the surface.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.805
So in other words,

00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:32.208
while our vascular system uses
the three dimensions inside us,
