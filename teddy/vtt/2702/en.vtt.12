00:05:59.474 --> 00:06:01.292
Always comes when you're late, right?

00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:02.451
(Laughter)

00:06:02.475 --> 00:06:04.638
That driver is looking for parking.

00:06:05.193 --> 00:06:07.410
There is no parking spot
available in the area,

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:08.777
but how would he know?

00:06:09.552 --> 00:06:14.468
It is estimated that up to 30 percent
of urban traffic is generated

00:06:14.492 --> 00:06:16.217
by drivers looking for parking.

00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:18.965
Do you see the 100 cars around you?

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:22.160
Eighty-five of them
only have one passenger.

00:06:22.571 --> 00:06:26.791
Those 85 drivers could all fit
in one Londonian red bus.

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:28.490
So the question is:

00:06:28.514 --> 00:06:31.574
Why are we wasting so much space
if it is what we need the most?
