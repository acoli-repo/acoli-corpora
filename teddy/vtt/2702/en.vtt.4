00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:01.331
For decades,

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:03.663
our remedy for congestion was simple:

00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:06.728
build new roads or enlarge existing ones.

00:02:07.198 --> 00:02:08.348
And it worked.

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:10.830
It worked admirably for Paris,

00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:13.944
when the city tore down
hundreds of historical buildings

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:15.615
to create 85 miles

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.920
of transportation-friendly boulevards.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.099
And it still works today
in fast-growing emerging cities.

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.945
But in more established urban centers,

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.899
significant network expansions
are almost impossible:

00:02:28.923 --> 00:02:30.843
habitat is just too dense,
