00:06:56.098 --> 00:07:00.136
more than 95 percent
of their oxygen capacity is utilized.

00:07:00.494 --> 00:07:03.355
Can you imagine if the vehicles
we used in our cities

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:05.063
were 95 percent full,

00:07:05.087 --> 00:07:08.471
all the additional space
you would have to walk, to bike

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:10.033
and to enjoy our cities?

00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:14.129
The reason blood is so
incredibly efficient

00:07:14.153 --> 00:07:17.254
is that our red blood cells
are not dedicated

00:07:17.278 --> 00:07:19.132
to specific organs or tissues;

00:07:19.497 --> 00:07:22.608
otherwise, we would probably have
traffic jams in our veins.

00:07:22.632 --> 00:07:23.864
No, they're shared.

00:07:23.888 --> 00:07:26.264
They're shared by all
the cells of our body.

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:29.390
And because our network is so extensive,

00:07:29.414 --> 00:07:34.174
each one of our 37 trillion cells
gets its own deliveries of oxygen
