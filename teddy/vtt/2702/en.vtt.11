00:05:30.415 --> 00:05:33.044
So building this 3-D
transportation network

00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:38.386
is one of the ways we can mitigate
and solve traffic jams.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.820
But it's not the only one.

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:41.875
We have to question

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:45.666
other fundamental choices
that we made, like the vehicles we use.

00:05:46.278 --> 00:05:48.618
Just imagine a very familiar scene:

00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:51.116
You've been driving for 42 minutes.

00:05:51.656 --> 00:05:54.379
The two kids behind you
are getting restless.

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:56.104
And you're late.

00:05:56.754 --> 00:05:59.019
Do you see that slow car in front of you?

00:05:59.474 --> 00:06:01.292
Always comes when you're late, right?
