00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:32.208
while our vascular system uses
the three dimensions inside us,

00:04:32.232 --> 00:04:34.996
our urban transportation
is mostly two-dimensional.

00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:38.914
And so what we need
is to embrace that verticality.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.855
If our surface grid is saturated,

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.777
well, let's elevate our traffic.

00:04:44.174 --> 00:04:48.058
This Chinese concept of a bus
that can straddle traffic jams --

00:04:48.694 --> 00:04:53.079
that was an eye-opener on new ways
to think about space and movement

00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:54.389
inside our cities.

00:04:54.863 --> 00:04:56.675
And we can go higher,

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.991
and suspend our transportation
like we did with our electrical grid.
