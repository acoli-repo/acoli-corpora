00:06:28.514 --> 00:06:31.574
Why are we wasting so much space
if it is what we need the most?

00:06:31.598 --> 00:06:33.360
Why are we doing this to ourselves?

00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:35.700
Biology would never do this.

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:39.236
Space inside our arteries
is fully utilized.

00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:41.246
At every heartbeat,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.283
a higher blood pressure literally compacts
millions of red blood cells

00:06:45.307 --> 00:06:47.425
into massive trains of oxygen

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.338
that quickly flow throughout our body.

00:06:49.771 --> 00:06:53.701
And the tiny space inside our red
blood cells is not wasted, either.

00:06:54.357 --> 00:06:56.074
In healthy conditions,

00:06:56.098 --> 00:07:00.136
more than 95 percent
of their oxygen capacity is utilized.
