00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:30.460
and coping with human unpredictability,

00:09:30.484 --> 00:09:32.096
which is more challenging.

00:09:33.063 --> 00:09:36.490
But what would happen
when whole cities become driverless?

00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:38.827
Would we need traffic lights?

00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:40.447
Would we need lanes?

00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:41.970
How about speed limits?

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:44.852
Red blood cells are not flowing in lanes.

00:09:45.402 --> 00:09:47.363
They never stop at red lights.

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:49.363
In the first driverless cities,

00:09:49.387 --> 00:09:51.504
you would have no red lights and no lanes.

00:09:52.014 --> 00:09:55.087
And when all the cars
are driverless and connected,

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.195
everything is predictable
and reaction time, minimum.

00:09:59.219 --> 00:10:01.133
They can drive much faster
