00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:03.195
the city's vascular system
performing its vital function

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.429
right before your eyes.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:08.409
But when I'm sitting in my car

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.312
after an hour and a half
of commute every day,

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:14.213
that reality looks very different.

00:01:14.237 --> 00:01:15.291
(Laughter)

00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:16.473
Nothing --

00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:18.187
not public radio,

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.370
no podcast --

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:20.422
(Laughter)

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.455
Not even mindfulness meditation

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.094
makes this time worth living.

00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:25.727
(Laughter)

00:01:26.072 --> 00:01:27.226
Isn't it absurd

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.707
that we created cars
that can reach 130 miles per hour
