Others project an energy
that they can hardly contain,

00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:32.754
like New York

00:00:32.778 --> 00:00:34.003
or Hong Kong.

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:36.806
And then you have Paris

00:00:37.492 --> 00:00:39.204
or Istanbul,

00:00:39.228 --> 00:00:41.201
and their patina full of history.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.158
I see cities as living beings.

00:00:44.514 --> 00:00:46.982
And when I discover them from far above,

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:51.431
I like to find those main streets
and highways that structure their space.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.495
Especially at night,

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.342
when commuters make these arteries
look dramatically red and golden:

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:03.195
the city's vascular system
performing its vital function
