They can drive much faster

00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:04.094
and can take any rational initiative
that can speed them up

00:10:04.118 --> 00:10:05.475
or the cars around them.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.275
So instead of rigid traffic rules,

00:10:10.203 --> 00:10:11.535
flow will be regulated

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:16.386
by a mesh of dynamic and constantly
self-improving algorithms.

00:10:18.468 --> 00:10:21.195
The result: a strange traffic

00:10:21.219 --> 00:10:24.730
that mixes the fast and smooth
rigor of German autobahns

00:10:24.754 --> 00:10:28.054
and the creative vitality
of the intersections of Mumbai.

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:30.254
