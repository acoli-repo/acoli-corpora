00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.707
that we created cars
that can reach 130 miles per hour

00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:37.353
and we now drive them at the same speed
as 19th-century horse carriages?

00:01:37.377 --> 00:01:38.636
(Laughter)

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.402
In the US alone,

00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:45.820
we spent 29.6 billion hours
commuting in 2014.

00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:47.899
With that amount of time,

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:52.214
ancient Egyptians could have built
26 Pyramids of Giza.

00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:53.284
(Laughter)

00:01:53.308 --> 00:01:54.706
We do that in one year.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.106
A monumental waste of time,
energy and human potential.
