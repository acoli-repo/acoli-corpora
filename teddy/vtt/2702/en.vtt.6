00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:02.917
was leveraging specific properties
of our vascular system.

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:06.050
"Wow," I thought, "Our vascular system --

00:03:06.074 --> 00:03:09.150
all the veins and arteries in our body

00:03:09.174 --> 00:03:12.381
making miracles of logistics every day."

00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:15.270
This is the moment I realized

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:18.277
that biology has been
in the transportation business

00:03:18.301 --> 00:03:19.812
for billions of years.

00:03:20.364 --> 00:03:22.728
It has been testing countless solutions

00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:26.051
to move nutrients, gases and proteins.

00:03:26.532 --> 00:03:30.893
It really is the world's most
sophisticated transportation laboratory.
