00:07:56.458 --> 00:08:00.143
this unjust and extractive approach
to living on this planet

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:01.417
and survive.

00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:07.768
(Applause)

00:08:07.792 --> 00:08:10.726
To survive this next phase
of our human existence,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.018
we will need to restructure
our social and economic systems

00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:16.250
to develop our collective resilience.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:22.309
The social restructuring must be
towards restoration and repair

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:23.768
of the earth

00:08:23.792 --> 00:08:26.643
and the communities
that have been extracted from,

00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:27.934
criminalized

00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.208
and targeted for generations.
