the leadership and
the traditional knowledge

00:10:34.042 --> 00:10:36.333

It means that we must commit
to standards of ecological equity

00:10:40.792 --> 00:10:43.518
and climate justice and human rights

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.768

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:03.351
It requires us to believe in the things
that we are privileged enough
