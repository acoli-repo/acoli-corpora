00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:00.143
or be forced to resettle somewhere else

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:01.643
less climate resilient,

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:03.101
less expensive

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:04.375
and alone.

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:08.726
The climate crisis
is a much larger conversation

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.101
than reducing CO2 emissions,

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:15.268
and it is a much different conversation
than just extreme weather.

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:19.583
We're facing a shift
in every aspect of our global reality.

00:06:20.292 --> 00:06:23.393
And climate migration
is just one small part,

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:25.476
but it's going to have ripple effects

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.750
in both coastal cities
and cities in the interior.

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:31.018
So what do we do?
