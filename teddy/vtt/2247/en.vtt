00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:03.833
It was about two years
after Hurricane Katrina

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:06.667
that I first saw the Louisiana flood maps.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.268
These flood maps are used
to show land loss in the past

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:13.851
and land loss that is to come.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.976
On this particular day,
at a community meeting,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.101
these maps were used to explain

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:23.476
how a 30-foot tidal surge
that accompanied Hurricane Katrina

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.851
could flood communities like mine
in south Louisiana

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:30.167
and communities across
the Mississippi and Alabama coast.
