00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:32.059
it's predicted that
more than 180 million people

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:34.476
will be displaced due to climate change,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.184
and in south Louisiana,

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:39.851
those who can afford to do so
are already moving.

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:42.851
They're moving because
south Louisiana is losing land

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.208
at one of the fastest rates on the planet.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.059
Disappearance is what my bayou community

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:51.958
has in common with
other coastal communities.

00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:56.768
Erasure is what communities
around the globe are fighting

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:59.750
as we get real about
the impacts of climate change.
