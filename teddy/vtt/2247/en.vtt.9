00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:37.184
are only prepared to make profit
off of people who migrate.

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:42.726
This will cause rounds
of climate gentrification,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.559
and it will also penalize
the movement of people,

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:48.893
usually through exploited labor

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:51.208
and usually through criminalization.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:56.393
