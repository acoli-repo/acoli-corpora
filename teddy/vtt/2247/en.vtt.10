00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:02.226
where communities
that were kept from the waterfront

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.893
are now being priced out
of the high ground

00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:07.684
where they were placed originally

00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:10.018
as people move away from the coast.

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:12.643
These folks are being moved,
forced to relocate away

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:15.792
from the social and economic systems
that they need to survive.

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:22.833
Climate gentrification also happens
in the aftermath of climate disaster.

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:26.059
When massive amounts
of people leave a location

00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:28.268
for an indefinite amount of time,

00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:30.601
we see others come in.
