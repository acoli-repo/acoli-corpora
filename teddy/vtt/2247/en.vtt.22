00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.143

00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:15.559
We must transform from a disposable,

00:11:15.583 --> 00:11:18.268
individual society

00:11:18.292 --> 00:11:22.143
into one that sees our collective,
long-term humanity,

00:11:22.167 --> 00:11:24.042

We must see that even the best of us
are entangled in an unjust system,
