00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:30.601
we see others come in.

00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:33.184
We also see climate gentrification happen

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:37.643
when damaged homes are now "green built,"

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:39.643
but now have a higher value,

00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:43.184
generally outside of the reach
of black and brown and poor people

00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:44.458
who want to return home.

00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:49.809
The price difference in rents
or the ownership of a house

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:53.726
is the difference between
being able to practice your right,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.101
your human right
to return home as a community,

00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:00.143
or be forced to resettle somewhere else
