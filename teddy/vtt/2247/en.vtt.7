00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:30.476
when they leave when they're displaced
by climate disaster,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.976
even when they don't cross
international borders.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.976
These terms, these misused terms,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.934
that are meant to identify the other,

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.708
the victim,

00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:45.934
the person who is not supposed to be here,

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.934
these terms are barriers

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.226
to economic recovery,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.268
to social integration

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:56.458
and to the healing required from
the climate crisis and climate trauma.

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:59.351
Words matter.

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:02.375
It also matters how we treat
people who are crossing borders.
