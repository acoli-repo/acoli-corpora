and communities across
the Mississippi and Alabama coast.

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:35.667
It turns out that the land we were losing
was our buffer from the sea.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:40.559
I volunteered to interact
with the graphics on the wall,

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:44.292
and in an instant my life changed
for the second time in two years.

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:50.059
The graphic showed
massive land loss in south Louisiana

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.184
and an encroaching sea,

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:58.809
but more specifically, the graphic showed
the disappearance of my community

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:02.000
and many other communities
before the end of the century.
