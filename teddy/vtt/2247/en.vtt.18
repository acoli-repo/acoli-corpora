00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:00.518
no matter who they are,

00:09:00.542 --> 00:09:01.958
no matter where they're from.

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:07.875
What would it mean if we started
to plan for climate migration now?

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:12.893
Sprawling cities or declining cities
could see this as an opportunity

00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:17.851
to rebuild a social infrastructure
rooted in justice and fairness.

00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:20.601
We could actually put money
into public hospitals

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:22.101
and help them prepare

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:24.351
for what is to come
through climate migration,

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:27.917
including the trauma
that comes with loss and relocation.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.059
We can invest more of our time in justice,
