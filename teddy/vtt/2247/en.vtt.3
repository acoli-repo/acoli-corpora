00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:34.309
Friends, neighbors, family, my community:

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.958
I just assumed it would always be there.

00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:42.893
Land, trees, marsh, bayous:

00:01:42.917 --> 00:01:47.018
I just assumed that it would be there
as it had been for thousands of years.

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:48.292
I was wrong.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.851
To understand what was happening
to my community,

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:55.851
I had to talk to other communities
around the globe.

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:59.268
I started in south Louisiana
with the United Houma Nation.

00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:03.184
I talked to youth advocates
in Shishmaref, Alaska.
