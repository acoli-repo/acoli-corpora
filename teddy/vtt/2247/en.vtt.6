00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:04.518
I've spent the last 14 years
advocating on behalf of communities

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:07.601
that have been directly impacted
by the climate crisis.

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.934
These communities
are fighting discrimination

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.809
within climate disaster recovery,

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:16.768
and they're also trying to balance
mass displacement of people

00:03:16.792 --> 00:03:18.601
with an influx of others

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.000
who see opportunity in starting anew.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.268
Since 2005, people
have been called "refugees"

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:30.476
when they leave when they're displaced
by climate disaster,
