Last week, my team and I

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.406
spent time visiting mothers

00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:06.917
that have all experienced the same thing:

00:10:06.917 --> 00:10:09.349
the death of a newborn.

00:10:09.349 --> 00:10:12.349
I'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful

00:10:12.349 --> 00:10:15.262
and more painful.

00:10:15.262 --> 00:10:17.894
This one is from Myanmar.

00:10:17.894 --> 00:10:19.900
She had the most beautiful smile,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.110
the smile, I think, that life gives you

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.497
when you've had a second chance.

00:10:24.497 --> 00:10:27.831
Her son, Myo, is her second one.

00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:29.735
She had a daughter

00:10:29.735 --> 00:10:32.127
who passed away at three weeks,
