00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:30.176
is handwashing with soap.

00:01:30.176 --> 00:01:33.431
Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school.

00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:36.254
It stops babies from dying.

00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:38.127
Handwashing with soap

00:01:38.127 --> 00:01:40.924
is one of the most cost-effective

00:01:40.924 --> 00:01:43.470
ways of saving children's lives.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.126
It can save over 600,000 children every year.

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:50.090
That's the equivalent of stopping

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.070
10 jumbo jets

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.998
full of babies and children

00:01:53.998 --> 00:01:56.709
from crashing every single day.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.133
I think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.415
useful public health intervention.
