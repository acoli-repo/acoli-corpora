00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:06.170
So imagine that a plane is about to crash

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.971
with 250 children and babies,

00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:12.390
and if you knew how to stop that, would you?

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.361
Now imagine

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:18.000
that 60 planes full of babies under five

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.210
crash every single day.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.982
That's the number of kids

00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:25.307
that never make it to their fifth birthday.

00:00:25.307 --> 00:00:28.547
6.6 million children

00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:32.138
never make it to their fifth birthday.
