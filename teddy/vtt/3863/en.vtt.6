94 percent of households in Kenya,

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:05.363
you will find soap.

00:03:05.363 --> 00:03:09.200

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.779
like Ethiopia, we are at 50 percent.

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:14.006
So why is it?

00:03:25.947 --> 00:03:28.379
soap is used for bathing,

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.371
soap is used for laundry,
