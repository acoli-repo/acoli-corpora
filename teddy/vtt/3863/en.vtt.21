00:10:29.735 --> 00:10:32.127
who passed away at three weeks,

00:10:32.127 --> 00:10:34.480
and we know that the majority

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.820
of children that actually die

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.686
die in the first month of their life,

00:10:37.686 --> 00:10:40.554
and we know that if we give a bar of soap

00:10:40.554 --> 00:10:42.814

00:10:42.814 --> 00:10:45.364

00:10:45.364 --> 00:10:46.606

00:10:50.518 --> 00:10:52.750
inspires me to continue in this mission,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.134
to know that I can equip her

00:10:55.134 --> 00:10:56.939
with what's needed

00:10:56.939 --> 00:10:58.790
so that she can do

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.854
the most beautiful job in the world:
