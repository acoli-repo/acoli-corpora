00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.415
useful public health intervention.

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:05.365
So now just take a minute.

00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:07.301
I think you need to get to
know the person next to you.

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:09.249
Why don't you just shake their hands.

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.493
Please shake their hands.

00:02:11.493 --> 00:02:12.793
All right, get to know each other.

00:02:12.793 --> 00:02:14.328
They look really pretty.

00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:16.101
All right.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.399
So what if I told you

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.984
that the person whose hands you just shook

00:02:20.984 --> 00:02:22.692
actually didn't wash their hands

00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:25.350
when they were coming out of the toilet?
(Laughter)

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.680
They don't look so pretty anymore, right?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.836
Pretty yucky, you would agree with me.
