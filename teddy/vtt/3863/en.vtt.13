00:06:27.438 --> 00:06:30.813
especially in terms of the pandemics

00:06:30.813 --> 00:06:33.350
and epidemics such as cholera,

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.805
or Ebola at the moment,

00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:37.345
but with competing priorities.

00:06:37.345 --> 00:06:39.850
The budget is not always there.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.713
And when you think about this,

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:43.820

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.141
to make handwashing a daily habit,

00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:49.962
it requires sustained funding

00:06:49.962 --> 00:06:53.070
to refine this behavior.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.503
In short, those that fight for public health

00:06:57.503 --> 00:07:00.267
are actually dependent upon the soap companies
