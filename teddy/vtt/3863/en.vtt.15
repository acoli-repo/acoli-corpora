00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.633
And most importantly,

00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:34.240
win for the most vulnerable.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.296
On October 15,

00:07:36.296 --> 00:07:38.648
we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day.

00:07:38.648 --> 00:07:40.368
Schools, communities,

00:07:40.368 --> 00:07:42.248
our friends in the public sector

00:07:42.248 --> 00:07:44.864
and our friends in the private sector —

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:47.144
yes, on that day even our competitors,

00:07:47.144 --> 00:07:49.130
we all join hands to celebrate

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.112
the world's most important

00:07:51.112 --> 00:07:53.160
public health intervention.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.385
What's required,

00:07:54.385 --> 00:07:57.121
and again where the private sector
can make a huge difference,

00:07:57.121 --> 00:08:00.887
is coming up with this big, creative thinking
