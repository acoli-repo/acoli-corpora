00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.203
science and facts into compelling messages.

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:34.099
Just for a minute, imagine

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.840
when they put all their forces behind

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.790
a message as powerful as handwashing with soap.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.749
The profit motive is transforming health outcomes

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:44.627
in this world.

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:46.446
But it's been happening for centuries:

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:49.979
the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.715
in Victorian England

00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:53.987
to actually combat cholera.

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:56.291
Last week, I was in Ghana

00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:57.830
with the minister of health,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.049
because if you don't know,

00:05:59.049 --> 00:06:01.706
there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.
