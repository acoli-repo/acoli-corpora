It's that belief, plus the scale of Unilever,

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.729
that allows us to keep talking about

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.545
handwashing with soap and
hygiene to these mothers.

00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:10.817
Big businesses and brands can change

00:05:10.817 --> 00:05:12.969
and shift those social norms

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:14.881
and make a difference for those habits

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:17.061
that are so stubborn.

00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:18.319
Think about it:

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.824
Marketeers spend all their time

00:05:21.824 --> 00:05:26.180
making us switch from one brand to the other.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.170
And actually, they know how to transform

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.203
science and facts into compelling messages.
