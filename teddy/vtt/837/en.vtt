The key question is, "When are we going to get fusion?"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion.

We've known about fusion since 1920,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
when my mother gave me food,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I always sorted the ones I disliked

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
from the ones I liked.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And I ate the disliked ones first,
