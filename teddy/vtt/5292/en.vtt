00:00:06.814 --> 00:00:14.045
The average 20 year old knows 
between 27,000 and 52,000 different words.

00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:20.053
By age 60, that number averages 
between 35,000 and 56,000.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:24.330
Spoken out loud, most of these words 
last less than a second.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.535
So with every word, the brain 
has a quick decision to make:

00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:32.235
which of those thousands of options 
matches the signal?
