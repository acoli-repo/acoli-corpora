00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:02.242
those systems were compromised
by the Chinese government,

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:04.663
because the Chinese government
wanted to figure out

00:04:04.687 --> 00:04:07.579
which of their own agents
the US government was monitoring.

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.540
By the same token,

00:04:09.564 --> 00:04:12.983
in 2004, the surveillance system
built into the network

00:04:13.007 --> 00:04:16.181
of Vodafone Greece --
Greece's largest telephone company --

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.784
was compromised by an unknown entity,

00:04:18.808 --> 00:04:20.848
and that feature,
the surveillance feature,

00:04:20.872 --> 00:04:23.150
was used to wiretap
the Greek Prime Minister

00:04:23.174 --> 00:04:24.893
and members of the Greek cabinet.

00:04:25.313 --> 00:04:28.377
The foreign government or hackers
who did that were never caught.

00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:33.652
And really, this gets to the very problem
with these surveillance features,
