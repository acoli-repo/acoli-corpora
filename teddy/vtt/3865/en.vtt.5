00:02:28.253 --> 00:02:30.071
What upsets them the most

00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:34.262
is that the tech companies have built
encryption features into their products

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:36.159
and turned them on by default.

00:02:36.547 --> 00:02:38.517
It's the default piece that matters.

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:42.316
In short, the tech companies
have democratized encryption.

00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:46.962
And so, government officials
like British Prime Minister David Cameron,

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:51.833
they believe that all communications --
emails, texts, voice calls --

00:02:51.857 --> 00:02:54.445
all of these should be
available to governments,

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.571
and encryption is making that difficult.

00:02:57.478 --> 00:03:00.862
Now, look -- I'm extremely sympathetic
to their point of view.
