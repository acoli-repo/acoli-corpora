00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:33.758
Our telephones and the networks
that carry our calls

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:36.155
were wired for surveillance first.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:37.582
First and foremost.

00:00:38.763 --> 00:00:42.589
So what that means is that
when you're talking to your spouse,

00:00:42.613 --> 00:00:46.935
your children, a colleague
or your doctor on the telephone,

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:48.445
someone could be listening.

00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.466
Now, that someone might
be your own government;

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.653
it could also be another government,
a foreign intelligence service,

00:00:55.677 --> 00:00:58.504
or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker

00:00:58.528 --> 00:01:02.098
or any other party that breaks into
the surveillance system,
