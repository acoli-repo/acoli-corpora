00:00:01.343 --> 00:00:03.072
For more than 100 years,

00:00:03.096 --> 00:00:07.122
the telephone companies have provided
wiretapping assistance to governments.

00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:10.684
For much of this time,
this assistance was manual.

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:14.826
Surveillance took place manually
and wires were connected by hand.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.600
Calls were recorded to tape.

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:19.478
But as in so many other industries,

00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:21.268
computing has changed everything.

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:24.748
The telephone companies
built surveillance features

00:00:24.772 --> 00:00:26.817
into the very core of their networks.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.474
I want that to sink in for a second:

00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:33.758
Our telephones and the networks
that carry our calls
