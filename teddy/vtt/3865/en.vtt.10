00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:01.270
encryption is going to make
wiretapping more difficult.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.949
It means that the police
are going to have a tougher time

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.285
catching bad guys.

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:07.865
But the alternative would mean
to live in a world

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.520
where anyone's calls or anyone's
text messages could be surveilled

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:15.270
by criminals, by stalkers
and by foreign intelligence agencies.

00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:17.606
And I don't want to live
in that kind of world.

00:05:18.102 --> 00:05:20.817
And so right now,
you probably have the tools

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:23.159
to thwart many kinds
of government surveillance

00:05:23.183 --> 00:05:26.166
already on your phones
and already in your pockets,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.969
you just might not realize how strong
and how secure those tools are,

00:05:29.993 --> 00:05:33.522
or how weak the other ways
you've used to communicate really are.
