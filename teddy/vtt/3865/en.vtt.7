00:03:26.577 --> 00:03:30.252
What that means is that
if the drug dealers' telephone calls

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.821
or the terrorists' telephone calls
can be intercepted,

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.841
then so can the rest of ours, too.

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:36.492
And I think we really need to ask:

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:39.643
Should a billion people
around the world be using devices

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.086
that are wiretap friendly?

00:03:43.407 --> 00:03:47.155
So the scenario of hacking of surveillance
systems that I've described --

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:49.290
this is not imaginary.

00:03:49.622 --> 00:03:50.774
In 2009,

00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:54.845
the surveillance systems that Google
and Microsoft built into their networks --

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:58.360
the systems that they use to respond
to lawful surveillance requests

00:03:58.384 --> 00:03:59.550
from the police --

00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:02.242
those systems were compromised
by the Chinese government,
