00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:33.652
And really, this gets to the very problem
with these surveillance features,

00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:34.936
or backdoors.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.162
When you build a backdoor
into a communications network

00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:39.487
or piece of technology,

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:42.559
you have no way of controlling
who's going to go through it.

00:04:43.243 --> 00:04:44.688
You have no way of controlling

00:04:44.712 --> 00:04:47.482
whether it'll be used by your side
or the other side,

00:04:47.506 --> 00:04:49.417
by good guys, or by bad guys.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.499
And so for that reason,
I think that it's better

00:04:52.523 --> 00:04:55.175
to build networks
to be as secure as possible.

00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:58.680
Yes, this means that in the future,

00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:01.270
encryption is going to make
wiretapping more difficult.
