such a harmless and unthreatening

and uninteresting person that I actually don't fear

said this: He said,

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:57.884
"If you're doing something that you don't want

00:02:57.884 --> 00:02:59.898
other people to know,

00:02:59.898 --> 00:03:03.903
maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."
