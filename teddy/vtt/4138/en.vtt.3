00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:32.679
because only people who are engaged in bad acts

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.748
have a reason to want to hide

00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:37.459
and to care about their privacy.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.240
This worldview is implicitly grounded

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.416
in the proposition that there are
two kinds of people in the world,

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:44.452
good people and bad people.

00:01:44.452 --> 00:01:47.420
Bad people are those who plot terrorist attacks

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.918
or who engage in violent criminality

00:01:48.918 --> 00:01:52.070
and therefore have reasons to
want to hide what they're doing,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.127
have reasons to care about their privacy.

00:01:54.127 --> 00:01:56.950
But by contrast, good people

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.603
are people who go to work,

00:01:58.603 --> 00:02:01.505
come home, raise their children, watch television.
