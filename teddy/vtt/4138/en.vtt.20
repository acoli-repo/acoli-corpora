00:09:59.263 --> 00:10:02.813
and privacy is the George Orwell novel "1984,"

00:10:02.813 --> 00:10:06.280
which we all learn in school, and
therefore it's almost become a cliche.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.349
In fact, whenever you bring it up
in a debate about surveillance,

00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:10.598
people instantaneously dismiss it

00:10:10.598 --> 00:10:12.900
as inapplicable, and what they say is,

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.183
"Oh, well in '1984,' there were
monitors in people's homes,

00:10:16.183 --> 00:10:18.348
they were being watched at every given moment,

00:10:18.348 --> 00:10:22.310
and that has nothing to do with
the surveillance state that we face."

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.230
That is an actual fundamental misapprehension

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.931
of the warnings that Orwell issued in "1984."

00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:29.582
The warning that he was issuing

00:10:29.582 --> 00:10:31.190
was about a surveillance state
