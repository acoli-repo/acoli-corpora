like breathing air or drinking water.

00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:02.931
The reason is that when we're in a state

00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:05.588
where we can be monitored,
where we can be watched,

00:07:05.588 --> 00:07:08.264
our behavior changes dramatically.

00:07:08.264 --> 00:07:11.297
The range of behavioral options that we consider

00:07:11.297 --> 00:07:13.105

This is just a fact of human nature

and in virtually every field of discipline.

00:07:23.898 --> 00:07:26.680
There are dozens of psychological studies

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.231
that prove that when somebody knows

00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:30.800
that they might be watched,
