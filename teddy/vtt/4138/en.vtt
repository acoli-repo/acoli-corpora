00:00:00.855 --> 00:00:03.798
There is an entire genre of YouTube videos

00:00:03.798 --> 00:00:05.811
devoted to an experience which

00:00:05.811 --> 00:00:08.388
I am certain that everyone in this room has had.

00:00:08.388 --> 00:00:10.401
It entails an individual who,

00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:11.964
thinking they're alone,

00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:15.170
engages in some expressive behavior —

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.677
wild singing, gyrating dancing,

00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:20.280
some mild sexual activity —

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.878
only to discover that, in fact, they are not alone,

00:00:22.878 --> 00:00:25.923
that there is a person watching and lurking,

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:27.678
the discovery of which causes them

00:00:27.678 --> 00:00:29.578
to immediately cease what they were doing

00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:31.468
in horror.
