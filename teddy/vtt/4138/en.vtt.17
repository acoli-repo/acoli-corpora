00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:31.975
of an enormous tower in the center of the institution

00:08:31.975 --> 00:08:34.123
where whoever controlled the institution

00:08:34.123 --> 00:08:36.808
could at any moment watch any of the inmates,

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:40.130
although they couldn't watch all of them at all times.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.185
And crucial to this design

00:08:42.185 --> 00:08:43.980
was that the inmates could not actually

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.856
see into the panopticon, into the tower,

00:08:46.856 --> 00:08:48.528
and so they never knew

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.700
if they were being watched or even when.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.283
And what made him so excited about this discovery

00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:56.156
was that that would mean that the prisoners

00:08:56.156 --> 00:08:59.184
would have to assume that they were being watched

00:08:59.184 --> 00:09:00.869
at any given moment,
