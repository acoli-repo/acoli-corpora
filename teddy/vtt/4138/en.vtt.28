00:13:58.499 --> 00:14:00.264
that you never want to,

00:14:00.264 --> 00:14:01.898
the fact that there are other people

00:14:01.898 --> 00:14:04.102
who are willing to and able to resist

00:14:04.102 --> 00:14:06.136
and be adversarial to those in power —

00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:07.670
dissidents and journalists

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.758
and activists and a whole range of others —

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:15.230

of how free a society is

00:14:19.587 --> 00:14:21.737
is not how it treats its good,

00:14:21.737 --> 00:14:24.200
obedient, compliant citizens,

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.040
but how it treats its dissidents

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.155
and those who resist orthodoxy.

00:14:29.155 --> 00:14:30.752
But the most important reason
