00:10:29.582 --> 00:10:31.190
was about a surveillance state

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.354
not that monitored everybody at all times,

00:10:33.354 --> 00:10:35.407
but where people were aware that they could

00:10:35.407 --> 00:10:37.036

"At any rate, they could plug in your wire

00:10:51.454 --> 00:10:53.163
whenever they wanted to.

00:10:53.163 --> 00:10:55.742
