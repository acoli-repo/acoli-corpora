The Earth is 4.6 billion years old,

00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:10.597
but a human lifetime often lasts
for less than 100 years.

00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:14.508
So why care about
the history of our planet

00:00:14.532 --> 00:00:20.389
when the distant past seems
so inconsequential to everyday life?

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.967
You see, as far as we can tell,

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:26.226
Earth is the only planet
in our solar system

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.759
known to have sparked life,

00:00:28.783 --> 00:00:34.182
and the only system able to provide
life support for human beings.
