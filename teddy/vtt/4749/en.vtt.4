00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.647
so the photons pass through.

00:02:00.647 --> 00:02:03.760
So, which photons does carbon dioxide prefer?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.585
Where is the black line in our rainbow

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:07.960
that explains global warming?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.789
Well, it's not there.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.952
Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb light directly

00:02:11.952 --> 00:02:13.286
from the Sun.

00:02:13.286 --> 00:02:14.507
It absorbs light from a totally

00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:16.232
different celestial body.

00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:19.016
One that doesn't appear to be emitting light at all:

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:20.739
Earth.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.175
If you're wondering why our planet

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.876
doesn't seem to be glowing,

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:27.138
it's because the Earth doesn't emit visible light.

00:02:27.138 --> 00:02:29.306
It emits infared light.

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:30.920
The light that our eyes can see,
