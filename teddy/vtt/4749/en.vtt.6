00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:01.969
the term visible light by our own limitations.

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.865
After all, infrared light is visible to snakes,

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:07.827
and ultraviolet light is visible to birds.

00:03:07.827 --> 00:03:09.907
If our eyes were adapted to see light of

00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:12.283
1900 megahertz, then a mobile phone

00:03:12.283 --> 00:03:13.423
would be a flashlight,

00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:14.425
and a cell phone tower

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:17.157
would look like a huge lantern.

00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:19.315
Earth emits infrared radiation

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:21.240
because every object with a temperature

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.468
above absolute zero will emit light.

00:03:24.468 --> 00:03:26.726
This is called thermal radiation.

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:28.158
The hotter an object gets,

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:30.857
the higher frequency the light it emits.
