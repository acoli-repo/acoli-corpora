00:00:27.134 --> 00:00:30.365
you'll see dark gaps where bands of color went missing.

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:31.753
Where did they go?

00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:33.168
Before reaching our eyes,

00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:35.080
different gases absorbed those

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.688
specific parts of the spectrum.

00:00:37.688 --> 00:00:39.847
For example, oxygen gas snatched up

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:41.695
some of the dark red light,

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:44.914
and sodium grabbed two bands of yellow.

00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:46.308
But why do these gases absorb

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:48.362
specific colors of light?

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:51.279
This is where we enter the quantum realm.

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:53.637
Every atom and molecule has a set number

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:56.968
of possible energy levels for its electrons.

00:00:56.968 --> 00:00:58.979
To shift its electrons from the ground state

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.297
to a higher level,
