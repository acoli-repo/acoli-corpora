00:03:56.187 --> 00:04:00.265
95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes.

00:04:00.265 --> 00:04:02.174
It's wasted as heat.

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:04.827
Earth's infrared radiation would escape to space

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.358
if there weren't greenhouse gas molecules

00:04:07.358 --> 00:04:09.080
in our atmophere.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.834
Just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons,

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.512
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases

00:04:14.512 --> 00:04:17.153
match with infrared photons.

00:04:17.153 --> 00:04:18.914
They provide the right amount of energy

00:04:18.914 --> 00:04:22.085
to shift the gas molecules into their higher energy level.

00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:24.410
Shortly after a carbon dioxide molecule

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.727
absorbs an infrared photon,

00:04:26.727 --> 00:04:29.182
it will fall back to its previous energy level,

00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:32.714
and spit a photon back out in a random direction.
