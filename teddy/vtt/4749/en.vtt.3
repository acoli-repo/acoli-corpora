00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:30.663
so a gas molecule can choose

00:01:30.663 --> 00:01:33.270
the photons that carry the exact amount of energy

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.024
needed to shift the molecule to

00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:37.381
its next energy level.

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:38.715
When this match is made,

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:40.644
the photon disappers as the molecule

00:01:40.644 --> 00:01:41.965
gains its energy,

00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:44.765
and we get a small gap in our rainbow.

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:47.887
If a photon carries too much or too little energy,

00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:49.366
the molecule has no choice but

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.219
to let it fly past.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.639
This is why glass is transparent.

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.711
The atoms in glass do not pair well

00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:58.384
with any of the energy levels in visible light,

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.647
so the photons pass through.
