00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:30.920
The light that our eyes can see,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.992
including all of the colors of the rainbow,

00:02:32.992 --> 00:02:35.422
is just a small part of the larger spectrum

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:37.825
of electromagnetic radiation,

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:40.198
which includes radio waves, microwaves,

00:02:40.198 --> 00:02:43.286
infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays,

00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:45.103
and gamma rays.

00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:47.744
It may seem strange to think of these things as light,

00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:49.291
but there is no fundamental difference

00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:53.027
between visible light and other electromagnetic radiation.

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:54.127
It's the same energy,

00:02:54.127 --> 00:02:56.394
but at a higher or lower level.

00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:58.374
In fact, it's a bit presumptuous to define

00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:01.969
the term visible light by our own limitations.
