00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:32.714
and spit a photon back out in a random direction.

00:04:32.714 --> 00:04:34.619
Some of that energy then returns

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:36.098
to Earth's surface,

00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:37.639
causing warming.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.447
The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,

00:04:39.447 --> 00:04:41.380
the more likely that infrared photons

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.558
will land back on Earth

00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:45.124
and change our climate.
