00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:30.857
the higher frequency the light it emits.

00:03:30.857 --> 00:03:32.561
When you heat a piece of iron,

00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:35.956
it will emit more and more frequencies of infrared light,

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:40.322
and then, at a temperature of around 450 degrees Celsius,

00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:43.082
its light will reach the visible spectrum.

00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:45.310
At first, it will look red hot.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.606
And with even more heat,

00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:48.112
it will glow white

00:03:48.112 --> 00:03:51.166
with all of the frequencies of visible light.

00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:52.857
This is how traditional light bulbs

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.309
were designed to work

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.187
and why they're so wasteful.

00:03:56.187 --> 00:04:00.265
95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes.
