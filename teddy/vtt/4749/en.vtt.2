00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.297
to a higher level,

00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:03.701
a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy.

00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:06.119
No more, no less.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.123
It gets that energy from light,

00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:11.292
which comes in more energy levels than you could count.

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:14.657
Light consists of tiny particles called photons

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.761
and the amount of energy in each photon

00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:19.126
corresponds to its color.

00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:22.149
Red light has lower energy and longer wavelengths.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.823
Purple light has higher energy and shorter wavelengths.

00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:28.642
Sunlight offers all the photons of the rainbow,

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:30.663
so a gas molecule can choose
