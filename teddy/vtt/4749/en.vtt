00:00:06.687 --> 00:00:07.668
You've probably heard that

00:00:07.668 --> 00:00:10.452
carbon dioxide is warming the Earth,

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:11.823
but how does it work?

00:00:11.823 --> 00:00:13.832
Is it like the glass of a greenhouse

00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:15.733
or like an insulating blanket?

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.852
Well, not entirely.

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:19.272
The answer involves a bit

00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:22.010
of quantum mechanics, but don't worry,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.959
we'll start with a rainbow.

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:25.818
If you look closely at sunlight separated

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:27.134
through a prism,

00:00:27.134 --> 00:00:30.365
you'll see dark gaps where bands of color went missing.
