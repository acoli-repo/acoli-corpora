00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.944
I like to get past the fur, the feathers

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:34.573
and the scales.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:36.801
I want to get under the skin.

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:39.601
No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant

00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:41.749
or a tiny tree frog,

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:48.641
my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.780
You may wonder, do I ever photograph people?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.615
Sure. People are always present in my photos,

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.742
no matter whether they appear

00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:00.561
to portray tortoises
