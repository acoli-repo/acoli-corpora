WEBVTT

00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:00.561
to portray tortoises

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:02.374
or cougars

00:02:02.374 --> 00:02:04.253
or lions.

00:02:04.253 --> 00:02:08.751
You just have to learn how 
to look past their disguise.

00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:10.485
As a photographer,

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:13.300
I try to reach beyond the differences

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.264
in our genetic makeup

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:18.861
to appreciate all we have in common

00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:22.239
with every other living thing.

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.568
When I use my camera,

00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:26.491
I drop my skin

00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.191
like the animals at that cave

00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:33.128
so I can show who they really are.
