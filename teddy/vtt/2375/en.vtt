Humanity takes center stage at TED,

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.313
but I would like to add 
a voice for the animals,

00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:13.112
whose bodies and minds 
and spirits shaped us.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:16.358
Some years ago, it was my good fortune

00:00:16.358 --> 00:00:18.306
to meet a tribal elder on an island

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:20.860
not far from Vancouver.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.238
His name is Jimmy Smith,

00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:25.487
and he shared a story with me

00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:27.840
that is told among his people,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.035
who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw.
