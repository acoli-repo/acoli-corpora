and salmon her scales,

00:01:00.907 --> 00:01:03.829
and then, they would dance.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.130
But one day, a human made it to the cave

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.714

Embarrassed, the animals fled,

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.934
and that was the last time

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.143

I like to get past the fur, the feathers
