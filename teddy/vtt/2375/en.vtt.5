As animals blessed

00:02:35.378 --> 00:02:38.752
with the power of rational thought,

00:02:38.752 --> 00:02:43.285
we can marvel at the intricacies of life.

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:46.121
As citizens of a planet in trouble,

00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:48.685
it is our moral responsibility

00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:54.240

we can all rejoice in the unity of life,
