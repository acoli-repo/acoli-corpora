00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
He has a telephone booth.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And then it started, there was no turning back after that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
near Agra.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Then there was no looking back at all for us.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We gave cycle rickshaws.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We set up carpet-weaving units,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
vocational training for the women.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The women were just not allowed to come out of the community

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and work with mainstream society. So, we were able to address that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Education. The kids never went to school.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They only had Islamic education, very little of it.
