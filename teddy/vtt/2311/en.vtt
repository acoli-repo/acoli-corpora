Hi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
these are the dancing bears.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In 1995, we started working on a two-year investigative research project

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to try and find out what was going on.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because of this.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
who live across India,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and have been in India since the 13th century.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We went about getting evidence of what was going on.
