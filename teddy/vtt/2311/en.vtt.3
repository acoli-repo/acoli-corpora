Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
for a livelihood, to getting something else.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So, this is Bitu Qalandar, who was our first experiment.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And we were so unsure that this would work.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And we said, "Okay, here is some seed fund.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Let's see if you can get something else." And we got the bear surrendered

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to -- we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
He has a telephone booth.
