00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They only had Islamic education, very little of it.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And they were never allowed to go to school

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So, we sponsor 600 children education programs today.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Of course we also had to get the bears in.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This is what happens to the bears when they come in.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And this is what we turn them into.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So, basically in 2002 there were

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
1,200 dancing bears.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We rescued over 550 dancing bears.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears.
