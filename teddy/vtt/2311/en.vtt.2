00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The couple are barely 18 years old.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They already have four children beside them. You can see them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So, we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now, when we started working deeper and digging deeper,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we found that it's an illegal act.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
These guys could go to jail for up to seven years

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
if they were caught by authorities.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It was unacceptable.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The mother bears are usually killed.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The cubs, which are taken, are separated.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod.
