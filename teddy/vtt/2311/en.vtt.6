00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The big news that I want to announce today

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
is that next month we will be bringing in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the very last bear of India,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
into our rescue center.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
(Applause)

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
which has been here for centuries.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And the people can hold their heads up high.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that they've lived all their lives.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again.
