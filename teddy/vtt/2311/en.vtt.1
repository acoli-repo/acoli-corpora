00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We went about getting evidence of what was going on.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And we went in, pretending to be buyers.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And we found this right in this very state, in Karnataka.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and being sold and traded.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
These were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and they are used for bear paw soup,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and also being trained, later on,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to become dancing bears like the one you just saw.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Sadly, the family of Qalandars depended on this bear.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The couple are barely 18 years old.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They already have four children beside them. You can see them.
