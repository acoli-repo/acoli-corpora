00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which has a dramatically negative impact on our life.

if you're trying to get a small business loan,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What are we going to do about it? I define simplicity
