00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.016
from start to finish,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.640
guiding and mentoring a local doctor
through the procedure step by step.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.016
Well, enough of me telling you about it.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.320
I'd now like to show you.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.776
We're now going to go live
to Dr. Marc Tompkins,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.360
an orthopedic surgeon
at the University of Minnesota.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.296
He's going to perform
an arthroscopic surgery for us,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.496
a keyhole surgery of the knee,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.056
and I'd like to disclose

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.240
that this patient has consented
to having their operation streamed.
