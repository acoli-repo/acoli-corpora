00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.680
really the endgame
in terms of what can be achieved?

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.056
I don't think so,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.856
and today I'd like to share with you

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.160
how I believe digital technology
can take us to even greater heights.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.816
I'm a surgeon by profession,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.216
and as I stand here today
talking to all of you,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.616
five billion people around the world
lack access to safe surgical care.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.056
Five billion people.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.696
That's 70 percent
of the world's population,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.176
who according to the WHO's
Lancet Commission

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.976
can't even access
simple surgical procedures

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.320
as and when they need them.
