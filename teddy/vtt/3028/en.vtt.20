00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.496
in getting specialist surgeons
to certain locations.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.416
In a world where
there are more mobile devices

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.296
than there are human beings,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.200
it truly has a global reach.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.736
Of course, we've still got a long way

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.256
before we can solve the problem
of getting surgery to five billion people,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.536
and unfortunately,

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.800
some people still
don't have access to internet.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.080
But things are rapidly moving
in the right direction.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.080
The potential for change is there.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.776
My team and I are growing
our global footprint,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.720
and we're starting to see
the potential of this technology.
