00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.776
And I remember one quote
from a mother who said,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.920
"This technology
gave my daughter her smile."

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.080
For me, this is the real power
of this technology.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.176
The beauty is that it breaks boundaries.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.560
It transcends all
technological difficulties.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.000
It connects people.
It democratizes access.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.416
Wi-Fi and mobile technology
are growing rapidly,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.456
and they should play a role
in boosting surgical provision.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.936
We've even seen it used in conflict zones
where there's considerable risk

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.496
in getting specialist surgeons
to certain locations.
