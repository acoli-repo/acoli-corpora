00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.320
as and when they need them.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.816
Let's zoom in on Sierra Leone,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.336
a country of six million people,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.840
where a recent study showed
that there are only 10 qualified surgeons.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.520
That's one surgeon
for every 600,000 people.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.800
The numbers are staggering,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.600
and we don't even need to look that far.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.296
If we look around us here in the US,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.056
a recent study reported that we need
an extra 100,000 surgeons by 2030

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.480
to just keep up with the demand
for routine surgical procedures.
