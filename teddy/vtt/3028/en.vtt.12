NHH: Great, so we can see there's
a small tear there on the meniscus,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.360
but otherwise it looks alright.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.216
And if you turn
and head to this direction,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.456
follow my finger,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.680
let's have a quick look
at the ACL and the PCL.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.936
That's your ACL there,
that looks quite healthy,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.216
no problems there.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.256
So we've just identified
that small meniscus tear there,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.000
but otherwise the fluid
around the joint looks OK as well.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.256
All right, thank you very much,
Dr. Tompkins. Thank you for your time.
