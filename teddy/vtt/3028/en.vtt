00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:03.695
According to the theories
of human social development,

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:05.936
we're now living
through the fourth great epoch

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.055
of technological advancement,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.280
the Information Age.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.816
Connectivity through digital technology
is a modern miracle.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.976
We can say it has broken down barriers
of time and space which separate people,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.896
and it's created a condition for an age

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.160
where information, ideas
can be shared freely.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.176
But are these great accomplishments
in digital technology

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.680
really the endgame
in terms of what can be achieved?
