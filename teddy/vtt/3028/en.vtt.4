00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.120
So what's the answer?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.096
Well, part of you are carrying
some of that solution with you today:

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.960
a smartphone, a tablet, a computer.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.456
Because for me,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.536
digital communications technology
has the power to do so much more

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.816
than just to allow us to shop online,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.888
to connect through social media platforms
and to stay up to date.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.096
It has the power to help us solve
some of the key issues that we face,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.640
like lack of access
to vital surgical services.
