00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.240
At the rate that we're going,
we won't be meeting those numbers.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.136
As a surgeon, this is
a global issue that bothers me.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.696
It bothers me a lot,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.536
because I've seen firsthand

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.416
how lack of access
to safe and affordable healthcare

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.360
can blight the lives of ordinary people.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.056
If you're a patient
that needs an operation

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.816
and there isn't a surgeon available,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.040
you're left with some
really difficult choices:

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.240
to wait, to travel,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.920
or not to have an operation at all.
