00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.696
I'd also like to point out
that in the interest of time,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.936
we're just going to go
through the first steps,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.216
marking up the patient

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.000
and just identifying
a few key anatomical landmarks.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.920
Hello, Dr. Tompkins, can you hear me?

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.176
Dr. Mark Tompkins: Good morning, Nadine.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.616
Nadine Hachach-Haram:
Everyone from TED says hello.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.840
Audience: Hi.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.496
NHH: Alright, Dr. Tompkins,
let's get started.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.816
So let's start with our incisions
and where we're going to make these,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.776
on either side of the patellar tendon.
