00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.320
I apologize for some
of the gruesome views.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.320
(Video) Doctor 1: OK. Show me again.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.856
Doctor 2: If you see here,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.936
that's the upper part,
the most outer part of your tumor.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.216
Doctor 1: Yes.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.096
Doctor 2: So it's
three centimeters deep,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.000
so this should be three centimeters.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.176
Doctor 1: Yes, yes.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.080
Doctor 2: OK,
so you need to get a 3.5 margin.

00:08:25.536 --> 00:08:27.536
Doctor 1: I'm going to show you anyway

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.120
and tell me what you think about it.
