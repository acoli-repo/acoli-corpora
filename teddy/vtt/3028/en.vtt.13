All right, thank you very much,
Dr. Tompkins. Thank you for your time.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.896
I'll let you continue.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.256
Have a good day. Bye.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.360
(Applause)

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.896
So I hope through
this simple demonstration

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.816
I was able to illustrate to you
just how powerful this technology can be.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.056
And I'd like to point out
that I wasn't using any special equipment,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.536
just my laptop and a really simple webcam.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.536
We're so used to using digital technology

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.800
to communicate through voice
and text and video,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.056
but augmented reality
can do something so much deeper.
