00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.176
And today I'd like to share with you

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.640
an example of how I think
we can make that possible.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.776
The history of surgery
is filled with breakthroughs

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.136
in how science and technology
was able to help the surgeons of the day

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.656
face their greatest challenges.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.656
If we go back several hundred years,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.576
an understanding of microbiology

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.936
led to the development
of antiseptic techniques,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.816
which played a big role in making sure

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.176
patients were able
to stay alive postsurgery.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.776
Fast-forward a few hundred years

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.136
and we developed
keyhole or arthroscopic surgery,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.056
which combines video technology
and precision instruments
