00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.056
which combines video technology
and precision instruments

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.760
to make surgery less invasive.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.096
And more recently, a lot of you
will be aware of robotic surgery,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.776
and what robotics brings to surgery
is much like modern automated machinery,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.000
ultraprecision,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.096
the ability to carry out procedures
at the tiniest scales

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.040
with a degree of accuracy
that even surpasses the human hand.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.640
But robotic surgery also introduced
something else to surgery:

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.936
the idea that a surgeon

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.640
doesn't actually have to be standing
at the patient's bedside to deliver care,
