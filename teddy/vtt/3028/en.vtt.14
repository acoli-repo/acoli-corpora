00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.056
but augmented reality
can do something so much deeper.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.376
It allows two people to virtually interact

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.115
in a way that mimics
how they would collaborate in person.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.416
Being able to show someone
what you want to do,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.576
to illustrate and demonstrate and gesture,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.840
is so much more powerful
than just telling them.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.056
And it can make
for such a great learning tool,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.440
because we learn better
through direct experience.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.496
So how is this making
a difference around the world?

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.576
Well, back in my teaching hospital,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.696
we've been using this to support
local district general hospitals

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.320
and providing skin cancer surgery
and trauma treatment.
