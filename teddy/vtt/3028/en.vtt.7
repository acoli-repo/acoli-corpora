00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.640
doesn't actually have to be standing
at the patient's bedside to deliver care,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.216
that he could be looking at a screen

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.400
and instructing a robot
through a computer.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.880
We call this remote surgery.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.496
It is incumbent on us

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.976
to find solutions that solve these answers
in a cost-effective and scalable way,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.656
so that everyone, no matter
where they are in the world,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.320
can have these problems addressed.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.096
So what if I told you

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.496
that you didn't really need
a million-dollar robot

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.760
to provide remote surgery?
