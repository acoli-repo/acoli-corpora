your incisions there and there,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.640
that should hopefully
get us into the knee.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.400
MT: All right, I'm going in.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.040
NHH: Great.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.640

So why don't we go around

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.880
MT: Perfect.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.496
NHH: Great, so we can see there's
a small tear there on the meniscus,
