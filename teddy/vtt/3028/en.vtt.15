00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.536
This reduces their travel time,
improves their access,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.760
and saves money.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.976
We've even started seeing its use
in wound care management with nurses

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.736
and in outpatient management.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.496
Most recently, and quite exciting,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.560

through a cancer removal of a kidney.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.160
And I'd like to just share with you
a very quick video here.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.320
I apologize for some
of the gruesome views.
