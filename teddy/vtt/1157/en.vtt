00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was asked to come here and speak about creation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I can -- in 15 minutes, I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which I call "creativity."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Creativity is how we cope with creation.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
creativity is always meaningful.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
See, for instance, in this picture.
