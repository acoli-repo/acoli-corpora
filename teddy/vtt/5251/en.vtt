00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.969
A canvas drenched in sunset hues,
colors radiating like flame.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.659
At first glance, this painting may appear 
to be an impossible, abstract image.

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.619
But a closer look reveals 
the tender stems,

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.079
lush petals and velvety texture 
of a Canna Lily.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.669
This metamorphosis of natural subjects
into abstract geometry

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.509
is commonplace in the work 
of Georgia O’Keeffe—

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.999
the revolutionary American painter 
and sculptor.
