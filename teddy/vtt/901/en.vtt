If I can leave you with one big idea today,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
it's that the whole of the data

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in which we consume

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is greater that the sum of the parts,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and instead of thinking about information overload,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
what I'd like you to think about is how

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we can use information so that patterns pop

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
organized by age.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents.
