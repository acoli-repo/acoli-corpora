00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:03.444
If I should have a daughter,

00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:05.579
instead of "Mom,"

00:00:05.603 --> 00:00:08.904
she's going to call me "Point B,"

00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:11.555
because that way she knows
that no matter what happens,

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.976
at least she can always find
her way to me.

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:17.920
And I'm going to paint solar systems
on the backs of her hands

00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:19.882
so she has to learn the entire universe

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:23.000
before she can say, "Oh, I know that
like the back of my hand."

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:24.976
And she's going to learn

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.976
that this life will hit you
hard in the face,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.295
wait for you to get back up just
so it can kick you in the stomach.
