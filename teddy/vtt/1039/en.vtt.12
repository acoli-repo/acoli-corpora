The poem was very indignant,

00:06:02.884 --> 00:06:04.026
and mainly exaggerated,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.278
but the only spoken-word poetry
that I had seen up until that point

00:06:07.302 --> 00:06:08.976
was mainly indignant,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.334

and I turned around to see

00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:25.402
this giant girl in a hoodie
sweatshirt emerge from the crowd.

00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:26.841
She was maybe eight feet tall

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:29.323
and looked like she could
beat me up with one hand,

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.424
but instead she just nodded
at me and said,
