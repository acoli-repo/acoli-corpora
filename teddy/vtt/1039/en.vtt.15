00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.001
laughed with me and groaned their sympathy

00:07:30.025 --> 00:07:33.328
and clapped and told me,

00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:37.403

00:07:37.427 --> 00:07:38.976
into three steps.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.817
Step one was the moment I said,

00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:42.976

00:07:52.386 --> 00:07:53.976
And step three began

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.800
when I realized I didn't have
to write indignant poems,

00:07:56.824 --> 00:07:58.222
if that's not what I was.

00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:00.411
There were things
that were specific to me,
