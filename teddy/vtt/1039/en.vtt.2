don't keep your nose up
in the air like that.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.453
I know that trick;
I've done it a million times.

00:01:03.477 --> 00:01:04.976
You're just smelling for smoke

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.976
so you can follow the trail
back to a burning house,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.619
so you can find the boy
who lost everything in the fire

00:01:10.643 --> 00:01:11.975
to see if you can save him.

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:15.976
Or else find the boy who lit
the fire in the first place,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.477
to see if you can change him.

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:19.976
But I know she will anyway,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.048
so instead I'll always keep
an extra supply

00:01:22.072 --> 00:01:24.190
of chocolate and rain boots nearby,

00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:27.103
because there is no heartbreak
that chocolate can't fix.

00:01:28.158 --> 00:01:30.301
Okay, there's a few
that chocolate can't fix.
