00:11:29.173 --> 00:11:30.547
You protect yourself

00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:33.809
from all the unexpected miseries
or hurt that might show up.

00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:36.463
But I try to walk through life like this.

00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:39.354
And yes, that means catching
all of those miseries and hurt,

00:11:39.378 --> 00:11:43.104
but it also means
that when beautiful, amazing things

00:11:43.128 --> 00:11:44.545
just fall out of the sky,

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:45.976
I'm ready to catch them.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.381
I use spoken word to help my students

00:11:48.405 --> 00:11:49.976
rediscover wonder,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.766
to fight their instincts
to be cool and unfazed

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.305
and, instead, actively pursue being
engaged with what goes on around them,

00:11:56.329 --> 00:11:59.622
so that they can reinterpret
and create something from it.

00:11:59.646 --> 00:12:01.939
It's not that I think
that spoken-word poetry
