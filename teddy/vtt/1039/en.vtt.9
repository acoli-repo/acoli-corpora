00:04:29.382 --> 00:04:30.976
And I know

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.724
that I have been waiting
all week to tell this joke.

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:35.892
(Laughter)

00:04:35.916 --> 00:04:38.090
Why was the scarecrow invited to TED?

00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:41.281
Because he was out standing in his field.

00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:43.773
(Laughter)

00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:46.112
I'm sorry.

00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:50.401
Okay, so these are three things
I know to be true.

00:04:50.425 --> 00:04:53.608
But there are plenty of things
I have trouble understanding.

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:56.528
So I write poems to figure things out.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.810
Sometimes the only way I know
how to work through something

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:01.287
is by writing a poem.
