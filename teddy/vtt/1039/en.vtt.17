00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:32.707
who shared my belief in the magic
of spoken-word poetry.

00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:34.725
And actually, Phil Kaye and I

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:37.342
coincidentally also share
the same last name.

00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:40.101
When I was in high school I had
created Project V.O.I.C.E.

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.976
as a way to encourage my friends
to do spoken word with me.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.976
But Phil and I decided to reinvent
Project V.O.I.C.E.,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.976
this time changing the mission

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.976
to using spoken-word poetry
as a way to entertain,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.976
educate and inspire.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.715
We stayed full-time students,
but in between we traveled,

00:08:55.739 --> 00:08:57.567
performing and teaching

00:08:57.591 --> 00:08:59.975
nine-year-olds to MFA candidates,

00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:03.345
from California to Indiana to India
