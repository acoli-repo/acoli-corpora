00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.508
is a permanent shadow of positive light.

00:17:00.925 --> 00:17:01.976
After the A-bomb,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.588
specialists said it would take 75 years

00:17:04.612 --> 00:17:06.976
for the radiation-damaged
soil of Hiroshima City

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.976
to ever grow anything again.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.365
But that spring, there were
new buds popping up from the earth.

00:17:12.389 --> 00:17:14.392
When I meet you, in that moment,

00:17:14.416 --> 00:17:16.252
I'm no longer a part of your future.

00:17:16.276 --> 00:17:18.515

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:20.976
But in that instant,
I get to share your present.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.976
And you, you get to share mine.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.976
And that is the greatest present of all.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.262
So if you tell me
I can do the impossible --

00:17:27.894 --> 00:17:29.388
I'll probably laugh at you.

00:17:29.412 --> 00:17:31.500
I don't know if I can change
the world yet,
