00:06:59.245 --> 00:07:00.770
In fact, they welcomed me.

00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:03.731
And it was here, listening to these poets
share their stories,

00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:06.938
that I learned that spoken-word
poetry didn't have to be indignant,

00:07:06.962 --> 00:07:09.282
it could be fun or painful

00:07:09.306 --> 00:07:11.242
or serious or silly.

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:14.520
The Bowery Poetry Club became
my classroom and my home,

00:07:14.544 --> 00:07:16.180
and the poets who performed

00:07:16.204 --> 00:07:18.584
encouraged me to share my stories as well.

00:07:18.608 --> 00:07:20.497
Never mind the fact that I was 14.

00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:22.976
They told me, "Write about being 14."

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.719
So I did and stood amazed every week

00:07:25.743 --> 00:07:27.976
when these brilliant, grown-up poets

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.001
laughed with me and groaned their sympathy
