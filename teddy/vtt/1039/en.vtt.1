00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.295
wait for you to get back up just
so it can kick you in the stomach.

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.231
But getting the wind knocked out of you

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:35.101
is the only way to remind your lungs

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:36.976
how much they like the taste of air.

00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:39.276
There is hurt, here,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.640
that cannot be fixed
by Band-Aids or poetry.

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:44.976
So the first time she realizes
that Wonder Woman isn't coming,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.514
I'll make sure she knows

00:00:46.538 --> 00:00:48.937
she doesn't have to wear
the cape all by herself,

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:51.451
because no matter how wide
you stretch your fingers,

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:53.150
your hands will always be too small

00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:55.691
to catch all the pain you want to heal.

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:57.694
Believe me, I've tried.

00:00:57.718 --> 00:00:59.013
"And, baby," I'll tell her,

00:00:59.037 --> 00:01:01.155
don't keep your nose up
in the air like that.
