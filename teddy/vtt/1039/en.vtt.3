00:01:28.158 --> 00:01:30.301
Okay, there's a few
that chocolate can't fix.

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:32.563
But that's what the rain boots are for,

00:01:32.587 --> 00:01:35.976
because rain will wash away
everything, if you let it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.976
I want her to look at the world

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.582
through the underside
of a glass-bottom boat,

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:41.976
to look through a microscope

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.976
at the galaxies that exist

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.175
on the pinpoint of a human mind,

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:48.207
because that's the way my mom taught me.

00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:49.976
That there'll be days like this.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.976
(Singing) There'll be days
like this, my momma said.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.976
When you open your hands to catch

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.547
and wind up with only
blisters and bruises;

00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:59.976
when you step out of the phone
booth and try to fly

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.877
and the very people you want to save
