00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.132
diving in the water, determined
to beat this swimming champion?

00:11:03.156 --> 00:11:05.545
After the race, he tossed
his wet, cloud-white hair

00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:06.828
and said, 'You're a god.'

00:11:06.852 --> 00:11:08.976
No, Anderson, you're the god."

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.976
(Laughter)

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.873
(Applause)

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.792
Now, I know that the number one
rule to being cool

00:11:18.816 --> 00:11:20.703
is to seem unfazed,

00:11:20.727 --> 00:11:23.923
to never admit that anything scares you

00:11:23.947 --> 00:11:25.556
or impresses you or excites you.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.976
Somebody once told me

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.149
it's like walking through life like this.

00:11:29.173 --> 00:11:30.547
You protect yourself
