00:02:59.508 --> 00:03:02.388
Always apologize when
you've done something wrong,

00:03:02.412 --> 00:03:03.793
but don't you ever apologize

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:05.976
for the way your eyes
refuse to stop shining.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.976
Your voice is small,
but don't ever stop singing.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.976
And when they finally hand you heartache,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.976
when they slip war
and hatred under your door

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.976
and offer you handouts on street-corners

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.976
of cynicism and defeat,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.128
you tell them that they really
ought to meet your mother.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.571
(Applause)

00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:27.976
Thank you. Thank you.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.325
(Applause)
