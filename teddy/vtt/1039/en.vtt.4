00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.877
and the very people you want to save

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.640
are the ones standing on your cape;

00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:05.568
when your boots will fill with rain,

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.976
and you'll be up to your knees
in disappointment.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.502
And those are the very days you have
all the more reason to say thank you.

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:13.381
Because there's nothing more beautiful

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:16.266
than the way the ocean refuses
to stop kissing the shoreline,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.532
no matter how many times it's sent away.

00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:22.587
You will put the wind
in win some, lose some.

00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:25.976
You will put the star
in starting over, and over.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.976
And no matter how many land
mines erupt in a minute,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.626
be sure your mind lands
