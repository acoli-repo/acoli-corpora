00:05:29.542 --> 00:05:32.976
And I was underdeveloped
and over-excitable.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.976
And despite my fear

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.166
of ever being looked at for too long,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.411
I was fascinated by the idea
of spoken-word poetry.

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:44.075
I felt that my two secret loves,
poetry and theater,

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.028
had come together, had a baby,

00:05:47.052 --> 00:05:48.717
a baby I needed to get to know.

00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:50.686
So I decided to give it a try.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.614
My first spoken-word poem,

00:05:52.638 --> 00:05:55.976
packed with all the wisdom
of a 14-year-old,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.976
was about the injustice

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.566
of being seen as unfeminine.
