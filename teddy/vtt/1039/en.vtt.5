00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.626
be sure your mind lands

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.007
on the beauty of this
funny place called life.

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:35.793
And yes, on a scale
from one to over-trusting,

00:02:35.817 --> 00:02:37.976
I am pretty damn naive.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.499
But I want her to know
that this world is made out of sugar.

00:02:41.523 --> 00:02:42.976
It can crumble so easily,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.976
but don't be afraid to stick
your tongue out and taste it.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.976
"Baby," I'll tell her, "remember,
your momma is a worrier,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.834
and your poppa is a warrior,

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:53.220
and you are the girl
with small hands and big eyes

00:02:53.244 --> 00:02:54.976
who never stops asking for more."

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.579
Remember that good things come in threes

00:02:57.603 --> 00:02:59.022
and so do bad things.

00:02:59.508 --> 00:03:02.388
Always apologize when
you've done something wrong,
