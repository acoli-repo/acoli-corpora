00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.424
but instead she just nodded
at me and said,

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.213
"Hey, I really felt that. Thanks."

00:06:35.514 --> 00:06:36.681
And lightning struck.

00:06:36.974 --> 00:06:38.245
I was hooked.

00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:41.739
I discovered this bar
on Manhattan's Lower East Side

00:06:41.763 --> 00:06:43.976
that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.976
and my bewildered,
but supportive, parents took me

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.976
to soak in every ounce
of spoken word that I could.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.976
I was the youngest by at least a decade,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.976
but somehow the poets
at the Bowery Poetry Club

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.221
didn't seem bothered
by the 14-year-old wandering about.

00:06:59.245 --> 00:07:00.770
In fact, they welcomed me.
