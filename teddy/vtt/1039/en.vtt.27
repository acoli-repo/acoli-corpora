00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.048
with the specific things
that make you you,

00:13:31.072 --> 00:13:33.402
even while those things
are always changing.

00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:36.140
Because step three never ends.

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:38.553
But you don't get to start on step three,

00:13:38.577 --> 00:13:40.741
until you take step one first:

00:13:40.765 --> 00:13:41.778
"I can."

00:13:41.802 --> 00:13:43.524
I travel a lot while I'm teaching,

00:13:43.548 --> 00:13:47.050
and I don't always get to watch
all of my students reach their step three,

00:13:47.074 --> 00:13:48.792
but I was very lucky with Charlotte,

00:13:48.816 --> 00:13:51.456
that I got to watch her journey
unfold the way it did.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.812
I watched her realize

00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:56.612
that, by putting the things that she knows
to be true into the work she's doing,

00:13:56.636 --> 00:13:59.076
she can create poems
that only Charlotte can write,

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.039
about eyeballs and elevators
and Dora the Explorer.
