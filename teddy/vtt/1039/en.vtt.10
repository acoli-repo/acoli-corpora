00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:01.287
is by writing a poem.

00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:03.209
Sometimes I get to the end of the poem,

00:05:03.233 --> 00:05:05.760
look back and go,
"Oh, that's what this is all about,"

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:07.801
and sometimes I get to the end of the poem

00:05:07.825 --> 00:05:09.160
and haven't solved anything,

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.358
but at least I have a new poem out of it.

00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:14.081
Spoken-word poetry is the art
of performance poetry.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.552
I tell people it involves creating poetry

00:05:16.576 --> 00:05:18.464
that doesn't just want to sit on paper,

00:05:18.488 --> 00:05:21.297
that something about it
demands it be heard out loud

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.694
or witnessed in person.

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:25.154
When I was a freshman in high school,

00:05:25.178 --> 00:05:28.976
I was a live wire of nervous hormones.

00:05:29.542 --> 00:05:32.976
And I was underdeveloped
and over-excitable.
