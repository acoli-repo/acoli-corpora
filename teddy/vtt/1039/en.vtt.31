When my Grandpa Genji died,
I was only five years old,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.149
but I took my mom
by the hand and told her,

00:15:33.173 --> 00:15:35.713
"Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby."

00:15:36.284 --> 00:15:39.448
And yet, for someone
who's apparently done this already,

00:15:39.472 --> 00:15:41.976
I still haven't figured anything out yet.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.976
My knees still buckle
every time I get on a stage.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.976
My self-confidence can be measured out

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.976
in teaspoons mixed into my poetry,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.976
and it still always
tastes funny in my mouth.

00:15:52.302 --> 00:15:55.523
But in Hiroshima, some people
were wiped clean away,

00:15:55.547 --> 00:15:58.301
leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.

00:15:58.325 --> 00:16:01.757
So no matter that I have inhibitions
to fill all my pockets,
