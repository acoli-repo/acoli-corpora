Over the years, three main theories
about the manuscript's text have emerged.

00:02:03.693 --> 00:02:06.042
The first is that it's written in cypher,

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:10.263
a secret code deliberately designed
to hide secret meaning.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.575
The second is that the document is a hoax

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:16.213
written in gibberish to make money
off a gullible buyer.

00:02:16.213 --> 00:02:19.133
Some speculate the author
was a medieval con man.

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:22.793
Others, that it was Voynich himself.

00:02:22.793 --> 00:02:26.523
The third theory is that the manuscript
is written in an actual language,

00:02:26.523 --> 00:02:28.695
but in an unknown script.

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:31.674
Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting
to create an alphabet
