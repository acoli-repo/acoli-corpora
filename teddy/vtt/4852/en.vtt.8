00:03:58.523 --> 00:04:02.437
a constellation that includes the seven
stars called the Pleiades?

00:04:02.437 --> 00:04:06.807
Could this word be Centaurun
for the Centaurea plant in the picture?

00:04:06.807 --> 00:04:09.698
Perhaps, but progress is slow.

00:04:09.698 --> 00:04:12.527
If we can crack its code,
what might we find?

00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:14.959
The dream journal of 
a 15th-century illustrator?

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.692
A bunch of nonsense?

00:04:16.692 --> 00:04:19.488
Or the lost knowledge 
of a forgotten culture?

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:21.477
What do you think it is?
