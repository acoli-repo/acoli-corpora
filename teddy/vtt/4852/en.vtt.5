00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:31.674
Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting
to create an alphabet

00:02:31.674 --> 00:02:35.123
for a language that was spoken
but not yet written.

00:02:35.123 --> 00:02:38.844
In that case, the Voynich manuscript
might be like the rongorongo script

00:02:38.844 --> 00:02:40.684
invented on Easter Island,

00:02:40.684 --> 00:02:45.005
now unreadable after the culture
that made it collapsed.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:47.364
Though no one can read 
the Voynich manuscript,

00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:50.145
that hasn't stopped people from guessing
what it might say.

00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:52.873
Those who believe the manuscript
was an attempt to create

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:54.736
a new form of written language

00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:56.995
speculate that it might be an encyclopedia

00:02:56.995 --> 00:03:00.285
containing the knowledge 
of the culture that produced it.
