00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:31.511
and the language in the Voynich manuscript

00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:35.342
has patterns you wouldn't find
from a random letter generator.

00:01:35.342 --> 00:01:38.712
Other than that, we know little more
than what we can see.

00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:41.244
The letters are varied 
in style and height.

00:01:41.244 --> 00:01:44.943
Some are borrowed from other scripts,
but many are unique.

00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:48.262
The taller letters have been named
gallows characters.

00:01:48.262 --> 00:01:50.482
The manuscript is 
highly decorated throughout

00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:52.592
with scroll-like embellishments.

00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:55.213
It appears to be written by two
or more hands,

00:01:55.213 --> 00:01:58.273
with the painting done 
by yet another party.

00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:03.693
Over the years, three main theories
about the manuscript's text have emerged.
