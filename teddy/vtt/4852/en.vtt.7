00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:30.193
The first breakthrough 
was the carbon dating.

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:33.666
Also, contemporary historians have
traced the provenance of the manuscript

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:37.546
back through Rome and Prague
to as early as 1612,

00:03:37.546 --> 00:03:41.287
when it was perhaps passed
from Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:44.477
to his physician, Jacobus Sinapius.

00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:46.801
In addition to these 
historical breakthroughs,

00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:50.527
linguistic researchers recently proposed
the provisional identification

00:03:50.527 --> 00:03:53.698
of a few of the manuscript's words.

00:03:53.698 --> 00:03:56.938
Could the letters beside these seven
stars spell Tauran,

00:03:56.938 --> 00:03:58.523
a name for Taurus,

00:03:58.523 --> 00:04:02.437
a constellation that includes the seven
stars called the Pleiades?
