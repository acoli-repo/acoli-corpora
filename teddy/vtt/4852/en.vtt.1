astrology diagrams,

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:31.499
zodiac rings,

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:37.010
and suns and moons with faces
accompany the text.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.540
This 24x16 centimeter book
is called the Voynich manuscript,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.649
and its one of history's biggest
unsolved mysteries.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.890
The reason why?

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.261
No one can figure out what it says.

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:51.190
The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.660
a Polish bookseller who came across
the document at a Jesuit college

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.769
in Italy in 1912.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:57.941
He was puzzled.

00:00:57.941 --> 00:00:59.011
Who wrote it?

00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:00.431
Where was it made?
