00:09:57.075 --> 00:10:00.010
but a new way to organize work,

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.059
and the most significant management innovation to come

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:06.015
out of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry

00:10:06.015 --> 00:10:08.080
is what we call the global delivery model.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.009
What the global delivery model allows is, it allows you

00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:14.059
to take previously geographically core-located tasks,

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:17.060
break them up into parts, send them around the world

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.061
where the expertise and the cost structure exists,

00:10:19.061 --> 00:10:22.044
and then specify the means for reintegrating them.

00:10:22.044 --> 00:10:24.057
Without that, you could not have any of the other

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:26.085
invisible innovations today.

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:29.049
So, what I'm trying to say is, what we are finding

00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:34.012
in our research is, that if products for end users
