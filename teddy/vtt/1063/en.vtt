Over the last two decades, India has become

00:00:03.013 --> 00:00:06.052
a global hub for software development

00:00:06.052 --> 00:00:10.079
and offshoring of back office services, as we call it,

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:15.099
and what we were interested in finding out was that

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.039
because of this huge industry that has started

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.050
over the last two decades in India,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.041
offshoring software development and back office services,

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:26.064
there's been a flight of white collar jobs

00:00:26.064 --> 00:00:30.015
from the developed world to India.
