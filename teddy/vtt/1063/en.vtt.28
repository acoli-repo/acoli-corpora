00:13:58.059 --> 00:14:02.068
or 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000

00:14:02.068 --> 00:14:06.027
were in America, 9,000 were in India.

00:14:06.027 --> 00:14:11.030
In 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.087
the U.S. employees had moved to 105,000,

00:14:13.087 --> 00:14:17.014
whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000.

00:14:17.014 --> 00:14:20.016
Well, in 2010, they decided they're not going to reveal

00:14:20.016 --> 00:14:22.048
this data anymore, so I had to make some estimates

00:14:22.048 --> 00:14:23.088
based on various sources.

00:14:23.088 --> 00:14:26.052
Here are my best guesses. Okay? I'm not saying

00:14:26.052 --> 00:14:27.098
this is the exact number, it's my best guess.

00:14:27.098 --> 00:14:29.060
It gives you a sense of the trend.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:34.023
There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which
