may have read the famous economist Schumpeter,

00:04:11.048 --> 00:04:13.055
he said, "Innovation is novelty

00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:17.031
in how value is created and distributed."

It could be new products and services,

00:04:19.044 --> 00:04:21.077

00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:28.077
Once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation,

00:04:28.077 --> 00:04:32.077
the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.
