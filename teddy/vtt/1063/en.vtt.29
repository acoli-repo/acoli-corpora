There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which

00:14:34.023 --> 00:14:36.083
98,000 are remaining in the U.S.,

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:40.039
and 150,000 are in India.

00:14:40.039 --> 00:14:43.051
So you tell me, is IBM an American company,

00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:47.057
or an Indian company? (Laughter)

00:14:47.057 --> 00:14:52.020
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. (Applause)
