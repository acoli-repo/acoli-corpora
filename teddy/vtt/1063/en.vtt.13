00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:30.008
one of the smartest people I know, said

00:06:30.008 --> 00:06:31.053
he's going to do a study.

00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:34.019
What he did was he looked at those companies

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.090
that had an R&amp;amp;D center in USA and in India,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.047
and then he looked at a patent that was filed

00:06:40.047 --> 00:06:43.018
out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same

00:06:43.018 --> 00:06:45.068
company's subsidiary in India,

00:06:45.068 --> 00:06:48.076
so he's now comparing the patents of R&amp;amp;D centers

00:06:48.076 --> 00:06:52.077
in the U.S. with R&amp;amp;D centers in India of the same company

00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:55.007
to find out what is the quality of the patents filed

00:06:55.007 --> 00:06:56.094
out of the Indian centers and how do they compare

00:06:56.094 --> 00:06:59.073
with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers?

00:06:59.073 --> 00:07:01.094
Interestingly, what he finds is
