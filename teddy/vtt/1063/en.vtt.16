00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:01.091
For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules

00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:04.051
are being developed, but you see a major part of that work

00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:07.006
is being sent to India.

00:08:07.006 --> 00:08:10.007
For example, XCL Technologies,

00:08:10.007 --> 00:08:12.099
they developed two of the mission critical systems

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:16.019
for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner,

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:18.091
one to avoid collisions in the sky,

00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:22.015
and another to allow landing in zero visibility.

00:08:22.015 --> 00:08:24.078
But of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787,

00:08:24.078 --> 00:08:27.016
you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation

00:08:27.016 --> 00:08:28.043
out of India.

00:08:28.043 --> 00:08:31.044
The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India
