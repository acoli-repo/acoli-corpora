00:11:58.073 --> 00:12:00.068
What we are trying to say is

00:12:00.068 --> 00:12:05.091
that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you --

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:08.061
it's a self-perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder,

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:11.034
and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that

00:12:11.034 --> 00:12:13.049
you can't be an investment banker

00:12:13.049 --> 00:12:15.048
without having been an analyst once.

00:12:15.048 --> 00:12:17.075
You can't be a professor without having been a student.

00:12:17.075 --> 00:12:20.061
You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate.

00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:23.020
So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs,

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.047
at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:29.032
The second thing we bring up is what we call

00:12:29.032 --> 00:12:32.068
the browning of the TMT, the top management teams.
