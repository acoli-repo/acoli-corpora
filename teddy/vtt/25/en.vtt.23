00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.840
They'll only reach a fraction
of the young people that we need to reach.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.776
We want to take these ideas
and find ways to scale them up.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.256
To reach more young people
in more communities,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.976
in more places around the world.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.320
And we want to dream big.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.776
Could every school,
everywhere in the world,

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.616
no matter how remote or mountainous,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.616
or even if it's in a refugee camp,

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.096
could they be connected to the internet?

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.976
Could we have instant translation
for young people,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.136
so that you could get a good education
