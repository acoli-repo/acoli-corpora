00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.176
Every day, we read about young people
lending their ideas and passions

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.216
to fighting for change,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.496
social change, political change,
change in their communities.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.640
Imagine what they'll create:
breakthroughs, inventions.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.696
Maybe new medicines,
new modes of transportation,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.736
new ways to communicate,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.296
sustainable economies
and maybe even a world at peace.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.216
But this opportunity, this youth dividend,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.680
is not a given.
