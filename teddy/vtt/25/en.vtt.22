00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.576
so that they can learn firsthand

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.256
what it's like to be an architect,
a designer or a scientist.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.496
And when you see these girls,
smiles on their faces,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.216
the hot lights in their eyes,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.816
they are so excited,
they have hope for the future.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.056
They want to change the world.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.376
And now, with this program
and these mentors,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.240
they'll be able to do it.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.976
But these ideas and programs
are just a start.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.840
They'll only reach a fraction
of the young people that we need to reach.
