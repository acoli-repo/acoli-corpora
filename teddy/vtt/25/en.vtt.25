00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.616
Young people are asking us
for apprenticeships,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.696
for job shadowing, for internships.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.920
Could we do this?

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.816
Young people are also asking us
for work-study programs,

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.816
places where they can learn and earn.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.456
Could we do this and could we
reach out to a community that's nearby,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.080
that's less advantaged, and help them?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.856
Young people are also saying
that they want to help other young people.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.856
They want more space and more voice,
