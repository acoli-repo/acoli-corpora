for what they'll accomplish
in their lives.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.600
But what they're also telling me
is that they have fears.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.336
They feel that they're facing
a series of urgent crises.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.936
A crisis of demographics,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.336
a crisis of education,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.616
a crisis of employment,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.696
a crisis of violence

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.960
and a crisis for girls.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.616
If you look at these crises,
you realize that they're urgent

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.056
and they need to be addressed now.
