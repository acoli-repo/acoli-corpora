00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.576
we think they can scale up to reach
thousands and millions of people

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.799
around the world.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.216
And with this project,
we're also going to do something new.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.856
We're going to co-design
and co-create with young people.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.775
So with Gen-U, they're going to be
in the driver's seat,

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.800
steering us all along the way.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.416
In Argentina, there's a program
where we connect students

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.496
who are in rural, remote,
hard to reach mountainous communities,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.136
with something they've seldom seen:

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.656
a secondary school teacher.
