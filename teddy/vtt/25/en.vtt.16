Gen-U is to be an open platform,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.776
where people can come
and share their ideas and solutions

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.936
about what works, what does not work,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.160
and importantly, what might work.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.056
So if we can take these ideas
and add a little bit of seed money,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.056
and add some good partners,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.336
and add good political will,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.576
we think they can scale up to reach
thousands and millions of people
