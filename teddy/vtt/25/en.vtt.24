00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.136
so that you could get a good education

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.760
in your own language,
anywhere in the world?

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.096
And would it be possible

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.016
that we could connect
the education in your school

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.496
with skills that you're going to need
to get a job in your own community?

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.720
So that you actually can move
from school to work.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.616
And more.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.200
Can each one of us help?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.336
In our everyday lives
and in our workplaces,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.800
are there ways that we could
support young people?
