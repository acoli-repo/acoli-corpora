And sometimes, their parents
can no longer afford the fees.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.440
It's a tragedy.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.336
And young people are also telling me
that they're worried about employment,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.440
that they won't be able to find a job.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.760
And again, they're right.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.880
Every month, 10 million
young people reach working age.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.896
It's a staggering number.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.136
Some will go on for further education,
but many will enter the workforce.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.480
And our world is not creating
10 million new jobs each month.
