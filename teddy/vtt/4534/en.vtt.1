00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This, in a way, is one of the challenges

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of how to interpret a really good idea.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We all, I think, believe in compassion.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.
