One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So when I thought about compassion,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
where he's lying there and he says,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
"I really understand, and I really appreciate

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.
