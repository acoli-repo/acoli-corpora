which says that when God created the world,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
God thought that it would be best to create the world

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
only with the divine attribute of justice.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Because, after all, God is just.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And then God looked to the future and realized,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, God thought, "Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion."
