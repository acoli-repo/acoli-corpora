00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I wouldn't be doing my job --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
because I have to actually be there for them

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and give up being a rabbi.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.
