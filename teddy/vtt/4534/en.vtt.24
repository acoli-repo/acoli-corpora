00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?"

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
He goes into the synagogue. "God, will you please help me?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Ah, what a wonderful smell."

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
"There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question."

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Takes the bread and goes home.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
"I'm an idiot. God wants bread?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
He goes in there, and it's not there.
