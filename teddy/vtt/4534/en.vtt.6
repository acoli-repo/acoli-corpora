And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Who cannot be touched by compassion

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I know some people who say

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
"Well, you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I'm not going to even begin to try."

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.
