00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
He goes in there, and it's not there.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And he says, "God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Next week, with raisins."

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
This went on for years.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Every week, the cleaner would come. "God you've answered my plea again."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Take the bread. Take it home.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on.
