00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
"In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion."

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
But, something else as well:

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
actually, 18 minutes is important.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or "matzah"?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And they say "It's 18 minutes."

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.
