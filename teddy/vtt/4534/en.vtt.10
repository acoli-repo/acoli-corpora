00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, God thought, "Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion."

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And then God looked to the future and realized that,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
there would be anarchy and chaos.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
There had to be limits to all things.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
The rabbis describe this as being like a king

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.
