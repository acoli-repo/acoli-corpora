00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And all the main religions have similar teachings.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And again, within Judaism,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we have a teaching about God,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?
