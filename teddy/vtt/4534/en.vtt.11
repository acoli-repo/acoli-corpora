If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
There is something more though that has to be there.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And that is the translation of the feelings

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that we may have about compassion

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
into the wider world, into action.
