4,000 years of agriculture
in a country of rich natural resources

00:01:33.388 --> 00:01:36.768
is spoiled by the overuse
of chemicals and pesticides.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.603
In 2016, the Chinese government revealed

00:01:40.627 --> 00:01:44.919
half a million food safety violations
in just nine months.

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:49.856
Alarmingly, one in every four
diabetics in the world

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.426
now comes from China.

00:01:52.742 --> 00:01:54.455
The stories around food

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.941
are scary and somewhat overwhelming,

00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:03.361
and I told myself it's time to bring
a mindful patience into the impatience.
