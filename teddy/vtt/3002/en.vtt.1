00:00:27.738 --> 00:00:32.461
As a young magician, I was always
in a rush to make them appear,

00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:34.032
but my teacher told me

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:37.444
the secret to the success
of this magical act

00:00:37.468 --> 00:00:41.691
is to make my doves appear
only after they've waited patiently

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:42.948
in my tuxedo.

00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:46.817
It has to be a mindful kind of patience,

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:49.829
the kind that took me
some years to master.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.904
When life took me to Shanghai
seven years ago,

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:59.393
the mindful patience I learned
became almost impossible to practice.
