When we went live, 18 months ago,

00:02:30.685 --> 00:02:33.273
the food we could sell then
was somewhat dismal.

00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:37.046
We had no fruit
and hardly any meat to sell,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.062
as none that was sent to the lab
passed our zero tolerance test

00:02:41.086 --> 00:02:45.088
towards pesticides, chemicals,
antibiotics and hormones.

00:02:45.572 --> 00:02:47.668
I told our very anxious employees

00:02:47.692 --> 00:02:52.144
that we would not give up until we've met
every local farmer in China.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:57.724
Today, we supply 240 types of produce

00:02:57.748 --> 00:02:59.826
from 57 local farmers.
