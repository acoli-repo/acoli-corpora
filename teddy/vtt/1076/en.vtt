00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.921
How can I speak in 10 minutes

00:00:02.945 --> 00:00:06.489
about the bonds of women
over three generations,

00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:09.564
about how the astonishing
strength of those bonds

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:12.474
took hold in the life
of a four-year-old girl

00:00:13.225 --> 00:00:18.056
huddled with her young sister,
her mother and her grandmother

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.906
for five days and nights
in a small boat in the China Sea

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.247
more than 30 years ago.

00:00:24.473 --> 00:00:27.027
Bonds that took hold
in the life of that small girl

00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:28.215
and never let go --

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:32.105
that small girl now
living in San Francisco
