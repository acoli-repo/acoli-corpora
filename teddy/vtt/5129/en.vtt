00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:09.547
On October 4, 1957,

00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:12.439
the world watched in awe and fear

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.133
as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik,

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.442
the world's first man-made satellite,

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:18.743
into space.

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:20.982
This little metal ball,

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:23.072
smaller than two feet in diameter,

00:00:23.072 --> 00:00:24.865
launched a space race

00:00:24.865 --> 00:00:27.190
between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.214
that would last for eighteen years

00:00:29.214 --> 00:00:31.906
and change the world as we know it.
