00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Back in New York, I am the head of development

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
for a non-profit called Robin Hood.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now in our town,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
you have to get to the fire scene pretty early

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to get in on any action.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I remember my first fire.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I was the second volunteer on the scene,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to get to the captain in charge

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to find out what our assignments would be.
