00:00:01.622 --> 00:00:04.125
This is the story of how I used comics

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:07.086
to help me in my role
as a caregiver for my mom

00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:08.755
in a way I couldn’t have imagined.

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:12.175
When I was thinking
about how to tell that story,

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:13.926
I talked a lot about it with my mom.

00:00:14.302 --> 00:00:16.345
That’s because the story is hers.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.682
My mom’s name is Jocelyn,

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:20.850
and we’re not alike.

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:22.643
She’s an optimist.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.855
I worry about all the terrible things
that are going to go wrong.

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:26.856
She’s impulsive.

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:27.857
I’m cautious.

00:00:28.107 --> 00:00:29.108
We’re so different

00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:32.695
that it took me a long time to realize
we had something important in common.
