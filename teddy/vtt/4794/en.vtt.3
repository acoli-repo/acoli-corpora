00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:31.965
But your digestive tract doesn't respond
to all carbohydrates the same.

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:33.673
Consider starch and fiber,

00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:35.230
both polysaccharides,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.892
both derived from plants,

00:01:36.892 --> 00:01:42.120
both composed of hundreds to thousands
of monosaccharides joined together,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.272
but they're joined together differently,

00:01:44.272 --> 00:01:47.205
and that changes the effect 
they have on your body.

00:01:47.205 --> 00:01:51.884
In starches, which plants mostly store
for energy in roots and seeds,

00:01:51.884 --> 00:01:55.708
glucose molecules are joined together
by alpha linkages,

00:01:55.708 --> 00:02:00.488
most of which can be easily cleaved
by enzymes in your digestive tract.
