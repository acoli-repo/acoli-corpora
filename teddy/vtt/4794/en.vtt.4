00:01:55.708 --> 00:02:00.488
most of which can be easily cleaved
by enzymes in your digestive tract.

00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:05.658
But in fiber, the bonds between
monosaccharide molecules are beta bonds,

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.876
which your body can't break down.

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:12.560
Fiber can also trap some starches,
preventing them from being cleaved,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.931
resulting in something called
resistant starch.

00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:19.852
So foods high in starch,
like crackers and white bread,

00:02:19.852 --> 00:02:21.328
are digested easily,

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:24.774
quickly releasing a whole bunch of glucose
into your blood,

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:28.972
exactly what would happen if you drank
something high in glucose, like soda.

00:02:28.972 --> 00:02:31.958
These foods have a high glycemic index,
