00:02:54.988 --> 00:03:00.759
and foods like eggs, cheese, and meats
have the lowest glycemic index.

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:04.164
When sugar moves from the digestive tract
to the blood stream,

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:08.091
your body kicks into action to transfer it
into your tissues

00:03:08.091 --> 00:03:10.942
where it can be processed 
and used for energy.

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:14.643
Insulin, a hormone 
synthesized in the pancreas,

00:03:14.643 --> 00:03:17.936
is one of the body's main tools
for sugar management.

00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:20.509
When you eat and your blood sugar rises,

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.173
insulin is secreted into the blood.

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:26.992
It prompts your muscle and fat cells
to let glucose in

00:03:26.992 --> 00:03:30.777
and jump starts the conversion
of sugar to energy.
