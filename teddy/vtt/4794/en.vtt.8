00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.546
and blood insulin continues to rise.

00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:03.951
Chronically consuming 
a lot of carbohydrates

00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:06.255
may lead to insulin resistance,

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:09.214
and many scientists believe
that insulin resistance

00:04:09.214 --> 00:04:13.465
leads to a serious condition
called metabolic syndrome.

00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:15.600
That involves a constellation of symptoms,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.205
including high blood sugar,

00:04:17.205 --> 00:04:19.033
increased waist circumference,

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:21.156
and high blood pressure.

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:23.465
It increases the risk 
of developing conditions,

00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:25.261
like cardiovascular disease

00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:27.384
and type II diabetes.

00:04:27.384 --> 00:04:31.935
And its prevalence is rapidly increasing
all over the world.
