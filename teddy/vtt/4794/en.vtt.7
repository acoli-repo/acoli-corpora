00:03:26.992 --> 00:03:30.777
and jump starts the conversion
of sugar to energy.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:33.672
The degree to which a unit
of insulin lowers the blood sugar

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:37.335
helps us understand something called
insulin sensitivity.

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:40.992
The more a given unit of insulin
lowers blood sugar,

00:03:40.992 --> 00:03:43.115
the more sensitive you are to insulin.

00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:47.549
If insulin sensitivity goes down,
that's known as insulin resistance.

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.763
The pancreas still sends out insulin,

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:54.864
but cells, especially muscle cells,
are less and less responsive to it,

00:03:54.864 --> 00:03:57.139
so blood sugar fails to decrease,

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.546
and blood insulin continues to rise.
