00:02:28.972 --> 00:02:31.958
These foods have a high glycemic index,

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.398
the amount that a particular food
raises the sugar level in your blood.

00:02:36.398 --> 00:02:39.705
Soda and white bread have a similar
glycemic index

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.923
because they have a similar effect
on your blood sugar.

00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:47.414
But when you eat foods high in fiber,
like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains,

00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:52.544
those indigestible beta bonds slow 
the release of glucose into the blood.

00:02:52.544 --> 00:02:54.988
Those foods have a lower glycemic index,

00:02:54.988 --> 00:03:00.759
and foods like eggs, cheese, and meats
have the lowest glycemic index.
