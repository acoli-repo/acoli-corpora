00:00:57.517 --> 00:01:00.990
have three or more simple sugars
strung together.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.330
Complex carbohydrates with three
to ten linked sugars

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.257
are oligosaccharides.

00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:09.367
Those with more than ten
are polysaccharides.

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:10.975
During digestion,

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:14.052
your body breaks down those
complex carbohydrates

00:01:14.052 --> 00:01:16.906
into their monosaccharide building blocks,

00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:19.469
which your cells can use for energy.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.331
So when you eat 
any carbohydrate-rich food,

00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:27.238
the sugar level in your blood,
normally about a teaspoon, goes up.

00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:31.965
But your digestive tract doesn't respond
to all carbohydrates the same.
