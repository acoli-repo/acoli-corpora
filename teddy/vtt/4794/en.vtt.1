00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:30.375
First of all, carbohydrate is 
the nutritional category for sugars

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:34.480
and molecules that your body breaks down
to make sugars.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.687
Carbohydrates can be simple or complex
depending on their structure.

00:00:38.687 --> 00:00:42.611
This is a simple sugar,
or monosaccharide.

00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:46.889
Glucose, fructose, 
and galactose are all simple sugars.

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:50.505
Link two of them together,
and you've got a disaccharide,

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:55.254
lactose, maltose, or sucrose.

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:57.517
Complex carbohydrates,
on the other hand,

00:00:57.517 --> 00:01:00.990
have three or more simple sugars
strung together.
