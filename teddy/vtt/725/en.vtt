00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to talk to you today a little bit

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
about predictable irrationality.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And my interest in irrational behavior

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
started many years ago in the hospital.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I was burned very badly.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.
