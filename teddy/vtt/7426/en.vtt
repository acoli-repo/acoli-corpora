00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:13.801
Between 1927 and 1941, 400 workers
blasted 450,000 tons of rock

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:19.307
from a mountainside using chisels, 
jackhammers, and a lot of dynamite.

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:22.518
Gradually, they carved out Mount Rushmore.

00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:25.938
Now, the monument draws nearly
3 million people

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:28.524
to South Dakota’s Black Hills every year.

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:31.903
But its façade belies a dark history.
