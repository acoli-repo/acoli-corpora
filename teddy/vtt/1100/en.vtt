00:00:01.365 --> 00:00:03.991
I want to start with a game. Okay?

00:00:04.015 --> 00:00:06.410
And to win this game,

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:09.323
all you have to do is see
the reality that's in front of you

00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:11.339
as it really is, all right?

00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:13.950
So we have two panels here,
of colored dots.

00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:19.171
And one of those dots
is the same in the two panels.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.418
And you have to tell me which one.

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:24.890
Now, I narrowed it down

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:29.585
to the gray one, the green one,
and, say, the orange one.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.672
So by a show of hands,
we'll start with the easiest one.
