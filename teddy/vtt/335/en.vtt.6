00:02:57.968 --> 00:03:00.034
the companies of tomorrow.

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:01.440
And I'm going to now shift

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.458
to talking a little bit about my own experiences.

00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:08.338
I joined Unilever in 1976

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:11.471
as a management trainee in India.

00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:13.806
And on my first day of work

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:16.140
I walked in and my boss tells me,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.247
"Do you know why you're here?"

00:03:18.247 --> 00:03:21.544
I said, "I'm here to sell a lot of soap."

00:03:21.544 --> 00:03:24.630
And he said, 
"No, you're here to change lives."

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.922
You're here to change lives.

00:03:26.922 --> 00:03:28.552
You know, I thought it was rather facetious.

00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:31.367
We are a company that sells soap and soup.
