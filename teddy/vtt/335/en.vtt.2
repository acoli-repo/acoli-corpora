00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.003
so you continue to make

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:02.922
more and more shareholder value.

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:05.714
And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough

00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:08.374
and we have to move from this 3G model

00:01:08.374 --> 00:01:10.688
to a model of what I call

the G of growth that is responsible.

00:01:16.123 --> 00:01:19.560
And it is this that has to become

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.675
of creating value.

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:26.400
Of not just creating economic value

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.854
but creating social value.

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:31.654
And companies that will thrive are those
