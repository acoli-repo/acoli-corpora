00:05:29.488 --> 00:05:31.652
A product that we've just launched recently,

00:05:31.652 --> 00:05:35.180
One Rinse product that allows you to save water

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.356
every time you wash your clothes.

00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:40.381
And if we can convert all our users to using this,

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:42.614
that's 500 billion liters of water.

00:05:42.614 --> 00:05:44.908
By the way, that's equivalent to one month of water

00:05:44.908 --> 00:05:48.092
for a whole huge continent.

00:05:48.092 --> 00:05:49.768
So just think about it.

00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:53.335
There are small actions that 
can make a big difference.

00:05:53.335 --> 00:05:54.953
And I can go on and on.

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:57.050
Our food chain, our brilliant products --

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.419
and I'm sorry I'm giving you 
a word from the sponsors --

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.121
Knorr, Hellman's and all those wonderful products.
