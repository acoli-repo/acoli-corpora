00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:03.924
The entire model of capitalism

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:06.103
and the economic model that you and I

00:00:06.103 --> 00:00:07.782
did business in,

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:09.609
and, in fact, continue to do business in,

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.232
was built around what probably Milton Friedman

00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:14.950
put more succinctly.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.530
And Adam Smith, of course, 
the father of modern economics

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.879
actually said many, many years ago,

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:21.397
the invisible hand,

00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:23.053
which is, "If you continue to operate

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:25.166
in your own self-interest

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.922
you will do the best good for society."

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:32.653
Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things
