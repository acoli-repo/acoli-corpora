00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:01.176
and we are gong to change the lives

00:07:01.176 --> 00:07:03.901
of one billion people over 2020."

00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:05.701
Now the question here is,

00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:07.225
where do we go from here?

00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:09.145
And the answer to that is very simple:

00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:11.278
We're not going to change the world alone.

00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:13.868
There are plenty of you and plenty of us

00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:15.338
who understand this.

00:07:15.338 --> 00:07:16.503
The question is,

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:19.134
we need partnerships, we need coalitions

00:07:19.134 --> 00:07:21.590
and importantly, we need that leadership

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.550
that will allow us to take this from here

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.839
and to be the change

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:27.375
that we want to see around us.

00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:28.695
Thank you very much.

00:07:28.695 --> 00:07:32.510
