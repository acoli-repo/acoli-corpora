WEBVTT

00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:31.367
We are a company that sells soap and soup.

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:34.239
What are we doing about changing lives?

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.254
And it's then I realized

00:03:38.254 --> 00:03:40.577
that simple acts

00:03:40.577 --> 00:03:43.009
like selling a bar of soap

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:44.498
can save more lives

00:03:44.498 --> 00:03:45.975
than pharmaceutical companies.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.597
I don't know how many of you know

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:50.932
that five million children don't reach the age of five

00:03:50.932 --> 00:03:53.808
because of simple infections that can be prevented

00:03:53.808 --> 00:03:56.748
by an act of washing their hands with soap.

00:03:56.748 --> 00:03:58.200
We run the largest

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.429
hand-washing program

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:00.334
in the world.
