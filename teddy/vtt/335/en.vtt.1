Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things

00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:35.455
and I've talked about a lot of good 
things that have happened,

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:38.841

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:40.777

growth that is competitive,

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.952
better than the other person;

00:00:56.952 --> 00:00:58.514
