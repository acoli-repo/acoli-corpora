00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:00.334
in the world.

00:04:00.334 --> 00:04:02.495
We are running a program on hygiene and health

00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:04.997
that now touches half a billion people.

00:04:04.997 --> 00:04:06.597
It's not about selling soap,

00:04:06.597 --> 00:04:08.558
there is a larger purpose out there.

00:04:08.558 --> 00:04:10.616
And brands indeed can be

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:12.623
at the forefront of social change.

00:04:12.623 --> 00:04:14.280
And the reason for that is,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.890
when two billion people use your brands

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.542
that's the amplifier.

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:21.743
Small actions can make a big difference.

00:04:21.743 --> 00:04:23.281
Take another example,

00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:26.551
I was walking around in 
one of our villages in India.

00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.194
Now those of you who have done this

00:04:28.194 --> 00:04:33.368
will realize that this is no walk in the park.
