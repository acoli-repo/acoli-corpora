Wales is a small but progressive country,

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:07.125
the only country in the world
to have legislated

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.973
to protect the interests
of future generations,

00:00:09.997 --> 00:00:14.431
the only country to have appointed
someone independent to oversee this.

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:18.646
Across the world, our systems
of government, of politics, of economics

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.706
have tended to act in the short term.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.849
And often, the decisions that are taken

00:00:22.873 --> 00:00:26.344
discount the interests
of future generations and the planet.

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:28.362
But in Wales, we're trying to change that

00:00:28.386 --> 00:00:31.411
by passing a law which requires
not just our government
