Bruno Giussani: Hello.

00:00:06.563 --> 00:00:10.863
Bill Gates calls himself
an imperfect messenger on climate

00:00:10.863 --> 00:00:14.830
because of his high
carbon footprint and lifestyle.

00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:18.497
However, he has just made
a major contribution to our thinking

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.830
about confronting
climate change via a book,

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:25.397
a book about decarbonising
our economy and society.

00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:28.130
It's an optimistic "can-do" kind of book

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:32.097
with a strong focus
on technological solutions.
