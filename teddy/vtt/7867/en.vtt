I used to have a saying that phone calls
don't change your life.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.207
Until one day I got a phone call that did.

00:00:10.207 --> 00:00:12.075
It was from my mother.

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:14.778
"Your father is trying to kill himself."

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:16.413
He's what?

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:20.183
My dad was a son of the American South,

00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:22.352
a Navy veteran and civic leader,

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.755
he was never depressed a minute.

00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:26.823
Until he got Parkinson's.

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:29.226
Six times in 12 weeks,

00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:31.395
my dad attempted to end his life.
