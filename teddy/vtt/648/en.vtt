The story that I'm going
to tell you today,

00:00:03.123 --> 00:00:05.063
for me, began back in 2006.

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:09.130
That was when I first heard
about an outbreak of mysterious illness

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:11.870
that was happening in the Amazon
rainforest of Peru.

00:00:12.947 --> 00:00:15.376
The people that were getting sick
from this illness,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.945
they had horrifying symptoms, nightmarish.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:19.499
They had unbelievable headaches,

00:00:19.523 --> 00:00:21.123
they couldn't eat or drink.

00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:23.067
Some of them were even hallucinating --

00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:24.278
confused and aggressive.

00:00:24.953 --> 00:00:27.208
The most tragic part of all

00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:29.412
was that many of the victims
were children.

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:31.681
And of all of those that got sick,
