00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:10.590
Beginning in the 3rd century,
before the coming era,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.967
the Romans conquered
the Iberian Peninsula.

00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:18.431
This period gave rise to several regional
languages in the area that's now Spain,

00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:21.434
including Castilian, Catalan and Galician.

00:00:22.143 --> 00:00:26.731
One of these would become Spanish—
but not for another 1,500 years.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.570
Those years tell the origin story 
of what’s become a global modern language.
