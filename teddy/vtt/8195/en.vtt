00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:05.418
I'd like to start by asking
you to imagine a color

00:00:05.418 --> 00:00:07.962
that you've never seen before.

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:10.965
Just for a second give this a try.

00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:15.887
Can you actually visualize a color
that you've never been able to perceive?

00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:20.266
I never seem to get tired of trying this

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.061
although I know
it's not an easy challenge.

00:00:23.102 --> 00:00:24.312
And the thing is,

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:29.233
we can't imagine something
without drawing upon our experiences.
