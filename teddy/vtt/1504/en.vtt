00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I started my journey 30 years ago.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And I worked in mines. And I realized that

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
this was a world unseen.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I wanted, through color and large format cameras

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and very large prints,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to make a body of work that somehow

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
became symbols of our

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
use of the landscape,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
how we use the land.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And to me this was

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a key component that somehow, through this medium of photography,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which allows us to contemplate these landscapes,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that I thought photography was perfectly suited
