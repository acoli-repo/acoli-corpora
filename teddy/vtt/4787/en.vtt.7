00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:30.149
Telomeres cap chromosomes

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:33.601
to allow DNA to get copied
every time a cell divides

00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:36.880
without damaging 
the cell's genetic code,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.744
and they shorten with each cell division.

00:03:39.744 --> 00:03:44.945
When telomeres become too short,
a cell can no longer divide and it dies.

00:03:44.945 --> 00:03:46.635
As if all that weren't enough,

00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:50.498
chronic stress has even more ways
it can sabotage your health,

00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:51.906
including acne,

00:03:51.906 --> 00:03:53.091
hair loss,

00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:54.476
sexual dysfunction,

00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:55.599
headaches,

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:56.754
muscle tension,

00:03:56.754 --> 00:03:58.230
difficulty concentrating,

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.358
fatigue,

00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:01.217
and irritability.
