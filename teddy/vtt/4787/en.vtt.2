00:00:57.742 --> 00:01:01.359
they easily reach 
your blood vessels and heart.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.931
Adrenaline causes 
your heart to beat faster

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:09.044
and raises your blood pressure,
over time causing hypertension.

00:01:09.044 --> 00:01:13.794
Cortisol can also cause the endothelium,
or inner lining of blood vessels,

00:01:13.794 --> 00:01:16.104
to not function normally.

00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:18.848
Scientists now know 
that this is an early step

00:01:18.848 --> 00:01:22.398
in triggering the process 
of atherosclerosis

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:25.892
or cholesterol plaque
build up in your arteries.

00:01:25.892 --> 00:01:31.672
Together, these changes increase 
your chances of a heart attack or stroke.
