and irritability.

00:04:01.217 --> 00:04:03.816
So, what does all this mean for you?

00:04:03.816 --> 00:04:07.353
Your life will always be filled
with stressful situations.

00:04:07.353 --> 00:04:10.657
But what matters to your brain
and entire body

00:04:10.657 --> 00:04:13.392
is how you respond to that stress.

00:04:13.392 --> 00:04:18.206
If you can view those situations
as challenges you can control and master,

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:21.092
rather than as threats 
that are insurmountable,

00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:25.875
you will perform better in the short run
and stay healthy in the long run.
