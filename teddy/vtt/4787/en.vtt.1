In the short term, 
stress can be advantageous,

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.232
but when activated too often or too long,

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:38.209
your primitive fight or flight 
stress response

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:40.172
not only changes your brain

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:46.277
but also damages many of the other
organs and cells throughout your body.

00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:49.219
Your adrenal gland releases 
the stress hormones

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.012
cortisol, epinephrine, 
also known as adrenaline,

00:00:53.012 --> 00:00:55.298
and norepinephrine.

00:00:55.298 --> 00:00:57.742
As these hormones 
travel through your blood stream,

00:00:57.742 --> 00:01:01.359
they easily reach 
your blood vessels and heart.
