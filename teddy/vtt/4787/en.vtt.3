When your brain senses stress,

00:01:33.818 --> 00:01:36.549
it activates your 
autonomic nervous system.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.921
Through this network 
of nerve connections,

00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:42.205
your big brain communicates
stress to your enteric,

00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:47.076
or intestinal nervous system.

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.653
Besides causing butterflies 
in your stomach,

00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:54.659
this brain-gut connection can disturb
the natural rhythmic contractions

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.979
that move food through your gut,

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.475
leading to irritable bowel syndrome,

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:02.626
and can increase your 
gut sensitivity to acid,
