00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.955
we turned it into a solid,
plastic model, as you can see,

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.919
using a rapid prototyping technique,
another engineering technique.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.776
We then used that former

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.447
to manufacture a perfectly bespoke
porous textile mesh,

00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:47.282
which takes the shape of the former
and perfectly fits the aorta.

00:03:47.672 --> 00:03:51.940
So this is absolutely personalized
medicine at its best, really.

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:56.587
Every patient we do
has an absolutely bespoke implant.

00:03:57.497 --> 00:04:00.550
Once you've made it,
the installation is quite easy.
