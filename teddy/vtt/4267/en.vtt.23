When you have a group of people
with different professional training,

00:11:36.731 --> 00:11:38.632

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.805

knowledge base,

00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:43.050
but also a different perspective
on everything.

00:11:43.074 --> 00:11:44.775

that have never been looked at before,

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.104
very quickly and easily.

00:11:57.128 --> 00:12:00.397
You can short-cut huge amounts of work
