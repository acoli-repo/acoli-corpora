it must be rubbish, they binned it.

Most R&amp;D is going to be

by the Polish Academy of Sciences

00:09:39.843 --> 00:09:43.508
or the Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council, or whatever.

00:09:43.532 --> 00:09:45.342
And you need to get past those people.

00:09:45.749 --> 00:09:48.876
Jargon is a huge problem
when you try to work across disciplines,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.254
because in an engineering world,
we all understand CAD and RP.

00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:54.079
Not in the medical world.

00:09:54.749 --> 00:09:58.321

They've really got to start
talking to each other,
