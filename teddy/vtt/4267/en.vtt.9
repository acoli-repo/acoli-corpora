00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:31.749
Two hours to install one of our devices,

00:04:31.773 --> 00:04:35.155
compared to 6 hours
for the existing treatment.

00:04:36.184 --> 00:04:39.665
As I said, the existing treatment
requires the heart-lung bypass machine,

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:41.481
and it requires a total body cooling.

00:04:41.505 --> 00:04:44.184
We don't need any of that.
We work on a beating heart.

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:45.499
He opens you up,

00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:47.959
he accesses the aorta
while your heart is beating,

00:04:47.983 --> 00:04:49.445
all at the right temperature.

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.623
No breaking into your circulatory system.

00:04:51.647 --> 00:04:53.136
So it really is great.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.499
But for me, absolutely the best point is,

00:04:56.523 --> 00:04:59.387
there is no anticoagulation
therapy required.

00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:01.102
I don't take any drugs at all,
