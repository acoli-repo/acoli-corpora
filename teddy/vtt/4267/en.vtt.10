00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:01.102
I don't take any drugs at all,

00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:03.863
other than recreational ones
that I would choose to take.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.240
(Laughter)

00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:08.496
And in fact, if you speak to people
who are on long-term warfarin,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.424
it is a serious compromise
to your quality of life,

00:05:11.448 --> 00:05:15.182
and even worse, it inevitably
foreshortens your life.

00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:18.487
Likewise, if you have
the artificial valve option,

00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:20.321
you're committed to antibiotic therapy

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:23.412
whenever you have
any intrusive medical treatment,

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:26.369
even trips to the dentist
require that you take antibiotics,

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:28.774
in case you get an internal
infection on the valve.

00:05:29.252 --> 00:05:32.247
Again, I don't have any of that,
so I'm entirely free,
