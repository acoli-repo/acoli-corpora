00:05:56.383 --> 00:06:01.606
and you can see there aren't only two
principal technical disciplines there,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.898
medicine and engineering,

00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:07.024
but also, there are various specialists
from within those two disciplines.

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.930
John Pepper was the cardiac surgeon
who did all the actual work on me.

00:06:12.383 --> 00:06:15.703
But everyone else had to contribute
one way or another.

00:06:15.727 --> 00:06:17.537
Raad Mohiaddin, a medical radiologist.

00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:21.610
We had to get good-quality images
from which to make the CAD model.

00:06:21.634 --> 00:06:24.457
Warren Thornton, who still does
all our CAD models for us,

00:06:24.481 --> 00:06:27.465
had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:32.737
to produce this model from this
really rather difficult input data set.
