00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:00.478
between the two organizations.

00:08:00.502 --> 00:08:02.812
I was working with the Imperial
and the Brompton,

00:08:02.836 --> 00:08:05.507
and this generated some serious
problems for the project.

00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:07.341

00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:09.986
Research &amp; Ethics Committee.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.010
If you want to do anything new in surgery,

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:21.994
There will be some form of equivalent

problems associated with that,

00:08:25.515 --> 00:08:27.602
we also had professional jealousies.

00:08:27.626 --> 00:08:30.055
There were people
on the Research &amp; Ethics committee
