00:06:57.174 --> 00:07:01.331
to ensure that everyone in the team
understood exactly what was meant

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:03.000
when a particular phrase was used.

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:06.561
Our disciplinary conventions
were funny as well.

00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:09.620
We took a lot of horizontal slice
images through me,

00:07:09.644 --> 00:07:13.144
produced those slices and used them
to build a CAD model.

00:07:13.582 --> 00:07:15.443
And the very first CAD model we made,

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:19.630
the surgeons were playing with it
and couldn't quite figure it out.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.095
And then we realized that it was actually
a mirror image of the real aorta.

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:27.576
And it was a mirror image
because in the real world,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.411
we always look down on plans,

00:07:29.435 --> 00:07:31.984
plans of houses, or streets, or maps.
