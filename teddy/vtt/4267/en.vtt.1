00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:31.002
and I was already up at 4.4.

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:35.652
And as you can see,
my aorta dilated progressively,

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:40.247
and I got closer and closer to the point
where surgery was going to be necessary.

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:43.553
The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome.

00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:46.543
Anesthetize you, open your chest,

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.416
put you on an artificial
heart and lung machine,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.609
drop your body temperature
to about 18 centigrade,

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:55.297
stop your heart, cut the aorta out,

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:58.335
replace it with a plastic valve
and a plastic aorta.

00:00:59.073 --> 00:01:04.080
And most importantly, commit you
to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy.
