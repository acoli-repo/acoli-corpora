00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:02.328
The great advantage
of an external support, for me,

00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:05.041
was that I could retain
all of my own bits,

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:07.357
all of my own endothelium and valves,

00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:10.181
and not need any anticoagulation therapy.

00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:13.023
So, where do we start?

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:16.027
This is a sagittal slice through me.

00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:20.569
In the middle, you can see
that little structure squeezing out,

00:02:20.593 --> 00:02:22.080
that's the left ventricle,

00:02:22.104 --> 00:02:24.925
pushing blood out
through the aortic valve.

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.116
You can see two of the leaflets
of the aortic valve working there.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.986
Up into the ascending aorta.
