They've really got to start
talking to each other,

00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:04.077
and exercise a bit of imagination,
if that's not too much to ask.

00:10:04.101 --> 00:10:05.312
(Laughter)

00:10:05.336 --> 00:10:07.225
Which it probably is.

00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:08.564
(Laughter)

00:10:08.588 --> 00:10:10.948
I've coined the phrase
"obstructive conservatism."

00:10:10.972 --> 00:10:14.554
So many people in the medical world
don't want to change.

00:10:14.578 --> 00:10:18.094
Particularly when some jumped-up engineer
has come along with the answer.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.505
They don't want to change.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:21.958
They simply want to do
whatever they've done before.

00:10:21.982 --> 00:10:25.281
And in fact, many surgeons
in the UK are still waiting

00:10:25.305 --> 00:10:28.434
for one of our patients
to have some sort of an episode,

00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:31.113
so that they could say,
"Told you that was no good."
