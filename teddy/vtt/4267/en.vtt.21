00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:31.113
so that they could say,
"Told you that was no good."

00:10:31.137 --> 00:10:33.373
We've actually got 30 patients.

00:10:33.397 --> 00:10:35.223
At seven and a half years,

00:10:35.247 --> 00:10:37.412
we've got 90 post-op
patient years between us,

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:39.212
and we haven't had a single problem.

00:10:39.236 --> 00:10:41.374
And still, there are people
in the UK saying,

00:10:41.398 --> 00:10:44.154
"That external aortic root,
it will never work, you know."

00:10:44.527 --> 00:10:46.932
It really is a problem.

00:10:46.956 --> 00:10:49.759
I'm sure everyone in this room
has come across arrogance

00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:52.549
amongst medics, doctors,
surgeons, at some point.

00:10:53.575 --> 00:10:57.939
The middle point is simply the way
that the doctors protect themselves.

00:10:57.963 --> 00:11:00.314
"Well, of course,
I'm looking after my patient."
