really rather difficult input data set.

00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:37.758
There are some barriers to this, though,
there are some problems.

00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:39.035
Jargon is a big one.

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:44.621
I would think no one in this room
understands the first four jargon points.

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:48.091
The engineers amongst you will recognize
"rapid prototyping" and "CAD."

00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:51.449
The medics amongst you, if there are any,
will recognize the first two,

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:55.106
but there will be nobody else here
that understands all those four words.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.150
Taking the jargon out was very important

00:06:57.174 --> 00:07:01.331
to ensure that everyone in the team
understood exactly what was meant
