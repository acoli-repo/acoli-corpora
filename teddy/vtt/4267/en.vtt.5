00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.964
And it's that part, the ascending aorta,

00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:38.674
which dilates and ultimately bursts,
which of course is fatal.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.480
We started by organizing image acquisition

00:02:42.504 --> 00:02:47.564
from magnetic resonance
and CT imaging machines,

00:02:47.588 --> 00:02:52.037
from which to make a model
of the patient's aorta.

00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:56.220
This is a model of my aorta.

00:02:56.244 --> 00:02:58.087
I've got a real one in my pocket,

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.591
if anyone would like to look at it,
and play with it.
