00:00:00.986 --> 00:00:05.260
I'm a process engineer, I know all about
boilers and incinerators

00:00:05.284 --> 00:00:08.408
and fabric filters, and cyclones,
and things like that.

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.998
But I also have Marfan syndrome.

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:12.897
This is an inherited disorder.

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:17.092
And in 1992, I participated
in a genetic study,

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:20.204
and found to my horror,
as you can see from the slide,

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:24.351
that my ascending aorta
was not in the normal range,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:25.971
the green line at the bottom.

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.878
Everyone in here will be between 3.2-3.6,

00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:31.002
and I was already up at 4.4.
