in people with Marfan syndrome

is that it lacks some tensile strength.

00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:43.591
So, the possibility exists
to simply externally wrap the pipe,

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:47.149
and it would remain stable
and operate quite happily.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:51.844
If your high-pressure hose pipe
or hydraulic line bulges a little,

00:01:51.868 --> 00:01:55.368

00:01:55.392 --> 00:01:58.192
