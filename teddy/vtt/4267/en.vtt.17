00:08:27.626 --> 00:08:30.055
There were people
on the Research &amp; Ethics committee

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:32.808
who really didn't want to see
John Pepper succeed again.

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:34.683
Because he is so successful.

00:08:34.707 --> 00:08:36.845
And they made extra problems for us.

00:08:38.441 --> 00:08:40.390
Bureaucratic problems.

00:08:40.414 --> 00:08:43.068
Ultimately, when you have a new treatment,

00:08:43.092 --> 00:08:47.109
you have to have a guidance note
for all the hospitals in the country.

00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:50.753
In the UK, we have the National Institute
and Clinical Excellence.

00:08:50.777 --> 00:08:52.777
You have an equivalent
in Poland, no doubt.

00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:56.086
And we had to get past the NICE problem.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.872
We now have a great clinical
guidance, out on the net.

00:08:58.896 --> 00:09:03.536
So any other hospitals interested
can come along, read the NICE report,
