"Well, of course,
I'm looking after my patient."

00:11:00.338 --> 00:11:03.850
I think it's not good, but that's my view.

00:11:04.739 --> 00:11:06.838
Egos, of course, again a huge problem.

00:11:06.862 --> 00:11:08.800
If you work in a multidisciplinary team,

00:11:08.824 --> 00:11:11.629
you've got to give your guys
the benefit of the doubt,

00:11:11.653 --> 00:11:13.529
you've got to express support for them.

00:11:13.553 --> 00:11:16.432
Tom Treasure, professor
of cardiothoracic surgery.

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:18.264
Incredible guy.

00:11:18.288 --> 00:11:19.778
Dead easy to give him respect.

00:11:19.802 --> 00:11:22.567
Him giving me respect? Slightly different.

00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:23.614
(Laughter)

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:25.398
That's all the bad news.

00:11:25.422 --> 00:11:29.643
The good news is,
the benefits are stonkingly huge.

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:31.776
Translate that one! I bet they can't.
