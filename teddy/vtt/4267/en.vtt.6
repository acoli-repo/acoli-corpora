00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.591
if anyone would like to look at it,
and play with it.

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:01.624
(Laughter)

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.713
You can see it's quite
a complex structure.

00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:06.282
It has a funny tri-lobal shape
at the bottom,

00:03:06.306 --> 00:03:08.301
which contains the aortic valve.

00:03:08.325 --> 00:03:10.283
It then comes back into a round form,

00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:12.406
and then tapers and curves off.

00:03:13.408 --> 00:03:16.450
It's quite a difficult structure
to produce.

00:03:17.752 --> 00:03:19.541
This is a sort of CAD model of me,

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.481
and this is one of the later CAD models.

00:03:21.505 --> 00:03:25.104
We went through an iterative process
of producing better and better models.

00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:28.656
When we produced that model,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.955
we turned it into a solid,
plastic model, as you can see,
