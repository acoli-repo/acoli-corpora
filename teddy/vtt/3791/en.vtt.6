00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.111
but we also have been making progress
in our understanding

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:05.687
of what the signatures
of life are on Earth.

00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:08.543
And you can have what we call
organic molecules,

00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:10.470
and these are the bricks of life,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.350
and you can have fossils,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.253
and you can minerals, biominerals,

00:03:15.253 --> 00:03:18.643
which is due to the reaction
between bacteria and rocks,

00:03:18.643 --> 00:03:21.777
and of course you can have
gases in the atmosphere.

00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:23.983
And when you look at those
tiny green algae

00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:25.934
on the right of the slide here,

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.450
they are the direct descendants
of those who have been pumping oxygen

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.843
a billion years ago
in the atmosphere of the Earth.
