00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:31.607
And it also discovered traces of methane.

00:12:31.607 --> 00:12:34.152
And we don't know yet
if the methane in question

00:12:34.152 --> 00:12:37.990
is really from geology or biology.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.859
Regardless, what we know is
that because of the discovery,

00:12:42.859 --> 00:12:46.100
the hypothesis that there is still
life present on Mars today

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.455
remains a viable one.

00:12:48.455 --> 00:12:53.652
So by now, I think I have convinced you
that Mars is very special to us,

00:12:53.652 --> 00:12:56.628
but it would be a mistake to think
that Mars is the only place

00:12:56.628 --> 00:13:01.574
in the solar system that is interesting
to find potential microbial life.
