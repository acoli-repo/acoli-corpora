Mars did have an ocean,
it had volcanoes, it had lakes,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.673
and it had deltas like the beautiful
picture you see here.

00:05:35.673 --> 00:05:39.460
This picture was sent by the Curiosity 
rover only a few weeks ago.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.142
It shows the remnants of a delta,
and this picture tells us something:

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.096
water was abundant

00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:47.757
and stayed founting at the surface
for a very long time.

00:05:47.757 --> 00:05:49.568
This is good news for life.

00:05:49.568 --> 00:05:52.990
Life chemistry takes a long time
to actually happen.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.507
So this is extremely good news,

00:05:54.507 --> 00:05:58.127
but does that mean that if we go there,
life will be easy to find on Mars?

00:05:58.127 --> 00:06:00.010
Not necessarily.
