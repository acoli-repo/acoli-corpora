00:11:28.246 --> 00:11:31.171
And those microbes, the rocks
you see in that slide here,

00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:34.391
well, they are actually
living inside rocks

00:11:34.391 --> 00:11:37.585
and they are using the protection
of the translucence of the rocks

00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:39.382
to get the good part of the U.V.

00:11:39.382 --> 00:11:43.126
and discard the part that could
actually damage their DNA.

00:11:43.126 --> 00:11:45.401
And this is why we are taking our rover

00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:48.977
to train them to search 
for life on Mars in these areas,

00:11:48.977 --> 00:11:52.714
because if there was life on Mars
three and a half billion years ago,

00:11:52.714 --> 00:11:57.074
it had to use the same strategy
to actually protect itself.

00:11:57.864 --> 00:12:00.242
Now, it is pretty obvious
