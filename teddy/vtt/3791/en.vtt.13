00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:31.430
if we want to be able to find those traces
of the signatures of life

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.644
at the surface of Mars, if they are there,

00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:36.831
we need to understand what was
the impact of each of these events

00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:40.484
on the preservation of its record.

00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:45.314
Only then will we be able
to know where those signatures are hiding,

00:06:45.314 --> 00:06:48.997
and only then will we be able
to send our rover to the right places

00:06:48.997 --> 00:06:52.146
where we can sample those rocks
that may be telling us something

00:06:52.146 --> 00:06:54.862
really important about who we are,

00:06:54.862 --> 00:06:58.972
or, if not, maybe telling us
that somewhere, independently,

00:06:58.972 --> 00:07:01.828
life has appeared on another planet.
