00:06:58.972 --> 00:07:01.828
life has appeared on another planet.

00:07:01.828 --> 00:07:04.336
So to do that, it's easy.

00:07:04.336 --> 00:07:07.894
You only need to go back
3.5 billion years ago

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:10.285
in the past of a planet.

00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:12.909
We just need a time machine.

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:15.103
Easy, right?

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:16.673
Well, actually, it is.

00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:18.574
Look around you -- that's planet Earth.

00:07:18.574 --> 00:07:20.618
This is our time machine.

00:07:20.618 --> 00:07:24.788
Geologists are using it
to go back in the past of our own planet.

00:07:24.788 --> 00:07:26.971
I am using it a little bit differently.

00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:29.966
I use planet Earth to go
in very extreme environments

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:32.868
where conditions were similar
to those of Mars
