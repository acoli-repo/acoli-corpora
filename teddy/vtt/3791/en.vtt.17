00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:34.463
the climate is changing very fast,
and water and ice are disappearing.

00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:37.678
But we need to go back to that time
when everything changed on Mars,

00:08:37.678 --> 00:08:39.761
and to do that, we need to go higher.

00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:41.858
Why is that?

00:08:41.858 --> 00:08:43.215
Because when you go higher,

00:08:43.215 --> 00:08:46.337
the atmosphere is getting thinner,
it's getting more unstable,

00:08:46.337 --> 00:08:51.648
the temperature is getting cooler,
and you have a lot more U.V. radiation.

00:08:51.648 --> 00:08:52.457
Basically,

00:08:52.457 --> 00:08:57.191
you are getting to those conditions
on Mars when everything changed.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:04.837
So I was not promising anything about
a leisurely trip on the time machine.
