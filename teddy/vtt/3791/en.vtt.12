00:05:58.127 --> 00:06:00.010
Not necessarily.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.861
Here's what happened:

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:05.230
At the time when life exploded
at the surface of the Earth,

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.369
then everything went south for Mars,

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:08.901
literally.

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:12.472
The atmosphere was
stripped away by solar winds,

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.775
Mars lost its magnetosphere,

00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:19.187
and then cosmic rays and U.V.
bombarded the surface

00:06:19.187 --> 00:06:23.410
and water escaped to space
and went underground.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.501
So if we want to be able to understand,

00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:31.430
if we want to be able to find those traces
of the signatures of life
