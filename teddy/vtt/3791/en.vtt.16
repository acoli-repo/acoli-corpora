00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:03.285
The Earth and Mars will have looked
pretty much exactly like that --

00:08:03.285 --> 00:08:06.796
volcanoes everywhere,
evaporating lakes everywhere,

00:08:06.796 --> 00:08:10.103
minerals, hot springs,

00:08:10.103 --> 00:08:13.934
and then you see those mounds
on the shore of those lakes?

00:08:13.934 --> 00:08:17.394
Those are built by the descendants
of the first organisms

00:08:17.394 --> 00:08:20.496
that gave us the first fossil on Earth.

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:24.555
But if we want to understand what's 
going on, we need to go a little further.

00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:26.470
And the other thing about those sites

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.946
is that exactly like on Mars
three and a half billion years ago,

00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:34.463
the climate is changing very fast,
and water and ice are disappearing.
