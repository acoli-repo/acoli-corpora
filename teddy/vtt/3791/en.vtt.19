00:09:28.464 --> 00:09:33.126
At this altitude, this lake is
experiencing exactly the same conditions

00:09:33.126 --> 00:09:36.245
as those on Mars
three and a half billion years ago.

00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:39.170
And now we have to change our voyage

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.890
into an inner voyage inside that lake,

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.541
and to do that, we have to remove
our mountain gear

00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:49.847
and actually don suits and go for it.

00:09:50.277 --> 00:09:54.452
But at the time we enter that lake,
at the very moment we enter that lake,

00:09:54.452 --> 00:09:56.380
we are stepping back

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.561
three and a half billion years
in the past of another planet,

00:09:59.561 --> 00:10:03.661
and then we are going to get
the answer came for.
