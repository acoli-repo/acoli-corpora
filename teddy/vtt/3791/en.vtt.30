00:14:58.724 --> 00:15:01.531
On Earth, there are many
intelligent species,

00:15:01.531 --> 00:15:04.898
but only one has achieved technology.

00:15:04.898 --> 00:15:08.195
Right here in the journey
of our own solar system,

00:15:08.195 --> 00:15:10.934
there is a very, very powerful message

00:15:10.934 --> 00:15:16.320
that says here's how we should look 
for alien life, small and big.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.618
So yeah, microbes are talking
and we are listening,

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:21.337
and they are taking us,

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:23.891
one planet at a time
and one moon at a time,

00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:26.770
towards their big brothers out there.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.486
And they are telling us about diversity,

00:15:29.486 --> 00:15:32.110
they are telling us about
abundance of life,
