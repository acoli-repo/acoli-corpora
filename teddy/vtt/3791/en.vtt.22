During U.V. storms there,
the U.V. Index reaches 43.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.976
SPF 30 is not going to do anything 
to you over there,

00:11:07.976 --> 00:11:11.342
and the water is so
transparent in those lakes

00:11:11.342 --> 00:11:14.675
that the algae has
nowhere to hide, really,

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.965
and so they are developing
their own sunscreen,

00:11:16.965 --> 00:11:18.749
and this is the red color you see.

00:11:18.749 --> 00:11:21.310
But they can adapt only so far,

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.788
and then when all the water
is gone from the surface,

00:11:23.788 --> 00:11:26.388
microbes have only one solution left:

00:11:26.388 --> 00:11:28.246
They go underground.

00:11:28.246 --> 00:11:31.171
And those microbes, the rocks
you see in that slide here,
