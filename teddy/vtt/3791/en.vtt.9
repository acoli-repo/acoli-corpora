00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.201
Well clearly at the beginning
of the solar system,

00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:37.169
Mars and the Earth were bombarded
by giant asteroids and comets,

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.327
and there were ejecta
from these impacts all over the place.

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:44.187
Earth and Mars kept throwing rocks
at each other for a very long time.

00:04:44.187 --> 00:04:46.230
Pieces of rocks landed on the Earth.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.181
Pieces of the Earth landed on Mars.

00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:53.359
So clearly, those two planets may have
been seeded by the same material.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:57.283
So yeah, maybe Granddady is sitting
there on the surface and waiting for us.

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:06.190
But that also means that we can go to Mars
and try to find traces of our own origin.
