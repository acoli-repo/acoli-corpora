00:11:57.864 --> 00:12:00.242
Now, it is pretty obvious

00:12:00.242 --> 00:12:03.770
that going to extreme environments
is helping us very much

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.761
for the exploration of Mars 
and to prepare missions.

00:12:07.761 --> 00:12:12.100
So far, it has helped us to understand
the geology of Mars.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.221
It has helped to understand the past
climate of Mars and its evolution,

00:12:16.221 --> 00:12:19.208
but also its habitability potential.

00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:24.747
Our most recent rover on Mars
has discovered traces of organics.

00:12:24.747 --> 00:12:27.706
Yeah, there are organics
at the surface of Mars.

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:31.607
And it also discovered traces of methane.
