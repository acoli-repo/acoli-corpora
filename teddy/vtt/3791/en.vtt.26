00:12:56.628 --> 00:13:01.574
in the solar system that is interesting
to find potential microbial life.

00:13:02.434 --> 00:13:06.352
And the reason is because
Mars and the Earth

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:09.143
could have a common root
to their tree of life,

00:13:09.143 --> 00:13:13.290
but when you go beyond Mars,
it's not that easy.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.900
Celestial mechanics 
is not making it so easy

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.315
for an exchange
of material between planets,

00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:22.355
and so if we were to discover
life on those planets,

00:13:22.355 --> 00:13:24.212
it would be different from us.

00:13:24.212 --> 00:13:26.050
It would be a different type of life.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.903
But in the end, it might be just us,

00:13:28.903 --> 00:13:30.899
it might be us and Mars,
