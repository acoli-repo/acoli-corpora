you have life thriving

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:13.676
and it uses only chemistry
for life processes.

00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:19.326
So when you think of it 
at that point, all walls collapse.

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:21.600
You have no limitations, basically.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.160
And if you have been looking
at the headlines lately,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.120
then you will see that we have
discovered a subsurface ocean

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.989
on Europa, on Ganymede,
on Enceladus, on Titan,
