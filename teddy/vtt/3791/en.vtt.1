00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.450
are really pushing them
to the brink of survival.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.704
Actually, sometimes me too,
when I'm trying to follow them too close.

00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:37.521
But here's the thing:

00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:43.134
We are the only advanced civilization
in the solar system,

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:46.878
but that doesn't mean that there is
no microbial life nearby.

00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:50.663
In fact, the planets
and moons you see here

00:00:50.663 --> 00:00:54.633
could host life -- all of them --
and we know that,

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.482
and it's a strong possibility.

00:00:57.482 --> 00:01:02.135
And if we were going to find life
on those moons and planets,
