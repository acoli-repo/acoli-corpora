00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.130
and the reason being is that anything that
is older than four billion years is gone.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.754
All record is gone,

00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:09.632
erased by plate tectonics and erosion.

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:13.184
This is what I call the Earth's
biological horizon.

00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:16.667
Beyond this horizon we don't know
where we are coming from.

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:19.593
So is everything lost? Well, maybe not.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:23.308
And we might be able to find
evidence of our own origin

00:04:23.308 --> 00:04:26.419
in the most unlikely place,
and this place in Mars.

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:29.420
How is this possible?

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.201
Well clearly at the beginning
of the solar system,
