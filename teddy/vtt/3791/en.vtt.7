00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.843
a billion years ago
in the atmosphere of the Earth.

00:03:31.843 --> 00:03:34.465
When they did that, they poisoned
90 percent of the life

00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:35.987
at the surface of the Earth,

00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:39.190
but they are the reason why
you are breathing this air today.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.925
But as much as our understanding grows
of all of these things,

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:48.851
there is one question
we still cannot answer,

00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.126
and this is, where are we coming from?

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:52.844
And you know, it's getting worse,

00:03:52.844 --> 00:03:55.886
because we won't be able
to find the physical evidence

00:03:55.886 --> 00:03:58.440
of where we are coming from
on this planet,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.130
and the reason being is that anything that
is older than four billion years is gone.
