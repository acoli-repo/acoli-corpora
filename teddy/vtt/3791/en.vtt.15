00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:32.868
where conditions were similar
to those of Mars

00:07:32.868 --> 00:07:34.865
at the time when the climate changed,

00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:37.745
and there I'm trying 
to understand what happened.

00:07:37.745 --> 00:07:39.439
What are the signatures of life?

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:42.272
What is left? How are we going to find it?

00:07:42.272 --> 00:07:45.276
So for one moment now
I'm going to take you with me

00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:48.130
on a trip into that time machine.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.865
And now, what you see here,
we are at 4,500 meters in the Andes,

00:07:52.865 --> 00:07:59.594
but in fact we are less than a billion
years after the Earth and Mars formed.

00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:03.285
The Earth and Mars will have looked
pretty much exactly like that --
