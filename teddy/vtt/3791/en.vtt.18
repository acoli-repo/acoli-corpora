00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:04.837
So I was not promising anything about
a leisurely trip on the time machine.

00:09:04.837 --> 00:09:07.371
You are not going to be sitting
in that time machine.

00:09:07.371 --> 00:09:10.399
You have to haul 1,000 pounds
of equipment to the summit

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:14.184
of this 20,000-foot volcano
in the Andes here.

00:09:14.184 --> 00:09:16.784
That's about 6,000 meters.

00:09:16.784 --> 00:09:20.407
And you also have to sleep
on 42-degree slopes

00:09:20.407 --> 00:09:23.518
and really hope that there won't
be any earthquake that night.

00:09:23.518 --> 00:09:28.464
But when we get to the summit,
we actually find the lake we came for.

00:09:28.464 --> 00:09:33.126
At this altitude, this lake is
experiencing exactly the same conditions
