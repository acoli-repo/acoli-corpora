00:00:57.482 --> 00:01:02.135
And if we were going to find life
on those moons and planets,

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:05.151
then we would answer questions such as,

00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:07.287
are we alone in the solar system?

00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:09.256
Where are we coming from?

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:12.233
Do we have family in the neighborhood?

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:16.157
Is there life beyond our solar system?

00:01:16.157 --> 00:01:20.244
And we can ask all those questions
because there has been a revolution

00:01:20.244 --> 00:01:24.520
in our understanding
of what a habitable planet is,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.860
and today, a habitable planet is a planet

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.193
that has a zone where
water can stay stable,
