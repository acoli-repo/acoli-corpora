00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.193
that has a zone where
water can stay stable,

00:01:32.193 --> 00:01:35.922
but to me this is a horizontal
definition of habitability,

00:01:35.922 --> 00:01:38.197
because it involves a distance to a star,

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:41.169
but there is another
dimension to habitability,

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:43.350
and this is a vertical dimension.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.527
Think of it as

00:01:47.527 --> 00:01:54.210
conditions in the subsurface of a planet
where you are very far away from a sun,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.353
but you still have water,
energy, nutrients,

00:01:57.353 --> 00:01:59.304
which for some of them means food,

00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:01.207
and a protection.
