00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.989
on Europa, on Ganymede,
on Enceladus, on Titan,

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.923
and now we are finding a geyser
and hot springs on Enceladus,

00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:37.978
Our solar system is turning
into a giant spa.

00:02:37.978 --> 00:02:41.864
For anybody who has gone to a spa
knows how much microbes like that, right?

00:02:41.864 --> 00:02:43.582
(Laughter)

00:02:43.582 --> 00:02:47.111
So at that point, think also about Mars.

00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:50.478
There is no life possible
at the surface of Mars today,

00:02:50.478 --> 00:02:53.729
but it might still be hiding underground.

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:59.339
So, we have been making progress
in our understanding of habitability,

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.111
but we also have been making progress
in our understanding
