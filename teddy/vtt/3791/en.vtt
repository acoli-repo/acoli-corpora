00:00:00.765 --> 00:00:02.276
Well, you know, sometimes

00:00:02.276 --> 00:00:05.258
the most important things come
in the smallest packages.

00:00:05.258 --> 00:00:08.847
I am going to try to convince you,
in the 15 minutes I have,

00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:13.100
that microbes have a lot to say
about questions such as,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.998
"Are we alone?"

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:20.223
and they can tell us more about
not only life in our solar system

00:00:20.223 --> 00:00:22.100
but also maybe beyond,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.397
and this is why I am tracking them down
in the most impossible places on Earth,

00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:29.766
in extreme environments where conditions

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.450
are really pushing them
to the brink of survival.
