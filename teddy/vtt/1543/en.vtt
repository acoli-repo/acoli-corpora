I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we don't understand as much as we think we do.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'd like to begin with four questions.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That's an in-joke, by the way.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But these four questions, actually,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of audiences of science educators --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so that's science teachers -- and also of seven-year-olds,
