I'm going to show you how terrorism

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
actually interacts with our daily life.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in Italian jails.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, as many of you may remember,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which was very active in Italy

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
from the 1960s until the mid-1980s.
