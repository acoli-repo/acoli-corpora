00:12:57.788 --> 00:13:02.365
Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.706
(Laughter)

00:13:03.706 --> 00:13:05.648
And you can see from the student testimonials

00:13:05.648 --> 00:13:07.335
that students actually find

00:13:07.335 --> 00:13:09.856
that because of this large online community,

00:13:09.856 --> 00:13:12.455
they got to interact with each other in many ways

00:13:12.455 --> 00:13:16.648
that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.

00:13:16.648 --> 00:13:18.992
Students also self-assembled,

00:13:18.992 --> 00:13:20.855
without any kind of intervention from us,

00:13:20.855 --> 00:13:22.758
into small study groups.

00:13:22.758 --> 00:13:25.120
Some of these were physical study groups

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.946
along geographical constraints

00:13:26.946 --> 00:13:29.668
and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.

00:13:29.668 --> 00:13:31.568
This is the San Francisco study group,
