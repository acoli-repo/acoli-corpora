00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:02.706
thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long,

00:01:02.706 --> 00:01:06.586
hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.

00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:08.894
When the gates opened, there was a stampede,

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:12.546
and 20 people were injured and one woman died.

00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:14.486
She was a mother who gave her life

00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:18.549
trying to get her son a chance at a better life.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.706
But even in parts of the world like the United States

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:26.062
where education is available, it might not be within reach.

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:28.734
There has been much discussed in the last few years

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:30.723
about the rising cost of health care.
