00:15:28.718 --> 00:15:30.802
which means that students who made that same mistake

00:15:30.802 --> 00:15:32.828
would now get personalized feedback

00:15:32.828 --> 00:15:37.227
telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.

00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:41.038
So this personalization is something that one can then build

00:15:41.038 --> 00:15:44.178
by having the virtue of large numbers.

00:15:44.178 --> 00:15:46.490
Personalization is perhaps

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.913
one of the biggest opportunities here as well,

00:15:48.913 --> 00:15:51.258
because it provides us with the potential

00:15:51.258 --> 00:15:53.948
of solving a 30-year-old problem.

00:15:53.948 --> 00:15:57.297
Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984,

00:15:57.297 --> 00:15:59.548
posed what's called the 2 sigma problem,

00:15:59.548 --> 00:16:02.610
which he observed by studying three populations.
