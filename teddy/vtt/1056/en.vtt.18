00:08:57.374 --> 00:09:00.695
15 percent are zoned out on Facebook,

00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:03.151
and then there's the smarty pants in the front row

00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.510
who blurts out the answer

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.717
before anyone else has had a chance to think about it,

00:09:06.717 --> 00:09:09.589
and I as the instructor am terribly gratified

00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:11.237
that somebody actually knew the answer.

00:09:11.237 --> 00:09:14.029
And so the lecture moves on before, really,

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:17.558
most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.

00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:20.165
Here, every single student

00:09:20.165 --> 00:09:22.949
has to engage with the material.

00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:24.885
And of course these simple retrieval questions

00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:26.547
are not the end of the story.

00:09:26.547 --> 00:09:29.517
One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions,

00:09:29.517 --> 00:09:31.870
and one also needs to provide the students with feedback
