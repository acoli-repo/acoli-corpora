DK: So here the video pauses,

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.646
and the student types in the answer into the box

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:35.869
and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.

00:08:35.884 --> 00:08:36.753
(Laughter)

00:08:36.753 --> 00:08:38.763
So they get to try again,

00:08:38.763 --> 00:08:41.299
and this time they got it right.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.492
There's an optional explanation if they want.

00:08:43.492 --> 00:08:47.749
And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.

that I as an instructor might ask in class,

00:08:51.708 --> 00:08:54.208
but when I ask that kind of a question in class,

00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:55.508
80 percent of the students

00:08:55.508 --> 00:08:57.374
are still scribbling the last thing I said,

00:08:57.374 --> 00:09:00.695
15 percent are zoned out on Facebook,
