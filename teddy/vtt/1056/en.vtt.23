00:11:27.489 --> 00:11:30.649
What's even more surprising is that self-grades,

00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:32.960
where the students grade their own work critically --

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.697
so long as you incentivize them properly

00:11:34.697 --> 00:11:36.635
so they can't give themselves a perfect score --

00:11:36.635 --> 00:11:39.826
are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.

00:11:39.826 --> 00:11:41.433
And so this is an effective strategy

00:11:41.433 --> 00:11:43.537
that can be used for grading at scale,

00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:46.273
and is also a useful learning strategy for the students,

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:48.528
because they actually learn from the experience.

00:11:48.528 --> 00:11:53.177
So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised,

00:11:53.177 --> 00:11:55.681
where tens of thousands of students

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:56.879
are grading each other's work,

00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:59.948
and quite successfully, I have to say.

00:11:59.948 --> 00:12:02.208
But this is not just about students
