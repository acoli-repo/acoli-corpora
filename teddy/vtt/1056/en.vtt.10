00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:00.405
it's also about the people.

00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:03.381
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India

00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:05.556
and would never have access in this case

00:05:05.556 --> 00:05:07.045
to a Stanford-quality course

00:05:07.045 --> 00:05:09.560
and would never be able to afford it.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.598
Or Jenny, who is a single mother of two

00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:13.565
and wants to hone her skills

00:05:13.565 --> 00:05:16.700
so that she can go back and complete her master's degree.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.836
Or Ryan, who can't go to school,

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:21.701
because his immune deficient daughter

00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:25.084
can't be risked to have germs come into the house,

00:05:25.084 --> 00:05:26.924
so he couldn't leave the house.

00:05:26.924 --> 00:05:28.556
I'm really glad to say --

00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:30.808
recently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan --
