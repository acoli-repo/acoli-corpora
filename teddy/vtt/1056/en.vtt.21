00:10:29.842 --> 00:10:32.201
and they can move on to the next assignment.

00:10:32.201 --> 00:10:35.349
This ability to interact actively with the material

00:10:35.349 --> 00:10:37.033
and be told when you're right or wrong

00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:40.159
is really essential to student learning.

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:42.434
Now, of course we cannot yet grade

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:45.268
the range of work that one needs for all courses.

00:10:45.268 --> 00:10:48.569
Specifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work

00:10:48.569 --> 00:10:50.491
that is so essential in such disciplines

00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:54.088
as the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.

00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:56.337
So we tried to convince, for example,

00:10:56.337 --> 00:10:57.953
some of our humanities faculty

00:10:57.953 --> 00:11:00.649
that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.
