00:10:57.953 --> 00:11:00.649
that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:02.840
That didn't go over really well.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.273
So we had to come up with a different solution.

00:11:05.273 --> 00:11:08.347
And the solution we ended up using is peer grading.

00:11:08.347 --> 00:11:10.769
It turns out that previous studies show,

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:12.441
like this one by Saddler and Good,

00:11:12.441 --> 00:11:14.929
that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy

00:11:14.929 --> 00:11:18.143
for providing reproducible grades.

00:11:18.143 --> 00:11:19.913
It was tried only in small classes,

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:21.400
but there it showed, for example,

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.882
that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis

00:11:23.882 --> 00:11:25.193
are actually very well correlated

00:11:25.193 --> 00:11:27.489
with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.

00:11:27.489 --> 00:11:30.649
What's even more surprising is that self-grades,
