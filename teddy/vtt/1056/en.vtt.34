00:16:59.069 --> 00:17:01.267
would be above average.

00:17:01.267 --> 00:17:04.690
Hence, the 2 sigma problem.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.089
Because we cannot afford, as a society,

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:10.161
to provide every student with an individual human tutor.

00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:12.410
But maybe we can afford to provide each student

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.429
with a computer or a smartphone.

00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:16.618
So the question is, how can we use technology

00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:19.993
to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve,

00:17:19.993 --> 00:17:22.731
to the right side with the green curve?

00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:25.068
Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer,

00:17:25.068 --> 00:17:26.473
because a computer doesn't get tired

00:17:26.473 --> 00:17:29.546
of showing you the same video five times.

00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:32.797
And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times,
