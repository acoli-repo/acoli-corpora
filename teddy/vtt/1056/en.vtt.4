00:01:58.314 --> 00:02:00.627
in the United States who get a higher education

00:02:00.627 --> 00:02:04.090
actually are working in jobs that require that education.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.930
This, of course, is not true for the students

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.882
who graduate from the top institutions,

00:02:07.882 --> 00:02:10.514
but for many others, they do not get the value

00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:14.050
for their time and their effort.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.080
Tom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.448
captured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.

00:02:21.448 --> 00:02:24.568
He said the big breakthroughs are what happen

00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:28.467
when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.088
I've talked about what's desperately necessary.
