Students can traverse this material in different ways,

00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:06.082
depending on their background, their skills or their interests.

00:07:06.082 --> 00:07:08.602
So, for example, some students might benefit

00:07:08.602 --> 00:07:11.362
from a little bit of preparatory material

00:07:11.362 --> 00:07:13.433
that other students might already have.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.873
Other students might be interested in a particular

00:07:15.873 --> 00:07:18.959
enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:22.194
So this format allows us to break away

00:07:22.194 --> 00:07:25.018
from the one-size-fits-all model of education,

00:07:25.018 --> 00:07:29.010
and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.353
Of course, we all know as educators
