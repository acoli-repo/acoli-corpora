WEBVTT

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.559
gives considerably improved results

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:02.828
on various achievement tests down the line

00:08:02.828 --> 00:08:07.132
than many other educational interventions.

00:08:07.132 --> 00:08:10.094
We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform,

00:08:10.094 --> 00:08:12.348
as well as other forms of practice in many ways.

00:08:12.348 --> 00:08:16.492
For example, even our videos are not just videos.

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:18.535
Every few minutes, the video pauses

00:08:18.535 --> 00:08:20.686
and the students get asked a question.

00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:22.907
(Video) SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting,

00:08:22.907 --> 00:08:25.999
status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.

00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:28.766
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.

00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:30.390
DK: So here the video pauses,
