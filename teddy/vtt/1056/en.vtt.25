00:12:29.527 --> 00:12:32.166
First of all, there was a question and answer forum,

00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:34.310
where students would pose questions,

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.734
and other students would answer those questions.

00:12:36.734 --> 00:12:38.447
And the really amazing thing is,

00:12:38.447 --> 00:12:40.117
because there were so many students,

00:12:40.117 --> 00:12:42.482
it means that even if a student posed a question

00:12:42.482 --> 00:12:44.114
at 3 o'clock in the morning,

00:12:44.114 --> 00:12:45.696
somewhere around the world,

00:12:45.696 --> 00:12:47.770
there would be somebody who was awake

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.083
and working on the same problem.

00:12:50.083 --> 00:12:52.041
And so, in many of our courses,

00:12:52.041 --> 00:12:54.370
the median response time for a question

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.788
on the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.

00:12:57.788 --> 00:13:02.365
Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.
