This is the San Francisco study group,

00:13:31.568 --> 00:13:33.887
but there were ones all over the world.

00:13:33.887 --> 00:13:35.919

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:38.908
sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines,

00:13:38.908 --> 00:13:40.352
and on the bottom left there,

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:44.148

00:13:44.148 --> 00:13:45.911

00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:48.917

00:13:51.028 --> 00:13:54.353

00:13:54.353 --> 00:13:58.007

00:13:58.007 --> 00:14:00.441
a completely unprecedented look
