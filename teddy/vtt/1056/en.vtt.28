00:13:58.007 --> 00:14:00.441
a completely unprecedented look

00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:02.730
into understanding human learning.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.193
Because the data that we can collect here is unique.

00:14:06.193 --> 00:14:10.202
You can collect every click, every homework submission,

00:14:10.202 --> 00:14:14.565
every forum post from tens of thousands of students.

00:14:14.565 --> 00:14:16.908
So you can turn the study of human learning

00:14:16.908 --> 00:14:18.841
from the hypothesis-driven mode

00:14:18.841 --> 00:14:21.699
to the data-driven mode, a transformation that,

00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:24.740
for example, has revolutionized biology.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.164
You can use these data to understand fundamental questions

00:14:28.164 --> 00:14:30.044
like, what are good learning strategies
