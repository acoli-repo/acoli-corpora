00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.353
Of course, we all know as educators

00:07:31.353 --> 00:07:34.713
that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.

00:07:34.713 --> 00:07:37.658
Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort

00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:40.250
is that we need to have students

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.659
who practice with the material

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:45.815
in order to really understand it.

00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:49.083
There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.

00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:51.615
This one that appeared in Science last year, for example,

00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:54.447
demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice,

00:07:54.447 --> 00:07:57.239
where students are just supposed to repeat

00:07:57.239 --> 00:07:58.639
what they already learned

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.559
gives considerably improved results
