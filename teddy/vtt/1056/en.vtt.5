00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.088
I've talked about what's desperately necessary.

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:33.600
Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.719
What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.287
three big Stanford classes,

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:42.167
each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:45.551
So to understand this, let's look at one of those classes,

00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:47.471
the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague

00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:49.200
and cofounder Andrew Ng.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.519
Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.728
It's a Machine Learning class,

00:02:52.728 --> 00:02:56.246
and it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.

00:02:56.246 --> 00:02:59.511
When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public,

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:02.127
it had 100,000 people registered.
