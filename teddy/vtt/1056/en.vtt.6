00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:02.127
it had 100,000 people registered.

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:04.136
So to put that number in perspective,

00:03:04.136 --> 00:03:06.495
for Andrew to reach that same size audience

00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:08.321
by teaching a Stanford class,

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.247
he would have to do that for 250 years.

00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:15.733
Of course, he'd get really bored.

00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:18.470
So, having seen the impact of this,

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.598
Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up,

00:03:21.598 --> 00:03:25.718
to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.

00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:27.213
So we formed Coursera,

00:03:27.213 --> 00:03:30.350
whose goal is to take the best courses
