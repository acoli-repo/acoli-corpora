00:14:59.555 --> 00:15:01.703
is where 2,000 students

00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:04.748
gave the exact same wrong answer.

00:15:04.748 --> 00:15:07.075
Now, if two students in a class of 100

00:15:07.075 --> 00:15:08.362
give the same wrong answer,

00:15:08.362 --> 00:15:09.713
you would never notice.

00:15:09.713 --> 00:15:12.273
But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer,

00:15:12.273 --> 00:15:13.970
it's kind of hard to miss.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.162
So Andrew and his students went in,

00:15:16.162 --> 00:15:17.682
looked at some of those assignments,

00:15:17.682 --> 00:15:21.770
understood the root cause of the misconception,

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.290
and then they produced a targeted error message

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.539
that would be provided to every student

00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:28.718
whose answer fell into that bucket,

00:15:28.718 --> 00:15:30.802
which means that students who made that same mistake
