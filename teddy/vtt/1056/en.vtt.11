00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:30.808
recently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan --

00:05:30.808 --> 00:05:32.740
that this story had a happy ending.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.643
Baby Shannon -- you can see her on the left --

00:05:34.643 --> 00:05:35.994
is doing much better now,

00:05:35.994 --> 00:05:40.192
and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.

00:05:40.192 --> 00:05:42.436
So what made these courses so different?

00:05:42.436 --> 00:05:46.156
After all, online course content has been available for a while.

00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:49.868
What made it different was that this was real course experience.

00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:51.594
It started on a given day,

00:05:51.594 --> 00:05:55.228
and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis

00:05:55.228 --> 00:05:57.083
and do homework assignments.

00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:58.874
And these would be real homework assignments

00:05:58.874 --> 00:06:02.178
for a real grade, with a real deadline.
