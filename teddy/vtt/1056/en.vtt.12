00:05:58.874 --> 00:06:02.178
for a real grade, with a real deadline.

00:06:02.178 --> 00:06:04.234
You can see the deadlines and the usage graph.

00:06:04.234 --> 00:06:06.322
These are the spikes showing

00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:10.111
that procrastination is global phenomenon.

00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:12.687
(Laughter)

00:06:12.687 --> 00:06:14.359
At the end of the course,

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:16.215
the students got a certificate.

00:06:16.215 --> 00:06:18.375
They could present that certificate

00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:20.528
to a prospective employer and get a better job,

00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:22.588
and we know many students who did.

00:06:22.588 --> 00:06:24.507
Some students took their certificate

00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:27.629
and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:29.470
for actual college credit.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.684
So these students were really getting something meaningful
