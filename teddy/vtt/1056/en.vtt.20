00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.034
We can grade models, whether it's

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:04.210
financial models in a business class

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.194
or physical models in a science or engineering class

00:10:07.194 --> 00:10:10.938
and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.

00:10:10.938 --> 00:10:12.857
Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple

00:10:12.857 --> 00:10:14.337
but fairly visual.

00:10:14.337 --> 00:10:16.814
This is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class,

00:10:16.814 --> 00:10:18.418
and the students are supposed to color-correct

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:20.010
that blurry red image.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.028
They're typing their program into the browser,

00:10:22.028 --> 00:10:26.086
and you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.

00:10:26.086 --> 00:10:29.842
And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that,

00:10:29.842 --> 00:10:32.201
and they can move on to the next assignment.
