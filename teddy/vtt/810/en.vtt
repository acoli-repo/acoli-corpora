00:00:00.642 --> 00:00:04.541
People are living longer
and societies are getting grayer.

00:00:05.113 --> 00:00:06.841
You hear about it all the time.

00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:08.764
You read about it in your newspapers.

00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:11.134
You hear about it on your television sets.

00:00:11.158 --> 00:00:12.422
Sometimes, I'm concerned

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:17.054
that we hear about it so much
that we've come to accept longer lives

00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:20.911
with a kind of a complacency, even ease.

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:26.225
But make no mistake, longer lives can --

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:32.132
and, I believe, will improve
quality of life at all ages.
