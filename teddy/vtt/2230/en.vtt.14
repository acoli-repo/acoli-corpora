00:06:58.458 --> 00:07:00.018
And it gets worse.

00:07:00.042 --> 00:07:02.018
For people who are subjected

00:07:02.042 --> 00:07:04.976
to significant amounts
of artificial light at night

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.101
they're about 50 percent more likely
to get breast cancer.

00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:12.351
And in fact, light pollution
is correlated with types of cancer

00:07:12.375 --> 00:07:13.726
across the board.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.393
And in controlled lab experiments

00:07:15.417 --> 00:07:19.893
there's a direct link between
increased artificial light at night

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:21.708
and a rate of tumor growth.

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:25.643
You might be wondering how normal light

00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:28.934
could possibly impact cancer rates.

00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.768
It likely all comes down
to the super important hormone
