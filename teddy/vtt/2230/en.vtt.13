00:06:28.583 --> 00:06:30.601
So let's talk about us.

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:33.018
You are probably not surprised to hear

00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:36.934
that light pollution can affect
your ability to sleep well at night.

00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.917
But you might be surprised to hear
that light pollution is linked to obesity.

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:43.518
In fact, in a recent study

00:06:43.542 --> 00:06:46.893
they found that light pollution
contributed to over 70 percent

00:06:46.917 --> 00:06:49.542
of the obesity rates in 80 countries.

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:51.684
More than that,

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:55.851
light pollution actually contributed
about the same amount to excess weight

00:06:55.875 --> 00:06:57.208
as eating junk food.

00:06:58.458 --> 00:07:00.018
And it gets worse.
