00:11:29.333 --> 00:11:31.976
like we've heard about today
and you'll hear more about,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.809
are overwhelming
and they seem intractable.

00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:39.559
Visible light pollution
is not one of these problems.

00:11:39.583 --> 00:11:42.893
This is actually stupidly simple, OK?

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:46.643
So here are five
super simple things you can do.

00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:49.559
Don't use lights
brighter than you need to.

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:52.018
Don't use lights when you don't need them.

00:11:52.042 --> 00:11:53.309
Those lights you're using,

00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:54.934
make sure they're shielded down,

00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.101
so they're not shining up into the sky.

00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:59.226
And let's talk about LED lights.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.559
If you have a choice,
don't buy the blue ones.
