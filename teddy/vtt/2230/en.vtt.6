00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:01.976
of course are due to all of the light
we produce at night.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.559
Those very same lights
we see all the way from space

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:06.559
are shining up into the atmosphere,

00:03:06.583 --> 00:03:11.768
where they bounce around
and create this featureless smog of light.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:14.226
And that featureless
smog of light has a name.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.476
It's called light pollution.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.768
As an astronomer,

00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:20.476
I can actually tell
how bad light pollution is

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.059
by the brightness of stars
I can see in the sky.

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:24.351
And it turns out

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:27.601
that when you're trying to unlock
the secrets of the cosmos,

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:31.434
it's really helpful
to be able to see the cosmos.
