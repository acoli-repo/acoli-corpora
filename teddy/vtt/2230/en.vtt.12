If a population is wiped out,

00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:05.226
it can take decades to replenish.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.809
And that, in turn, affects
the rest of their ecosystem

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:11.851
and the other species, like the birds
and the barnacles and the crabs.

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:15.101
So this is just one
small and slimy example

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:18.518
of how light pollution
can unleash a cascade effect

00:06:18.542 --> 00:06:20.893
on an entire ecosystem.

00:06:20.917 --> 00:06:25.351
Virtually every species
that has been studied to date

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:27.184
is impacted by light pollution.

00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:28.559
And that includes humans.

00:06:28.583 --> 00:06:30.601
So let's talk about us.
