00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:30.643
But they're pretty cool.

00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:32.601
So in an entire year

00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:36.893
a dog whelk will rarely move
more than about 10 meters.

00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:40.809
That means that when
they are attacking their prey

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:43.792
they can hit this brisk pace
of about a millimeter an hour.

00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:45.976
And --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
(Laughter)

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:50.768
This works out OK,

00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:53.393
because they attack things like barnacles.

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:57.125
(Laughter)

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.934
So these dog whelks live
in the intertidal area of coasts,
