00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.226
than just losing some
whimsical ability to gaze at the stars.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.518
For example,

00:04:06.542 --> 00:04:09.476
countless plant and animal
species are affected.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.643
So we could talk about sea turtles

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:15.101
or pollinators

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:18.101
or any of these super important species

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.434
that are also cute.

00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:21.726
Instead, I want to talk

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.184
about these quietly unassuming dog whelks.

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:26.601
You may have seen them around

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:29.351
and not given them
really a whole lot of thought.

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:30.643
But they're pretty cool.
