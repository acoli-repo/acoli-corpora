00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.351
buy 30,000 Tesla Model X SUVs.

00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:02.393
(Laughter)

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.667
And that includes
the electric car tax credit.

00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:09.976
And then there are the existential costs.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.268
I don't have any data

00:09:12.292 --> 00:09:15.893
on how losing touch
with our place in the cosmos

00:09:15.917 --> 00:09:17.768
impacts us.

00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:20.351
But I believe

00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:22.434
that this probably impacts our humanity

00:09:22.458 --> 00:09:25.976
more than any of the other
scary statistics I can share with you.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.601
And it's getting worse with time.

00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:33.226
The amount of light pollution
is doubling roughly every 35 years.
