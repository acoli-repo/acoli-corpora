00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:30.226
which is not coincidentally
the name of one of my dogs.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.726
(Laughter)

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.559
But this experience is being lost.

00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:37.851
My favorite constellation, Lyra,

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:40.066
this is what it would look like
from Manhattan.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.684
For people who live in urban
and suburban environments,

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:45.351
if they go outside at night and look up,

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:50.101
instead of being awestruck
by the majesty of the universe,

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:52.167
they see pretty much nothing.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.143
These unremarkable,
completely blank night skies,

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:01.976
of course are due to all of the light
we produce at night.
