The fact that you're laughing
about death is kind of amazing.

00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:32.333
(Laughter)

00:08:33.208 --> 00:08:35.125
You might still care about money.

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:38.268
The money that's spent
on that wasted light,

00:08:38.292 --> 00:08:41.226
and I mean just the light
that's going out into the universe,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.518
and not doing us any good,

00:08:42.542 --> 00:08:44.393
is three billion dollars a year.

00:08:44.417 --> 00:08:46.434
That's enough money to build, like,

00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:49.018
1,000 utility-grade windmills,

00:08:49.042 --> 00:08:53.309
or fund the entire DC public-school
system for over two years,

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:55.809
or -- this is my favorite,
because I really want one

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:57.476
but I can't afford one --

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.351
buy 30,000 Tesla Model X SUVs.
