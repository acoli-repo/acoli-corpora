also has a pollution problem.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.976
Mostly it's from modern technology,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.351
things like cell phones
or car-to-car radar,

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:08.583
or now apparently we need appliances
that can talk to each other.

00:10:09.792 --> 00:10:12.809
All of this modern technology
is putting out strong signals

00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:14.976
that can completely swamp

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.768
this exceedingly faint light
we're trying to detect

00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:20.934
from the rest of the universe
outside Earth,

00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.792
which just for the record,
is most of the universe.
