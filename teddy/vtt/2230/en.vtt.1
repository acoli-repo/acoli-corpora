00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:33.851
That light is meant to be
illuminating our sidewalks,

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:35.976
and our streets and our houses.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.643
Instead, it's actually
going up into the sky

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:40.268
and out into the universe,

00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:42.375
where it's not doing any of us any good.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:47.101
When I see photos of this, of the Earth,

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.250
I see environmental catastrophe.

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:52.518
Those aren't jewels,

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:53.833
those are tumors.

00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.226
I'm an astronomer,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.851
so it's really no surprise
probably to anyone

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:02.226
that I've always loved the night sky.
