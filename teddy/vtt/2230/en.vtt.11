Why is an astronomer
telling you about dog whelks?

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.333
I ask that myself.

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:38.976
Because their behavior
is impacted by light pollution.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.268
For example,

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:43.518
if dog whelks are subjected
to artificial light at night

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:47.768
they're about twice as likely
to stay under the water with a predator.

00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:49.684
And that puts them at increased risk.

00:05:49.708 --> 00:05:51.976
And it's not like they can make
a speedy escape.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.268
And so these --

00:05:53.292 --> 00:05:54.542
(Laughter)

00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:57.726
And the other issue
is because they literally move

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.559
at a snail's pace.

00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:02.268
If a population is wiped out,
