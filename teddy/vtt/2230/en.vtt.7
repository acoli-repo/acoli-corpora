00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:31.434
it's really helpful
to be able to see the cosmos.

00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:32.708
And --

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:33.833
[Laughs]

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.208
Truth.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:38.643
And this light that we're trying to detect

00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:42.809
is coming from millions or billions
of light-years away,

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:46.059
and so it's generally pretty faint.

00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:47.851
And as an astronomer,

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:50.351
I fight with this every day to do my job,

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:54.000
and I have to tell you,
it is a really big problem.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:59.976
But the problem is far worse

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.226
than just losing some
whimsical ability to gaze at the stars.
