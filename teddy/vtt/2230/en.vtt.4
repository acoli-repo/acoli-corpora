00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:02.184
And almost a sense of vertigo,

00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:05.125
like I was going to fall into space.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.143
And when this happened --

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:10.018
I know this sounds kind of ridiculous,

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:15.976
but I would simultaneously feel
unfathomably insignificant

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.625
and also kind of weirdly important.

00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:23.684
That star I looked to
night after night was called Vega.

00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:27.434
Vega is the brightest star
in the constellation Lyra,

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:30.226
which is not coincidentally
the name of one of my dogs.
