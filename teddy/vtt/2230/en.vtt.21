00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:32.351
And then, there are satellites.

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:36.518
Satellites are a problem at both
visible and invisible wavelengths.

00:10:36.542 --> 00:10:40.726
A host of private companies have plans
to deploy tens of thousands of satellites

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.518
into Earth orbit,

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:44.601
where they will not only outnumber,

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:48.018
literally outnumber
the visible stars in the sky,

00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:52.393
while also beaming
invisible light back to Earth.

00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:54.351
So for astronomers like me,

00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:56.851
who use invisible light
to study the universe,

00:10:56.875 --> 00:10:59.934
it's going to be like staring at the Sun

00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.375
and trying to see
a birthday candle behind it.
