00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:02.226
that I've always loved the night sky.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.167
I'm kind of a walking cliché.

00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:09.309
But when I was growing up in Minnesota,

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.434
one of my favorite things to do
on a summer evening

00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:15.101
was grab my old Raggedy Ann sleeping bag

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.434
and take it out into a field
behind my house,

00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:20.934
where I would spend hours
looking at the night sky.

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:24.101
And to do this, I had to brave
not only the darkness,

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.559
but also swarms of mosquitoes,

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:29.851
and my sleeping bag
really didn't smell very good.

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:31.583
