00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.934
So these dog whelks live
in the intertidal area of coasts,

00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.226
where, it turns out,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.309
they're a pretty key part
of the ecosystem.

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:11.143
Not only are they one of the most
dominant invertebrate predators,

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:16.226
but other animals, like crabs and birds,
think they're pretty tasty.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.643
So that leaves these poor snails
in a kind of precarious situation,

00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:22.059
because if they go too low in the water,

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:23.893
then crabs are a threat,

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:26.018
but if they come out of the water too far,

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:27.667
birds are going to have a feast.

00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:31.625
Why is an astronomer
telling you about dog whelks?
