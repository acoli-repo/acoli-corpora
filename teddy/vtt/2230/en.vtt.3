00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:31.583
(Laughter)

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:35.351
But there was one particular star

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.518
that I would look for, night after night.

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:39.268
And then I would play this game

00:01:39.292 --> 00:01:43.559
where I would try to focus
on that star so intensely,

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:45.934

would fade from my view

00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.893
and that single star
would be all that I could see.

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:51.018
I could only ever hold on to that focus

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:53.559
for a few fleeting moments.

00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:54.934
But when I did,

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.809
I felt this deep sense
of connection to the universe.

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:02.184
And almost a sense of vertigo,
