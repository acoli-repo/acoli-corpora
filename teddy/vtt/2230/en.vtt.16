In fact, things are so bad,

00:08:00.708 --> 00:08:03.518
that the International Agency
for Cancer Research

00:08:03.542 --> 00:08:06.851
has said that disrupting
the human circadian rhythm

00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:08.750
is a probable carcinogen.

00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:12.101
Also, for fun, I want to let you know

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.059
that light pollution has been linked to,

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:17.143
let's see -- headaches, anxiety,
depression, diabetes,

00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:19.434
cardiovascular disease
and the list goes on.

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:21.768
But maybe you don't care
about your health.

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:23.226
We're all going to die anyway,

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.518
you might as well die
in a brightly lit room.

00:08:25.542 --> 00:08:28.184
(Laughter)

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:31.143
The fact that you're laughing
about death is kind of amazing.
