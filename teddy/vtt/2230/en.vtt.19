00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:33.226
The amount of light pollution
is doubling roughly every 35 years.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.518
That means that within the next decade

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:40.101
virtually the entire eastern half
of the United States

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:43.083
will be perpetually brighter
than twilight.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.018
And there's another issue
with light pollution.

00:09:47.042 --> 00:09:50.143
The problem is way worse
than we can see with our own eyes.

00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:52.976
Our eyes have evolved
to just detect this tiny range

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.101
of the full spectrum of light.

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:57.476
All of this other light that we can't see,

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.559
this invisible light,

00:09:59.583 --> 00:10:01.226
also has a pollution problem.
