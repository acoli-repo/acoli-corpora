00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:02.785
I decided when I was asked to do this

00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:06.507
that what I really wanted to talk about
was my friend, Richard Feynman.

00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:09.976
I was one of the fortunate few
that really did get to know him

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.410
and enjoyed his presence.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.503
And I'm going to tell you
about the Richard Feynman that I knew.

00:00:15.527 --> 00:00:17.826
I'm sure there are people here
who could tell you

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.567
about the Richard Feynman they knew,

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:22.116
and it would probably be
a different Richard Feynman.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.123
Richard Feynman was a very complex man.

00:00:24.147 --> 00:00:26.123
He was a man of many, many parts.

00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:31.210
He was, of course, foremost,
a very, very, very great scientist.
