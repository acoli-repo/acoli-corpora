00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:32.354
about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting
added to the planet's atmosphere,

00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:35.626
and then diffusing into the ocean
and into the land.

00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:41.321
That's on top of the 550 gigatons
that are in place today.

00:03:42.062 --> 00:03:43.896
At the end of 30 years,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.473
we will have put 850 gigatons
of carbon into the air,

00:03:49.171 --> 00:03:51.422
and that probably goes a long way

00:03:51.446 --> 00:03:57.607
towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase
in global mean surface temperatures,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.826
locking in ocean acidification
