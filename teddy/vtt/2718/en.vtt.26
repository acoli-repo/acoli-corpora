00:12:57.168 --> 00:13:00.173
and they can deliver it in scale by 2030,

00:13:00.634 --> 00:13:02.833
if only we give them a chance.

00:13:04.064 --> 00:13:06.967
Right now, we're basically
waiting for a miracle.

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:09.472
What we need is a choice.

00:13:09.952 --> 00:13:12.756
If they can't make it safe,
if they can't make it cheap,

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.597
it should not be deployed.

00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:18.675
But what I want you to do
is not carry an idea forward,

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:20.350
but write your leaders,

00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:22.752
write the head of the NGOs you support,

00:13:22.776 --> 00:13:25.719
and tell them to give you the choice,

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.441
not the past.

00:13:27.465 --> 00:13:28.649
Thank you very much.

00:13:28.673 --> 00:13:33.465
