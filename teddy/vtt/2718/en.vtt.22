00:10:57.772 --> 00:11:00.144
about 200 gigawatts of nuclear,

00:11:00.501 --> 00:11:04.562
and on an energy-equivalent basis,
adjusting for intermittency,

00:11:04.586 --> 00:11:06.877
about 100 gigawatts of renewables.

00:11:07.554 --> 00:11:09.462
800 gigawatts of coal.

00:11:09.805 --> 00:11:13.357
They're doing that, knowing the costs
better than any other country,

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.933
knowing the need better
than any other country.

00:11:16.454 --> 00:11:19.081
But that's what they're aiming for in 2040

00:11:19.105 --> 00:11:21.429
unless we give them a better choice.

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:23.639
To give them a better choice,

00:11:23.663 --> 00:11:26.224
it's going to have to meet
the Chindia test.

00:11:26.248 --> 00:11:28.906
If you look at all the alternatives
that are out there,

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.430
there are really two
that come near to meeting it.
