00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.826
locking in ocean acidification

00:04:01.227 --> 00:04:03.204
and locking in sea level rise.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.205
Now, this is a projection made by men

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:10.125
by the actions of society,

00:04:10.863 --> 00:04:13.339
and it's ours to change, not to accept.

00:04:13.912 --> 00:04:17.790
But the magnitude of the problem
is something we need to appreciate.

00:04:18.648 --> 00:04:21.091
Different nations make
different energy choices.

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:23.442
It's a function
of their natural resources.

00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:25.475
It's a function of their climate.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:29.981
It's a function of the development path
that they've followed as a society.
