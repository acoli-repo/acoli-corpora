00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:02.303
we see the difficulty
that President Xi has

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.666
as he begins to un-employ so many people
in his coal and mining industries

00:01:08.214 --> 00:01:10.145
who see no future for themselves.

00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:14.186
As we as a society
figure out how to manage

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.163
the problems of the developed world

00:01:16.187 --> 00:01:18.235
and the problems of the developing world,

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.107
we have to look at how we move forward

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:24.841
and manage the environmental impact
of those decisions.

00:01:25.868 --> 00:01:28.967
We've been working on this problem
for 25 years, since Rio,

00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:30.674
the Kyoto Protocols.
