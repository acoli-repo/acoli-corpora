00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.224
which we can use today,

00:12:00.248 --> 00:12:03.182
versus the batteries
which are still under development.

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:06.924
So what's holding new nuclear back?

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:11.361
Outdated regulations
and yesterday's mindsets.

00:12:11.972 --> 00:12:16.167
We have not used our latest
scientific thinking on radiological health

00:12:16.191 --> 00:12:18.879
to think how we communicate
with the public

00:12:18.903 --> 00:12:21.281
and govern the testing
of new nuclear reactors.

00:12:21.729 --> 00:12:25.926
We have new scientific knowledge
that we need to use

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.489
in order to improve the way
we regulate nuclear industry.
