00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.430
there are really two
that come near to meeting it.

00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:35.750
First is this area of new nuclear
that I'll talk about in just a second.

00:11:36.107 --> 00:11:39.407
It's a new generation of nuclear plants
that are on the drawing boards

00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:40.707
around the world,

00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:43.069
and the people who are
developing these say

00:11:43.093 --> 00:11:46.634
we can get them
in position to demo by 2025

00:11:47.252 --> 00:11:50.525
and to scale by 2030,
if you will just let us.

00:11:51.246 --> 00:11:54.080
The second alternative
that could be there in time

00:11:54.771 --> 00:11:58.476
is utility-scale solar
backed up with natural gas,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.224
which we can use today,
