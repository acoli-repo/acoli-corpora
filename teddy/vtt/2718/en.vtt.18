00:09:03.507 --> 00:09:06.638
between one percent and three percent

00:09:06.662 --> 00:09:08.280
of the Earth's climate budget.

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:12.755
So every day that you go home
thinking that you should do something

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:14.055
about global warming,

00:09:14.594 --> 00:09:16.526
at the end of that week, remember:

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:20.943
somebody fired up a coal plant
that's going to run for 50 years

00:09:20.967 --> 00:09:24.043
and take away your ability to change it.

00:09:25.972 --> 00:09:29.566
What we've forgotten is something
that Vinod Khosla used to talk about,

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.712
a man of Indian ethnicity
but an American venture capitalist.
