It's a function of where
on the surface of the planet they are.

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.691
Are they where it's dark
a lot of the time,

00:04:36.715 --> 00:04:38.576
or are they at the mid-latitudes?

00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:42.708
Many, many, many things
go into the choices of countries,

00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:45.362
and they each make a different choice.

00:04:46.878 --> 00:04:50.040
The overwhelming thing
that we need to appreciate

00:04:50.064 --> 00:04:51.981
is the choice that China has made.

00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:55.289
China has made the choice,

00:04:55.313 --> 00:04:57.818
and will make the choice, to run on coal.

00:04:58.358 --> 00:05:00.377
The United States has an alternative.
