800 to 1,600 new coal plants
are going to be built around the world.

00:08:34.085 --> 00:08:38.694

That's happening regardless
of what we want,

00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:48.399

00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:50.793
assessing the interests of their citizens,

00:08:50.817 --> 00:08:54.232
have decided it's in the interest
of their citizens to do that.

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:59.302

00:08:59.726 --> 00:09:03.483
And every 100 of those plants will use up
