we regulate nuclear industry.

00:12:30.872 --> 00:12:33.321
The second thing is we've got a mindset

00:12:33.345 --> 00:12:36.154
that it takes 25 years
and 2 to 5 billion dollars

00:12:36.178 --> 00:12:37.913
to develop a nuclear power plant.

00:12:37.937 --> 00:12:41.866
That comes from the historical,
military mindset

00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:44.851
of the places nuclear power came from.

00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:47.567
These new nuclear ventures are saying

00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:50.496

for 5 cents a kilowatt hour;

00:12:51.212 --> 00:12:53.813
they can deliver it
for 100 gigawatts a year;

00:12:54.543 --> 00:12:56.772
they can demo it by 2025;

00:12:57.168 --> 00:13:00.173
and they can deliver it in scale by 2030,
