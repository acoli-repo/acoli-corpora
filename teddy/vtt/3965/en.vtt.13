MW: It's not always easy.

00:06:31.864 --> 00:06:35.329
Sometimes it does get
a little bit hard to walk your talk.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.257
IW: But last year, we did exactly that.

00:06:38.663 --> 00:06:40.266
We went to India to give a talk,

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.845
and our parents took us to visit

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:44.457
the former private house
of Mahatma Gandhi.

00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:47.470

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:51.327
Yes, by the end of the tour,

00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:53.002
when we met our parents again,

00:06:53.026 --> 00:06:54.692
we both made a decision and said,

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:56.472
"We're going on a hunger strike!"

00:06:56.496 --> 00:06:57.497
(Laughter)

00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:00.420
MW: And you can probably
imagine their faces.
