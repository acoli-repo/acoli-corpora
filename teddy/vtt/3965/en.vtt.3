WEBVTT

00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:32.571
where we learned about significant people,

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:34.083
like Nelson Mandela,

00:01:34.107 --> 00:01:35.258
Lady Diana

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:36.507
and Mahatma Gandhi.

00:01:37.244 --> 00:01:38.401
Walking home that day,

00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:41.733
we agreed that we also
wanted to be significant.

00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:44.651
Why should we wait until we were grown up

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:45.933
to be significant?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.494
We wanted to do something now.

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:50.835
MW: Sitting on the sofa that night,

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.695
we brainstormed and thought
of all the issues facing Bali.

00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:56.396
And one thing that stood out
to us the most

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.784
was the plastic garbage.

00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:00.603
But that is a huge problem.
