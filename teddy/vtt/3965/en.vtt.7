00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:30.428
home of 800 families.

00:03:30.952 --> 00:03:32.775
The village mayor was our first friend

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.265
and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped.

00:03:36.077 --> 00:03:38.745
We focused on making the customers aware,

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.487
because that's where the change
needs to happen.

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:44.463
The village is already
two-thirds along the way

00:03:44.487 --> 00:03:46.492
of becoming plastic bag free.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.205
Our first attempts to get the government
of Bali on board failed.

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:53.846
So we thought,

00:03:54.391 --> 00:03:58.691
"Hmm ... a petition
with one million signatures.

00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:00.708
They can't ignore us, right?"
