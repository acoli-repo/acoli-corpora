00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:00.603
But that is a huge problem.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.671
So we looked into what was
a realistic target for us kids:

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:06.820
plastic bags.

00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:08.237
And the idea was born.

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:10.964
IW: We started researching,

00:02:10.988 --> 00:02:13.928
and let's just say, the more we learned,

00:02:13.952 --> 00:02:17.041
there was nothing good about plastic bags.

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:18.671
And you know what?

00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:20.273
We don't even need them.

00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:24.544
MW: We were really inspired
by the efforts to say no to plastic bags

00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:26.438
in many other places,

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:28.444
from Hawaii to Rwanda

00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:31.013
and to severals cities
like Oakland and Dublin.
