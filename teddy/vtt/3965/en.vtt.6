00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:01.656
And together with them,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.430
we started a multi-layered approach,

00:03:03.454 --> 00:03:06.750
based on an on- and off-line
signature petition,

00:03:06.774 --> 00:03:10.210
educational and inspirational
presentations at schools

00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:14.719
and we raise general awareness
at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups.

00:03:14.743 --> 00:03:15.894
And last but not least,

00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:17.964
we distribute alternative bags,

00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:19.712
bags like net bags,

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:21.058
recycled newspaper bags

00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:23.802
or 100 percent organic material bags,

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:26.339
all made by local
initiatives on the island.

00:03:26.898 --> 00:03:28.292
IW: We run a pilot village,

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:30.428
home of 800 families.
