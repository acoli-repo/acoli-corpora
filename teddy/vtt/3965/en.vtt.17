00:08:31.498 --> 00:08:36.115
IW: Also, at the International Airport
of Bali, one of our supporters

00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:40.701
is planning to start
a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.

00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:43.173
MW: Stop handing out free plastic bags

00:08:43.197 --> 00:08:44.893
and bring in your own reusable bag

00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:48.361
is our next message to change
that mindset of the public.

00:08:49.405 --> 00:08:51.102
IW: Our short-term campaign,

00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:52.558
"One Island / One Voice,"

00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:54.016
is all about this.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.719
We check and recognize
the shops and restaurants

00:08:56.743 --> 00:08:59.586
that have declared themselves
a plastic bag-free zone,

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.983
and we put this sticker at their entrance
