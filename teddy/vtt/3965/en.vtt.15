WEBVTT

00:07:29.162 --> 00:07:30.313
started.

00:07:30.337 --> 00:07:32.326
We used social media to support our goal

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.117
and already on day two,

00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:36.407
police started to come
to our home and school.

00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:38.921
What were these two girls doing?

00:07:39.466 --> 00:07:41.976
We knew we weren't making
the governor look his best

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.881
by doing this food strike --

00:07:43.905 --> 00:07:45.339
we could have gone to jail.

00:07:45.768 --> 00:07:47.697
But, hey, it worked.

00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:48.947
Twenty-four hours later,

00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:50.383
we were picked up from school

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:52.430
and escorted to the office
of the governor.

00:07:53.283 --> 00:07:54.796
MW: And there he was --

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.029
(Applause)

00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:58.983
waiting for us to meet and speak,

00:07:59.007 --> 00:08:01.557
being all supportive
and thankful for our willingness
