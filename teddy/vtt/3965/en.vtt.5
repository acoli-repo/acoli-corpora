and to severals cities
like Oakland and Dublin.

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:37.449
IW: And so the idea turned into the launch
of "Bye Bye Plastic Bags."

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.850
MW: In the years
that we have been campaigning,

00:02:40.874 --> 00:02:43.436
we have learned a lot.

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:45.626
Lesson number one:

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.391
you cannot do it all by yourself.

00:02:48.415 --> 00:02:50.607
You need a big team of like-minded kids,

00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:53.802
and so we formed
the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew.

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.574
The volunteer team includes
children from all over the island,

00:02:57.598 --> 00:02:59.997
from both international and local schools.
