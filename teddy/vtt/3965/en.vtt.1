00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:31.426
And when it comes to plastic bags,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.018
less than five percent gets recycled.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.206
MW: We know that changes the image
you may have of our island.

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.150
It changed ours, too,
when we learned about it,

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:45.735
when we learned that almost all
plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:47.009
and then in our rivers

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:48.404
and then in our ocean.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.364
And those that don't even
make it to the ocean,

00:00:51.388 --> 00:00:53.501
they're either burned or littered.

00:00:54.183 --> 00:00:56.441
IW: So we decided
to do something about it.

00:00:56.812 --> 00:00:59.311
And we've been working
for almost three years now

00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:02.687
to try to say no to plastic bags
on our home island.
