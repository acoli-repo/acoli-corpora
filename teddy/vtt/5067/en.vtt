You know that little pink thing nestled 
in the corner of your eye?

00:00:10.668 --> 00:00:13.998
It’s actually the remnant 
of a third eyelid.

00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:16.148
Known as the “plica semilunaris,”

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:19.368
it’s much more prominent in birds 
and a few mammals,

00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:24.455
and functions like a windshield wiper 
to keep dust and debris out of their eyes.

00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:26.805
But in humans, it doesn’t work.

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:31.482
It’s vestigial, meaning it no longer 
serves its original purpose.
