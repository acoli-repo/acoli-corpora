00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:01.252
Well, the obvious answer is people
tend to be attracted to each other

00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:03.093
the more time they spend together.

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:05.601
But there's another ingredient
that has to be added:

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:07.419
attraction tends to happen

00:03:07.443 --> 00:03:10.520
when there's work that demands
close collaboration.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.232
So imagine you have a big group project
with a tight deadline

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:17.832
and you're working late nights
and brainstorming ideas.

00:03:17.856 --> 00:03:19.543
You look up, and across the table,

00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:22.444
one of your colleagues throws out
a really great idea.

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:25.369
You may feel something,
and that's natural.

00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:27.487
We call this task interdependence.

00:03:27.487 --> 00:03:29.685
It's a ripe ground for attraction.

00:03:29.685 --> 00:03:33.192
The second reason why people at work
are attracted to each other
