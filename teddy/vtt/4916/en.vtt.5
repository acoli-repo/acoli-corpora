00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:30.471
Question four:

00:02:30.495 --> 00:02:32.693
I've just started seeing a coworker.

00:02:32.717 --> 00:02:34.162
How do we handle things?

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:35.440
I get this question a lot.

00:02:35.464 --> 00:02:37.592
"Are they dating? Are they not dating?"

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:38.862
Don't keep it a secret.

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:42.483
You don't have to make a big deal of it,
but secrecy tends to be corrosive.

00:02:42.507 --> 00:02:46.494
People tend to see workplace couples
as a coalition or a unit,

00:02:46.518 --> 00:02:50.284
so try to make it clear to your coworkers
that you're not the same person;

00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:53.178
you love each other,
but you are going to disagree.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.573
Question five:

00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:57.717
Why are coworkers
often attracted to each other?

00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:01.252
Well, the obvious answer is people
tend to be attracted to each other
