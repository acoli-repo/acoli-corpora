00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:30.537
Because then you're really
better off on Tinder.

00:00:30.537 --> 00:00:32.206
If you want to date your coworker

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:35.176
because you really, sincerely think
you're falling in love with them

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:39.530
or there's a real potential
for a long-term, committed relationship,

00:00:39.614 --> 00:00:41.462
maybe you should date your coworker.

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:44.243
Studies show that your coworkers
are generally positive about it

00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:46.478
if they perceive
that you're falling in love

00:00:46.502 --> 00:00:48.652
and genuinely care about each other.

00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:52.095
It's when your coworkers sense
that something else is in play --

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:53.513
that can be disruptive.

00:00:53.513 --> 00:00:54.701
Question two:

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:56.310
Should I date my boss?

00:00:56.384 --> 00:00:59.372
In almost all cases, no,
you should not date your boss,

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:02.009
because now, you've got a power dynamic.
