But my own research suggests
things are different

00:04:02.538 --> 00:04:06.793
for people who are watching
or who are subjected to the flirting.

00:04:06.817 --> 00:04:08.246
It can be awkward, right?

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.397
Witnessing flirtation in the workplace
creates a sense of not knowing the rules,

00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:14.207
not knowing what's going on,

00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:17.255
or maybe seeing something
that you shouldn't be seeing.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.899
People who frequently witness
flirting at work --

00:04:19.923 --> 00:04:22.953
they actually report feeling
less satisfied in their jobs,

00:04:22.977 --> 00:04:25.194
and they feel less valued
by their company.

00:04:25.218 --> 00:04:28.883
They're more likely to give a negative
appraisal of the work environment,

00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:30.631
and they may even consider leaving.
