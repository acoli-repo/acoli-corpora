00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:30.631
and they may even consider leaving.

00:04:30.655 --> 00:04:33.531
For women, this association
can be even stronger.

00:04:33.555 --> 00:04:34.912

00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:57.932
it's a little different.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.557
As much as people in HR
would love to wave a magic wand
