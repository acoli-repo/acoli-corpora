00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:33.533
They asked them to make recommendations
on which employee should get picked

00:01:33.557 --> 00:01:35.074
for a special training program

00:01:35.098 --> 00:01:37.542
and which should get promoted to partner.

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:40.368
They looked at credentials
for imaginary employees,

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:43.393
and when it was stated
that an employee had been dating

00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:46.053
or was in a relationship with a superior,

00:01:46.077 --> 00:01:50.622
the evaluators were less likely to pick
that person for the training program

00:01:50.646 --> 00:01:51.891
or the promotion,

00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:54.423
even if they had the exact
same credentials

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:57.032
as someone who wasn't dating their boss.

00:01:57.056 --> 00:02:00.551
The evaluators were also quick
to dismiss their accomplishments.
