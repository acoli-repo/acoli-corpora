My name is Sevidzem Ernestine Leikeki.

00:00:03.898 --> 00:00:07.486
I'm a climate activist
from the North-West Region of Cameroon.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.571
I focus on two things:

00:00:09.595 --> 00:00:11.006
caring for nature

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.116
and educating the next
generation to do the same.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.506
We can't fight the climate emergency

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.946
if we cannot protect
and regenerate our land.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.111
That's why my colleagues and I

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:24.626
at Cameroon Gender and Environment Watch

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.342
are dedicated to regenerating
the 20,000-hectare Kilum-Ijim Forest.
