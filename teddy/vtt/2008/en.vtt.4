For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:09.664
destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society.

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:13.364
Aware of the devastation and the challenges,

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:20.147
I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society,

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:23.639
calling for an inclusive and just transition

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.706
to democracy and national reconciliation.

00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:30.523
