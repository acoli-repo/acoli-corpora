WEBVTT

00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:02.989
a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life,

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.590
to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.740
and to lobby for our right

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.857
for equal participation in building democracy and peace.

00:03:14.857 --> 00:03:20.573
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections,

00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:24.557
an environment which was increasingly polarized,

00:03:24.557 --> 00:03:34.025
an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion.
