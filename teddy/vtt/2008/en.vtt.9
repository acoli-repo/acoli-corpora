00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:34.474
However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections,

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:38.206
and of the revolution as a whole,

00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:39.790
was fading out --

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.256
for every day we were waking up to the news of violence.

00:04:44.256 --> 00:04:46.490
One day we wake up to the news

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.962
of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs.

00:04:49.962 --> 00:04:51.757
On another day we wake up to the news

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:56.258
of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate.

00:04:56.258 --> 00:04:58.340
On another day we wake up to the news

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.857
of the assassination of army officers.
