00:05:28.447 --> 00:05:30.147
that we first held.

00:05:30.147 --> 00:05:34.257
Intolerance, exclusion and revenge

00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:39.289
became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution.

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.939
I am here today not at all to inspire you

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.123
with our success story of the zipper list and the elections.

00:05:48.123 --> 00:05:50.324
I'm rather here today to confess

00:05:50.324 --> 00:05:57.106
that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision.

00:05:57.106 --> 00:05:59.929
We did not prioritize right.

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:07.323
For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya.
