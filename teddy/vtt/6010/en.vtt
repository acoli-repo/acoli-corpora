I published this article

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.816
in the New York Times Modern Love column
in January of this year.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.176
"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This."

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.496
And the article
is about a psychological study

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.936
designed to create romantic love
in the laboratory,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.696
and my own experience
trying the study myself

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.576
one night last summer.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.336
So the procedure is fairly simple:

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.216
two strangers take turns asking each other
36 increasingly personal questions

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.136
and then they stare into each other's eyes
