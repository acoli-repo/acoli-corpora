00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.840
to turn corn sugar into polyester.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.318
It's 30 percent more efficient
than the fossil fuel method,

00:07:35.318 --> 00:07:38.977
and it's much better for the environment.

00:07:38.977 --> 00:07:40.382
Genetic engineering and bioengineering

00:07:40.382 --> 00:07:41.913
are creating a whole bunch

00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:43.671
of great new opportunities

00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.500
for chemistry, for computation, for memory.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.550
We will probably be doing a lot,
obviously doing health things,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.754
but we will probably be growing chairs

00:07:50.754 --> 00:07:51.794
and buildings soon.

00:07:51.794 --> 00:07:55.704
The problem is, Sorona costs
about 400 million dollars

00:07:55.704 --> 00:07:57.085
and took seven years to build.

00:07:57.085 --> 00:08:00.164
It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days.
