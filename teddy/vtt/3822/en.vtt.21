you're always going to have friends,

00:10:30.093 --> 00:10:32.052
and you can pull Wikipedia
up whenever you need it,

00:10:32.052 --> 00:10:35.500
and what you need to learn is how to learn.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.144
In the case of Safecast, a bunch of amateurs

00:10:38.144 --> 00:10:39.742
when we started three years ago,

00:10:39.742 --> 00:10:42.250
I would argue that we probably as a group

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.666
know more than any other organization

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:47.875
about how to collect data and publish data

00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:50.647
and do citizen science.

00:10:50.647 --> 00:10:51.767
Compass over maps.

00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:55.492
So this one, the idea is that the cost of writing a plan

00:10:55.492 --> 00:10:58.595
or mapping something is getting so expensive

00:10:58.595 --> 00:11:01.768
and it's not very accurate or useful.
