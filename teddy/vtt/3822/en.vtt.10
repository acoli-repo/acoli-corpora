00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:02.248
and creating products like
the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms.

00:05:02.248 --> 00:05:04.190
But today, with the ability

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.499
to deploy things into the real world at such low cost,

and not depending on large
institutions to do it for us.

00:05:28.098 --> 00:05:30.800
So last year, we sent a bunch
