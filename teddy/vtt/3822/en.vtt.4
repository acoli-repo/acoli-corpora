00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.009
somehow come together

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.193
and do what NGOs and the government

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.611
were completely incapable of doing?

00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:09.369
And I would suggest that this has something to do

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.129
with the Internet. It's not a fluke.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.980
It wasn't luck, and it wasn't because it was us.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.398
It helped that it was an event

00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:17.033
that pulled everybody together,

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:18.791
but it was a new way of doing things

00:02:18.791 --> 00:02:20.870
that was enabled by the Internet

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.462
and a lot of the other things that were going on,

00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:24.475
and I want to talk a little bit about

00:02:24.475 --> 00:02:27.144
what those new principles are.

00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:31.952
So remember before the Internet? (Laughter)
