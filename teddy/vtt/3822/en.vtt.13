My next fellow, I hope, is going to be

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.645
one of these innovators from Shenzhen.

00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:34.310
And so what you see is

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.279
that is pushing innovation to the edges.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.384

onto an electronics board.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.283
This is a factory in a box.

00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:56.781
So what used to take a factory full of workers

00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:57.800
working by hand

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.509
