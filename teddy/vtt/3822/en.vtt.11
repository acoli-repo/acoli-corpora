00:05:28.098 --> 00:05:30.800
So last year, we sent a bunch
of students to Shenzhen,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.380
and they sat on the factory floors

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.685
with the innovators in Shenzhen, and it was amazing.

00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:36.162
What was happening there

00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:38.346
was you would have these manufacturing devices,

00:05:38.346 --> 00:05:40.539
and they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints.

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.004
They were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment

00:05:43.004 --> 00:05:46.214
and innovating right on the
manufacturing equipment.

00:05:46.214 --> 00:05:48.100
The factory was in the designer,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.374
and the designer was literally in the factory.

00:05:50.374 --> 00:05:52.000
And so what you would do is,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.241
you'd go down to the stalls

00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:55.797
and you would see these cell phones.

00:05:55.797 --> 00:05:58.322
So instead of starting little websites

00:05:58.322 --> 00:05:59.870
like the kids in Palo Alto do,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.410
the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones.
