00:11:27.692 --> 00:11:30.110
and to me it's very similar to
agile software development,

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.468
but this idea of compasses is very important.

00:11:33.468 --> 00:11:35.409
So I think the good news is

00:11:35.409 --> 00:11:38.910
that even though the world is extremely complex,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.302
what you need to do is very simple.

00:11:41.302 --> 00:11:44.000
I think it's about stopping this notion

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.572
that you need to plan everything,

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:46.664
you need to stock everything,

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.134
and you need to be so prepared,

00:11:48.134 --> 00:11:51.128
and focus on being connected,

00:11:51.128 --> 00:11:52.979
always learning,

00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:54.840
fully aware,

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.620
and super present.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.566
So I don't like the word "futurist."

00:11:59.566 --> 00:12:05.181
I think we should be now-ists,
