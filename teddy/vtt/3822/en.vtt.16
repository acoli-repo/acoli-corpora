00:07:57.085 --> 00:08:00.164
It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days.

00:08:00.164 --> 00:08:02.656
The thing is, the cost of innovation

00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.242
in bioengineering is also going down.

00:08:04.242 --> 00:08:06.211
This is desktop gene sequencer.

00:08:06.211 --> 00:08:09.765
It used to cost millions and millions
of dollars to sequence genes.

00:08:09.765 --> 00:08:11.509
Now you can do it on a desktop like this,

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:13.602
and kids can do this in dorm rooms.

00:08:13.602 --> 00:08:16.290
This is Gen9 gene assembler,

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.369
and so right now when you try to print a gene,

00:08:18.369 --> 00:08:19.637
what you do is somebody in a factory

00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:21.577
with pipettes puts the thing together by hand,

00:08:21.577 --> 00:08:23.928
you have one error per 100 base pairs,

00:08:23.928 --> 00:08:26.504
and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money.

00:08:26.504 --> 00:08:27.890
This new device

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.564
assembles genes on a chip,

00:08:29.564 --> 00:08:31.713
and instead of one error per 100 base pairs,
