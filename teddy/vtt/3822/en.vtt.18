00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:01.444
and so this is a fundamental new
way of thinking about innovation.

00:09:01.444 --> 00:09:04.121
It's a bottom-up innovation, it's democratic,

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:06.325
it's chaotic, it's hard to control.

00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:08.632
It's not bad, but it's very different,

00:09:08.632 --> 00:09:10.599
and I think that the traditional rules that we have

00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:12.671
for institutions don't work anymore,

00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:14.350
and most of us here

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.433
operate with a different set of principles.

00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:20.269
One of my favorite principles is the power of pull,

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:22.560
which is the idea of pulling resources

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.326
from the network as you need them

00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:26.171
rather than stocking them in the center

00:09:26.171 --> 00:09:27.756
and controlling everything.

00:09:27.756 --> 00:09:30.520
So in the case of the Safecast story,
