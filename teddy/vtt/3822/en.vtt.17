00:08:29.564 --> 00:08:31.713
and instead of one error per 100 base pairs,

00:08:31.713 --> 00:08:33.839
it's one error per 10,000 base pairs.

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:36.584
In this lab, we will have the world's capacity

00:08:36.584 --> 00:08:38.687
of gene printing within a year,

00:08:38.687 --> 00:08:41.299
200 million base pairs a year.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.862
This is kind of like when we went

00:08:43.862 --> 00:08:46.123
from transistor radios wrapped by hand

00:08:46.123 --> 00:08:47.394
to the Pentium.

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:49.790
This is going to become the
Pentium of bioengineering,

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.826
pushing bioengineering into the hands

00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:54.427
of dorm rooms and startup companies.

00:08:54.427 --> 00:08:57.200
So it's happening in software and in hardware

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.163
and bioengineering,

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:01.444
and so this is a fundamental new
way of thinking about innovation.
