00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:30.008
And we all know this. We all know
this happened on the Internet.

00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:32.773
It turns out it's happening in other things, too.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:36.015
Let me give you some examples.

00:04:36.015 --> 00:04:38.800
So at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.842
We do all kinds of things.

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:41.727
We do biology, we do hardware,

00:04:41.727 --> 00:04:45.348
and Nicholas Negroponte
famously said, "Demo or die,"

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:47.070
as opposed to "Publish or perish,"

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.313
which was the traditional academic way of thinking.

00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:52.875
And he often said, the demo only has to work once,

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.691
because the primary mode of us impacting the world

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:57.469
was through large companies

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:58.732
being inspired by us

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:02.248
and creating products like
the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms.
