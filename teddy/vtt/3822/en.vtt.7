00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.674
from V.C.s or big companies,

00:03:31.674 --> 00:03:33.787
and then you'd hire the designers and the engineers,

00:03:33.787 --> 00:03:34.810
and they'd build the thing.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.429
This is the Before Internet, B.I., innovation model.

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:41.736
What happened after the Internet was

00:03:41.736 --> 00:03:43.492
the cost of innovation went down so much

00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:45.979
because the cost of collaboration,
the cost of distribution,

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.622
the cost of communication, and Moore's Law

00:03:48.622 --> 00:03:51.298
made it so that the cost of trying a new thing

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:52.692
became nearly zero,

00:03:52.692 --> 00:03:54.961
and so you would have Google, Facebook, Yahoo,

00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:56.732
students that didn't have permission —

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:58.105
permissionless innovation —

00:03:58.105 --> 00:03:59.725
didn't have permission, didn't have PowerPoints,

00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:01.828
they just built the thing,
