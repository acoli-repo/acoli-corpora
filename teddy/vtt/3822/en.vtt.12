00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.410
the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.107
They make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto

00:06:05.107 --> 00:06:06.365
make websites,

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.478
and so there's a rainforest

00:06:08.478 --> 00:06:10.034
of innovation going on in the cell phone.

00:06:10.034 --> 00:06:11.634
What they do is, they make a cell phone,

00:06:11.634 --> 00:06:13.858
go down to the stall, they sell some,

00:06:13.858 --> 00:06:16.183
they look at the other kids' stuff, go up,

00:06:16.183 --> 00:06:18.774
make a couple thousand more, go down.

00:06:18.774 --> 00:06:20.765
Doesn't this sound like a software thing?

00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:22.412
It sounds like agile software development,

00:06:22.412 --> 00:06:25.340
A/B testing and iteration,

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.423
and what we thought you could only do with software

00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:29.693
kids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware.

00:06:29.693 --> 00:06:31.160
My next fellow, I hope, is going to be
