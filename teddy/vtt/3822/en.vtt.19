00:09:27.756 --> 00:09:30.520
So in the case of the Safecast story,

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.362
I didn't know anything when
the earthquake happened,

00:09:32.362 --> 00:09:33.990
but I was able to find Sean

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.186
who was the hackerspace community organizer,

00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:37.972
and Peter, the analog hardware hacker

00:09:37.972 --> 00:09:39.688
who made our first Geiger counter,

00:09:39.688 --> 00:09:41.686
and Dan, who built the Three Mile Island

00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:45.020
monitoring system after the
Three Mile Island meltdown.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.406
And these people I wouldn't have been able to find

00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:49.840
beforehand and probably were better

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.967
that I found them just in time from the network.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.834
I'm a three-time college dropout,

00:09:54.834 --> 00:09:56.507
so learning over education

00:09:56.507 --> 00:09:57.932
is very near and dear to my heart,

00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:00.456
but to me, education is what people do to you
