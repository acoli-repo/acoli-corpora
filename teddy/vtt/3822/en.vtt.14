WEBVTT

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:00.559
she's able to have effectively —

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:02.192
She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen

00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:03.436
to do this manufacturing.

00:07:03.436 --> 00:07:05.697
She can buy this box and she can manufacture it.

00:07:05.697 --> 00:07:07.940
So manufacturing, the cost of innovation,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.630
the cost of prototyping, distribution,
manufacturing, hardware,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.093
is getting so low

00:07:12.093 --> 00:07:14.410
that innovation is being pushed to the edges

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.838
and students and startups are being able to build it.

00:07:16.838 --> 00:07:18.716
This is a recent thing, but this will happen

00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:20.199
and this will change

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:22.624
just like it did with software.

00:07:22.624 --> 00:07:25.870
Sorona is a DuPont process

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.890
that uses a genetically engineered microbe

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.840
to turn corn sugar into polyester.
