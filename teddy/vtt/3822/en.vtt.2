00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:01.430
which was to go onto the Internet

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.772
and try to figure out

00:01:02.772 --> 00:01:05.183
if I could take matters into my own hands.

00:01:05.183 --> 00:01:07.024
On the Net, I found there were a lot of other people

00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:09.090
like me trying to figure out what was going on,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.306
and together we sort of loosely formed a group

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:13.777
and we called it Safecast,

00:01:13.777 --> 00:01:14.949
and we decided we were going to try

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.695
to measure the radiation

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:18.469
and get the data out to everybody else,

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.141
because it was clear that the government

00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:23.043
wasn't going to be doing this for us.

00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:24.460
Three years later,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.554
we have 16 million data points,

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.299
we have designed our own Geiger counters
