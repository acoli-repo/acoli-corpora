00:00:00.543 --> 00:00:03.286
On March 10, 2011,

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:06.293
I was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab

00:00:06.293 --> 00:00:09.522
meeting with faculty, students and staff,

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:11.311
and we were trying to figure out whether

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.671
I should be the next director.

00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:16.040
That night, at midnight,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.810
a magnitude 9 earthquake

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.676
hit off of the Pacific coast of Japan.

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:22.961
My wife and family were in Japan,

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:26.271
and as the news started to come in,

00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:27.970
I was panicking.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.232
I was looking at the news streams

00:00:29.232 --> 00:00:32.060
and listening to the press conferences
