00:00:29.232 --> 00:00:32.060
and listening to the press conferences

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.270
of the government officials

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.860
and the Tokyo Power Company,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.411
and hearing about this explosion

00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:39.610
at the nuclear reactors

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.291
and this cloud of fallout

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.190
that was headed towards our house

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.089
which was only about 200 kilometers away.

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.920
And the people on TV weren't telling us

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.860
anything that we wanted to hear.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.820
I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.242
what was going on with the radiation,

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.570
whether my family was in danger.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.759
So I did what instinctively felt like the right thing,

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:01.430
which was to go onto the Internet
