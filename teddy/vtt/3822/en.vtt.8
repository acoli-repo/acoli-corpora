00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:01.828
they just built the thing,

00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:03.272
then they raised the money,

00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:05.473
and then they sort of figured out a business plan

00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:07.830
and maybe later on they hired some MBAs.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.141
So the Internet caused innovation,

00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:11.265
at least in software and services,

00:04:11.265 --> 00:04:14.124
to go from an MBA-driven innovation model

00:04:14.124 --> 00:04:18.027
to a designer-engineer-driven innovation model,

00:04:18.027 --> 00:04:20.125
and it pushed innovation to the edges,

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:21.671
to the dorm rooms, to the startups,

00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:23.357
away from the large institutions,

00:04:23.357 --> 00:04:25.712
the stodgy old institutions that had the power

00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:27.399
and the money and the authority.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:30.008
And we all know this. We all know
this happened on the Internet.
