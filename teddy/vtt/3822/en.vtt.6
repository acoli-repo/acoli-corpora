00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:01.467
and what we found was that in this

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:04.080
completely unpredictable world

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.112
that most of the people who were surviving

00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:09.445
were working with sort of a different set of principles,

00:03:09.445 --> 00:03:12.076
and I want to talk a little bit about that.

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:13.440
Before the Internet, if you remember,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.345
when we tried to create services,

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:16.371
what you would do is you'd create

00:03:16.371 --> 00:03:18.683
the hardware layer and the
network layer and the software

00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:20.711
and it would cost millions of dollars

00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.018
to do anything that was substantial.

00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:25.457
So when it costs millions of dollars
to do something substantial,

00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:27.529
what you would do is you'd get an MBA

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:28.987
who would write a plan

00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:29.930
and get the money

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.674
from V.C.s or big companies,
