00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.299
we have designed our own Geiger counters

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.952
that you can download the designs

00:01:31.952 --> 00:01:32.826
and plug it into the network.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.730
We have an app that shows you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.757
most of the radiation in Japan
and other parts of the world.

00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:39.962
We are arguably one of the most successful

00:01:39.962 --> 00:01:41.817
citizen science projects in the world,

00:01:41.817 --> 00:01:44.169
and we have created

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:47.670
the largest open dataset of radiation measurements.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.412
And the interesting thing here

00:01:50.412 --> 00:01:55.060
is how did — (Applause) — Thank you.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.151
How did a bunch of amateurs

00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:59.320
who really didn't know what we were doing

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.009
somehow come together
