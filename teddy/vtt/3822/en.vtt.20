00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:00.456
but to me, education is what people do to you

00:10:00.456 --> 00:10:03.455
and learning is what you do to yourself.

00:10:03.455 --> 00:10:07.231
(Applause)

00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:08.990
And it feels like, and I'm biased,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.787
it feels like they're trying to make you memorize

00:10:11.787 --> 00:10:14.901
the whole encyclopedia before
they let you go out and play,

00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:18.998
and to me, I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone,

00:10:18.998 --> 00:10:20.701
and it feels like they assume

00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:22.488
you're going to be on top of some mountain

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:24.949
all by yourself with a number 2 pencil

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:26.332
trying to figure out what to do

00:10:26.332 --> 00:10:28.448
when in fact you're always going to be connected,

00:10:28.448 --> 00:10:30.093
you're always going to have friends,
