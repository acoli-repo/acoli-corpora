00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:31.952
So remember before the Internet? (Laughter)

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:33.740
I call this B.I. Okay?

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.351
So, in B.I., life was simple.

00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.097
Things were Euclidian, Newtonian,

00:02:40.097 --> 00:02:41.556
somewhat predictable.

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:43.966
People actually tried to predict the future,

00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:45.680
even the economists.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.894
And then the Internet happened,

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:50.965
and the world became extremely complex,

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:53.602
extremely low-cost, extremely fast,

00:02:53.602 --> 00:02:55.720
and those Newtonian laws

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.519
that we so dearly cherished

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.716
turned out to be just local ordinances,

00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:01.467
and what we found was that in this
