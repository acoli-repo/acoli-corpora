In fact, it is a step counter,
and it counts the steps.

00:06:30.468 --> 00:06:31.976
It's a binary step counter.

00:06:32.587 --> 00:06:35.630
So as soon it has been to the sea,

00:06:35.654 --> 00:06:40.807
it changes the pattern
of zeroes and ones here.

00:06:43.291 --> 00:06:45.894
And it always knows
where it is on the beach.

00:06:45.918 --> 00:06:48.257
So it's very simple brain.

00:06:48.654 --> 00:06:52.456
It says, well, there's the sea,
there are dunes, and I'm here.

00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:58.229
So it's a sort of imagination
of the simple world of the beach animal.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:06:59.959
Thank you.
