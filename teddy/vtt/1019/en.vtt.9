00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:33.976
There's a guy pushing there, behind,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.976
but it can also walk
on the wind very well.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.623
It's 3.2 tons.

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:48.793
This is working on the stored
wind in the bottles.

00:04:48.817 --> 00:04:52.785
It has a feeler, where it can
feel obstacles and turn around.

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.572
You see, it's going the other way.
