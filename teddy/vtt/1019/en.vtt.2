Narrator: The mechanical beasts
will not get their energy from food,

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:09.182
but from the wind.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.381
The wind will move feathers on their back,
which will drive their feet.

00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:17.729
The beast walks sideways
on the wet sand of the beach,

00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:20.044
with its nose pointed into the wind.

00:01:21.904 --> 00:01:26.712
As soon as it walks into
either the rolling surf or the dry sand,

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:30.062
it stops, and walks
in the opposite direction.
