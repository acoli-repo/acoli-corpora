Theo Jansen is working hard

Theo Jansen: I want to put
these forms of life on the beaches.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.976
And they should survive over there,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.637
on their own, in the future.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.904
Learning to live on their own --

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:59.555
