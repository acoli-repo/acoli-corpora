00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.442
So, the proportion of the tubes in this
animal is very important for the walking.

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:36.078
There are 11 numbers,
which I call The 11 Holy Numbers.

00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:40.976
These are the distances of the tubes
which make it walk that way.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.976
In fact, it's a new
invention of the wheel.

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:45.976
It works the same as a wheel.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.467
The axis of a wheel
stays on the same level,

00:03:49.491 --> 00:03:52.583
and this hip is staying
on the same level as well.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.503
In fact, this is better than a wheel,

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:59.976
because when you try to drive
your bicycle on the beach,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.361
you will notice it's very hard to do.
