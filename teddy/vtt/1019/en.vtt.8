you will notice it's very hard to do.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:08.665
And the feet just step over the sand,

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.268
and the wheel has to touch every piece
of the ground in-between.

00:04:13.228 --> 00:04:17.149
So 5,000 years after
the invention of the wheel,

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:18.450
we have a new wheel.

00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:20.976
I will show you, in the next video --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.474
can you start it, please? --

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:28.491
that very heavy loads can be moved.
