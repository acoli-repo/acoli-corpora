And it must feel the water of the sea.

00:05:30.842 --> 00:05:32.976
And this is the water feeler,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.980
and what's very important is this tube.

00:05:35.693 --> 00:05:39.976
It sucks in air normally,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.082
but when it swallows water,
it feels the resistance of it.

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:48.436
So, imagine that the animal
is walking towards the sea.

00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:54.999
As soon as it touches the water --

00:05:55.023 --> 00:06:01.611
you should hear a sound of running air.
