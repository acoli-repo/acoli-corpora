00:00:01.538 --> 00:00:04.871
You know those awkward icebreaker games,

00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:07.788
when everyone goes around
and answers something

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:11.746
like, "What's your favorite superpower?"

00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:16.079
When I was a kid, I loved those games.

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:18.621
I believed I had the perfect answer.

00:00:18.663 --> 00:00:21.079
People would start sharing
and I would wait,

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.954
bouncing in my seat with excitement.

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:24.413
And when it was my turn,

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:28.413
I would proudly tell everyone,
"The superpower I want most of all

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:33.871
is to see people's emotions in color,
hovering in the air around them."
