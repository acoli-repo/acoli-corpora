00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:03.305
is that we were seeing
this movie the other day,

00:10:03.329 --> 00:10:07.221
and it was about one of the astronauts,
one of your colleagues,

00:10:07.245 --> 00:10:10.213
and before he went up into space,

00:10:10.237 --> 00:10:14.396
they actually wrote an obituary,
NASA wrote an obituary for him.

00:10:14.792 --> 00:10:16.642
And I was like, is that normal?

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:18.602
And is that part of the job?

00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:24.160
Do you think about that peril
that you're putting yourself in

00:10:24.184 --> 00:10:25.478
as you go into space?

00:10:25.502 --> 00:10:26.800
LM: Yeah.

00:10:26.824 --> 00:10:29.078
So, I don't remember anyone
writing my obituary,

00:10:29.102 --> 00:10:31.713
maybe that was an Apollo-day thing.
