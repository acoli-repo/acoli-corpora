00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:31.522
was: "One small step for a man,
one giant leap for mankind."

00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:34.882
Neil [Armstrong] and Buzz Aldrin
were walking on the Moon.

00:00:35.308 --> 00:00:39.149
And I was five years old
in Lynchburg, Virginia,

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:42.493
a skinny black kid
in a kind of somewhat racist town.

00:00:43.303 --> 00:00:47.469
And I was trying to figure out
what I was going to do with my life.

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.732
And my parents, you know,
they were educators,

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:52.790
they'd said that you can do anything.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:56.106
But after that moon landing,
all the kids in the neighborhood

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.264
were like, "You're going to be
an astronaut?"

00:00:58.288 --> 00:00:59.490
I'm like, "No."

00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:02.713
I don't want a buzz cut,
and I don't see someone who looks like me.
