00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.594
grabbed out this big module,

00:05:31.618 --> 00:05:35.044
and I used the robotic arm
and I attached it to the space station.

00:05:35.962 --> 00:05:39.788
And the European team have been waiting
10 years for this thing to get installed,

00:05:39.812 --> 00:05:44.386
so I'm sure everyone in Europe was like,
"Leland! Leland! Leland!"

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.800
(Laughter)

00:05:45.824 --> 00:05:49.402
And so this moment happened,
this was our primary mission objective,

00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:50.576
it was done.

00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:53.863
And I had this big sigh of relief.

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.355
But then, Peggy Whitson,
the first female commander,

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.435
she invited us over
to the Russian segment.
