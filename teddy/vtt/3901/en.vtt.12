00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.435
she invited us over
to the Russian segment.

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:03.308
And the space station's
about the size of a football field,

00:06:03.332 --> 00:06:06.863
with solar panel and trusses
and all of these modules.

00:06:07.427 --> 00:06:10.491
And she says, "Leland, you go get
the rehydrated vegetables,

00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:11.729
we have the meat."

00:06:11.753 --> 00:06:15.522
So we float over with the bag
of vegetables, all rehydrated,

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:16.696
and we get there.

00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:18.789
And there's this moment

00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:23.133
where I get [transported]
back to my mother's kitchen.

00:06:23.157 --> 00:06:25.856
You can smell the beef
and barley heating up,

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.633
you can smell the food, the colors,

00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:32.554
and there are people there
from all around the world.
