00:08:57.221 --> 00:09:01.709
And so when I look up to space now,

00:09:01.733 --> 00:09:05.474
and I have this newfound perspective

00:09:05.498 --> 00:09:08.685
on the space station going overhead
and looking there,

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:10.501
and then looking back at my community

00:09:10.525 --> 00:09:13.724
and seeing the people
that I'm living and working with,

00:09:13.748 --> 00:09:15.843
and coexisting with,

00:09:15.867 --> 00:09:21.792
I think it's something that we all
can do now, especially in these times,

00:09:21.816 --> 00:09:25.538
to make sure that we have
the right perspective.

00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:27.660
Thank you.
