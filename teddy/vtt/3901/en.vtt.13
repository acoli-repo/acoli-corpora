00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:32.554
and there are people there
from all around the world.

00:06:32.578 --> 00:06:34.165
It's like a Benetton commercial,

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:38.149
you know, you have African American,
Asian American, French, German, Russian,

00:06:38.173 --> 00:06:39.498
the first female commander,

00:06:39.522 --> 00:06:43.317
breaking bread at 17,500 miles per hour,

00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:45.667
going around the planet every 90 minutes,

00:06:45.691 --> 00:06:48.597
seeing a sunrise and a sunset every 45.

00:06:49.127 --> 00:06:51.754
And Peggy would say,
"Hey, Leland, try some of this,"

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:53.579
and she'd float it over to my mouth,

00:06:53.603 --> 00:06:55.832
and I'd catch it
and we'd go back and forth.

00:06:55.856 --> 00:07:01.015
And we're doing all of this while
listening to Sade's "Smooth Operator."
