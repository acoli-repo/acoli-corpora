WEBVTT

00:06:55.856 --> 00:07:01.015
And we're doing all of this while
listening to Sade's "Smooth Operator."

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.040
(Laughter)

00:07:02.064 --> 00:07:04.459
I mean, this is like
blowing my mind, you know.

00:07:04.483 --> 00:07:05.578
(Laughter)

00:07:05.602 --> 00:07:09.022
And I float over to the window,
and I look down at the planet,

00:07:09.046 --> 00:07:12.078
and I see all of humanity.

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:15.221
And my perspective changes at that moment,

00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:18.124
because, I'm flying over Lynchburg,
Virginia, my home town,

00:07:18.148 --> 00:07:20.134
and my family's probably breaking bread.

00:07:20.158 --> 00:07:22.721
And five minutes later,
we're flying over Paris,

00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:25.348
where Leo Eyharts
is looking down at his parents,

00:07:25.372 --> 00:07:27.173
probably having some wine and cheese,

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.061
and Yuri's looking off to Moscow,

00:07:29.085 --> 00:07:31.630
and they're probably eating
borscht or something else.
