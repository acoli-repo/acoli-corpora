00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.079
In 1969, I was standing behind

00:00:09.103 --> 00:00:11.976
a Sylvania black-and-white television set.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.800
Hearing about these things happening
on the set in the front,

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:16.975
I was the guy, you know,

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.110
moving the rabbit ears
for my dad, and my sister and my mom.

00:00:20.134 --> 00:00:23.629
"Move over here, turn over here,
move this way, we can't see the screen."

00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:26.252
And what they were watching

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:31.522
was: "One small step for a man,
one giant leap for mankind."
