00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:31.213
(Laughter)

00:03:31.237 --> 00:03:32.975
And so I knew I could be a chemist.

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.420
So as I went on this journey
through a high school,

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:37.046
and I went to college,

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.189
and I got a football scholarship
to play football in college.

00:03:40.213 --> 00:03:43.721
And I knew that I could be a chemist,
because I'd already blown stuff up.

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:45.379
(Laughter)

00:03:45.403 --> 00:03:48.784
And when I graduated,

00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:51.382
I got drafted to the Detroit Lions.

00:03:51.406 --> 00:03:53.612
But I pulled a hamstring in training camp,

00:03:53.636 --> 00:03:56.993
and so what every former NFL player does,
they go work for NASA, right?

00:03:57.017 --> 00:03:58.311
So I went to work for NASA.

00:03:58.335 --> 00:03:59.336
(Laughter)

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.453
And this friend of mine said,
"Leland, you'd be great astronaut."
