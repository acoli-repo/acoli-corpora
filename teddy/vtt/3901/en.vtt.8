00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.453
And this friend of mine said,
"Leland, you'd be great astronaut."

00:04:02.477 --> 00:04:05.361
I just laughed at him,
I was like, "Yeah, me, an astronaut?"

00:04:05.385 --> 00:04:07.805
You know that Neil and Buzz
thing from back in '69?

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.396
And he handed me an application,
and I looked at it,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.682
and I didn't fill it out.

00:04:11.706 --> 00:04:16.665
And that same year, another friend of mine
filled out the application

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.839
and he got in.

00:04:18.372 --> 00:04:19.772
And I said to myself,

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.951
"If NASA's letting knuckleheads
like that be astronauts,"

00:04:23.975 --> 00:04:25.149
(Laughter)

00:04:25.173 --> 00:04:26.578
"maybe I can be one, too."

00:04:26.602 --> 00:04:30.309
So the next selection, I filled out
the application, and I got in.
