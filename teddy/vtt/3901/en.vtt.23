You did touch on something
that was very powerful and difficult,

00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:34.472
which is, you spoke about this incident

00:11:34.496 --> 00:11:37.020
that had happened to you
when you were five years old,

00:11:37.044 --> 00:11:38.225
and that you were raped.

00:11:38.249 --> 00:11:41.451
And I just think that
for you to be able to say those things,

00:11:41.475 --> 00:11:43.602
you know, on the TED stage,

00:11:43.626 --> 00:11:46.308
to be able to talk about that at all,

00:11:46.332 --> 00:11:48.268
is pretty fearless.

00:11:48.292 --> 00:11:51.157
And I wanted to get a sense from you,

00:11:51.181 --> 00:11:55.428
is that something that you think
is important for you to share that now,

00:11:55.452 --> 00:11:56.895
to speak about it?

00:11:56.919 --> 00:12:01.047
LM: It's so important, especially for men,
to talk about things that have happened,
