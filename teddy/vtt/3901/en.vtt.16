00:07:58.475 --> 00:08:01.459
to think about myself
of being an astronaut,

00:08:01.483 --> 00:08:04.514
if my father hadn't taken us on a journey

00:08:04.538 --> 00:08:08.399
in this radical craft that we built
with our own two hands.

00:08:10.016 --> 00:08:12.230
When I came home,

00:08:12.254 --> 00:08:16.952
I realized that perspective is something

00:08:16.976 --> 00:08:19.421
that we all get and we all have.

00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:22.673
It's just how far
do we open up our blinders

00:08:22.697 --> 00:08:25.244
to see that shift and that change.

00:08:25.903 --> 00:08:27.702
And going back to the space station,

00:08:27.726 --> 00:08:32.549
I think of, you know, Germans
and Russians fighting Americans.
