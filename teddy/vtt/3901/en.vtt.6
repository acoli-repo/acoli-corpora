00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:15.815
And I suppressed all that negativity,

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.005
all that trauma,

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.469

00:03:24.648 --> 00:03:25.811
(Laughter)

00:03:25.835 --> 00:03:29.728
where I created the most incredible
explosion in her living room.

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:31.213
(Laughter)
