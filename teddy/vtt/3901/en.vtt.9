00:04:26.602 --> 00:04:30.309
So the next selection, I filled out
the application, and I got in.

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:34.142
And I didn't know
what it meant to be an astronaut:

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:36.745
the training, the simulations,

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:39.839
all these things to get you ready
for this countdown:

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.863
three, two, one, liftoff.

00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:47.877
And in 2007, I was in Space Shuttle
"Atlantis," careening off the planet,

00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:51.435
traveling at 17,500 miles per hour.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.800
And eight and a half minutes later,

00:04:53.824 --> 00:04:57.151
the main engines cut off,
and we're now floating in space.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:00.472
And I push off
and float over to the window,
