In the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana

00:00:05.098 --> 00:00:07.809
had a very successful perfume business.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:10.066

00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:18.282
for murdering 600 men. You see, it wasn't a very good perfume.

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:22.148
In fact, it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless,

00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:25.472
but as a poison, it was the best money could buy,

00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:29.265
so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:34.525
It turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group,
