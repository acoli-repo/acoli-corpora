00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:02.476
From the standpoint of human geography,

00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:06.236
why we live where we live in the world,

00:00:06.276 --> 00:00:11.996
it's actually driven by a fairly
categorically organized set of variables.

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:16.036
Those variables are colliding,
but you can actually segment them.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.676
Demographic imbalances:
the gap between young and old.

00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:22.956
Young people move to countries
where wealthy aging populations need them.

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:24.836
That's been happening for generations.

00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:27.596
Political upheaval: civil wars,
international conflicts,

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:29.356
such as we're witnessing right now,

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:32.156
but of course, the 20th century
had a lot of these as well.
