00:00:59.237 --> 00:01:03.214
And to do this, we conducted a study
amongst 1,200 Americans

00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:05.388
representative of the US census,

00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:07.936
in which we asked a battery
of attitudinal questions

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.761
around robotics and AI

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:13.158
and also captured behavioral ones
around technology adoption.

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:15.296
We had a big study

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.297
so that we could analyze
differences in gender and generations,

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:20.289
between religious and political beliefs,

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:23.082
even job function and personality trait.

00:01:23.106 --> 00:01:26.609
It is a fascinating,
time-bound time capsule

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:28.299
of our human frailty

00:01:28.323 --> 00:01:30.909
in this predawn of the robotic era.
