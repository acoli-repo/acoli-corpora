00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:31.809
and a robot AI package deliverer,

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:34.459
so Dyson and Amazon, you guys should talk.

00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:36.396
There's an opportunity there.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.380
It seems we're ready to off-load
our chores to our robot friends.

00:02:40.404 --> 00:02:43.419
We're kind of definitely on the fence
when it comes to services,

00:02:43.443 --> 00:02:47.213

or a financial adviser, maybe.

00:02:47.237 --> 00:02:50.022

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:53.862
So from this, you'd go,

00:02:53.886 --> 00:02:55.339
"It's OK, Lucy, you know what?

00:02:55.363 --> 00:02:58.418
Go back to sleep, stop worrying,
the humans win in the end."

00:02:58.442 --> 00:02:59.664
But actually not so fast.

00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:01.410
If you look at my data very closely,
