00:05:28.776 --> 00:05:30.721
And lest you needed any more convincing,

00:05:30.745 --> 00:05:33.553
here is the generation's
"excitement level with AI."

00:05:33.577 --> 00:05:36.917
So not surprisingly,
the youngest of us are more excited.

00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:41.307
But, and possibly the most
paradoxical finding of my career,

00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:44.331
when I asked these people my 3am question,

00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:45.822
"Who wins in the end?"

00:05:46.188 --> 00:05:47.338
Guess what.

00:05:47.736 --> 00:05:49.974
The more excited you are
about AI and robotics,

00:05:49.998 --> 00:05:52.683
the more likely you are to say
it's the robots.

00:05:53.347 --> 00:05:56.879
And I don't think we need a neural net
running pattern-recognition software

00:05:56.903 --> 00:05:58.608
to see where this is all headed.

00:05:58.632 --> 00:06:01.337
We are the proverbial frogs
in boiling water.
