00:03:57.587 --> 00:04:00.998
to believe that getting
into an autonomous car is a good idea,

00:04:01.022 --> 00:04:03.839
that uploading your brain
for posterity is fun,

00:04:03.863 --> 00:04:07.585
and two and a half times more likely
to believe that becoming a cyborg is cool,

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.288
and for this, I blame Hollywood.

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:10.608
(Laughter)

00:04:10.632 --> 00:04:13.228
And this is where I want you
to look around the theater

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:16.609
and know that one in four men
are OK with the idea of sex with a robot.

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:19.770
That goes up to 44 percent
of millennial men

00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:21.388
compared to just one in 10 women,

00:04:21.412 --> 00:04:24.801
which I think puts a whole new twist
on the complaint of mechanical sex.

00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:26.793
(Laughter)

00:04:26.817 --> 00:04:29.246
Even more astounding
than that though, to be honest,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.840
is this behavioral difference.
