or uploading your brain

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:06.942
And we plotted people's comfort levels
with these various scenarios.

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:08.696
There were actually 31 in the study,

but for ease, I'm going to show you
just a few of them here.

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:15.188
The first thing you'll notice,

00:02:15.212 --> 00:02:18.021

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.793
And that's the idea
