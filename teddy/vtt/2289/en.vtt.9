00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.840
is this behavioral difference.

00:04:30.864 --> 00:04:35.077
So here we have people who have
a device with a voice assistant in it,

00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:37.847
so a smart speaker,
a home hub or a smart phone,

00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:39.593
versus those who don't.

00:04:39.617 --> 00:04:41.117
And you can see from this graph

00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:44.864
that the Trojan horse
is already in our living room.

00:04:44.888 --> 00:04:46.975
And as these devices proliferate

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:50.216
and our collective defenses soften,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.237
we all see how it can end.

00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:54.650
In fact, this may be as good
a time as any to admit

00:04:54.674 --> 00:04:57.080
I did take my Alexa Dot
on vacation with me.

00:04:58.192 --> 00:05:00.343
Final finding I have time for
is generational.
