00:00:27.874 --> 00:00:30.687
and the oldest, a robust 99,

00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:31.863
then together,

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:36.061
our collective consciousnesses
span just 185 years.

00:00:36.593 --> 00:00:39.959
That is a myopic pinprick of time

00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:43.475
when you think of the evolution
and the story of life on this planet.

00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:45.737
Turns out we're all in the cheap seats

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:48.753
and none of us will live to see
how it all pans out.

00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:51.125
So at my company,
we wanted a way around this.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.887
We wanted to see if there was
a way to cantilever out,

00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:56.919
beyond our fixed temporal vantage point,

00:00:56.943 --> 00:00:59.213
to get a sense of how it all shakes up.

00:00:59.237 --> 00:01:03.214
And to do this, we conducted a study
amongst 1,200 Americans
