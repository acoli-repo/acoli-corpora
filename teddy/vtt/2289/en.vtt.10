00:04:58.192 --> 00:05:00.343
Final finding I have time for
is generational.

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:02.922
So look at the difference
just three generations make.

00:05:02.946 --> 00:05:06.101
This is the leap from silent
to boomer to millennial.

00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:09.370
And what's more fascinating than this
is if you extrapolate this out,

00:05:09.394 --> 00:05:10.609
the same rate of change,

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:11.823
just the same pace,

00:05:11.847 --> 00:05:14.682
not the accelerated one
I actually believe will be the case,

00:05:14.706 --> 00:05:15.881
the same pace,

00:05:15.905 --> 00:05:17.602
then it is eight generations away

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:19.966
when we hear every single American

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.371
thinking the majority
of these things here are normal.

00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:26.434
So the year 2222 is an astounding place

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:28.752
where everything here is mainstream.

00:05:28.776 --> 00:05:30.721
And lest you needed any more convincing,
