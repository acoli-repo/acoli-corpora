had in fact, just like me
to get here to Vancouver,

00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:31.212
flown commercial.

00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:33.291
Lest you think everybody
was scared, though,

00:03:33.315 --> 00:03:35.450

flipping the ambivalent middle
can change the game.

00:03:52.644 --> 00:03:54.963
Another reason I know
we're vulnerable is men --

00:03:54.987 --> 00:03:57.563
I'm sorry, but men,

00:03:57.587 --> 00:04:00.998
to believe that getting
