00:01:28.323 --> 00:01:30.909
in this predawn of the robotic era.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.498
And I have five minutes
to tell you about it.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.839
The first thing you should know
is that we brainstormed

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:43.090
a list of scenarios
of current and potential AI robotics.

00:01:43.693 --> 00:01:46.235
They ran the spectrum from the mundane,

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.235
so, a robot house cleaner, anyone?

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.561
Through to the mischievous,

00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:52.680
the idea of a robot pet sitter,
or maybe a robot lawyer,

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:54.237
or maybe a sex partner.

00:01:54.553 --> 00:01:57.474
Through to the downright macabre,
the idea of being a cyborg,

00:01:57.498 --> 00:01:58.791
blending human and robot,

00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:02.696
or uploading your brain
so it could live on after your death.
