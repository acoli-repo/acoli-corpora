00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:30.760
That's because when it comes to food,

00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:34.931
the brain evolved to pay special attention
to new or different tastes.

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:36.061
Why?

00:03:36.085 --> 00:03:37.245
Two reasons:

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.785
first, to detect food that's gone bad.

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.729
And second, because the more variety
we have in our diet,

00:03:42.753 --> 00:03:45.852
the more likely we are
to get all the nutrients we need.

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:47.227
To keep that variety up,

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:49.639
we need to be able
to recognize a new food,

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:53.520
and more importantly, we need
to want to keep eating new foods.

00:03:53.544 --> 00:03:57.343
And that's why the dopamine levels off
when a food becomes boring.

00:03:57.367 --> 00:03:58.942
Now, back to that meal.

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:02.068
