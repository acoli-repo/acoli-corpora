00:02:28.754 --> 00:02:30.979
to deal with the extra sugar
you're eating.

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:34.539
The major currency
of our reward system is dopamine,

00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:37.129
an important chemical or neurotransmitter.

00:02:37.153 --> 00:02:39.660
There are many dopamine
receptors in the forebrain,

00:02:39.684 --> 00:02:41.816
but they're not evenly distributed.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.624
Certain areas contain dense
clusters of receptors,

00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:48.311
and these dopamine hot spots
are a part of our reward system.

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:51.549
Drugs like alcohol, nicotine, or heroin

00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:53.342
send dopamine into overdrive,

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:56.425
leading some people
to constantly seek that high,

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.170
in other words, to be addicted.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:03.532
Sugar also causes dopamine to be released,
though not as violently as drugs.
