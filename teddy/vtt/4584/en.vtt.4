00:01:57.607 --> 00:02:00.710
are just a few examples
of things and experiences

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:03.277
that also activate the reward system.

00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:08.645
But overactivating this reward system
kickstarts a series of unfortunate events:

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.300
loss of control, craving,
and increased tolerance to sugar.

00:02:13.158 --> 00:02:15.231
Let's get back to our bite of cereal.

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:18.888
It travels down into your stomach
and eventually into your gut.

00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:19.925
And guess what?

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.356
There are sugar receptors here, too.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.731
They are not taste buds,
but they do send signals

00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:26.563
telling your brain that you're full

00:02:26.587 --> 00:02:28.730
or that your body should
produce more insulin

00:02:28.754 --> 00:02:30.979
to deal with the extra sugar
you're eating.
