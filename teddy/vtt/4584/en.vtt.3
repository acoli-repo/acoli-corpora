00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:33.416
From here, the signal activates
the brain's reward system.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.101
This reward system is a series
of electrical and chemical pathways

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:39.725
across several different
regions of the brain.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.035
It's a complicated network,

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:44.484
but it helps answer a single,
subconscious question:

00:01:44.508 --> 00:01:45.853
should I do that again?

00:01:45.877 --> 00:01:49.477
That warm, fuzzy feeling you get
when you taste Grandma's chocolate cake?

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:51.380
That's your reward system saying,

00:01:51.404 --> 00:01:52.916
"Mmm, yes!"

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.273
And it's not just activated by food.

00:01:55.297 --> 00:01:57.583
Socializing, sexual behavior, and drugs

00:01:57.607 --> 00:02:00.710
are just a few examples
of things and experiences
