What happens when sugar hits your tongue?

00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:05.206
And does eating a little bit of sugar
make you crave more?

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:07.323
You take a bite of cereal.

00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:10.504
The sugars it contains activate
the sweet-taste receptors,

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:12.746
part of the taste buds on the tongue.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.747
These receptors send a signal
up to the brain stem,

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:19.237
and from there, it forks off
into many areas of the forebrain,

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.789
one of which is the cerebral cortex.

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:25.983
Different sections of the cerebral cortex
process different tastes:

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:27.971
bitter, salty, umami,

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:29.799
and, in our case, sweet.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:33.416
From here, the signal activates
the brain's reward system.
