Raj Panjabi: Illness is universal,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.296
access to care is not,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.016
and realizing this lit a fire in my soul.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.960
No one should die because
they live too far from a doctor or clinic.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.496
I wish that you would help us

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.936
recruit the largest army
of community health workers

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.576
the world has ever known

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.416
by creating the Community Health Academy,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.880
a global platform
to train, connect and empower.
