00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.776
We launched a nonprofit
called Last Mile Health,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.536
and Last Mile Health's mission

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.800
is to bring a health care worker
within reach of everyone everywhere.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.376
Woman: Hello. How are you?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.376
RP: A community health worker

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.736
is someone who lives
in one of these communities

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.056
that's cut off, several days
away from the nearest clinic,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.336
and they may not have had a chance
to finish even high school.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.256
Woman: I'm just listening to her lungs.
