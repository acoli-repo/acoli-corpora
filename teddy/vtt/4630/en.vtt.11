WEBVTT

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.560
We realized that working together
with other partners like Living Goods

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.416
would help us truly solve that problem.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.136
(Child crying)

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.736
And then we learned
about The Audacious Project,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.736
a new opportunity that TED
and a group of visionary philanthropists

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.736
had been working on
to fund some of the boldest,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.336
most audacious ideas in the world.
