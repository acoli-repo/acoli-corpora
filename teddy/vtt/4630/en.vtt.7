Prince Pailey: When I wake up
in the morning,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.160
I put my bag on my bike.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.656
The distances that I work

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.840
is sometimes two hours,
three hours in a forest.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.296
Some areas, some creeks,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.576
they drown with the ocean,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.080
so that every crossing
you find it so difficult.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.816
RP: Community health workers
are trained to address

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.856
the health problems
of their own community.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.176
In a country like Liberia,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.256
it could mean helping a mother
get treatment for her child
