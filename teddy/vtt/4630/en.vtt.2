00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.416
RP: Epidemic diseases
like Ebola, HIV, Zika,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.976
emerge from remote, rural communities

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.680
including the rain forests
of West and Central Africa.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.656
These are the hotspots of disease.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.536
They're the hotspots of infections.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.256
They're the hotspots of death

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.496
that are located in the blindspots
of the global health system.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.416
The idea that disease anywhere
can be a threat to people everywhere

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.656
is very real.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.336
So how do we stop this?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.336
Well, it's to enable
community health workers

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.560
to prevent, detect and respond
to outbreaks at their very source.
