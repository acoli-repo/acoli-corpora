00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.625
but we need to extend that.

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:04.968
It can be extended even to other species.

00:11:04.968 --> 00:11:09.375
Now, if we want a more altruistic society,
we need two things:

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:12.592
individual change and societal change.

00:11:12.592 --> 00:11:15.150
So is individual change possible?

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.349
Two thousand years
of contemplative study said yes, it is.

00:11:18.349 --> 00:11:21.951
Now, 15 years of collaboration
with neuroscience and epigenetics

00:11:21.951 --> 00:11:26.435
said yes, our brains change
when you train in altruism.

00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:30.707
So I spent 120 hours in an MRI machine.
