00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.394
So in 1900, as you can see,
we were well within the limits of safety.

00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:35.793
Now, in 1950 came the great acceleration.

00:02:35.793 --> 00:02:40.762
Now hold your breath, not too long,
to imagine what comes next.

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:46.907
Now we have vastly overrun
some of the planetary boundaries.

00:02:46.907 --> 00:02:50.866
Just to take biodiversity, 
at the current rate,

00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:57.288
by 2050, 30 percent of all species 
on Earth will have disappeared.

00:02:57.288 --> 00:03:03.085
Even if we keep their DNA in some fridge,
that's not going to be reversible.
