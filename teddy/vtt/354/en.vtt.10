It seems to me, there's only one concept

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:04.794
that can reconcile
those three time scales.

00:05:04.794 --> 00:05:09.198
It is simply having more
consideration for others.

00:05:09.198 --> 00:05:14.099
If you have more consideration for others,
you will have a caring economics,

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.051
where finance is at the service of society

00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:20.319
and not society at the service of finance.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.187
You will not play at the casino

00:05:22.187 --> 00:05:25.073
with the resources that people

00:05:25.073 --> 00:05:27.919
If you have more consideration for others,

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.396
you will make sure
that you remedy inequality,
