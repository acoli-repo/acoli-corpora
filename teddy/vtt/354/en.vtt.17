00:08:26.468 --> 00:08:32.344
So we tested all that, and in the end, 
he said, clearly people can be altruistic.

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:34.284
So that's good news.

00:08:34.284 --> 00:08:39.896
And even further, we should look
at the banality of goodness.

00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:41.600
Now look at here.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.370
When we come out, we aren't 
going to say, "That's so nice.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.937
There was no fistfight while this mob 
was thinking about altruism."

00:08:48.937 --> 00:08:51.099
No, that's expected, isn't it?

00:08:51.099 --> 00:08:54.278
If there was a fistfight,
we would speak of that for months.

00:08:54.278 --> 00:08:57.949
So the banality of goodness is something
that doesn't attract your attention,

00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:59.437
but it exists.

00:08:59.437 --> 00:09:04.913
Now, look at this.
