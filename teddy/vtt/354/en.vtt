00:00:00.742 --> 00:00:07.963
So we humans have an extraordinary
potential for goodness,

00:00:07.963 --> 00:00:12.363
but also an immense power to do harm.

00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:18.029
Any tool can be used to build
or to destroy.

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:21.217
That all depends on our motivation.

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:24.664
Therefore, it is all the more important

00:00:24.664 --> 00:00:28.938
to foster an altruistic motivation
rather than a selfish one.
