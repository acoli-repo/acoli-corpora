00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:30.707
So I spent 120 hours in an MRI machine.

00:11:30.707 --> 00:11:33.493
This is the first time I went
after two and a half hours.

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:37.167
And then the result has been published
in many scientific papers.

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:40.749
It shows without ambiguity
that there is structural change

00:11:40.749 --> 00:11:44.502
and functional change in the brain
when you train the altruistic love.

00:11:44.502 --> 00:11:46.252
Just to give you an idea:

00:11:46.252 --> 00:11:49.073
this is the meditator at rest on the left,

00:11:49.073 --> 00:11:52.776
meditator in compassion meditation,
you see all the activity,

00:11:52.776 --> 00:11:55.330
and then the control group at rest,
nothing happened,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.272
in meditation, nothing happened.

00:11:57.272 --> 00:11:59.250
They have not been trained.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.671
So do you need 50,000 hours 
of meditation? No, you don't.
