Now, look at this.

00:09:09.253 --> 00:09:12.054
So some psychologists said,

00:09:12.054 --> 00:09:15.291
when I tell them I run 140 humanitarian 
projects in the Himalayas

00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:17.545
that give me so much joy,

00:09:17.545 --> 00:09:20.799
they said, "Oh, I see,
you work for the warm glow.

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:23.703
That is not altruistic.
You just feel good."

00:09:23.703 --> 00:09:26.991
You think this guy,
when he jumped in front of the train,

00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:29.277
he thought, "I'm going to feel
so good when this is over?"

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.563
(Laughter)
