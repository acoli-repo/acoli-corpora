00:01:24.977 --> 00:01:31.970
So in a way, if we were to say
we need to continue this endless growth,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.616
endless use of material resources,

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:38.514
it's like if this man was saying --

00:01:38.514 --> 00:01:43.386
and I heard a former head of state,
I won't mention who, saying --

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:47.395
"Five years ago, we were at
the edge of the precipice.

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:49.972
Today we made a big step forward."

00:01:50.587 --> 00:01:56.590
So this edge is the same
that has been defined by scientists

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.244
as the planetary boundaries.

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:03.705
And within those boundaries,
they can carry a number of factors.
