After the intervention,
no more discrimination:

00:13:01.123 --> 00:13:05.048
the same amount of stickers to their 
best friend and the least favorite child.

00:13:05.048 --> 00:13:08.436
That's something we should do
in all the schools in the world.

00:13:08.436 --> 00:13:10.430
Now where do we go from there?

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.678
(Applause)

00:13:14.678 --> 00:13:17.359
When the Dalai Lama heard that,
he told Richard Davidson,

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:20.815
"You go to 10 schools, 100 schools,
the U.N., the whole world."

00:13:20.815 --> 00:13:22.499
So now where do we go from there?

00:13:22.499 --> 00:13:24.762
Individual change is possible.

00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:29.378
Now do we have to wait for an altruistic 
gene to be in the human race?

00:13:29.378 --> 00:13:33.132
That will take 50,000 years,
too much for the environment.
