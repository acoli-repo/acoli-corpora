00:09:58.738 --> 00:10:02.500
There are people who had choice,
like Pastor André Trocmé and his wife,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.187
and the whole village
of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in France.

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:09.135
For the whole Second World War,
they saved 3,500 Jews,

00:10:09.135 --> 00:10:11.792
gave them shelter,
brought them to Switzerland,

00:10:11.792 --> 00:10:15.237
against all odds, at the risk
of their lives and those of their family.

00:10:15.237 --> 00:10:17.394
So altruism does exist.

00:10:17.394 --> 00:10:19.119
So what is altruism?

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:23.021
It is the wish: May others be happy
and find the cause of happiness.

00:10:23.021 --> 00:10:28.266
Now, empathy is the affective resonance
or cognitive resonance that tells you,

00:10:28.266 --> 00:10:30.977
this person is joyful,
this person suffers.
