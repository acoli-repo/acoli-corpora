00:10:28.266 --> 00:10:30.977
this person is joyful,
this person suffers.

00:10:30.977 --> 00:10:34.463
But empathy alone is not sufficient.

00:10:34.463 --> 00:10:36.686
If you keep on being
confronted with suffering,

00:10:36.686 --> 00:10:39.447
you might have empathic distress, burnout,

00:10:39.447 --> 00:10:43.507
so you need the greater sphere
of loving-kindness.

00:10:43.507 --> 00:10:46.234
With Tania Singer at the Max Planck 
Institute of Leipzig,

00:10:46.234 --> 00:10:52.335
we showed that the brain networks for
empathy and loving-kindness are different.

00:10:52.335 --> 00:10:54.416
Now, that's all well done,

00:10:54.416 --> 00:10:59.790
so we got that from evolution,
from maternal care, parental love,

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.625
but we need to extend that.
