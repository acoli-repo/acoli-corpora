00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:03.705
And within those boundaries,
they can carry a number of factors.

00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:09.231
We can still prosper, humanity can still
prosper for 150,000 years

00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:12.563
if we keep the same stability of climate

00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:15.721
as in the Holocene
for the last 10,000 years.

00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:21.479
But this depends on choosing
a voluntary simplicity,

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.160
growing qualitatively, not quantitatively.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.394
So in 1900, as you can see,
we were well within the limits of safety.
