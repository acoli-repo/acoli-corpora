okay, altruism is the answer,
it's not just a novel ideal,

00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:03.611
but can it be a real, pragmatic solution?

00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:06.469
And first of all, does it exist,

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:10.213
true altruism, or are we so selfish?

00:06:10.213 --> 00:06:15.553
So some philosophers thought
we were irredeemably selfish.

00:06:15.553 --> 00:06:20.765
But are we really all just like rascals?

00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:23.579
That's good news, isn't it?

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:26.108
Many philosophers, 
like Hobbes, have said so.

00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:29.429
But not everyone looks like a rascal.

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:32.262
Or is man a wolf for man?
