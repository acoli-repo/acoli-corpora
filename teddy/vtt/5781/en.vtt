00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.326
My name is Olafur Eliasson.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.794
I'm an artist.

00:00:03.818 --> 00:00:06.688
I work with natural phenomena,

00:00:06.712 --> 00:00:08.697
the weather,

00:00:08.721 --> 00:00:11.736
climate, environment

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.860
and our future, one could say.

00:00:13.884 --> 00:00:15.496
(Soft sound)

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.746
I was very inspired by youth movements,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.563
how young people actually
have organized themselves

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.337
in order to be heard.

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:24.589
For some time now,

00:00:24.613 --> 00:00:27.466
I have in fact collaborated
with young people --

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.276
they are the artists
as well, in this case --
