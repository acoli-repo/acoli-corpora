00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:01.006
Well, we got started in what we
call the indoor biofuels lab.

00:07:01.006 --> 00:07:05.401
It's a seedling lab. We have 26
different species of halophytes,

00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:08.684
and five are winners. What we do here is —

00:07:08.684 --> 00:07:11.509
actually it should be called
a death lab, 'cause we try to

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:14.098
kill the seedlings, make them rough —

00:07:14.098 --> 00:07:16.418
and then we come to the GreenLab.

00:07:16.418 --> 00:07:18.176
What you see in the lower corner

00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:20.364
is a wastewater treatment plant experiment

00:07:20.364 --> 00:07:24.057
that we are growing, a macro-algae
that I'll talk about in a minute.

00:07:24.057 --> 00:07:28.043
And lastly, it's me actually working
in the lab to prove to you I do work,

00:07:28.043 --> 00:07:31.775
I don't just talk about what I do.
