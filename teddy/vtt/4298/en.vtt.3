00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:30.959
Now, combating that challenge

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.849
we have to also meet
the big three metric —

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:37.662
Actually, extreme green
for us is all three together;

00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:40.052
that's why you see the plus
there. I was told to say that.

00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:45.049
So it has to be the big three at
GRC. That's another metric.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.000
Ninety-seven percent of the
world's water is saltwater.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.010
How about we use that?
Combine that with number three.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.042
Do not use arable land.

00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:00.222
Because crops are already
growing on that land
