00:07:28.043 --> 00:07:31.775
I don't just talk about what I do.

00:07:31.775 --> 00:07:35.005
Here's the plant species.
Salicornia virginica.

00:07:35.005 --> 00:07:38.564
It's a wonderful plant. I love that plant.

00:07:38.564 --> 00:07:42.030
Everywhere we go we see it. It's
all over the place, from Maine

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.041
all the way to California.
We love that plant.

00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:50.006
Second is Salicornia bigelovii. Very
difficult to get around the world.

00:07:50.006 --> 00:07:52.052
It is the highest lipid
content that we have,

00:07:52.052 --> 00:07:56.042
but it has a shortcoming: It's short.

00:07:56.042 --> 00:08:01.163
Now you take europaea, which is the
largest or the tallest plant that we have.
