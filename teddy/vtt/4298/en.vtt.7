One is a closed photobioreactor
that you see here,

00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:35.036
and what you see on the other
side is our species —

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:39.006
we are currently using a species
called Scenedesmus dimorphus.

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:43.312
Our job at NASA is to take the
experimental and computational

00:03:43.312 --> 00:03:48.007
and make a better mixing for
the closed photobioreactors.

00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:50.044
Now the problems with closed
photobioreactors are:

00:03:50.044 --> 00:03:52.775
They are quite expensive,
they are automated,

00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:55.803
and it's very difficult
to get them in large scale.

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:57.428
So on large scale what do they use?

00:03:57.428 --> 00:04:00.921
We use open pond systems.
