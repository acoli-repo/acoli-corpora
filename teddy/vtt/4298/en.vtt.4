00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:00.222
Because crops are already
growing on that land

00:02:00.222 --> 00:02:03.019
that's very scarce around the world.

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:06.026
Number two: Don't compete with food crops.

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:10.443
That's already a well established
entity, they don't need another entry.

00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:14.391
And lastly the most precious
resource we have on this Earth

00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:19.051
is fresh water. Don't use fresh water.

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:22.022
If 97.5 percent
of the world's water is saltwater,

00:02:22.022 --> 00:02:25.299
2.5 percent is fresh water.
Less than a half percent

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.060
of that is accessible for human use.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.021
But 60 percent of the population
lives within that one percent.
