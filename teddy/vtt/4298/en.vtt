00:00:00.051 --> 00:00:03.014
What I'm going to do is,
I'm going to explain to you

00:00:03.014 --> 00:00:05.066
an extreme green concept

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.058
that was developed
at NASA's Glenn Research Center

00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:10.060
in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.490
But before I do that, we have to go over

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.027
the definition of what green is,

00:00:14.027 --> 00:00:17.024
'cause a lot of us have a
different definition of it.

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:19.017
Green. The product is created through

00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:21.480
environmentally and socially
conscious means.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.668
There's plenty of things that
are being called green now.

00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:26.280
What does it actually mean?

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.923
We use three metrics to determine green.

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:33.015
The first metric is: Is it sustainable?
