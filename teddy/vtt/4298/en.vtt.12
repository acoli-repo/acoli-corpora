Wait a second! I just saw lots of greenery
in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer.

00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:04.228
Believe it or not, in our analysis
of our saltwater ecosystems

00:06:04.228 --> 00:06:08.028
80 percent of what we need
are in these tanks themselves.

00:06:08.028 --> 00:06:12.027
The 20 percent that's missing
is nitrogen and phosphorous.

00:06:12.027 --> 00:06:14.083
We have a natural solution: fish.

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:17.971
No we don't cut up the fish
and put them in there.

00:06:17.971 --> 00:06:21.854
Fish waste is what we use.
As a matter of fact

00:06:21.854 --> 00:06:26.019
we use freshwater mollies, that we've
used our climatic adaptation technique

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:29.041
from freshwater all the way to seawater.

00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:36.037
Freshwater mollies: cheap,
they love to make babies,
