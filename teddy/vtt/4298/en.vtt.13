Freshwater mollies: cheap,
they love to make babies,

00:06:36.037 --> 00:06:37.846
and they love to go to the bathroom.

00:06:37.846 --> 00:06:40.001
And the more they go to the
bathroom, the more fertilizer we get,

00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:42.540
the better off we are, believe it or not.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.805
It should be noted that we use
sand as our soil,

00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:52.030
regular beach sand. Fossilized coral.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.001
So a lot of people ask me,
"How did you get started?"

00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:01.006
Well, we got started in what we
call the indoor biofuels lab.
