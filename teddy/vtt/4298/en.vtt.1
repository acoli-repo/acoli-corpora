00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:33.015
The first metric is: Is it sustainable?

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:36.539
Which means, are you preserving
what you are doing for future use

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.034
or for future generations?

00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:43.007
Is it alternative? Is it different
than what is being used today,

00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:45.812
or does it have a lower carbon footprint

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.396
than what's used conventionally?

00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:51.231
And three: Is it renewable?

00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:54.987
Does it come from Earth's
natural replenishing resources,

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:58.087
such as sun, wind and water?

00:00:58.087 --> 00:01:01.619
Now, my task at NASA is to develop
