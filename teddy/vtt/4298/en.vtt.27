We think we have a solution for food,
water, fuel and now energy. Complete.

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:40.189
It's extreme green, it's sustainable,
alternative and renewable

00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:44.027
and it meets the big three at GRC:

00:13:44.027 --> 00:13:49.018
Don't use arable land, don't
compete with food crops,

00:13:49.018 --> 00:13:52.080
and most of all, don't use fresh water.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.054
So I get a lot of questions about,
"What are you doing in that lab?"

00:13:57.054 --> 00:14:02.807
And I usually say, "None of your business,
that's what I'm doing in the lab." (Laughter)
