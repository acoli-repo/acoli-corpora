saltwater asparagus and pickle weed.

00:10:30.319 --> 00:10:33.050
So we are pickling pickle
weed in the middle.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.852
Oh, I thought it was funny. (Laughter)

00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:39.225
And at the bottom is seaman's mustard.
It does make sense,

00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:41.612
this is a logical snack. You have mustard,

00:10:41.612 --> 00:10:44.760
you are a seaman, you see the
halophyte, you mix it together,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.022
it's a great snack with some crackers.

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:54.022
And last, garlic with Salicornia,
which is what I like.

00:10:54.022 --> 00:10:58.997
So, water, fuel and food.

00:10:58.997 --> 00:11:02.548
None of this is possible
without the GreenLab team.
