Now, my task at NASA is to develop

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.815
the next generation of aviation fuels.

00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:07.644
Extreme green. Why aviation?

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:11.001
The field of aviation uses
more fuel than just about

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:16.017
every other combined. We
need to find an alternative.

00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:19.017
Also it's a national
aeronautics directive.

00:01:19.017 --> 00:01:21.685
One of the national aeronautics
goals is to develop

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:24.381
the next generation of fuels, biofuels,

00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:28.091
using domestic and safe,
friendly resources.

00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:30.959
Now, combating that challenge
