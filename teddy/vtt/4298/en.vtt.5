00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.021
But 60 percent of the population
lives within that one percent.

00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:36.013
So, combating my problem was,
now I have to be extreme green

00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:38.261
and meet the big three.
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:42.007
welcome to the GreenLab Research Facility.

00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:44.942
This is a facility dedicated
to the next generation

00:02:44.942 --> 00:02:48.087
of aviation fuels using halophytes.

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:51.065
A halophyte is a salt-tolerating plant.

00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:55.093
Most plants don't like salt,
but halophytes tolerate salt.

00:02:55.093 --> 00:02:58.088
We also are using weeds

00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:01.019
and we are also using algae.
