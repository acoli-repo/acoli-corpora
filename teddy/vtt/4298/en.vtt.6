WEBVTT

00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:01.019
and we are also using algae.

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.010
The good thing about our lab is, we've had

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.020
3,600 visitors in the last two years.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.022
Why do you think that's so?

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:12.028
Because we are on to something special.

00:03:12.028 --> 00:03:14.597
So, in the lower you see
the GreenLab obviously,

00:03:14.597 --> 00:03:17.049
and on the right hand
side you'll see algae.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.002
If you are into the business
of the next generation

00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.322
of aviation fuels, algae
is a viable option,

00:03:22.322 --> 00:03:24.001
there's a lot of funding right now,

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.022
and we have an algae to fuels program.

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:28.022
There's two types of algae growing.

00:03:28.022 --> 00:03:31.015
One is a closed photobioreactor
that you see here,
