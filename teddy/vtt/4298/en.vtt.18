00:08:56.818 --> 00:09:01.029
This species is so significant to us.

00:09:01.029 --> 00:09:05.000
The properties are very close to plastic.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.378
We are trying right now to convert
this macro-algae into a bioplastic.

00:09:10.378 --> 00:09:15.051
If we are successful, we will
revolutionize the plastics industry.

00:09:15.051 --> 00:09:18.573
So, we have a seed to fuel program.

00:09:18.573 --> 00:09:21.530
We have to do something with
this biomass that we have.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:26.039
And so we do G.C. extraction, lipid
optimization, so on and so forth,

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:29.726
because our goal really is to come up with

00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:33.636
the next generation of aviation fuels,
aviation specifics, so on and so forth.
