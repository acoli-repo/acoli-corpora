00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:32.049
than a closed photobioreactor system,

00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:34.030
which we think is significant.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.062
There is a drawback to algae,
however: It's very expensive.

00:04:38.062 --> 00:04:43.165
Is there a way to produce
algae inexpensively?

00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:45.026
And the answer is: yes.

00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:48.049
We do the same thing
we do with halophytes,

00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:52.004
and that is: climatic adaptation.

00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:54.816
In our GreenLab we have
six primary ecosystems

00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:58.787
that range from freshwater
all the way to saltwater.

00:04:58.787 --> 00:05:02.546
What we do: We take a potential
species, we start at freshwater,
