00:03:57.428 --> 00:04:00.921
We use open pond systems.
Now, around the world

00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:04.442
they are growing algae,
with this racetrack design

00:04:04.442 --> 00:04:06.891
that you see here. Looks like an oval with

00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:09.028
a paddle wheel and mixes really well,

00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:13.086
but when it gets around the last turn,
which I call turn four — it's stagnant.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.076
We actually have a solution for that.

00:04:15.076 --> 00:04:18.040
In the GreenLab in our open pond system

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.055
we use something that happens
in nature: waves.

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:24.747
We actually use wave technology
on our open pond systems.

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:29.431
We have 95 percent mixing
and our lipid content is higher

00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:32.049
than a closed photobioreactor system,
