00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:02.651
I have to say that I'm very glad to be here.

00:00:02.651 --> 00:00:05.852
I understand we have over 80 countries here,

00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:08.066

talks to your parents, and it's a little bit awkward.

00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:26.722
Well, I remember in third grade, I had this moment

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:29.578
where my father, who never takes off from work,

00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:33.508
