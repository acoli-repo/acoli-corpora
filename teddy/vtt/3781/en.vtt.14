00:06:55.254 --> 00:07:00.346
architects, designers, writers, activists, you name it.

00:07:00.346 --> 00:07:04.529
It's a very interesting, eclectic membership.

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:05.866
Just a few examples:

00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:08.991
an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum;

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:10.563
a collaborative team

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:14.341
who are combining biological and electronic design

00:07:14.341 --> 00:07:17.486
with 3D printing technologies in a workshop;

00:07:17.486 --> 00:07:19.620
another artist who is using the slime mold

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.720
as a way of engaging a community

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.724
to map their area.

00:07:24.724 --> 00:07:26.886
Here, the slime mold is being used directly

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:29.764
as a biological tool, but metaphorically

00:07:29.764 --> 00:07:31.748
as a symbol for ways of talking
