00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:30.064
The slime mold had replicated

00:04:30.064 --> 00:04:32.480
the Tokyo transport network

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.135
— (Laughter) —

00:04:34.135 --> 00:04:37.130
a complex system developed over time

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.030
by community dwellings, civil
engineering, urban planning.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.303
What had taken us well over 100 years

00:04:43.303 --> 00:04:46.469
took the slime mold just over a day.

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.122
The conclusion from their experiment

00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:50.632
was that the slime mold can form efficient networks

00:04:50.632 --> 00:04:53.255
and solve the traveling salesman problem.

00:04:53.255 --> 00:04:55.519
It is a biological computer.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:58.143
As such, it has been mathematically modeled,

00:04:58.143 --> 00:04:59.804
algorithmically analyzed.

00:04:59.804 --> 00:05:02.509
It's been sonified, replicated, simulated.
