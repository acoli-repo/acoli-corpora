00:09:29.036 --> 00:09:31.479
We're not trying to prove, demonstrate anything.

00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:33.613
But what it did provide us was a way

00:09:33.613 --> 00:09:35.961
of engaging a broad section of the public

00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:40.392
with ideas of intelligence, agency, autonomy,

00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:42.721
and provide a playful platform

00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:46.453
for discussions about

00:09:46.453 --> 00:09:48.837
the things that ensued.

00:09:48.837 --> 00:09:51.170
One of the most exciting things

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.030
about this experiment

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.217
was the conversation that happened afterwards.

00:09:56.217 --> 00:10:00.040
An entirely spontaneous symposium
happened in the park.
