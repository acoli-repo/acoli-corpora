00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.238
and told me to go home and play with it.

00:01:01.238 --> 00:01:03.245
The only instructions I was given,

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:05.029
that it likes it dark and damp

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:09.360
and its favorite food is porridge oats.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.378
I'm an artist who's worked for many years

00:01:11.378 --> 00:01:14.225
with biology, with scientific processes,

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:17.236
so living material is not uncommon for me.

00:01:17.236 --> 00:01:19.341
I've worked with plants, bacteria,

00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:20.860
cuttlefish, fruit flies.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.462
So I was keen to get my new collaborator home

00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:24.838
to see what it could do.

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:28.040
So I took it home and I watched.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.810
I fed it a varied diet.
