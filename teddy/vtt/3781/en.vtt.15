00:07:29.764 --> 00:07:31.748
as a symbol for ways of talking

00:07:31.748 --> 00:07:35.602
about social cohesion, communication

00:07:35.602 --> 00:07:37.466
and cooperation.

00:07:37.466 --> 00:07:39.976
Other public engagement activities,

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:41.994
I run lots of slime mold workshops,

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:44.456
a creative way of engaging with the organism.

00:07:44.456 --> 00:07:46.140
So people are invited to come and learn

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.036
about what amazing things it can do,

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:50.682
and they design their own petri dish experiment,

00:07:50.682 --> 00:07:52.998
an environment for the slime mold to navigate

00:07:52.998 --> 00:07:54.636
so they can test its properties.

00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:57.080
Everybody takes home a new pet

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.020
and is invited to post their results
