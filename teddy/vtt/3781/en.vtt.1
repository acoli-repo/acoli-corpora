00:00:28.113 --> 00:00:30.360
or millions of nuclei,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.121
all sharing a cell wall,

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:35.229
all operating as one entity.

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:36.833
In its natural habitat,

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:39.629
you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands,

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.330
eating rotting vegetation,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.870
but you might equally find it

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.412
in research laboratories,

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:50.614
classrooms, and even artists' studios.

00:00:50.614 --> 00:00:53.549
I first came across the slime
mold about five years ago.

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.106
A microbiologist friend of mine

00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:58.230
gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.238
and told me to go home and play with it.
