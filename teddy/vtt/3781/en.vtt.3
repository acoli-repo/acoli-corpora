00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.810
I fed it a varied diet.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.734
I observed as it networked.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:35.010
It formed a connection between food sources.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.848
I watched it leave a trail behind it,

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:39.607
indicating where it had been.

00:01:39.607 --> 00:01:42.555
And I noticed that when it was
fed up with one petri dish,

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:45.534
it would escape and find a better home.

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:47.262
I captured my observations

00:01:47.262 --> 00:01:49.022
through time-lapse photography.

00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:51.860
Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.441
so it's not really ideal for live viewing

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:57.294
unless there's some form of
really extreme meditation,

00:01:57.294 --> 00:01:59.822
but through the time lapse,

00:01:59.822 --> 00:02:02.918
I could observe some really interesting behaviors.
