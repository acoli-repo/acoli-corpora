00:11:33.757 --> 00:11:36.220
There's clearly significant rules at play

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.485
in this simple yet complex organism,

00:11:38.485 --> 00:11:42.277
and no matter what our disciplinary
perspective or our mode of inquiry,

00:11:42.277 --> 00:11:44.060
there's a great deal that we can learn

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.829
from observing and engaging

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:48.950
with this beautiful, brainless blob.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.165
I give you Physarum polycephalum.

00:11:52.165 --> 00:11:53.918
Thank you.

00:11:53.918 --> 00:11:54.880
