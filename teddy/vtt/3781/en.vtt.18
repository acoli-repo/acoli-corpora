00:08:58.982 --> 00:09:00.890
and then exploring the environment

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.789
is in search of food.

00:09:02.789 --> 00:09:06.420
So a chaotic shuffle ensued
as this bunch of strangers

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.328
tied together with yellow ropes
wearing "Being Slime Mold" t-shirts

00:09:10.328 --> 00:09:13.284
wandered through the museum park.

00:09:13.284 --> 00:09:16.610
When they met trees, they had to reshape

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.742
their connections and reform as a mass cell

00:09:19.742 --> 00:09:23.729
through not speaking.

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:27.087
This is a ludicrous experiment in many, many ways.

00:09:27.087 --> 00:09:29.036
This isn't hypothesis-driven.

00:09:29.036 --> 00:09:31.479
We're not trying to prove, demonstrate anything.
