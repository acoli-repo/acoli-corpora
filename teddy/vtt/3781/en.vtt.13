00:06:28.293 --> 00:06:30.389
for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.118
to share knowledge and experimentation

00:06:33.118 --> 00:06:36.086
across disciplinary divides

00:06:36.086 --> 00:06:39.781
and across academic divides.

00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:43.221
The Slime Mould Collective
membership is self-selecting.

00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:46.017
People have found the collective

00:06:46.017 --> 00:06:49.715
as the slime mold finds the oats.

00:06:49.715 --> 00:06:51.408
And it comprises of scientists

00:06:51.408 --> 00:06:52.967
and computer scientists and researchers

00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:55.254
but also artists like me,

00:06:55.254 --> 00:07:00.346
architects, designers, writers, activists, you name it.
