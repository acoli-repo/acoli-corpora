WEBVTT

00:04:59.804 --> 00:05:02.509
It's been sonified, replicated, simulated.

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.479
World over, teams of researchers

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.449
are decoding its biological principles

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.590
to understand its computational rules

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.844
and applying that learning
to the fields of electronics,

00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:15.080
programming and robotics.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.234
So the question is,

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:19.254
how does this thing work?

00:05:19.254 --> 00:05:21.414
It doesn't have a central nervous system.

00:05:21.414 --> 00:05:23.112
It doesn't have a brain,

00:05:23.112 --> 00:05:24.940
yet it can perform behaviors

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.928
that we associate with brain function.

00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:28.836
It can learn, it can remember,

00:05:28.836 --> 00:05:31.593
it can solve problems, it can make decisions.
