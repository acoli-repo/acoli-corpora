00:00:00.632 --> 00:00:03.737
I'd like to introduce you to an organism:

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:07.193
a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.

00:00:07.193 --> 00:00:10.015
It's a mold with an identity
crisis, because it's not a mold,

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:11.945
so let's get that straight to start with.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.481
It is one of 700 known slime molds

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.618
belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba.

00:00:16.618 --> 00:00:19.241
It is a single-celled organism, a cell,

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:21.481
that joins together with other cells

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.713
to form a mass super-cell

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:25.953
to maximize its resources.

00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:28.113
So within a slime mold you might find thousands

00:00:28.113 --> 00:00:30.360
or millions of nuclei,
