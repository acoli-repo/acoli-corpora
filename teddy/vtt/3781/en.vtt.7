00:03:28.448 --> 00:03:30.563
They did this at repeat intervals,

00:03:30.563 --> 00:03:32.221
and each time, the slime mold

00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:35.351
slowed down its growth in response.

00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.195
However, at the next interval,

00:03:37.195 --> 00:03:40.019
the researchers didn't put the cold air on,

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.313
yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation

00:03:43.313 --> 00:03:44.649
of it happening.

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:47.175
It somehow knew that it was about the time

00:03:47.175 --> 00:03:49.131
for the cold air that it didn't like.

00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:50.820
The conclusion from their experiment

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.090
was that the slime mold was able to learn.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.321
A third experiment:

00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:57.088
the slime mold was invited

00:03:57.088 --> 00:04:01.280
to explore a territory covered in oats.
