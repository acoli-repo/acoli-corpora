WEBVTT

00:05:58.964 --> 00:06:02.781
And it is this continuous, synchronous oscillation

00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:05.037
within the cell that allows it to form

00:06:05.037 --> 00:06:08.019
quite a complex understanding of its environment,

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:11.388
but without any large-scale control center.

00:06:11.388 --> 00:06:13.969
This is where its intelligence lies.

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:17.213
So it's not just academic researchers

00:06:17.213 --> 00:06:19.857
in universities that are interested in this organism.

00:06:19.857 --> 00:06:22.730
A few years ago, I set up SliMoCo,

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.070
the Slime Mould Collective.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.293
It's an online, open, democratic network

00:06:28.293 --> 00:06:30.389
for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts
