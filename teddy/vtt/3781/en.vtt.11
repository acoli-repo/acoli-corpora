00:05:28.836 --> 00:05:31.593
it can solve problems, it can make decisions.

00:05:31.593 --> 00:05:34.308
So where does that intelligence lie?

00:05:34.308 --> 00:05:36.800
So this is a microscopy, a video I shot,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.453
and it's about 100 times magnification,

00:05:39.453 --> 00:05:42.320
sped up about 20 times,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.106
and inside the slime mold,

00:05:44.106 --> 00:05:47.548
there is a rhythmic pulsing flow,

00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:49.716
a vein-like structure carrying

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:53.488
cellular material, nutrients and chemical information

00:05:53.488 --> 00:05:55.346
through the cell,

00:05:55.346 --> 00:05:58.964
streaming first in one direction
and then back in another.

00:05:58.964 --> 00:06:02.781
And it is this continuous, synchronous oscillation
