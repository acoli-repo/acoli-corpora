00:10:29.383 --> 00:10:31.367
and the slime mold, for me,

00:10:31.367 --> 00:10:33.736
is a fascinating subject matter.

00:10:33.736 --> 00:10:35.593
It's biologically fascinating,

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.177
it's computationally interesting,

00:10:37.177 --> 00:10:39.251
but it's also a symbol,

00:10:39.251 --> 00:10:42.909
a way of engaging with ideas of community,

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:46.563
collective behavior, cooperation.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:48.689
A lot of my work draws on the scientific research,

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:51.873
so this pays homage to the maze experiment

00:10:51.873 --> 00:10:53.455
but in a different way.

00:10:53.455 --> 00:10:55.813
And the slime mold is also my working material.

00:10:55.813 --> 00:11:01.030
It's a coproducer of photographs, prints, animations,
