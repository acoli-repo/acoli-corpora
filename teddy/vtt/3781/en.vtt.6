00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:01.627
and it formed a connection

00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:03.041
between the food.

00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.525
It retracted from empty areas and dead ends.

00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:08.335
There are four possible routes through this maze,

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:10.440
yet time and time again,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.607
the slime mold established the shortest

00:03:12.607 --> 00:03:15.060
and the most efficient route.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.311
Quite clever.

00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:18.050
The conclusion from their experiment

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.047
was that the slime mold had
a primitive form of intelligence.

00:03:21.047 --> 00:03:24.910
Another study exposed cold air at
regular intervals to the slime mold.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.255
It didn't like it. It doesn't like it cold.

00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:28.448
It doesn't like it dry.

00:03:28.448 --> 00:03:30.563
They did this at repeat intervals,
