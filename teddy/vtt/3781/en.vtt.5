00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:30.755
at how what was essentially
just a bag of cellular slime

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:33.985
could somehow map its territory,

00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:37.457
know itself, and move with seeming intention.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:41.110
I found countless scientific studies,

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.155
research papers, journal articles,

00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:47.379
all citing incredible work with this one organism,

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.343
and I'm going to share a few of those with you.

00:02:49.343 --> 00:02:52.303
For example, a team in Hokkaido University in Japan

00:02:52.303 --> 00:02:54.335
filled a maze with slime mold.

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:56.431
It joined together and formed a mass cell.

00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:58.783
They introduced food at two points,

00:02:58.783 --> 00:02:59.981
oats of course,

00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:01.627
and it formed a connection
