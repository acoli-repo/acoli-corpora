00:01:59.822 --> 00:02:02.918
I could observe some really interesting behaviors.

00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:06.418
For instance, having fed on a nice pile of oats,

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:10.862
the slime mold goes off to explore new territories

00:02:10.862 --> 00:02:13.594
in different directions simultaneously.

00:02:13.594 --> 00:02:15.833
When it meets itself,

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:17.700
it knows it's already there,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.654
it recognizes it's there,

00:02:19.654 --> 00:02:21.201
and instead retreats back

00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:24.881
and grows in other directions.

00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:27.205
I was quite impressed by this feat,

00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:30.755
at how what was essentially
just a bag of cellular slime
