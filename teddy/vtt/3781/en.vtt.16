WEBVTT

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.020
and is invited to post their results

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.438
on the Slime Mould Collective.

00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:03.886
And the collective has enabled me

00:08:03.886 --> 00:08:06.248
to form collaborations

00:08:06.248 --> 00:08:08.841
with a whole array of interesting people.

00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:10.434
I've been working with filmmakers

00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:13.900
on a feature-length slime mold documentary,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.558
and I stress feature-length,

00:08:16.558 --> 00:08:18.267
which is in the final stages of edit

00:08:18.267 --> 00:08:21.293
and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon.

00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:22.773
(Laughter)

00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:26.108
It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is

00:08:26.108 --> 00:08:28.981
the world's first human slime mold experiment.

00:08:28.981 --> 00:08:31.953
This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year.
