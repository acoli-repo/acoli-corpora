This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year.

00:08:31.953 --> 00:08:36.644
We invited people to become
slime mold for half an hour.

00:08:36.644 --> 00:08:39.985
So we essentially tied people together

00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:42.309
so they were a giant cell,

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.153
and invited them to follow slime mold rules.

00:08:45.153 --> 00:08:48.584
You have to communicate through oscillations,

00:08:48.584 --> 00:08:49.880
no speaking.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.813
You have to operate as one entity, one mass cell,

00:08:54.813 --> 00:08:56.397
no egos,

00:08:56.397 --> 00:08:58.982
and the motivation for moving

00:08:58.982 --> 00:09:00.890
and then exploring the environment
