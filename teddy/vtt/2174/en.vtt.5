As a strategy consultant,
I study businesses for a living.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.752
And as a mathematician at heart,

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:34.982
I couldn't live with something
and its opposite being equally true.

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:39.315
So, I went back to fundamentals,
and I asked the question:

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.505
What do online marketplaces really do?

00:02:42.903 --> 00:02:44.053
What do they do?

00:02:45.347 --> 00:02:47.164
Well, at their core,

00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:49.269
they're doing something very simple.

00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:51.583
They match sellers and buyers.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.194
That's it.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.996
For drivers and passengers,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.403
you get Uber, Grab in Southeast Asia

00:02:58.427 --> 00:02:59.955
or DiDi in China.
