00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.379
into what is today a super
online marketplace for everything

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:02.561
from food to grocery

00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:05.085
even massages and laundry pickups.

00:07:06.442 --> 00:07:09.918
It all came from a deliberate trade-off

00:07:09.942 --> 00:07:12.650
to be an orchestrator
of a bigger ecosystem

00:07:12.674 --> 00:07:15.464
where others also have their role to play,

00:07:15.488 --> 00:07:17.797
instead of a single winner, a hero,

00:07:17.821 --> 00:07:21.852
that takes for himself what would,
at the end, be a smaller pie.

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:25.482
Another interesting example is Jumia.

00:07:25.506 --> 00:07:28.744
Jumia is the equivalent
of Amazon in Africa.

00:07:28.768 --> 00:07:31.553
But they don't generate
the same level of fear
