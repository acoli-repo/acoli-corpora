WEBVTT

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:33.860
have helped their business ecosystems
and the communities around them.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.895
The positive side I have seen

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:40.697
demonstrated itself in a woman,
a taxi driver in Egypt,

00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:42.776
that now had the opportunity to work

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.577
without the harassment
she faced in the taxi business.

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:50.662
It demonstrated itself
through a village in Kenya

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:52.347
that got an economic boost,

00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:55.649
because the nearby beautiful
but completely unknown lake

00:01:55.673 --> 00:01:58.749
is now becoming
a national ecotourism spot.
