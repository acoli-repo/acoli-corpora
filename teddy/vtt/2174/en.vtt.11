00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.426
In fact, during my time in Singapore,

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.568
I spent half of any given week
traveling in the region,

00:05:33.592 --> 00:05:36.331
between Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia,

00:05:36.355 --> 00:05:37.736
and I became a user --

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.315
actually, more of a fan --

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.165
of online marketplaces
that were not that well-known back then.

00:05:44.047 --> 00:05:47.507
But some of them made
interesting strategic trade-offs

00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:50.024
that dramatically reduced
their side effects,

00:05:50.048 --> 00:05:51.673
their externalities.

00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:54.958
Take Gojek, for example.

00:05:55.347 --> 00:05:57.966
They're basically Uber for motor bikes.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.008
They are one of the most liked
online marketplaces in Indonesia,
