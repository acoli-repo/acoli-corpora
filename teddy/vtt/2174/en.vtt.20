00:09:57.955 --> 00:10:00.598
because when Grab started,
it had a different name.

00:10:00.622 --> 00:10:03.074
It was called MyTeksi,

00:10:03.098 --> 00:10:08.537
and as the name suggests,
it started as a platform for taxis.

00:10:09.521 --> 00:10:13.943
So when Grab started expanding
the driver pool beyond taxis,

00:10:13.967 --> 00:10:16.500
it was seen as gradual and reasonable.

00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:19.748
They were also very careful
while doing so.

00:10:20.188 --> 00:10:22.979
They thought of what kind
of social safety net

00:10:23.003 --> 00:10:25.125
they should bring to all drivers.

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:28.188
So they put in place
special insurance packages

00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:30.513
and even financial education programs.
