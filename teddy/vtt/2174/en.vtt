In February 2013,
my wife and I moved to Singapore.

00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:08.230
Exactly at the same time,

00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:11.512
Uber has announced
it started operations in the country.

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:15.432
Now, my wife and I
agree on a lot of things,

00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:18.718
but using Uber was definitely
not one of them.

00:00:19.797 --> 00:00:21.823
While I was excited about the technology

00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:25.093
and how maybe we don't need
to own cars anymore,

00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:30.618
she felt that every Uber car
is here to steal jobs from taxi drivers.
