00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.196
and ultimately, unlock
more value for everyone.

00:03:31.847 --> 00:03:35.307
In fact, online marketplaces' core benefit

00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:39.013
is that they get us more
from the same amount of effort.

00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.537
For example,

00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:43.934
if you're a taxi driver in San Francisco

00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.568
and you decide to work 10 hours per day,

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.664
then you're actually having
a paying passenger in your car

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:52.622
for four hours out of the 10.

00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:57.287
If you take the same car
and put it on a platform like Uber,

00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:59.209
you can have paying passengers

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:01.422
for an additional one and a half hours.
