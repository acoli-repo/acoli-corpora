For matching merchants and consumers,

00:03:02.898 --> 00:03:05.903
you get Amazon, Alibaba
or Jumia in Africa.

00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:08.244
And for housing, you get Airbnb;

00:03:08.268 --> 00:03:10.410
for fundraising, you get Kickstarter --

00:03:10.434 --> 00:03:11.584
the list goes on.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.887
What all these examples have in common

00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:17.450
is that they transition
this basic functionality

00:03:17.474 --> 00:03:19.125
of matching sellers and buyers

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.196
from the physical world
to the digital world.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.133
And by doing so,

00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:25.968
they can find better matches,

00:03:25.992 --> 00:03:27.156
do it faster

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.196
and ultimately, unlock
more value for everyone.
