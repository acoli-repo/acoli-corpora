00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.534
but they have also built Jumia University,

00:08:02.558 --> 00:08:03.783
an e-learning platform

00:08:03.807 --> 00:08:07.982
where merchants can come and learn
basic digital and business skills.

00:08:09.085 --> 00:08:12.799
We have studied online marketplaces
in Africa last year.

00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:16.767
And during that study,
we have met one of Jumia's merchants.

00:08:17.085 --> 00:08:18.474
His name is Jomo.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.926
He was fired from his job in 2014,

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.466
and at that time, he decided
he wanted to become his own boss.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.204
He wanted to be independent.

00:08:27.228 --> 00:08:30.046
He also wanted to never be fired again.
