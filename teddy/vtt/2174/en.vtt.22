00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.578
I'm not trying to argue
that the trade-offs

00:11:00.602 --> 00:11:04.465
by either Grab or Jumia
or Gojek are risk-free.

00:11:04.903 --> 00:11:08.036
Did they slow down growth
at some point, temporarily?

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.219
Maybe.

00:11:09.243 --> 00:11:10.506
But look at them today.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.428
Gojek is worth 10 billion dollars.

00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:18.918
Jumia is one of only three unicorns
in the whole of Africa.

00:11:19.752 --> 00:11:22.953
And Grab, well, they pushed out Uber

00:11:22.977 --> 00:11:25.777
out of the whole region of Southeast Asia.

00:11:26.712 --> 00:11:31.165
And I also think these trade-offs
have nothing specific to emerging markets.
