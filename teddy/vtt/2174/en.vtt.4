Online marketplaces will continue to grow.

00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:05.276
And they will transform the way we shop,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.482
the way we travel

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:08.537
and the way we transact with each other.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.371
So we really need to understand

00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:14.347
where is the truth
between those two stories.

00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:17.688
Should we expect more of the bright side

00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:19.978
or more of the dark and worrying side?

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:24.235
And is there a way to get
the first without getting the second?

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.106
I believe there is.

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:30.045
