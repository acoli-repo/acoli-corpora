00:09:27.943 --> 00:09:32.641
So, when we decided with my wife
to leave the country last year,

00:09:32.665 --> 00:09:34.531
Uber decided to do the same.

00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:36.538
At the same time,

00:09:36.562 --> 00:09:41.111
again, we started to see that pattern,

00:09:41.135 --> 00:09:43.460
but maybe it's a coincidence.

00:09:44.053 --> 00:09:48.679
In reality, Uber lost
the ride-hailing battle

00:09:48.703 --> 00:09:51.727
to a Malaysian-born start-up called Grab.

00:09:52.616 --> 00:09:54.378
Now, interestingly,

00:09:54.402 --> 00:09:57.931
my wife didn't have the same
level of concerns with Grab,

00:09:57.955 --> 00:10:00.598
because when Grab started,
it had a different name.
