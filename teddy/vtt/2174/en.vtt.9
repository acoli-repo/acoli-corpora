00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:30.799
Or you can decide that the platform
gets to keep all of it.

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.149
What usually happens
is that all three of them

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.706
would somehow split it.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.212
But what about the rest of us?

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:41.517
We can also be impacted

00:04:41.541 --> 00:04:43.736
without being on either sides
of this business.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.101
If my neighbor decides
to rent his apartment on Airbnb,

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:50.317
and we have more people
coming in and out of the building,

00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:52.023
more noise than usual,

00:04:52.047 --> 00:04:56.237
then I'm getting an unpleasant side effect
of this productivity magic.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.149
This is what economists would call
a "negative externality."
