worried about aggressive competition
from global platforms

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:03.116
eating up their local businesses.

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:07.146
And on the rational level,
of course I understand.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.553
After all, this is basic
supply and demand economics.

00:01:10.577 --> 00:01:13.458
If, in any market,
you dramatically increase supply,

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:16.961
you should expect prices, profitability
and growth to go down

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:18.385
for existing players.

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.466
But in my personal experience,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.591
I've also seen
the other side of the story.

00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:26.148
Where online marketplaces,

00:01:26.172 --> 00:01:29.861
like Gojek in Indonesia
or Jumia in Africa,

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:33.860
have helped their business ecosystems
and the communities around them.
