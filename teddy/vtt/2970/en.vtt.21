it's highly likely
that the rest of the staff will too.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.536
So that's a little bit
about my thoughts on doctors,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.256
and now let's move on
to the transgender community.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.536
I'm here talking about fear,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.696
but y'all know who
is really fearful, right?

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.096
It's the transgender community.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.936
Earlier I shared the story about Anne

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.456
and how she was so worried
about going into treatment

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.536
and not being respected
as her female self,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.496
and then Leah who was scared
about how her doctor would react,

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.576
and the second
that he didn't shake her hand

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.200
and ordered that HIV test,
her fears came true.
