00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.216
She told me about her journey of being
in and out of hospitals and rehabs

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.496
trying to get sober,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.456
and when she did, the health care
providers and doctors

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.536
wouldn't use the correct
female name or pronouns.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.920
This caused her pain.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.536
You see, when I was studying
to become a therapist,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.120
I wasn't taught how to work
with transgender patients.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.040
I had no idea these would be
the patients I'd be working with.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.096
But the more I worked with Anne
and other patients like Anne,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.416
I began to see my mission evolve,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.496
and that was to make sure
that the transgender community

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280
got their health care needs met.
