Today, in this talk,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.536
I want to offer a new way of thinking
for three groups of people:

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.856
doctors, the transgender community
and, well, the rest of us.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.616
But before we do, I want to cover
a couple of definitions

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.496
that's going to help you wrap your head
around gender identity a little bit more.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.176
So I hope you've got your paper and pen.
Get ready to take some notes.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.496
So let's start out
with this idea of a binary system.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.776
And what this means is,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.736
before, we always thought
there was only two, male and female.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.416
Get it? Binary? Right?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.000
So we've come to find out
that this isn't true.
