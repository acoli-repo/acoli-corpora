00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.896
and she began to tell me
that she didn't fear coming into rehab

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.296
and having to give up drugs and alcohol.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.336
Her fear was that the doctors
that were going to be treating her

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.240
would not treat her as her female self.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.176
She then told me about this ongoing pain
that she has experienced her whole life

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.656
of being assigned male
but knowing she's female.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.976
And what she meant by that is,
when she was born,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.136
the doctor held her up to her parents

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.056
and based on her genitalia said,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.816
"It's a boy."

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.480
She always knew she wasn't a boy.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.536
Many years passed and the feelings
that she was feeling
