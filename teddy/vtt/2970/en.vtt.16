00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.536
someone that's assigned a sex at birth

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.000
and they identify
on the other side of the spectrum.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.696
A transgender male is someone
who was assigned female at birth,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.056
but their sense of self,
who they are, how they live their life,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.616
is as a male.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.696
And the opposite is, as we talked earlier,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.536
a transgender female,
someone that's assigned male at birth

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.616
but lives their live
and sense of self as a female.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.456
It's also important to point out here

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.496
that not everyone
that has a nonbinary identity

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.440
identifies with the term "transgender."

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.256
Just so nobody gets confused,
I want to point out sexual identity,
