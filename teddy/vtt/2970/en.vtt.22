The transgender community
needs to be empowered

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.056
to speak up for their health care needs.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.200
The days of remaining silent and taking
whatever treatment you can get are over.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.856
If you don't speak up
for your health care needs,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.440
no one's going to do it for you.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.480
So what about the rest of us?

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.936
A lot of y'all, maybe in the next week
or a couple of months,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.216
are going to have
a doctor's appointment, right?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.576
So let's say you go
to your doctor's appointment

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.936
and when it's over,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.760
you feel worse than you did
when you got there.
