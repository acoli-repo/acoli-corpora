00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.696
But for today's talk, I want you
to think about transgender

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.256
as someone who is assigned
a sex at birth that doesn't match

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.136
with who they are as a person
and their sense of self.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.416
Now, this is very different
than biological sex.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.816
So gender identity is sense of self.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.136
So think of it as
what's between your ears:

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.016
sense of self, who you are.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.776
This is very different
than biological sex, right?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.736
Hormones, genitalia, chromosomes:

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.400
that's what's between our legs.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.776
Now, you may be thinking, "Dr. Kristie,
I have never questioned who I am.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.496
I know I'm a man, or I know I'm a woman."
