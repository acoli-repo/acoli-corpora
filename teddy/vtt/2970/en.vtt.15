the doctor held me up
to my parents and said,

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.576
"It's a girl."

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.656
All this, based on my genitalia.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.456
Even though I grew up
in a small farm town in Georgia,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.696
very much a tomboy,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.736
I never questioned that I was a female.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.296
I've always known I was a girl,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.736
regardless of how I was as a kid.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.576
Now, this is very different
than someone who's transgender.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.736
Now, trans is a Latin term
for "on the other side of" --

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.616
think about transcontinental airlines,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.496
across, on the other side of --

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.536
someone that's assigned a sex at birth
