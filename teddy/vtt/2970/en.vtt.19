or the patient ends up spending their time

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.280
trying to teach the doctor
how to take care of them.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.696
Many doctors don't feel comfortable
asking about gender identities.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.016
Some don't feel like it's relevant at all
to their medical care

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.600
and others just don't want
to say the wrong thing.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.816
Many doctors who say
something inappropriate

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.336
or they say something negative,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.936
they may not be coming
from a malicious or mean place,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.776
they may have never been trained
on how to care for these individuals.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.560
But this can't be accepted
as a norm anymore either.
