WEBVTT

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280
got their health care needs met.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.456
The more I looked into this,
I saw how this very real fear

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.256
of violence, discrimination
and this lack of acceptance

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.416
caused so many of these patients
to turn to alcohol and drugs.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.016
And I also heard these horror stories

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.976
of when these patients
were seeking medical care

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.416
and how they were treated,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.774
and how a lot of their
medical needs were ignored.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.536
Now let me tell you about Leah.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.736
I had the pleasure
of meeting Leah a few years back.
