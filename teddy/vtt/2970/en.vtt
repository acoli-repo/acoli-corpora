00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.576
About six months
into my career as a therapist,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.896
I was working at a drug
and alcohol rehab facility.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.496
I got a call from one of the nurses
down at the detox unit.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.376
She asked me to come down
and assess one of the new patients

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.256
that had arrived earlier in the day.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.696
So I went down to the unit
and had the pleasure of meeting Anne.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.176
Anne's a transgender female,
and as her and I started talking,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.216
she was sharing with me
about what brought her into treatment,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.976
but I could hear this fear in her voice,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.896
and I could see this worry in her eyes,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.896
and she began to tell me
that she didn't fear coming into rehab
