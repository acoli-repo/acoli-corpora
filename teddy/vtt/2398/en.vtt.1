00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And about three years ago,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I started an exercise

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in openness and inclusiveness

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
by reaching out into the open-source software community

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to create new digital tools for magic --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
tools that could eventually be shared with other artists

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to start them off further on in the process

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and to get them to the poetry faster.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's an augmented reality

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
projection tracking and mapping system,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or a digital storytelling tool.
