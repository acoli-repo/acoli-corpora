00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to begin by reciting a poem.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
"Oh beloved dentist:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Your rubber fingers in my mouth ...

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
your voice so soft and muffled ...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Lower the mask, dear dentist,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
lower the mask."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Laughter)

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Okay, in this presentation,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
through a fairly serious workout.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You're going to see a lot of imagery,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about,
