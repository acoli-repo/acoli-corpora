00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.973
There are two ways
of thinking about my work.

00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:07.090
The easy way is just -- I'm papering
black-and-white images on walls.

00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:10.525
But I believe my work
is about connecting people.

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.107
For me, it's the power
of bringing people together.

00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:20.625
I went there to do art projects
with the community.

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.419
Now I realize that the community
wanted to do art projects

00:01:24.443 --> 00:01:26.005
even more than I wanted.

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:27.577
And I started thinking:

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.859
Why I don't take myself
out of the equation and let them do it?
