00:06:27.858 --> 00:06:30.574
it has to make chemicals called enzymes

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.182
to chew through
the scaffolding of tissues.

00:06:33.763 --> 00:06:38.485
We designed these nanoparticles
to be activated by these enzymes.

00:06:39.034 --> 00:06:44.946
One enzyme can activate a thousand
of these chemical reactions in an hour.

00:06:45.462 --> 00:06:49.020
Now in engineering, we call
that one-to-a-thousand ratio

00:06:49.044 --> 00:06:50.609
a form of amplification,

00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:52.805
and it makes something ultrasensitive.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:56.662
So we've made an ultrasensitive
cancer detector.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.120
OK, but how do I get this activated
signal to the outside world,
