00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.256
and perform therapy on the spot,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.418
so no one is lost to follow up.

00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:07.779
That's just one example of how
miniaturization can save lives.

00:03:08.148 --> 00:03:09.301
Now as engineers,

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:12.070
we think of this
as straight-up miniaturization.

00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:14.531
You took a big thing
and you made it little.

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:16.806
But what I told you before about computers

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.076
was that they transformed our lives

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.401
when they became small enough
for us to take them everywhere.

00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:28.081
So what is the transformational
equivalent like that in medicine?

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.636
Well, what if you had a detector
