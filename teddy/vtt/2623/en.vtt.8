00:03:58.444 --> 00:04:00.346
which is 100 nanometers.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.180
And that has profound implications.

00:04:03.583 --> 00:04:07.226
It turns out that materials
actually change their properties

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.846
at the nanoscale.

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.777
You take a common material like gold,

00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.122
and you grind it into dust,
into gold nanoparticles,

00:04:15.146 --> 00:04:18.458
and it changes from looking
gold to looking red.

00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:22.895
If you take a more exotic material
like cadmium selenide --

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.093
forms a big, black crystal --

00:04:25.117 --> 00:04:27.718
if you make nanocrystals
out of this material

00:04:27.742 --> 00:04:29.315
and you put it in a liquid,

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.163
and you shine light on it,
