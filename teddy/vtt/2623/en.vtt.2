00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:01.305
Things like vaccination, timely screening

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.562
and of course, stopping smoking.

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:07.909
But even with the best tools
and technologies that we have today,

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.996
some tumors can't be detected

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.690
until 10 years after
they've started growing,

00:01:13.714 --> 00:01:17.477
when they are 50 million
cancer cells strong.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:19.857
What if we had better technologies

00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:22.987
to detect some of these more
deadly cancers sooner,

00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:24.313
when they could be removed,

00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:26.538
when they were just getting started?

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:29.837
Let me tell you about how
miniaturization might get us there.
