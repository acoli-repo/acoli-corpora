00:08:26.671 --> 00:08:30.370
Or maybe we want make something
that's more inexpensive and portable.

00:08:30.394 --> 00:08:34.177
Then we make molecules
that we can trap on paper,

00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:35.905
like a pregnancy test.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.555
In fact, there's a whole
world of paper tests

00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:43.091
that are becoming available
in a field called paper diagnostics.

00:08:43.711 --> 00:08:46.037
Alright, where are we going with this?

00:08:46.724 --> 00:08:48.293
What I'm going to tell you next,

00:08:48.317 --> 00:08:50.143
as a lifelong researcher,

00:08:50.167 --> 00:08:52.046
represents a dream of mine.

00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:54.489
I can't say that's it's a promise;

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:56.005
it's a dream.

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:59.616
But I think we all have to have dreams
to keep us pushing forward,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.577
even -- and maybe especially --
cancer researchers.
