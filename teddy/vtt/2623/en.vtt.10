00:04:58.982 --> 00:05:00.506
So as a physician,

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.754
what's just as interesting to me

00:05:02.778 --> 00:05:05.078
is that it's not just
the color of materials

00:05:05.102 --> 00:05:07.033
that changes at the nanoscale;

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:10.665
the way they travel
in your body also changes.

00:05:11.137 --> 00:05:13.936
And this is the kind of observation
that we're going to use

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.134
to make a better cancer detector.

00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:17.911
So let me show you what I mean.

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:20.883
This is a blood vessel in the body.

00:05:20.907 --> 00:05:23.318
Surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.

00:05:23.683 --> 00:05:26.724
We're going to inject nanoparticles
into the blood vessel

00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:30.928
and watch how they travel
from the bloodstream into the tumor.
