00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.636
Well, what if you had a detector

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.922
that was so small that it could
circulate in your body,

00:03:35.946 --> 00:03:38.359
find the tumor all by itself

00:03:38.383 --> 00:03:40.752
and send a signal to the outside world?

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.156
It sounds a little bit
like science fiction.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.083
But actually, nanotechnology
allows us to do just that.

00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:52.296
Nanotechnology allows us to shrink
the parts that make up the detector

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.157
from the width of a human hair,

00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:55.841
which is 100 microns,

00:03:55.865 --> 00:03:58.420
to a thousand times smaller,

00:03:58.444 --> 00:04:00.346
which is 100 nanometers.
