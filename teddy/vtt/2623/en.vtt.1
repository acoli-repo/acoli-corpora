00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.077
due to one of the fastest-growing
diseases on Earth:

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.519
cancer.

00:00:35.543 --> 00:00:36.798
Now when I say that,

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:40.600
what most people hear me say
is that we're working on curing cancer.

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:41.887
And we are.

00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:43.062
But it turns out

00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:45.887
that there's an incredible
opportunity to save lives

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:49.244
through the early detection
and prevention of cancer.

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:55.164
Worldwide, over two-thirds of deaths
due to cancer are fully preventable

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.988
using methods that we already
have in hand today.

00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:01.305
Things like vaccination, timely screening
