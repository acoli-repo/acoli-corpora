depending on how big
or small I make a material,

00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:04.103
I can change where it goes in your body.

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.891
In my lab, we recently made
a cancer nanodetector

00:06:09.915 --> 00:06:15.163
that is so small that it could travel
into the body and look for tumors.

00:06:15.477 --> 00:06:19.569
We designed it to listen
for tumor invasion:

00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:24.366
the orchestra of chemical signals
that tumors need to make to spread.

00:06:24.932 --> 00:06:27.834
For a tumor to break out
of the tissue that it's born in,

00:06:27.858 --> 00:06:30.574
it has to make chemicals called enzymes
