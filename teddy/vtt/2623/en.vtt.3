00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.428
This is a microscope in a typical lab

00:01:33.452 --> 00:01:37.008
that a pathologist would use
for looking at a tissue specimen,

00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:39.470
like a biopsy or a pap smear.

00:01:39.927 --> 00:01:41.995
This $7,000 microscope

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:45.275
would be used by somebody
with years of specialized training

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.088
to spot cancer cells.

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:51.172
This is an image from a colleague
of mine at Rice University,

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.774
Rebecca Richards-Kortum.

00:01:52.798 --> 00:01:56.625
What she and her team have done
is miniaturize that whole microscope

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.624
into this $10 part,

00:01:58.648 --> 00:02:01.464
and it fits on the end
of an optical fiber.
