00:07:27.898 --> 00:07:32.003
is going from the blood,
through the kidney, into the urine,

00:07:32.027 --> 00:07:34.697
and everything else
that's bigger is retained.

00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:40.123
OK, so if I make a 100-nanometer
cancer detector,

00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:42.619
I inject it in the bloodstream,

00:07:42.643 --> 00:07:48.073
it can leak into the tumor
where it's activated by tumor enzymes

00:07:48.097 --> 00:07:50.453
to release a small signal

00:07:50.477 --> 00:07:53.699
that is small enough to be
filtered out of the kidney

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.901
and put into the urine,

00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:59.966
I have a signal in the outside world
that I can detect.
