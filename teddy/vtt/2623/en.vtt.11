00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:30.928
and watch how they travel
from the bloodstream into the tumor.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:35.816
Now it turns out that the blood vessels
of many tumors are leaky,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.206
and so nanoparticles can leak out
from the bloodstream into the tumor.

00:05:40.628 --> 00:05:43.762
Whether they leak out
depends on their size.

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:45.279
So in this image,

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:49.674
the smaller, hundred-nanometer,
blue nanoparticles are leaking out,

00:05:49.698 --> 00:05:53.094
and the larger, 500-nanometer,
red nanoparticles

00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:54.895
are stuck in the bloodstream.

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.022
So that means as an engineer,

00:05:57.046 --> 00:06:01.038
depending on how big
or small I make a material,
