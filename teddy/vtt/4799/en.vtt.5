00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:31.828
you'd have to guess who to trust.

00:02:31.828 --> 00:02:37.547
But splitting them into one pair
and two trios would work every time,

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:38.995
and here's why.

00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:42.932
The possessed students might lie,
or they might not,

00:02:42.932 --> 00:02:45.183
but you know there are only two of them,

00:02:45.183 --> 00:02:48.632
while the other six will 
always tell the truth.

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:50.759
When each group returns to the hall,

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.814
all of its members will either give
the same report

00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:56.606
or argue about 
whether they found the exit.

00:02:56.606 --> 00:02:58.995
If a trio returns in total agreement,

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:01.214
then you know none of them are lying.
