00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:30.700
and the walls begin to shake.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.499
Fleeing for your lives,

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:36.236
you come to a room you passed before
with five hallways,

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:40.227
including the one to the altar
and the one leading back outside.

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:43.219
The giant sandglass in the center
is now flowing,

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.926
with less than an hour before it empties,

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:50.436
and the rumbling tells you that you don't 
want to be around when that happens.

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:52.493
From what you recall of your way here,

00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:56.741
it would take about 20 minutes to reach
the exit at a fast pace.

00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:59.382
You know this is the last junction
before the exit,

00:00:59.382 --> 00:01:02.439
but your trail markings have been erased,
