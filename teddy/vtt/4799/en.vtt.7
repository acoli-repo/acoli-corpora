00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:31.914
In either case, ignore the duo.

00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:36.363
If there's only one group arguing,
both others must be telling the truth,

00:03:36.363 --> 00:03:37.971
and if there are two conflicts,

00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:40.673
then the possessed students
are in separate groups

00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:44.536
and you can safely trust the majority
in both trios

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:47.854
since at least two people in each
will be truthful.

00:03:47.854 --> 00:03:49.821
The temple collapses behind you

00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:52.780
as greenish vapors 
escape from two of the students.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.476
You're all safe and free from the curse.

00:03:55.476 --> 00:03:56.859
After that ordeal,

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.183
you tell your group 
they all deserve a vacation,

00:03:59.183 --> 00:04:02.432
and you just happen to have
another expedition coming up.
