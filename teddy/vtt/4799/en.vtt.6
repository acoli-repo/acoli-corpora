00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:01.214
then you know none of them are lying.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:04.331
With the pair, 
you can't be sure either way,

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:08.944
but all you need is reliable evidence
about three of the four paths.

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:12.382
The fourth you can figure out
using the process of elimination.

00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:17.245
Of course, none of this matters if you're
lucky enough to find the exit yourself,

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:21.715
but otherwise, putting everything together
leaves you with three possibilities.

00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:24.150
If each group gives a consistent answer,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.028
either everyone is telling the truth,

00:03:26.028 --> 00:03:29.567
or the two possessed students 
are paired together.

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:31.914
In either case, ignore the duo.
