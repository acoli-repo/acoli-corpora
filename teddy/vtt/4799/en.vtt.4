Don't worry about the possessed
students attacking

00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:02.181
or otherwise harming the others.

00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:05.812
This curse only affects
their communication.

00:02:05.812 --> 00:02:09.036
Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out by yourself!

Answer in: 3

Answer in: 2

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:12.900
Answer in: 1

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.314
The first thing to realize is that since
you know you aren't possessed,

00:02:16.314 --> 00:02:19.122
you can explore one of the halls alone.

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:22.486
This leaves eight students 
for the remaining three paths.

00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:26.217
Sending groups of four down just two
of the paths won't work

00:02:26.217 --> 00:02:29.734
because if one group came back split
two versus two,

00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:31.828
you'd have to guess who to trust.
