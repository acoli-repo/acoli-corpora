00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:30.186
Remembering the green smoke,

00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:33.893
you realize two of the students
have been cursed.

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:37.421
At any time, 
one or both of them might lie,

00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:40.102
though they also might tell the truth.

00:01:40.102 --> 00:01:42.865
You know for sure that the curse
didn't get you,

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:45.696
but you don't know which students
can't be trusted,

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:49.500
and because the possessed students
may lie only occasionally,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.350
there is no guaranteed way to test
them to determine which are cursed.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.447
Can you figure out a way to ensure
that you all escape?

00:01:57.447 --> 00:02:00.091
Don't worry about the possessed
students attacking
