00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
but it was going back into the press

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So, these are broadsheets, tabloids, debates were being had all about this work,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
politicians were getting involved --

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
all sorts of things -- great headlines.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Then suddenly, it started to get on front pages.
