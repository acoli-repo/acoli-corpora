00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when Princess Diana died.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There was a sort of a standstill in Britain

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the moment of her death,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I was fascinated by this phenomenon,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so I wondered:

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
could one erase the image of Diana, actually quite crudely and physically?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but I couldn't erase this from my memory

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche.
