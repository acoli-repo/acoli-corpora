And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the more pictures you see of these celebrities,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
the more you feel you know them,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
but you don't know them

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and you want to know them further.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Of course, the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
watch her horses. (Laughter).

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And then I was sort of making imagery.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
In England there's an expression: "you can't imagine the Queen on the loo."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So I'm trying to penetrate that.
