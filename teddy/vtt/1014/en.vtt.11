00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Then suddenly, it started to get on front pages.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I was being asked and paid to do front covers.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
which I found also fascinating.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
How one moment -- it was disgusting --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
saying my work was wonderful,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But then this changed suddenly.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I then started to work for magazines and newspapers.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
This was, for example, an image that went into Tatler.
