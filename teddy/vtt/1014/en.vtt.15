So, all this work is getting shown in art galleries.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Then I made a book.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Stills from the TV series went into this book.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
But there was a real legal problem because it looks real,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
but how do you get over that?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Because obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now:

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that we can't tell what's real.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So, from my point of view, it's important to publish it,
