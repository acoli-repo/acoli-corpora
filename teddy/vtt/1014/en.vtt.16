How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So, from my point of view, it's important to publish it,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
but at the same time it does cause a confusion --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
intentional on my behalf,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
but problematic for any outlet that I'm working with.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and comments about our public figures.
