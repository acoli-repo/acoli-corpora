00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
so I got a look-alike of Diana

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and posed her in the right positions and angles

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and created something that was in, or existed in, the public imagination.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So people were wondering: was she going to marry Dodi?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Was she in love with him?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Was she pregnant? Did she want his baby?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Was she pregnant when she died?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So I created this image of Diana, Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child
