So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and this was a sequence of images.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And this gets shown in art galleries like this, as a sequence.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And similarly with the Di-Dodian baby imagery --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
this is another art gallery installation.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but you think it's Camilla and the Queen,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real.
