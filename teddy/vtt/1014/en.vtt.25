00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and how we read all our information through imagery.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery.
