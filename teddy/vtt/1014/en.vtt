00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I show a number of photographs and films,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but I also make television programs, books and some advertising,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
all with the same concept.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and the importance of the image:

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
celebrity is born of photography.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when Princess Diana died.
