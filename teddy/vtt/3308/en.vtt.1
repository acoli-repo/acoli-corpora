00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:30.831
and at the same time,
they have no immunity.

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:34.910
So in the general population,

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:39.133
it's likely that the dose of virus
that you receive when you are infected

00:00:39.157 --> 00:00:42.371
is much less than the dose
that a health worker would receive,

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:44.680
health workers having
more serious infections.

00:00:44.704 --> 00:00:47.704
So your infection
would be less serious, hopefully.

00:00:47.728 --> 00:00:51.057
So that leaves the elderly
and those with comorbidities

00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:53.633
to really be the ones
that we have to make sure

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:55.822
are taken care of in hospitals.

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:59.863
[Who are the people who should be
most concerned about this?]
