00:06:59.703 --> 00:07:02.497
and this intensive increase
in human populations

00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:04.537
living together on the same planet

00:07:04.561 --> 00:07:09.768
is really a melting pot
where outbreaks can occur and do occur.

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:12.803
We will eventually have
more and more of these outbreaks.

00:07:12.827 --> 00:07:16.741
So an emerging infection today
is just a warning

00:07:16.765 --> 00:07:18.549
of what will happen in the future.

00:07:18.573 --> 00:07:19.778
We have to make sure

00:07:19.802 --> 00:07:22.855
that that technical
collaboration in the world

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.903
is there to work together

00:07:24.927 --> 00:07:28.276
to make sure that we can understand
these outbreaks when they occur

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.867
and rapidly provide the information
necessary to control them.
