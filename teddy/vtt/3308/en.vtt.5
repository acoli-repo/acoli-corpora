00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.871
so we understand

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:33.641
and can make sure that we can
contribute in our own way

00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:35.665
to prevention of major spread.

00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:38.776
[You led the global response
to the SARS outbreak in 2003.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.384
How does this outbreak compare?]

00:02:40.408 --> 00:02:42.654
That's the same problem
with all new infections.

00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:45.210
This is an infection
that's coming to humans

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:48.336
who have never been exposed
to this virus before.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.728
They don't have any antibody protection,

00:02:50.752 --> 00:02:53.282
and it's not clear whether
their immune system

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.268
can handle this virus or not.

00:02:55.292 --> 00:02:59.959
This is a virus that usually finds itself
in bats or in other animals,

00:02:59.983 --> 00:03:01.800
and all of a sudden, it's in humans.
