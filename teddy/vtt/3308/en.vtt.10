00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:01.738
there may be some candidate vaccines

00:05:01.762 --> 00:05:06.585
that can then be studied for licensing
by regulatory agencies.

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:10.728
So we're talking about at least a year
until there's vaccine available

00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:13.314
that can be used in many populations.

00:05:13.338 --> 00:05:16.993
[What questions about the outbreak
are still unanswered?]

00:05:17.347 --> 00:05:19.164
It's clear we know how it transmits,

00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:21.827
we don't know how easily
it transmits in humans,

00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:26.220
in communities or in unenclosed areas.

00:05:26.244 --> 00:05:27.958
We know, for example,

00:05:27.982 --> 00:05:31.847
that in the enclosed area
of a cruise ship, it spread very easily.
