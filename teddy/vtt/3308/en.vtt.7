00:03:28.672 --> 00:03:30.276
was about 10 percent.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.355
With the current coronavirus, COVID-19,

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.776
it is two percent or probably less.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.164
So it's a much less virulent virus,

00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:41.625
but it's still a virus
that causes mortality,

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.594
and that's what we don't want
entering human populations.

00:03:44.618 --> 00:03:48.383
[Have we responded adequately
at border crossings, such as airports?]

00:03:48.407 --> 00:03:52.700
It's clearly understood
that airports or any land borders

00:03:52.724 --> 00:03:54.954
cannot prevent a disease from entering.

00:03:54.978 --> 00:03:57.768
People in the incubation period
can cross that border,

00:03:57.792 --> 00:03:59.117
can enter countries

00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.315
and can then infect others
when they become sick.
