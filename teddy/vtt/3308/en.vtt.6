00:02:59.983 --> 00:03:01.800
and all of a sudden, it's in humans.

00:03:01.824 --> 00:03:04.982
And humans just don't have
experience with this virus.

00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:06.164
But gradually,

00:03:06.188 --> 00:03:08.997
we are beginning to learn a lot,
as we did with SARS.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:12.887
And you know, there are certainly
a larger number of deaths

00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:14.728
than there were with SARS.

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:18.950
But when you divide that by a denominator
of persons who are infected,

00:03:18.974 --> 00:03:22.236
there are many, many more persons infected
than there were with SARS.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.112
The case fatality ratio,

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:28.648
that is the ratio of deaths
to the numbers of cases in SARS,

00:03:28.672 --> 00:03:30.276
was about 10 percent.
