00:04:29.587 --> 00:04:32.725
[What's the timeline for a vaccine?]

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.813
Vaccines are under development right now,

00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:36.971
there's a lot of research going on.

00:04:36.995 --> 00:04:40.908
That research requires first
that the vaccine be developed,

00:04:40.932 --> 00:04:45.330
then that it be studied for safety
and effectiveness in animals,

00:04:45.354 --> 00:04:48.861
who are challenged with the virus
after they are vaccinated,

00:04:48.885 --> 00:04:51.234
and then it must go into human studies.

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:53.371
The animal studies have not yet begun,

00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:55.942
but will soon begin for certain vaccines.

00:04:55.966 --> 00:04:58.109
And it's thought
that by the end of the year,

00:04:58.133 --> 00:04:59.291
or early next year,

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:01.738
there may be some candidate vaccines
