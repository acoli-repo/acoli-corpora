00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:02.621
Well, the most concerned are people

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.760
who are, first of all,
in developing countries

00:01:05.784 --> 00:01:08.569
and who don't have access
to good medical care

00:01:08.593 --> 00:01:11.292
and may not have access
at all to a hospital,

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:14.450
should an epidemic occur in their country.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.228
Those people would be at great risk,

00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:17.664
especially the elderly.

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:20.315
Elderly in all populations are at risk,

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:23.014
but especially those
who can't get to oxygen.

00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:24.670
In industrialized countries,

00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:27.404
it's the very elderly
who have comorbidities,

00:01:27.428 --> 00:01:29.682
who have diabetes,
who have other diseases,

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:30.918
who are at risk.
