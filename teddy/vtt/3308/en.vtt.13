00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.958
Today, there are over
seven billion people.

00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:34.022
And when those people come into the world,

00:06:34.046 --> 00:06:35.292
they demand more food,

00:06:35.316 --> 00:06:37.101
they demand a whole series of things

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:38.562
and they live closer together.

00:06:38.586 --> 00:06:42.172
In fact, we're an urban world,
where people live in urban areas.

00:06:42.196 --> 00:06:45.105
And at the same time,
we're growing more animals,

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.653
and those animals are contributing
food to humans as well.

00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:50.828
So what we see

00:06:50.852 --> 00:06:55.776
is that that animal-human interface
is becoming closer and closer together.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.679
And this intensive agriculture of animals

00:06:59.703 --> 00:07:02.497
and this intensive increase
in human populations
