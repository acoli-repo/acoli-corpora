00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:02.309
[As of the morning February 27, 2020,

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.810
there were at least 82,000 confirmed
cases worldwide of the coronavirus

00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:07.135
and 2,810 deaths from it.

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:10.946
TED invited Dr. David Heymann to share
the latest findings about the outbreak.]

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.611
[What happens if you get infected
with the coronavirus?]

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:16.435
This looks like a very mild disease,
like a common cold,

00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:18.228
in the majority of people.

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:22.752
There are certain people who get infected
and have very serious illness;

00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:24.227
among them are health workers.

00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:26.061
It's a very serious infection in them,

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:28.410
as they get a higher dose
than normal people,

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:30.831
and at the same time,
they have no immunity.
