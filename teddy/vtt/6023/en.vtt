00:00:06.413 --> 00:00:08.371
In the middle of the 19th century,

00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:13.496
the California gold rush brought thousands
of settlers to America’s west coast.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:18.579
But finding gold may have been easier 
than transporting it back east.

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.913
The only hope for avoiding 
a grueling six month wagon journey

00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:26.288
was to travel the narrowest portion 
of the continent—

00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:29.579
the 48-kilometer Isthmus of Panama.
