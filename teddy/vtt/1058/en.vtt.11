00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:32.550
We'd take action. It may not be good action, but we would take action.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.896
(Laughter)

00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:35.961
We can't sit idly by here either.

00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:38.019
This is happening today.

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:40.221
Privacy is not an option,

00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:42.062
and it shouldn't be the price we accept

00:05:42.062 --> 00:05:43.768
for just getting on the Internet.

00:05:43.768 --> 00:05:47.385
Our voices matter and our actions matter even more.

00:05:47.385 --> 00:05:50.458
Today we've launched Collusion.

00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:52.625
You can download it, install it in Firefox,

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:55.167
to see who is tracking you across the Web

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:57.548
and following you through the digital woods.

00:05:57.548 --> 00:06:00.610
Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard.
