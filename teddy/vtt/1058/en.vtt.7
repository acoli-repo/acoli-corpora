00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.250
and I asked her, "Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school?"

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.250
And she, of course, naturally as a nine-year-old,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.369
looked at me and said quizzically, "What's literacy?"

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:39.125
So I sent her online, of course, to look it up.

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:41.250
Now let me stop here.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.030
We are not even two bites into breakfast

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.346
and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me.

00:03:48.346 --> 00:03:51.604
I have navigated to a total of four.

00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:54.894
So let me fast-forward through the rest of my day.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.191
I go to work, I check email,

00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:59.881
I log onto a few more social sites, I blog,

00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:03.375
I check more news reports, I share some of those news reports,
