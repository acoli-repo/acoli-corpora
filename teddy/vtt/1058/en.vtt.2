00:00:56.995 --> 00:01:00.080
And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.430
we are like Hansel and Gretel

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.000
leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.442
everywhere we travel through the digital woods.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:12.292
We are leaving our birthdays, our places of residence,

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:14.654
our interests and preferences,

00:01:14.654 --> 00:01:16.743
our relationships,

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:20.504
our financial histories, and on and on it goes.

00:01:20.504 --> 00:01:22.500
Now don't get me wrong,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.987
I'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing.

00:01:25.987 --> 00:01:28.365
In fact, when I know the data that's being shared

00:01:28.365 --> 00:01:31.125
and I'm asked explicitly for my consent,
