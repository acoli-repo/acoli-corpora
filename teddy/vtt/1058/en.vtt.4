And when all of that data is held,

00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:04.048
they can do almost whatever they want with it.

00:02:04.048 --> 00:02:07.417
This is an area today that has very few regulations

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:09.167
and even fewer rules.

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:12.750
Except for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.875
it's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked.

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:20.279
So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further.

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.985
The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:27.458
and it's an experimental browser add-on

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:29.625
that you can install in your Firefox browser

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:34.321
that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you.
