00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:34.321
that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you.

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.917
The red dots you see up there

00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:38.833
are sites that are behavioral tracking

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:42.042
that I have not navigated to, but are following me.

00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:45.190
The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.556
And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me,

00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:50.656
but I have no idea who they are.

00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:52.750
All of them are connected, as you can see,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.000
to form a picture of me on the Web.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.542
And this is my profile.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:59.952
So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal.

00:02:59.952 --> 00:03:03.375
I installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago
