00:01:28.365 --> 00:01:31.125
and I'm asked explicitly for my consent,

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:33.542
I want some sites to understand my habits.

It helps them suggest books for me to read

or movies for my family to watch

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:40.731

But when I don't know and when I haven't been asked,

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:54.000
In fact, there's an entire industry formed

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.337
around following us through the digital woods

00:01:56.337 --> 00:01:58.681
and compiling a profile on each of us.

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.596
And when all of that data is held,
