00:00:00.594 --> 00:00:03.819
I don't know why, but I'm continually amazed to think

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:06.417
that two and a half billion of us around the world

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:08.833
are connected to each other through the Internet

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:10.958
and that at any point in time

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:13.708
more than 30 percent of the world's population

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:18.823
can go online to learn, to create and to share.

00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:22.386
And the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this

00:00:22.386 --> 00:00:24.167
is also continuing to go grow.

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:25.625
A recent study showed

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.125
that the young generation alone

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:30.396
is spending over eight hours a day online.
