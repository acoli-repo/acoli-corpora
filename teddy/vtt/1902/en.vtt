00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It was an incredible surprise to me

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Because, basically,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I work as a theoretical physicist.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I develop and test models of the Big Bang,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
using observational data.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I've been moonlighting for the last five years

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
helping with a project in Africa.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And, I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
People wonder, you know, "How do you have time to do this?" And so on.
