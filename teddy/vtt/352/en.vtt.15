00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:30.786
and surface tension

00:07:30.786 --> 00:07:34.322
to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself.

00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:35.767
So that's where the lenses go.

00:07:35.767 --> 00:07:37.379
There are some light sources.

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:38.764
And essentially, in the end,

00:07:38.764 --> 00:07:41.942
all the parts line up because of origami,

00:07:41.942 --> 00:07:45.213
because of the fact that origami allows us

00:07:45.213 --> 00:07:48.193
micron-scale precision of optical alignment.

00:07:48.193 --> 00:07:50.822
So even though this looks like a simple toy,

00:07:50.822 --> 00:07:52.736
the aspects of engineering that go in

00:07:52.736 --> 00:07:55.422
something like this are fairly sophisticated.

00:07:55.422 --> 00:07:58.657
So here is another obvious thing that we would do,

00:07:58.657 --> 00:08:00.250
typically, if I was going to show
