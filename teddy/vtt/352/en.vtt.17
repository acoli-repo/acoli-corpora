Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves.

00:08:30.624 --> 00:08:32.718
And I want to leave you with this picture.

00:08:32.718 --> 00:08:34.643
I had not anticipated this before,

00:08:34.643 --> 00:08:36.330
but a really interesting link

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.225
between hands-on science education

00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:39.483
and global health.

00:08:39.483 --> 00:08:42.409
What are the tools that we're actually providing

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.589
the kids who are going to fight

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:46.507
this monster soup for tomorrow?

00:08:46.507 --> 00:08:48.865
I would love for them to be able to just print out

00:08:48.865 --> 00:08:50.994
a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets.

00:08:50.994 --> 00:08:53.900
Thank you.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.343
