00:03:58.557 --> 00:04:01.097
for example right here.

00:04:01.097 --> 00:04:02.609
We didn't want to change this,

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.981
because this is the standard

00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:05.834
that's been optimized for over the years,

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:08.530
and many health workers are actually used to this.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.991
So this is what changes,

00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:12.158
but the standard stains all remain the same

00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:13.933
for many different diseases.

00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:16.865
You pop this in.

00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:20.751
There is an XY stage,

00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:22.724
and then there is a focusing stage,

00:04:22.724 --> 00:04:24.590
which is a flexure mechanism

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.143
that's built in paper itself that allows us to move

00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:30.124
and focus the lenses by micron steps.
