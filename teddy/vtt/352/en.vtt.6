00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.081
What you see here is all the possible components

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:07.506
to build a functional bright-field
and fluorescence microscope.

00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:09.315
So, there are three stages:

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:12.064
There is the optical stage, the illumination stage

00:03:12.064 --> 00:03:14.532
and the mask-holding stage.

00:03:14.532 --> 00:03:16.404
And there are micro optics at the bottom

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:19.278
that's actually embedded in the paper itself.

00:03:19.278 --> 00:03:21.782
What you do is, you take it on,

00:03:21.782 --> 00:03:24.558
and just like you are playing like a toy,

00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:27.645
which it is,

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:31.614
I tab it off,
