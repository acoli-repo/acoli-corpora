00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:31.008
that an English mom in her teacup

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.144
actually was drinking a monster soup,

00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:37.293
not very far from here. This is from London.

00:00:37.293 --> 00:00:40.135
Fast forward 200 years.

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:42.267
We still have this monster soup around,

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:45.122
and it's taken hold in the developing countries

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.538
around the tropical belt.

00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:50.101
Just for malaria itself,

00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.546
there are a million deaths a year,

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:54.292
and more than a billion people

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:56.940
that need to be tested because they are at risk

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.175
for different species of malarial infections.
