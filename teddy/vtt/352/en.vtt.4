This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '40s

00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:03.489
using the exact same setup
that we actually use today

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:06.173
for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram

00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:08.618
in Sevagram in India.

00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:11.945
Two of my students, Jim and James,

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:14.265
traveled around India and Thailand,

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:16.517
starting to think about this problem a lot.

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:18.992
We saw all kinds of donated equipment.

00:02:18.992 --> 00:02:21.904
We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses.

00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:24.099
And we saw people who had a functional microscope

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.050
but just didn't know how to even turn it on.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.690
What grew out of that work and that trip

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.441
was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes.
