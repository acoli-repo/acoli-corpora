00:05:58.988 --> 00:06:00.561
in the cross-section pattern.

00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.117
Another example, one of my favorite insects,

00:06:03.117 --> 00:06:05.094
I love to hate this one,

00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:06.875
is a mosquito,

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:10.637
and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens.

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:14.000
Right there.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.213
All from the simple setup that I actually described.

00:06:18.213 --> 00:06:19.986
So my wife has been field testing

00:06:19.986 --> 00:06:21.986
some of our microscopes

00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:24.467
by washing my clothes whenever I forget them

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.496
in the dryer.

00:06:26.496 --> 00:06:29.296
So it turns out they're waterproof, and --

00:06:29.296 --> 00:06:31.084
