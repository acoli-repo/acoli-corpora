00:06:29.296 --> 00:06:31.084
(Laughter) —

00:06:31.084 --> 00:06:33.582
right here is just fluorescent water,

00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:35.132
and I don't know if you can actually see this.

00:06:35.132 --> 00:06:37.521
This also shows you how 
the projection scope works.

00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:41.174
You get to see the beam the 
way it's projected and bent.

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.139
Can we get the lights back on again?

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.926
So I'm quickly going to show you,

00:06:48.926 --> 00:06:50.975
since I'm running out of time,

00:06:50.975 --> 00:06:53.401
in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture,

00:06:53.401 --> 00:06:56.481
the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing,

00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:59.603
so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs.

00:06:59.603 --> 00:07:02.462
