00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.441
was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes.

00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:35.264
So what is a Foldscope?

00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:38.813
A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope,

00:02:38.813 --> 00:02:41.943
a platform for fluorescence, bright-field,

00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:43.518
polarization, projection,

00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:46.086
all kinds of advanced microscopy

00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:49.301
built purely by folding paper.

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:52.162
So, now you think, how is that possible?

00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:54.125
I'm going to show you some examples here,

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:55.926
and we will run through some of them.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:59.710
It starts with a single sheet of paper.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.081
What you see here is all the possible components
