00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:31.158
So what I would like to do is,

00:05:31.158 --> 00:05:32.784
if we could dim the lights, please,

00:05:32.784 --> 00:05:36.449
it turns out foldscopes are
also projection microscopes.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.983
I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn --

00:05:38.983 --> 00:05:40.736
go to the back of the wall --

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:42.444
and just project, and this way you will see

00:05:42.444 --> 00:05:44.564
exactly what I would see.

00:05:44.564 --> 00:05:46.350
What you're looking at --

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.733
(Applause) —

00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:51.369
This is a cross-section of a compound eye,

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:53.720
and when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.964
I am going through the z-axis.

00:05:55.964 --> 00:05:58.988
You actually see how the lenses are cut together

00:05:58.988 --> 00:06:00.561
in the cross-section pattern.
