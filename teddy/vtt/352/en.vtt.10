00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.291
I have 30 different foldscopes

00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:08.022
of different configurations all in a single folder.

00:05:08.022 --> 00:05:09.834
And I'm going to pick one randomly.

00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:11.916
This one, it turns out, is actually designed

00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:13.479
specifically for malaria,

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.790
because it has the fluorescent filters built

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.887
specifically for diagnosing malaria.

00:05:17.887 --> 00:05:21.815
So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes

00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:23.581
comes out of this.

00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:26.520
So up till now, you didn't actually see

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.477
what I would see from one of these setups.

00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:31.158
So what I would like to do is,
