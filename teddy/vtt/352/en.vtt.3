00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:30.910
And that's primarily because scalability

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.942
of the diagnostics is completely out of reach.

00:01:33.942 --> 00:01:37.858
And remember that number: one billion.

00:01:37.858 --> 00:01:41.759
The problem lies with the microscope itself.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.135
Even though the pinnacle of modern science,

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:47.270
research microscopes are
not designed for field testing.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.950
Neither were they first designed

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.101
for diagnostics at all.

00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:54.489
They are heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain,

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.790
and cost a lot of money.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.195
