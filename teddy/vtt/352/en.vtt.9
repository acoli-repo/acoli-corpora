and focus the lenses by micron steps.

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:32.257
So what's really interesting about this object,

00:04:32.257 --> 00:04:34.140
and my students hate when I do this,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.901
but I'm going to do this anyway,

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.857
is these are rugged devices.

00:04:37.857 --> 00:04:42.434
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor

00:04:42.434 --> 00:04:45.386
and really try to stomp on it.

00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:47.761
And they last, even though they're designed

00:04:47.761 --> 00:04:51.224
from a very flexible material, like paper.

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:54.076
Another fun fact is, this is what we actually

00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:58.131
send out there as a standard diagnostic tool,

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.900
but here in this envelope

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.291
I have 30 different foldscopes
