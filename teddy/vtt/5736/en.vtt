A few years ago, a stranger
sitting next to me on a plane,

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:06.788
asked what I did for a living.

00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:12.079
I told him that I'm an archeologist
and I study the ancient Maya.

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:15.163
He said, "Wow, I love archeology,"

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:19.079
and told me how excited he gets
when hearing about new finds.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.079
Then he told me how amazing it is

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:27.079
that aliens from the planet Nibiru
had come to Earth

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:31.371
and established the ancient Sumerian
culture in Mesopotamia.
