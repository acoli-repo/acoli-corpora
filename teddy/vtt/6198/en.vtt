What stands between Africa's current
prostrate condition

00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:10.088
and a future of prosperity and abundance
for its long-suffering populations?

00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:12.156
One word:

00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:13.902
knowledge.

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:19.316
If Africa is to become a continent
that offers the best life for humans,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.298
it must become a knowledge society

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.590
immediately.

00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:28.697
This is what I have called
"Africa's knowledge imperative."

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:33.754
Our universities must reduce emphasis
on producing manpower
