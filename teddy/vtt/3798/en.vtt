00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:02.773
I'm thrilled to be here tonight

00:00:02.773 --> 00:00:05.152
to share with you something
we've been working on

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:07.242
for over two years,

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:09.796
and it's in the area
of additive manufacturing,

00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:12.513
also known as 3D printing.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.231
You see this object here.

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:18.039
It looks fairly simple,
but it's quite complex at the same time.

00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:21.800
It's a set of concentric
geodesic structures

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.795
with linkages between each one.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:30.797
In its context, it is not manufacturable
by traditional manufacturing techniques.
