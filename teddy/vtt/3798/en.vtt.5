00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.817
And our approach would be,
if we could do this,

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:35.671
then we could fundamentally address
the three issues holding back 3D printing

00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:38.086
from being a manufacturing process.

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:40.617
One, 3D printing takes forever.

00:02:40.617 --> 00:02:45.841
There are mushrooms that grow faster
than 3D printed parts. (Laughter)

00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.417
The layer by layer process

00:02:49.417 --> 00:02:52.319
leads to defects
in mechanical properties,

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.266
and if we could grow continuously,
we could eliminate those defects.

00:02:56.266 --> 00:03:01.398
And in fact, if we could grow really fast,
we could also start using materials
