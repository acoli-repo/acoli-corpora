00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:30.099
Light and oxygen work in different ways.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.141
Light can take a resin
and convert it to a solid,

00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:35.295
can convert a liquid to a solid.

00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:38.829
Oxygen inhibits that process.

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.080
So light and oxygen
are polar opposites from one another

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.588
from a chemical point of view,

00:03:44.588 --> 00:03:48.001
and if we can control spatially
the light and oxygen,

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:49.948
we could control this process.

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:53.739
And we refer to this as CLIP.
[Continuous Liquid Interface Production.]

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.615
It has three functional components.

00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:00.326
One, it has a reservoir
that holds the puddle,
