00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:31.261
the mesoscale.

00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:34.094
And subtractive techniques
from the silicon industry

00:09:34.094 --> 00:09:35.510
can't do that very well.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.159
They can't etch wafers that well.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:39.109
But this process is so gentle,

00:09:39.109 --> 00:09:41.594
we can grow these objects
up from the bottom

00:09:41.594 --> 00:09:43.590
using additive manufacturing

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.843
and make amazing things
in tens of seconds,

00:09:45.843 --> 00:09:47.932
opening up new sensor technologies,

00:09:47.932 --> 00:09:50.417
new drug delivery techniques,

00:09:50.417 --> 00:09:54.149
new lab-on-a-chip applications,
really game-changing stuff.

00:09:55.149 --> 00:09:59.983
So the opportunity of making
a part in real time

00:09:59.983 --> 00:10:02.816
that has the properties to be a final part
