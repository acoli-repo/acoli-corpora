00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.506
In addition, as our ability
to deliver liquid to that interface,

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:04.246
we can go 1,000 times faster I believe,

00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:07.803
and that in fact opens up the opportunity
for generating a lot of heat,

00:06:07.803 --> 00:06:11.866
and as a chemical engineer,
I get very excited at heat transfer

00:06:11.866 --> 00:06:16.045
and the idea that we might one day
have water-cooled 3D printers,

00:06:16.045 --> 00:06:18.437
because they're going so fast.

00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:22.500
In addition, because we're growing things,
we eliminate the layers,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.474
and the parts are monolithic.

00:06:24.474 --> 00:06:26.564
You don't see the surface structure.

00:06:26.564 --> 00:06:29.057
You have molecularly smooth surfaces.

00:06:29.057 --> 00:06:33.297
And the mechanical properties
of most parts made in a 3D printer
