00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:01.477
such that the stent could go away
after 18 months: really-game changing.

00:09:01.477 --> 00:09:05.633
Or digital dentistry, and making
these kinds of structures

00:09:05.633 --> 00:09:08.814
even while you're in the dentist chair.

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:11.530
And look at the structures
that my students are making

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.504
at the University of North Carolina.

00:09:13.504 --> 00:09:16.313
These are amazing microscale structures.

00:09:16.313 --> 00:09:19.309
You know, the world is really good
at nano-fabrication.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:23.599
Moore's Law has driven things
from 10 microns and below.

00:09:23.599 --> 00:09:25.201
We're really good at that,

00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:29.241
but it's actually very hard to make things
from 10 microns to 1,000 microns,

00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:31.261
the mesoscale.
