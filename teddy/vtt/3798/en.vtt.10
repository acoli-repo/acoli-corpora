00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:00.910
and do this process over and over again.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.234
But with our very special window,

00:05:03.234 --> 00:05:06.563
what we're able to do is,
with oxygen coming through the bottom

00:05:06.563 --> 00:05:07.816
as light hits it,

00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:11.926
that oxygen inhibits the reaction,

00:05:11.926 --> 00:05:14.550
and we form a dead zone.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.869
This dead zone is on the order
of tens of microns thick,

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:22.096
so that's two or three diameters
of a red blood cell,

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:24.627
right at the window interface
that remains a liquid,

00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:26.577
and we pull this object up,

00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:28.969
and as we talked about in a Science paper,

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.682
as we change the oxygen content,
we can change the dead zone thickness.
