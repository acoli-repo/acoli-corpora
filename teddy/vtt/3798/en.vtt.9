00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.796
It's not only transparent to light
but it's permeable to oxygen.

00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:34.455
It's got characteristics
like a contact lens.

00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:37.716
So we can see how the process works.

00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:41.130
You can start to see that
as you lower a stage in there,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.309
in a traditional process,
with an oxygen-impermeable window,

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:47.148
you make a two-dimensional pattern

00:04:48.008 --> 00:04:51.370
and you end up gluing that onto the window
with a traditional window,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.922
and so in order to introduce
the next layer, you have to separate it,

00:04:54.922 --> 00:04:58.451
introduce new resin, reposition it,

00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:00.910
and do this process over and over again.
