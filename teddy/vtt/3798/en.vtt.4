in essentially real time

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.749
with essentially no waste

And could we be inspired by Hollywood

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:26.384
and come up with ways
to actually try to get this to work?

00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:28.450
And that was our challenge.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.817
And our approach would be,
if we could do this,
