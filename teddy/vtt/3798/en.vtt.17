00:08:26.176 --> 00:08:31.129
from better fuel-efficient cars
dealing with great lattice properties

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:33.080
with high strength-to-weight ratio,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.508
new turbine blades,
all sorts of wonderful things.

00:08:37.468 --> 00:08:42.623
Think about if you need a stent
in an emergency situation,

00:08:42.623 --> 00:08:46.593
instead of the doctor pulling off
a stent out of the shelf

00:08:46.593 --> 00:08:48.822
that was just standard sizes,

00:08:48.822 --> 00:08:52.978
having a stent that's designed
for you, for your own anatomy

00:08:52.978 --> 00:08:54.789
with your own tributaries,

00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:58.038
printed in an emergency situation
in real time out of the properties

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:01.477
such that the stent could go away
after 18 months: really-game changing.
