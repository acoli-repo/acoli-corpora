It's actually 2D printing
over and over again,

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:07.761
and it in fact uses the technologies
associated with 2D printing.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:13.360
Think about inkjet printing where you
lay down ink on a page to make letters,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.346
and then do that over and over again
to build up a three-dimensional object.

00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:20.417
In microelectronics, they use something

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:22.737
called lithography to do
the same sort of thing,

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:24.945
to make the transistors
and integrated circuits

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:26.997
and build up a structure several times.

00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:29.399
These are all 2D printing technologies.
