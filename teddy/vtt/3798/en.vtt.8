00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:00.326
One, it has a reservoir
that holds the puddle,

00:04:00.326 --> 00:04:02.205
just like the T-1000.

00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:04.621
At the bottom of the reservoir
is a special window.

00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:06.112
I'll come back to that.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:09.892
In addition, it has a stage
that will lower into the puddle

00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:12.481
and pull the object out of the liquid.

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:16.285
The third component
is a digital light projection system

00:04:16.285 --> 00:04:18.305
underneath the reservoir,

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:21.578
illuminating with light
in the ultraviolet region.

00:04:22.048 --> 00:04:25.271
Now, the key is that this window
in the bottom of this reservoir,

00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:28.150
it's a composite,
it's a very special window.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.796
It's not only transparent to light
but it's permeable to oxygen.
