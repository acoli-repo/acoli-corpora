00:07:59.716 --> 00:08:02.678
the so-called digital thread
in digital manufacturing.

00:08:02.678 --> 00:08:07.717
We go from a CAD drawing, a design,
to a prototype to manufacturing.

00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:10.440
Often, the digital thread is broken
right at prototype,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.872
because you can't go
all the way to manufacturing

00:08:12.872 --> 00:08:16.587
because most parts don't have
the properties to be a final part.

00:08:16.587 --> 00:08:18.978
We now can connect the digital thread

00:08:18.978 --> 00:08:23.227
all the way from design
to prototyping to manufacturing,

00:08:23.227 --> 00:08:26.176
and that opportunity
really opens up all sorts of things,

00:08:26.176 --> 00:08:31.129
from better fuel-efficient cars
dealing with great lattice properties
