00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.682
as we change the oxygen content,
we can change the dead zone thickness.

00:05:33.682 --> 00:05:37.374
And so we have a number of key variables
that we control: oxygen content,

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:40.439
the light, the light intensity,
the dose to cure,

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:42.401
the viscosity, the geometry,

00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:45.817
and we use very sophisticated software
to control this process.

00:05:46.697 --> 00:05:49.460
The result is pretty staggering.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.196
It's 25 to 100 times faster
than traditional 3D printers,

00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:56.170
which is game-changing.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.506
In addition, as our ability
to deliver liquid to that interface,
