00:02:56.266 --> 00:03:01.398
And in fact, if we could grow really fast,
we could also start using materials

00:03:01.398 --> 00:03:06.042
that are self-curing,
and we could have amazing properties.

00:03:06.042 --> 00:03:10.151
So if we could pull this off,
imitate Hollywood,

00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.912
we could in fact address 3D manufacturing.

00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:17.953
Our approach is to use
some standard knowledge

00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:20.553
in polymer chemistry

00:03:20.553 --> 00:03:27.152
to harness light and oxygen
to grow parts continuously.

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:30.099
Light and oxygen work in different ways.
