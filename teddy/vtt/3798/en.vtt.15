00:07:29.368 --> 00:07:31.978
We can make materials
that have incredible strength,

00:07:32.828 --> 00:07:36.404
high strength-to-weight ratio,
really strong materials,

00:07:36.404 --> 00:07:38.517
really great elastomers,

00:07:38.517 --> 00:07:41.242
so throw that in the audience there.

00:07:41.242 --> 00:07:43.878
So great material properties.

00:07:43.878 --> 00:07:47.293
And so the opportunity now,
if you actually make a part

00:07:47.293 --> 00:07:50.973
that has the properties
to be a final part,

00:07:50.973 --> 00:07:54.073
and you do it in game-changing speeds,

00:07:54.073 --> 00:07:56.860
you can actually transform manufacturing.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.716
Right now, in manufacturing,
what happens is,

00:07:59.716 --> 00:08:02.678
the so-called digital thread
in digital manufacturing.
