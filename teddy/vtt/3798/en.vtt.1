00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:30.797
In its context, it is not manufacturable
by traditional manufacturing techniques.

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:35.290
It has a symmetry such
that you can't injection mold it.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.879
You can't even manufacture it
through milling.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.117
This is a job for a 3D printer,

00:00:42.117 --> 00:00:46.598
but most 3D printers would take between
three and 10 hours to fabricate it,

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:50.824
and we're going to take the risk tonight
to try to fabricate it onstage

00:00:50.824 --> 00:00:53.401
during this 10-minute talk.

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.440
Wish us luck.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.624
Now, 3D printing is actually a misnomer.

00:00:59.624 --> 00:01:03.399
It's actually 2D printing
over and over again,
