00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.835
the entire polymer
chemistry textbook at this,

00:07:00.835 --> 00:07:04.826
and we're able to design chemistries
that can give rise to the properties

00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:07.868
you really want in a 3D-printed object.

00:07:07.868 --> 00:07:09.205
(Applause)

00:07:09.205 --> 00:07:12.439
There it is. That's great.

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:17.627
You always take the risk that something
like this won't work onstage, right?

00:07:18.177 --> 00:07:21.056
But we can have materials
with great mechanical properties.

00:07:21.056 --> 00:07:23.494
For the first time, we can have elastomers

00:07:23.494 --> 00:07:25.955
that are high elasticity
or high dampening.

00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:29.368
Think about vibration control
or great sneakers, for example.

00:07:29.368 --> 00:07:31.978
We can make materials
that have incredible strength,
