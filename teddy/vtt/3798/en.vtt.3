Now, I'm a chemist,
a material scientist too,

00:01:33.987 --> 00:01:36.711
and my co-inventors
are also material scientists,

00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:39.010
one a chemist, one a physicist,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.936
and we began to be
interested in 3D printing.

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:47.531
And very often, as you know,
new ideas are often simple connections

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:51.274
between people with different experiences
in different communities,

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:52.751
and that's our story.

00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:56.122
Now, we were inspired

00:01:56.122 --> 00:02:00.893
by the "Terminator 2" scene for T-1000,
