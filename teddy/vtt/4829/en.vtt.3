They know, for example, that
on a particular route,

00:01:30.788 --> 00:01:33.788
the probability that each individual
customer will show up

00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:38.246
on time is 90 percent. For
the sake of simplicity,

00:01:38.288 --> 00:01:41.788
will assume that every customer is
traveling individually rather than

00:01:41.788 --> 00:01:47.413
as families or groups, then if there
are 180 seats on the plane

00:01:47.413 --> 00:01:49.371
and they sell 180 tickets,

00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:53.954
the most likely result is that
162 passengers will board.

00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:58.788
But of course, you could also end up
with more passengers or fewer.

00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:04.329
The probability for each value is given by
what's called a binomial distribution,
