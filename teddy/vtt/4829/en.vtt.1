While often infuriating for the customer,

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:35.287
overbooking happens because it increases
profits while also letting businesses

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:39.871
optimize their resources. They know that
not everyone will show up to their

00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:42.079
appointments, reservations and flights,

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:45.121
so they make more available than
they actually have to offer.

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:50.829
Airlines are the classical example,
partially because it happens so often,

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:54.787
about 50000 people get bumped
off their flights each year.

00:00:55.954 --> 00:00:59.162
That figure comes at little surprise
to the airlines themselves,

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:02.746
which used statistics to determine
exactly how many tickets to sell.
