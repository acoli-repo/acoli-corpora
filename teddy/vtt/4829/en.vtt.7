00:03:26.788 --> 00:03:32.163
and so on. Multiply these probabilities
by the revenue for each case,

00:03:32.663 --> 00:03:37.829
add them all up and subtract the sum from
the earnings by 195 sold tickets

00:03:38.163 --> 00:03:42.329
and you get the expected revenue
for selling 195 tickets.

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.913
By repeating this calculation for various
numbers of extra tickets,

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:51.913
the airline can find the one likely to
yield the highest revenue in this example.

00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:54.788
That's 198 tickets from which

00:03:54.788 --> 00:03:58.829
the airline will probably make forty eight
thousand seven hundred seventy four

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.496
dollars, almost 4000 more than
without overbooking.
