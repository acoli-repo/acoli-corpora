00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:04.329
The probability for each value is given by
what's called a binomial distribution,

00:02:04.663 --> 00:02:09.079
which peaks at the most likely outcome.
Now let's look at the revenue.

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.954
The airline makes money from each
ticket buyer and loses money

00:02:12.954 --> 00:02:14.579
for each person who gets bumped.

00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:19.954
Let's say a ticket costs 250 dollars and
isn't exchangeable for a later flight

00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:23.788
and the cost of bumping a passenger
is 800 dollars.

00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:28.621
These numbers are just for the sake of
example. Actual amounts vary considerably.

00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:34.871
So here, if you don't sell any extra
tickets, you make 45000 dollars.
