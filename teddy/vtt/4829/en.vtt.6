00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:03.704
But what matters isn't just how good
or bad a scenario is financially,

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.788
but how likely it is to happen. So
how likely is each scenario?

00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:14.371
We can find out by using the binomial
distribution in this example,

00:03:14.538 --> 00:03:20.079
the probability of exactly 195 passengers
boarding is almost zero percent.

00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:26.788
The probability of exactly 184 passengers
boarding is one point one one percent

00:03:26.788 --> 00:03:32.163
and so on. Multiply these probabilities
by the revenue for each case,
