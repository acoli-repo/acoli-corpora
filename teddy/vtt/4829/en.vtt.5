00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:34.871
So here, if you don't sell any extra
tickets, you make 45000 dollars.

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.204
If you sell 15 extras and at least
15 people are no shows,

00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:43.413
you make forty eight thousand
seven hundred fifty dollars.

00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:48.163
That's the best case. In the worst case,
everyone shows up,

00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:51.579
15 unlucky passengers get bumped and

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.038
the revenue will only be thirty six
thousand seven hundred fifty dollars,

00:02:55.454 --> 00:02:59.038
even less than if you only sold 180
tickets in the first place.

00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:03.704
But what matters isn't just how good
or bad a scenario is financially,
