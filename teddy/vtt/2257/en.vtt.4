00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.299
has played a really important role
in shaping the person that I've become.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.619
In 1986, when I was five years old,

00:02:07.643 --> 00:02:10.843
my parents became missionaries
to South Africa.

00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:14.404
And that was during
the last few years of the apartheid,

00:02:14.428 --> 00:02:17.403
so we lived in an all-white neighborhood,

00:02:17.427 --> 00:02:20.561
and I attended an all-white public school,

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:23.172
while my parents helped found
a multiracial church

00:02:23.196 --> 00:02:25.053
in downtown Cape Town.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.521
Because I was so young,

00:02:27.545 --> 00:02:29.822
it was impossible for me to understand

00:02:29.846 --> 00:02:33.847
the magnitude of what was happening
in South Africa at that time.
