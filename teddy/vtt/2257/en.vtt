00:00:01.507 --> 00:00:04.286
If you happened to be
in the town of Lubec, Maine

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.595
in July of 2016,

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:09.567
you may have seen something
a little curious on the horizon

00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:11.669
when you looked out across the bay.

00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:13.625
In the distance,

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:16.235
on an otherwise uninhabited island,

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.957
loomed large black letters
that spelled the word "FOREVER."

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:23.957
The sign was 15 feet tall
and 50 feet wide,

00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:28.307
large enough so that on a clear day,
you really could see "FOREVER,"

00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:32.037
the word perfectly visible
and legible in the distance.
