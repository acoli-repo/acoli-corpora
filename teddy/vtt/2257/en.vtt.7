And that transformed me as a person.

00:03:32.974 --> 00:03:37.831
It instilled in me a sense
of wonder and optimism

00:03:37.855 --> 00:03:41.507
and possibility that permeates
everything I create.

00:03:43.178 --> 00:03:44.803
I make sculptures like "FOREVER"

00:03:44.827 --> 00:03:50.522
as a way of giving physical,
tangible forms to language and time.

00:03:50.908 --> 00:03:53.793
Those powerful but invisible forces

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:58.206
that shape the way we perceive
and experience our realities.

00:03:58.802 --> 00:04:02.910
And in doing so, I try to give
other people the opportunity
