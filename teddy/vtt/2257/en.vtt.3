00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:30.566
to the top of the hill
through waist-high shrubs.

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.205
And in the end,

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.918
"FOREVER" only lasted for three weeks.

00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:38.760
(Laughter)

00:01:38.784 --> 00:01:41.602
So if you're wondering
why I did it at all,

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:44.887
as I often did during that process,

00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:47.537
it might help for you to know
a little bit more about me

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:49.156
and my upbringing.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.672
I grew up in an evangelical
Christian family.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.133
And although I'm an atheist today,

00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:58.686
I've realized that my religious upbringing

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.299
has played a really important role
in shaping the person that I've become.
