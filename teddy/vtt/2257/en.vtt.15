00:07:26.228 --> 00:07:30.387
(Music, birds chirping)

00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:31.744
I always love to see

00:07:31.768 --> 00:07:35.402
how each group of people
finds a different way

00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:38.870
to bridge that physical
and metaphorical divide.

00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:45.045
But as soon as they release their hands
and break that connection,

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:49.123
the words immediately begin
to slouch and fall over

00:07:49.147 --> 00:07:53.369
and eventually return to a lifeless
pile of fabric on the ground.

00:07:54.733 --> 00:08:01.517
(Applause)
