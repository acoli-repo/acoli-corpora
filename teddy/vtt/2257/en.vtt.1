and legible in the distance.

But on some days,

00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:37.148
a thick white fog
would roll in off the ocean,

00:00:37.172 --> 00:00:40.267
erasing the word and the view altogether.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.815
And sometimes, like in this video,

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.211
you could barely see "FOREVER"
peeking out of the shifting fog,

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:52.589
accompanied only by the rhythmic
warning sounds of fog horns.

00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:55.069
(Sound of fog horn)

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.093
(Sound of fog horn)
