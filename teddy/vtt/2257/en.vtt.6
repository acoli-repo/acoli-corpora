00:02:56.921 --> 00:03:00.942
And the thing that left
a long-lasting impression on me

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:03.664
was how the people I met in South Africa

00:03:03.688 --> 00:03:07.807
could envision a better future
for themselves and their country.

00:03:08.228 --> 00:03:11.386
A future they really
believed was possible.

00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:15.831
And then they worked together,
relentlessly, for decades,

00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:19.878
until they achieved
that extraordinary historic change.

00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.222
I was there to see Nelson Mandela
released from prison,

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:29.484
and I watched an entire country
begin a major transformation.

00:03:29.913 --> 00:03:32.313
And that transformed me as a person.
