00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:01.640
to activate an inflatable sculpture.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.492
I put two sensors on a platform
far enough apart

00:07:05.516 --> 00:07:08.529
so that one person
can't make it work on their own.

00:07:08.903 --> 00:07:11.174
But when two or more people work together

00:07:11.198 --> 00:07:13.760
to complete that electrical circuit,

00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:15.717
the inflatable comes to life.

00:07:16.522 --> 00:07:19.252
And it begins to fill with air,

00:07:19.276 --> 00:07:22.847
and the longer people hold hands,
the larger it becomes,

00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:26.204
expanding into the words "You are magic."

00:07:26.228 --> 00:07:30.387
