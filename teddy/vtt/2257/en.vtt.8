00:03:58.802 --> 00:04:02.910
And in doing so, I try to give
other people the opportunity

00:04:02.934 --> 00:04:06.442
to reflect on their own
perception of reality

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:09.566
and inspire them to wonder and imagine

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.805
what else might be possible.

00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:15.244
I often use signs to do this,

00:04:15.268 --> 00:04:20.146
because of how simply and effectively
they're able to grab our attention

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.450
and communicate information.

00:04:22.965 --> 00:04:26.179
They often point out things
we would otherwise overlook,

00:04:26.203 --> 00:04:30.865
like this sign on the side
of the highway in Texas.
