00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.093
(Sound of fog horn)

00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:04.283
It started out as a fairly simple idea,

00:01:04.307 --> 00:01:05.998
albeit a little strange,

00:01:06.022 --> 00:01:08.235
to put the word "FOREVER" in the landscape

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.958
so it could appear
and disappear in the fog.

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:14.674
But it took over a year
to plan and execute,

00:01:14.698 --> 00:01:17.428
and it required the help
of so many people,

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:19.571
like the lobster boat captain,

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:22.809
who helped transport
all of the materials to the island.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.438
And the volunteers, who helped carry
thousands of pounds of wood and steel

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:30.566
to the top of the hill
through waist-high shrubs.
