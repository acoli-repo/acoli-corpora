I want people to feel
the power of collaboration,

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.006
sometimes quite literally.

00:06:35.252 --> 00:06:36.547
A few years ago,

00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:37.969
a friend of mine showed me

00:06:37.993 --> 00:06:42.616
how our bodies can safely conduct
small amounts of electricity.

00:06:42.982 --> 00:06:45.680
And if you hold hands with another person,

00:06:45.704 --> 00:06:49.355
a small electrical current
can pass through your held hands

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:53.338
and become like a switch
that can trigger something else to happen.

00:06:54.275 --> 00:06:58.981
So last year, I used
that form of human connection

00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:01.640
to activate an inflatable sculpture.
