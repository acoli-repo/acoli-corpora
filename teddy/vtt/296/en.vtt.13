00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.778
that's right there on the bottom, 
about to puncture through tissue.

00:06:31.778 --> 00:06:34.839
And you'll see that 
right at the moment of puncture,

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.892
right there, the mechanism unlocks 
and retracts that tip back.

00:06:39.892 --> 00:06:42.236
I want to show it to you again, a little closer up.

00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:44.428
You're going to see the sharp bladed tip,

00:06:44.428 --> 00:06:46.420
and right when it punctures 
that rubber membrane

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.572
it's going to disappear
into this white blunt sheath.

00:06:50.572 --> 00:06:52.437
Right there.

00:06:52.437 --> 00:06:57.101
That happens within four 100ths 
of a second after puncture.

00:06:57.101 --> 00:07:00.901
And because this device is designed
to address the physics of puncture
