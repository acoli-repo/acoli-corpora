00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:02.040
and he was talking about what
I could expect for the recovery,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.482
and what was going to happen.

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:05.900
He said, "Do you have any questions?"
And I said, "Just one, doc.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.374
What kind of trocar do you use?"

00:08:09.374 --> 00:08:12.879
So my favorite quote 
about laparoscopic surgery

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:15.525
comes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus:

00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:19.189
"It is puncture itself that causes risk."

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:22.325
That's my favorite quote 
because H.C. Jacobaeus

00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:26.365
was the first person to ever perform 
laparoscopic surgery on humans,

00:08:26.365 --> 00:08:29.797
and he wrote that in 1912.

00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:35.581
This is a problem that's been injuring and
even killing people for over 100 years.
