00:05:29.337 --> 00:05:32.449
and that is the plunge.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.353
But what if right at the moment of puncture

00:05:36.353 --> 00:05:37.977
you could pull that tip back,

00:05:37.977 --> 00:05:40.990
actually oppose the forward acceleration?

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.127
That's what I set out to do.

00:05:43.127 --> 00:05:44.447
So imagine you have a device

00:05:44.447 --> 00:05:47.647
and it's got some kind of sharp tip 
to cut through tissue.

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:50.860
What's the simplest way 
you could pull that tip back?

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.671
I chose a spring.

00:05:52.671 --> 00:05:55.255
So when you extend that spring, 
you extend that tip out

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:57.470
so it's ready to puncture tissue,

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.910
the spring wants to pull the tip back.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.663
How do you keep the tip in place
