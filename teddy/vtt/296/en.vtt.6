00:02:58.283 --> 00:03:01.483
to hang something in your apartment.

00:03:01.483 --> 00:03:05.395
There's that moment when the drill
first punctures through the wall

00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:09.047
and there's this plunge. Right?

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.430
And he looked at me and he said,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.901
"You mean like when they drill 
into people's brains?"

00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.233
And I said, "Excuse me?" (Laughter)

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.281
And then I looked it up and they
do drill into people's brains.

00:03:22.281 --> 00:03:24.345
A lot of neurosurgical procedures

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:28.127
actually start with a drill
incision through the skull.

00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:29.912
And if the surgeon isn't careful,

00:03:29.912 --> 00:03:33.496
he can plunge directly into the brain.
