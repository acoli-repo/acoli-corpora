00:06:57.101 --> 00:07:00.901
And because this device is designed
to address the physics of puncture

00:07:00.901 --> 00:07:02.733
and not the specifics of cranial drilling

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:04.940
or laparoscopic surgery, 
or another procedure,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.597
it's applicable across these
different medical disciplines

00:07:07.597 --> 00:07:10.628
and across different length scales.

00:07:10.628 --> 00:07:12.741
But it didn't always look like this.

00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:14.926
This was my first prototype.

00:07:14.926 --> 00:07:17.568
Yes, those are popsicle sticks,

00:07:17.568 --> 00:07:19.470
and there's a rubber band at the top.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.870
It took about 30 minutes to do this, but it worked.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.566
And it proved to me that my idea worked

00:07:24.566 --> 00:07:27.958
and it justified the next couple
years of work on this project.

00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.766
I worked on this because

00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:31.429
this problem really fascinated me.
