00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.663
How do you keep the tip in place

00:06:00.663 --> 00:06:03.127
until the moment of puncture?

00:06:03.127 --> 00:06:05.550
I used this mechanism.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.111
When the tip of the device
is pressed against tissue,

00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:11.951
the mechanism expands outwards 
and wedges in place against the wall.

00:06:11.951 --> 00:06:13.655
And the friction that's generated

00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:16.847
locks it in place and prevents
the spring from retracting the tip.

00:06:16.847 --> 00:06:18.734
But right at the moment of puncture,

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:20.798
the tissue can't push back
on the tip anymore.

00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:23.980
So the mechanism unlocks 
and the spring retracts the tip.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.630
Let me show you that 
happening in slow motion.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.278
This is about 2,000 frames a second,

00:06:27.278 --> 00:06:29.150
and I'd like you to notice the tip

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.778
that's right there on the bottom, 
about to puncture through tissue.
