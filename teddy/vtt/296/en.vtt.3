00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:30.617
And the way the surgeon uses this device

00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:32.033
is that he takes it

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.000
and he presses it into the abdomen

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.255
until it punctures through.

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:40.327
And now the reason why 
everyone in the operating room

00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:42.974
was staring at that device on that day

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:46.205
was because he had to be absolutely careful

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:47.672
not to plunge it through

00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:51.613
and puncture it into the organs 
and blood vessels below.

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:53.452
But this problem should seem 
pretty familiar to all of you

00:01:53.452 --> 00:01:56.373
because I'm pretty sure 
you've seen it somewhere else.

00:01:56.373 --> 00:01:58.165
(Laughter)

00:01:58.165 --> 00:01:59.821
Remember this?

00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:03.937
(Applause)
