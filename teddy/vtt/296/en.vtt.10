00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:00.966
Let's go back to drilling through a wall.

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:04.598
So you're applying a force 
on a drill towards the wall.

00:05:04.598 --> 00:05:07.942
And Newton says the wall
is going to apply force back,

00:05:07.942 --> 00:05:09.207
equal and opposite.

00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:11.170
So, as you drill through the wall,

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.100
those forces balance.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.641
But then there's that moment

00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.777
when the drill first punctures
through the other side of the wall,

00:05:16.777 --> 00:05:19.633
and right at that moment 
the wall can't push back anymore.

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:23.100
But your brain hasn't reacted 
to that change in force.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.161
So for that millisecond,

00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:26.793
or however long it takes you 
to react, you're still pushing,

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.337
and that unbalanced force 
causes an acceleration,

00:05:29.337 --> 00:05:32.449
and that is the plunge.
