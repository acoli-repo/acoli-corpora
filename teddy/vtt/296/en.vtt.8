laparoscopic surgery, 
epidurals, and cranial drilling —

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.349
these procedures account 
for over 30,000 complications

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.200
every year in this country alone.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.915
I call that a problem worth solving.

00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:13.240
So let's take a look at some of the devices

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.744
that are used in these types of procedures.

00:04:15.744 --> 00:04:18.969
I mentioned epidurals. This is an epidural needle.

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.286
It's used to puncture through 
the ligaments in the spine

00:04:21.286 --> 00:04:23.725
and deliver anesthesia during childbirth.

00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:26.278
Here's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools.

00:04:26.278 --> 00:04:28.214
These are actually used
to burrow into the bone

00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:31.714
and collect bone marrow
or sample bone lesions.
