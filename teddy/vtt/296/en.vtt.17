00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:35.581
This is a problem that's been injuring and
even killing people for over 100 years.

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:37.815
So it's easy to think that for
every major problem out there

00:08:37.815 --> 00:08:41.751
there's some team of experts 
working around the clock to solve it.

00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:45.100
The truth is that's not always the case.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.545
We have to be better at finding those problems

00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:50.313
and finding ways to solve them.

00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:53.569
So if you come across a problem that grabs you,

00:08:53.569 --> 00:08:55.450
let it keep you up at night.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.593
Allow yourself to be fascinated,

00:08:57.593 --> 00:09:00.505
because there are so many lives to save.
