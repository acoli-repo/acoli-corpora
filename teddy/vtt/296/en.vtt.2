00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:01.277
open incision you might
be used to with surgery,

00:01:01.277 --> 00:01:03.485
a laparoscopic surgery
is where the surgeon creates

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:06.502
these three or more small
incisions in the patient.

00:01:06.502 --> 00:01:09.368
And then inserts these long, thin instruments

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:10.482
and a camera,

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:14.333
and actually does the procedure inside the patient.

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.925
This is great because there's
much less risk of infection,

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:20.085
much less pain, shorter recovery time.

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:22.677
But there is a trade-off,

00:01:22.677 --> 00:01:24.461
because these incisions are created

00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.959
with a long, pointed device

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.423
called a trocar.

00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:30.617
And the way the surgeon uses this device
