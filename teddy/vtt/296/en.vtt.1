00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.698
And since then, the more surgeries I watched,

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.525
the more I realized this is how it is.

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:36.278
In some weird way, it's just
another day at the office.

00:00:36.278 --> 00:00:38.183
But every so often

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:40.281
the music gets turned down,

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:41.711
everyone stops talking,

00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:44.695
and stares at exactly the same thing.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:46.855
And that's when you know
that something absolutely critical

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:49.295
and dangerous is happening.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:50.311
The first time I saw that

00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:51.543
I was watching a type of surgery

00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:53.832
called laparoscopic surgery

00:00:53.832 --> 00:00:56.390
And for those of you who are unfamiliar,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.783
laparoscopic surgery, instead of the large

00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:01.277
open incision you might
be used to with surgery,
