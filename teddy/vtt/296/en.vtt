00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:02.855
The first time I stood
in the operating room

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:04.727
and watched a real surgery,

00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:07.302
I had no idea what to expect.

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:09.277
I was a college student in engineering.

00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:11.477
I thought it was going to be like on TV.

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.382

I think it was Madonna's greatest hits. (Laughter)

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:24.989
And there was plenty of conversation,

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.989
not just about the patient's heart rate,

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.762
but about sports and weekend plans.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.698
And since then, the more surgeries I watched,
