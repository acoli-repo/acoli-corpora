00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:31.429
this problem really fascinated me.

00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:33.558
It kept me up at night.

00:07:33.558 --> 00:07:36.540
But I think it should fascinate you too,

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.442
because I said puncture is everywhere.

00:07:38.442 --> 00:07:42.706
That means at some point 
it's going to be your problem too.

00:07:42.706 --> 00:07:44.266
That first day in the operating room

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:47.250
I never expected to find myself 
on the other end of a trocar.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.140
But last year, I got appendicitis 
when I was visiting Greece.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.970
So I was in the hospital in Athens,

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.458
and the surgeon was telling me

00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:56.594
he was going to perform 
a laparoscopic surgery.

00:07:56.594 --> 00:07:59.346
He was going to remove my appendix 
through these tiny incisions,

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:02.040
and he was talking about what
I could expect for the recovery,
