00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.907
that trocar incisions might 
be the most dangerous step

00:02:31.907 --> 00:02:33.923
in minimally invasive surgery.

00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:36.363
Again in 2009, we see a paper that says

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:38.547
that trocars account for over half

00:02:38.547 --> 00:02:42.234
of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery.

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:43.376
And, oh by the way,

00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:46.970
this hasn't changed for 25 years.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.500
So when I got to graduate school,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.368
this is what I wanted to work on.

00:02:50.368 --> 00:02:52.176
I was trying to explain to a friend of mine

00:02:52.176 --> 00:02:54.291
what exactly I was spending my time doing,

00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:56.107
and I said,

00:02:56.107 --> 00:02:58.283
"It's like when you're drilling through a wall

00:02:58.283 --> 00:03:01.483
to hang something in your apartment.
