00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:03.937
(Applause)

00:02:03.937 --> 00:02:05.813
You knew that at any second

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:07.693
that straw was going to plunge through,

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.278
and you didn't know if it was 
going to go out the other side

00:02:09.278 --> 00:02:10.581
and straight into your hand,

00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:12.277
or if you were going to
get juice everywhere,

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:15.580
but you were terrified. Right?

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.556
Every single time you did this,

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:20.112
you experienced the same
fundamental physics

00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:23.192
that I was watching in the operating room that day.

00:02:23.192 --> 00:02:25.738
And it turns out it really is a problem.

00:02:25.738 --> 00:02:28.530
In 2003, the FDA actually came out and said

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.907
that trocar incisions might 
be the most dangerous step
