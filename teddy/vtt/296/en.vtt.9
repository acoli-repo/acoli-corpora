00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:31.714
and collect bone marrow
or sample bone lesions.

00:04:31.714 --> 00:04:33.624
Here's a bayonette from the Civil War.

00:04:33.624 --> 00:04:36.640
(Laughter)

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.233
If I had told you it was a 
medical puncture device

00:04:39.233 --> 00:04:41.449
you probably would have believed me.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.642
Because what's the difference?

00:04:43.642 --> 00:04:45.577
So, the more I did this research

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.161
the more I thought there has to be

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.190
a better way to do this.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.609
And for me the key to this problem

00:04:51.609 --> 00:04:54.020
is that all these different puncture devices

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.822
share a common set of fundamental physics.

00:04:57.822 --> 00:04:59.374
So what are those physics?

00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:00.966
Let's go back to drilling through a wall.
