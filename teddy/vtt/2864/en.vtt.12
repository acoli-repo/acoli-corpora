00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.811
And so I wrote my fears

00:06:01.835 --> 00:06:03.135
and my doubts.

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:08.196
I wrote about my good days
and my bad days and my really ugly days,

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.970
and I shared them on a blog.

00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:12.416
And before long,

00:06:13.488 --> 00:06:17.119
I began to be seen and heard
by people who had epilepsy

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:18.577
and their families,

00:06:18.601 --> 00:06:21.437
and even those who did not
have the diagnosis.

00:06:21.953 --> 00:06:26.043
And I moved from that girl
who constantly asked why me

00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:28.854
to one who not only self-advocates,

00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:32.370
but does it for those who are yet
to find their voices.
