00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.083
I went on to employ five people,

00:07:00.107 --> 00:07:02.368
when I began what was Kenya's first

00:07:02.392 --> 00:07:05.470
free mental health
and epilepsy support line.

00:07:05.862 --> 00:07:07.184
And I travel --

00:07:07.208 --> 00:07:09.505
(Applause)

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:14.027
And I travel to speak about my affair,

00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:16.408
all these things that I had been told

00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:20.789
people like me living with epilepsy
could never be able to do.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.506
Every year, a population
as big as 80 percent of Nairobi

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.295
gets diagnosed with epilepsy

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:30.758
across the globe.
