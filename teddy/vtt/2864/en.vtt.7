00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:31.166
I spent a large chunk of my time
in hospital and at home,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.475
and only went back to do my final exams.

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:39.284
I had seizures in between papers,

00:03:39.308 --> 00:03:41.444
but managed to get good enough grades

00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:44.728
to be admitted for an actuarial
science degree

00:03:44.752 --> 00:03:46.343
at the University of Nairobi.

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:49.815
(Applause)

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.273
Unfortunately, I had to drop out
in my second year.

00:03:57.297 --> 00:03:59.740
I didn't have good enough coping skills

00:03:59.764 --> 00:04:01.900
and a support community around me.
