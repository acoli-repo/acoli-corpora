Chinese has a separate mentality,

00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:04.249
as, say, people in Europe and America.

00:03:04.273 --> 00:03:06.301
HW: That sense
of collective responsibility

00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:10.625
sometimes feels a little absent
from this culture.

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:14.199
At the same time, there are,
I think, valid concerns

00:03:14.223 --> 00:03:18.804
around surveillance
and data privacy, things like that.

00:03:18.828 --> 00:03:20.040
What is the balance here,

00:03:20.064 --> 00:03:24.594
and what is the right trade-off
between surveillance and freedom?

00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:28.623
HH: I think in the internet age,

00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:33.634
it is somewhere between China and the US.
