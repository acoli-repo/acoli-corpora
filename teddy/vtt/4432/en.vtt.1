00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.371
I wasn't that concerned.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:36.621
And on the 23rd, I had a friend of mine
from New York come to my house

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.169
who had a flu,

00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:40.173
and we had dinner together,

00:00:40.197 --> 00:00:42.566
and another friend who came,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.319
who left the next day for Australia
for vacation on an airplane.

00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:51.905
So we were not taking this
terribly seriously

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.367
until there was a lockdown.

00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:56.547
HW: And we've seen that echo
around the world.

00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:59.963
I think still some people find it hard
to understand the magnitude

00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:02.176
of some of the measures that China took.
