Helen Walters: Huang,
it's so good to see you.

00:00:03.047 --> 00:00:05.368
Thank you for joining us.
How's your 2020 been?

00:00:05.392 --> 00:00:08.786
Huang Hung: My 2020
started totally normal.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.513
In January, I went to Paris,

00:00:12.537 --> 00:00:15.842
did my interview
for the fashion week there,

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:19.527
came back to Beijing on January 22nd,

00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:22.762
and finding things a little bit tense

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:25.728
because there were a lot of rumors.

00:00:25.752 --> 00:00:29.155
Having lived through SARS,

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.371
I wasn't that concerned.
