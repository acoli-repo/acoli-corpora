00:07:57.197 --> 00:08:00.036
Even though he was
unjustly treated as a whistleblower,

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.477
he still went to work in the hospital

00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:04.991
and tried to save lives as a doctor,

00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:06.817
and then he died

00:08:06.841 --> 00:08:08.502
because he contracted the disease.

00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:11.121
So there was anger, frustration,

00:08:11.145 --> 00:08:13.584
and all of that came out

00:08:13.608 --> 00:08:16.600
in kind of commemorating a figure

00:08:16.624 --> 00:08:20.014
that they feel that
the government had wronged.

00:08:20.038 --> 00:08:21.198
The verdict

00:08:22.121 --> 00:08:26.572
and sort of the official voice on:

00:08:26.596 --> 00:08:29.884
"Who is Dr. Li?
Is he a good guy or a bad guy?"

00:08:29.908 --> 00:08:33.319
completely changed 180 degrees.
