00:09:57.166 --> 00:10:02.333
So it was a very funny joke
on Chinese social media,

00:10:02.357 --> 00:10:03.621
that wok-throwing.

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:09.778
There's a wok-throwing gymnastics
aerobics exercise video that went viral.

00:10:09.802 --> 00:10:10.964
HW: But tell us, Huang:

00:10:10.988 --> 00:10:13.501
You're also doing dances on TikTok, right?

00:10:13.525 --> 00:10:15.128
HH: Oh, of course.

00:10:15.152 --> 00:10:19.308
I'm doing a lot of wok-throwing
aerobics on TikTok.

00:10:19.332 --> 00:10:23.115
HW: I mean, a potential silver lining
of all of this is that it has laid bare

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.812
some of the inequities,
inequalities in the system,

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:29.351
some of the broken
structures that we have,

00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:32.503
and if we're smart, we can rebuild better.
