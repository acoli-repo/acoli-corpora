00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.414
in a pandemic like this

00:05:32.438 --> 00:05:34.577
is actually really meaningless.

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:40.206
So I think the West really needs
to move a step towards the East

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.660
and to think about

00:05:43.684 --> 00:05:46.800
rather than only think

whether people understand
global supply chains or not.

00:05:57.467 --> 00:05:59.652
Where do you think we head next?

00:05:59.676 --> 00:06:04.561
HH: You know, this is the most
horrifying thing that came out of this,
