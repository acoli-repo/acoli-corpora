Life flourished in swamps.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000
On land, life turned a corner. Jaws formed first; teeth came later.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It took time for life to break away from water,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and it still beckons all the time.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Life turned hard so it could venture inland.
