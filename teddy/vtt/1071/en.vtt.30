00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
is what's made a difference -- it powers everything.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
through plants and algae, and their waste is our breath,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and vice versa.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.000
We call it "atmosphere." This is the icon of our journey.
