Going down there was like entering a time capsule,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and I came out with a different sense of myself in time.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is what we all breathe today.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Stromatolites are the heroes in my story.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's a story about you and me, nature and science.
