00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the way it was three billion years ago,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
back before the sky turned blue.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There's stromatolites down there --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the first living things to capture photosynthesis --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and it's the only place they still occur today.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
