Nature's my muse and it's been my passion.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But five years ago, I went on a personal journey.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I wanted to visualize the story of life.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But there were also revelations.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And one of those I'd like to share with you today.
