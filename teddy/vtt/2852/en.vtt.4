00:01:59.182 --> 00:02:02.522
that a group of Russian government
sponsored hackers

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:05.779
who we called "Advanced
Persistent Threat 28,"

00:02:05.803 --> 00:02:08.384
or "APT28" for short,

00:02:08.408 --> 00:02:11.465
was carrying out
these operations against the US.

00:02:12.192 --> 00:02:14.351
And there was no shortage of evidence.

00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:18.702
This group of Russian government hackers
hadn't just appeared out of nowhere

00:02:18.726 --> 00:02:19.890
in 2016.

00:02:19.914 --> 00:02:23.071
We had started tracking
this group back in 2014.

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:27.976
And the tools that APT28 used
to compromise its victims' networks

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.593
demonstrated a thoughtful,
well-resourced effort
