00:06:58.495 --> 00:07:00.870
In it, there's two US diplomats.

00:07:00.894 --> 00:07:04.088
They sound like they're playing
kingmaker in Ukraine,

00:07:04.112 --> 00:07:07.555
and worse, they curse the EU
for its lack of speed and leadership

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:09.165
in resolving the crisis.

00:07:10.067 --> 00:07:12.526
The media covers the phone call,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.888
and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash

00:07:17.183 --> 00:07:19.518
leaves Washington and Europe reeling.

00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:25.041
And it creates a fissured response
and a feckless attitude

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:27.195
towards Russia's land grab in Ukraine.

00:07:28.118 --> 00:07:29.653
Mission accomplished.
