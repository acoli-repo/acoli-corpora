00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.824
So what to do about it?

00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:36.679
You can call out the hypocrisy
and failures of Western democracies

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.932
and explain how your way is better,

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.011
but that's never really worked for you.

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:45.392
What if you could get the people

00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:48.556
whose support is the very foundation
of these democracies

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.172
to start questioning the system?

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:54.890
Make the idea occur in their own minds

00:00:54.914 --> 00:00:59.026
that democracy and its institutions
are failing them,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.310
their elite are corrupt puppet masters
