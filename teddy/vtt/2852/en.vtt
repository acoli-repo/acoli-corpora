00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:03.563
Let's say you despise

00:00:03.587 --> 00:00:05.033
Western democracy.

00:00:06.592 --> 00:00:08.804
Democracy, in all its trappings,

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:11.491
free elections, town halls,

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:14.351
endless debates about
the proper role of government.

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:15.708
Too messy,

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:16.888
too unpredictable,

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:18.876
too constraining for your taste.

00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:23.961
And the way these democracies
band together and lecture everyone else

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:26.276
about individual rights and freedoms --

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.340
it gets under your skin.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.824
So what to do about it?
