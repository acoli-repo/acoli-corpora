00:07:58.806 --> 00:08:00.188
when it's authentic.

00:08:00.877 --> 00:08:06.271
Who's not interested in the truth
that's presented in phone calls and emails

00:08:06.295 --> 00:08:09.146
that were never intended
for public consumption?

00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:11.995
But how meaningful is that truth

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:14.459
if you don't know why
it's being revealed to you?

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:20.154
We must recognize that this place
where we're increasingly living,

00:08:20.178 --> 00:08:22.463
which we've quaintly termed "cyberspace,"

00:08:22.487 --> 00:08:24.693
isn't defined by ones and zeroes,

00:08:24.717 --> 00:08:27.706
but by information
and the people behind it.

00:08:28.828 --> 00:08:31.971
This is far more than a network
of computers and devices.
