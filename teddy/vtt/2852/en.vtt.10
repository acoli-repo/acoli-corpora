00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:03.708
As our realities are increasingly
based on the information

00:05:03.732 --> 00:05:06.088
that we're consuming
at the palm of our hand

00:05:06.112 --> 00:05:08.365
and from the news feeds
that we're scanning

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.355
and the hashtags and stories
that we see trending,

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.306
the Russian government
was the first to recognize

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.205
how this evolution

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.018
had turned your mind into the most
exploitable device on the planet.

00:05:22.954 --> 00:05:25.418
And your mind is particularly exploitable

00:05:25.442 --> 00:05:29.217
if you're accustomed
to an unfettered flow of information,

00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:32.520
now increasingly curated
to your own tastes.
