Look, so while the US and the West
spent the last 20 years

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:31.756
caught up in cybersecurity --

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.275
what networks to harden,

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:35.608
which infrastructure to deem critical,

00:04:35.632 --> 00:04:39.625
how to set up armies of cyber warriors
and cyber commands --

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:43.382
Russia was thinking in far more
consequential terms.

00:04:45.322 --> 00:04:48.649

even hit the shelf,

00:04:48.673 --> 00:04:53.146

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.595
that technology provided

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:59.030
and the inter-communication
and instant communication it provided us.
