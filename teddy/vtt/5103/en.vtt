Why do we buy certain products
or choose certain brands?

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:14.528
This is the sort of question advertisers
have always asked,

00:00:14.528 --> 00:00:16.478
and there are no easy answers.

00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:20.528
However, there is a handy tool
that helps companies explore this

00:00:20.528 --> 00:00:22.559
and similar questions,

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:25.147
and it's called the focus group.

00:00:25.147 --> 00:00:29.055
Until the 1940s, market research
was often quantitative

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:34.318
using things like sales figures
and customer polls to track consumption.
