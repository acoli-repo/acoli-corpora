00:04:54.269 --> 00:05:00.288
and have pure joy and wonder
for 10 to 15 minutes.

00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:04.694
In those days, I had discovered
a website called Joogle.

00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:07.760
[Google] (Laughter)

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.474
In my frantic wish
to do something about this custom,

00:05:11.474 --> 00:05:14.982
I made use of Google
and discovered Facebook,

00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:19.137
a website where people can connect
to anyone around the world,

00:05:19.137 --> 00:05:23.618
and so, from my very tiny,
cement-roofed room in Karachi,

00:05:23.618 --> 00:05:26.828
I connected with people in the U.K.,
the U.S., Australia and Canada,

00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:29.335
and created a campaign called

00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:32.228
WAKE UP Campaign
against Honor Killings.
