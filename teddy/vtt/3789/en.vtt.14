00:06:57.962 --> 00:07:01.335
Back in Karachi, as an 18-year-old,

00:07:01.335 --> 00:07:06.101
I thought this was the biggest
failure of my entire life.

00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.011
I was devastated.

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:11.656
As a teenager, I was blaming
myself for everything that happened.

00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:13.792
And it turns out,
when we started reflecting,

00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:19.666
we did realize that it was actually
me and my team's fault.

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:24.821
There were two big reasons
why our campaign had failed big time.

00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:27.071
One of those, the first reason,

00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:29.700
is we were standing
against core values of people.
