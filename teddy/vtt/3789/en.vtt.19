WEBVTT

00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:30.227
was we would promote their embroidery
by making a center in the village

00:09:30.227 --> 00:09:33.362
where women would come every day
to make embroidery.

00:09:34.064 --> 00:09:36.038
And so it began.

00:09:36.038 --> 00:09:40.040
We worked with one village,
and we started our first center.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.268
It was a beautiful day.

00:09:42.268 --> 00:09:43.372
We started the center.

00:09:43.372 --> 00:09:45.441
Women were coming to make embroidery,

00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:49.185
and going through a life-changing
process of education,

00:09:49.185 --> 00:09:52.235
learning about their rights,
what Islam says about their rights,

00:09:52.235 --> 00:09:55.054
and enterprise development,
how they can create money,

00:09:55.054 --> 00:09:57.306
and then how they can create
money from money,

00:09:57.306 --> 00:10:01.184
how they can fight the customs
that have been destroying their lives
