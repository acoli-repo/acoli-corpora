And just like that,
another of their decisions

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.986
was to keep me and my siblings
connected to our roots.

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:39.235
While we were living in a community
I fondly remember as called Ribabad,

00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:41.464
which means community of the poor,

00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:45.156
my dad made sure that we also
had a house in our rural homeland.

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:48.780
I come from an indigenous tribe
in the mountains of Balochistan

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.520
called Brahui.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.688
Brahui, or Brohi, means mountain dweller,
and it is also my language.

00:01:55.688 --> 00:01:59.924
Thanks to my father's very strict rules
about connecting to our customs,

00:01:59.924 --> 00:02:05.655
I had to live a beautiful life of songs, 
cultures, traditions, stories, mountains,
