00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:32.713
Or one evening when electricity had failed
for eight hours in our community,

00:00:32.713 --> 00:00:34.965
and my dad sat, surrounded by all of us,

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:38.866
telling us stories of when he was
a little kid struggling to go to school

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:42.974
while his father, who was a farmer,
wanted him to work in the fields with him.

00:00:42.974 --> 00:00:45.722
Or that dark night when I was 16

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:50.139
when three little kids had come to me
and they whispered in my ear

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:54.416
that my friend was murdered
in something called the honor killings.

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:58.231
But then I realized that,

00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:01.948
as much as I know that these moments
have contributed on my journey,
