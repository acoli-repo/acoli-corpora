00:01:59.924 --> 00:02:05.655
I had to live a beautiful life of songs, 
cultures, traditions, stories, mountains,

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:07.046
and a lot of sheep.

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:10.365
But then, living in two extremes

00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:14.394
between the traditions 
of my culture, of my village,

00:02:14.394 --> 00:02:17.745
and then modern education
in my school wasn't easy.

00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:22.249
I was aware that I was the only girl
who got to have such freedom,

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:24.293
and I was guilty of it.

00:02:24.293 --> 00:02:28.255
While going to school
in Karachi and Hyderabad,

00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:32.196
a lot of my cousins and childhood friends
were getting married off,
