And they'd be like,

00:08:01.902 --> 00:08:04.781
But we are working in the streets for you!

00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:06.383
We are changing the policies.

00:08:06.383 --> 00:08:09.355
How is that not impacting their life?

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:14.206
So then we found out something
which was very amazing for us.

00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:16.856
The policies of a country

00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:21.467
do not necessarily always affect
the tribal and rural communities.

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:25.771
It was devastating -- like, oh,
we can't actually do something about this?

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:28.813
And we found out there's a huge gap

00:08:28.813 --> 00:08:32.649
when it comes to official policies
and the real truth on the ground.
