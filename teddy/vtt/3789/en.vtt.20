00:09:57.306 --> 00:10:01.184
how they can fight the customs
that have been destroying their lives

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:02.902
from so many centuries,

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:04.758
because in Islam, in reality,

00:10:04.758 --> 00:10:08.373
women are supposed to be
shoulder to shoulder with men.

00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:12.125
Women have so much status
that we have not been hearing,

00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:13.938
that they have not been hearing,

00:10:13.938 --> 00:10:16.956
and we needed to tell them
that they need to know

00:10:16.956 --> 00:10:19.696
where their rights are
and how to take them by themselves,

00:10:19.696 --> 00:10:22.021
because they can do it and we can't.

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.993
So this was the model which actually
came out -- very amazing.

00:10:24.993 --> 00:10:27.526
Through embroidery
we were promoting their traditions.

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:30.237
We went into the village.
We would mobilize the community.
