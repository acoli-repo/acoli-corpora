00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:32.196
a lot of my cousins and childhood friends
were getting married off,

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:34.950
some to older men, some in exchange,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.249
some even as second wives.

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:42.558
I got to see the beautiful tradition
and its magic fade in front of me

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:47.892
when I saw that the birth of a girl child
was celebrated with sadness,

00:02:47.892 --> 00:02:52.659
when women were told
to have patience as their main virtue.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.640
Up until I was 16,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.448
I healed my sadness by crying,

00:02:57.448 --> 00:02:59.634
mostly at nights 
when everyone would sleep

00:02:59.634 --> 00:03:01.950
and I would sob in my pillow,
