00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.412
We were saying no to something
that was very important to them,

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:36.759
challenging their code of honor,

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:39.026
and hurting them deeply in the process.

00:07:39.026 --> 00:07:41.725
And number two, which was very
important for me to learn,

00:07:41.725 --> 00:07:43.930
and amazing, and surprising
for me to learn,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.111
was that we were not including
the true heroes

00:07:47.111 --> 00:07:49.317
who should be fighting for themselves.

00:07:49.317 --> 00:07:53.274
The women in the villages had no idea
we were fighting for them in the streets.

00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:54.711
Every time I would go back,

00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:57.718
I would find my cousins and friends
with scarves on their faces,

00:07:57.718 --> 00:07:59.512
and I would ask, "What happened?"

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.902
And they'd be like, 
"Our husbands beat us."
