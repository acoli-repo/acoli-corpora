00:03:54.841 --> 00:04:01.002
In those days, we were living in
a very small, one-roomed house in Karachi.

00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:05.529
Every year, during the monsoon seasons,
our house would flood up with water --

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.236
rainwater and sewage --

00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:10.368
and my mom and dad
would be taking the water out.

00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:15.467
In those days, my dad brought home
a huge machine, a computer.

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:20.364
It was so big it looked as if it was going
to take up half of the only room we had,

00:04:20.364 --> 00:04:23.864
and had so many pieces and wires
that needed to be connected.

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:25.954
But it was still the most exciting thing

00:04:25.954 --> 00:04:28.740
that has ever happened
to me and my sisters.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.850
My oldest brother Ali got to be in charge
of taking care of the computer,
