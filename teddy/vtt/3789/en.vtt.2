00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:01.948
as much as I know that these moments
have contributed on my journey,

00:01:01.948 --> 00:01:03.548
they have influenced my journey

00:01:03.548 --> 00:01:05.707
but they have not been
the beginning of it,

00:01:05.707 --> 00:01:10.003
but the true beginning of my journey
was in front of a mud house

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.626
in upper Sindh of Pakistan,

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:15.482
where my father held the hand
of my 14-year-old mother

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:17.502
and they decided
to walk out of the village

00:01:17.502 --> 00:01:20.962
to go to a town where they could
send their kids to school.

00:01:20.962 --> 00:01:23.168
In a way, I feel like my life

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:28.903
is kind of a result of some wise choices
and decisions they've made.

00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:31.759
And just like that,
another of their decisions
