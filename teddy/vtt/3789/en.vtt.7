00:03:29.445 --> 00:03:33.183
A custom that kills
did not make any sense to me,

00:03:33.183 --> 00:03:35.761
and I knew I had to do
something about it this time.

00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:38.152
I was not going to cry myself to sleep.

00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:40.660
I was going to do something,
anything, to stop it.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.726
I was 16 -- I started writing poetry

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:45.954
and going door to door
telling everybody about honor killings

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:48.149
and why it happens,
why it should be stopped,

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:49.585
and raising awareness about it

00:03:49.585 --> 00:03:54.162
until I actually found a much, much 
better way to handle this issue.

00:03:54.841 --> 00:04:01.002
In those days, we were living in
a very small, one-roomed house in Karachi.
