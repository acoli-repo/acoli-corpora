00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:01.325
Nobody believed us.

00:09:01.325 --> 00:09:04.063
Nobody wanted to work with us.

00:09:04.063 --> 00:09:07.618
It took a lot of convincing
and discussions with these communities

00:09:07.618 --> 00:09:11.310
until they agreed that we are going
to promote their language

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.972
by making a booklet of their stories,
fables and old tales in the tribe,

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:18.544
and we would promote their music

00:09:18.544 --> 00:09:24.055
by making a CD of the songs
from the tribe, and some drumbeating.

00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:26.216
And the third, which was my favorite,

00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:30.227
was we would promote their embroidery
by making a center in the village
