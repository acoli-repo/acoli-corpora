00:02:59.634 --> 00:03:01.950
and I would sob in my pillow,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.297
until that one night 
when I found out my friend was killed

00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:07.471
in the name of honor.

00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:11.218
Honor killings is a custom

00:03:11.218 --> 00:03:14.116
where men and women
are suspected of having relationships

00:03:14.116 --> 00:03:15.811
before or outside of the marriage,

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:17.990
and they're killed by their family for it.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.375
Usually the killer is the brother
or father or the uncle in the family.

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:27.007
The U.N. reports there are about 1,000
honor murders every year in Pakistan,

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:29.445
and these are only the reported cases.

00:03:29.445 --> 00:03:33.183
A custom that kills
did not make any sense to me,
