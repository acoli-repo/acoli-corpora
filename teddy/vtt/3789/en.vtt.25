(Applause)

00:12:34.106 --> 00:12:36.265
Thank you, thank you.

00:12:36.265 --> 00:12:41.442
In 2013, we launched our first
Sughar Hub instead of a center.

00:12:41.442 --> 00:12:43.602
We partnered with TripAdvisor

00:12:43.602 --> 00:12:47.514
and created a cement hall
in the middle of a village

00:12:47.514 --> 00:12:51.752
and invited so many other organizations
to work over there.

00:12:51.752 --> 00:12:53.847
We created this platform
for the nonprofits

00:12:53.847 --> 00:12:56.170
so they can touch and work
on the other issues

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.395
that Sughar is not working on,

00:12:58.395 --> 00:13:02.259
which would be an easy place 
for them to give trainings,
