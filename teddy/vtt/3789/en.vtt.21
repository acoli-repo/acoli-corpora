WEBVTT

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:30.237
We went into the village.
We would mobilize the community.

00:10:30.237 --> 00:10:33.257
We would make a center inside
where 30 women will come

00:10:33.257 --> 00:10:37.365
for six months to learn about
value addition of traditional embroidery,

00:10:37.365 --> 00:10:41.104
enterprise development,
life skills and basic education,

00:10:41.104 --> 00:10:44.215
and about their rights
and how to say no to those customs

00:10:44.215 --> 00:10:47.886
and how to stand as leaders
for themselves and the society.

00:10:47.886 --> 00:10:52.698
After six months, we would connect
these women to loans and to markets

00:10:52.698 --> 00:10:56.608
where they can become
local entrepreneurs in their communities.

00:10:56.608 --> 00:10:59.865
We soon called this project Sughar.

00:10:59.865 --> 00:11:03.905
Sughar is a local word used
in many, many languages in Pakistan.
