00:00:00.973 --> 00:00:03.209
While preparing for my talk

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:07.263
I was reflecting on my life
and trying to figure out

00:00:07.263 --> 00:00:12.187
where exactly was that moment
when my journey began.

00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:14.834
A long time passed by,
and I simply couldn't figure out

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:17.806
the beginning or the middle
or the end of my story.

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:19.757
I always used to think that my beginning

00:00:19.757 --> 00:00:23.867
was one afternoon in my community
when my mother had told me

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:27.308
that I had escaped three
arranged marriages by the time I was two.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:32.713
Or one evening when electricity had failed
for eight hours in our community,
