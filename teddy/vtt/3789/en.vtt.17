00:08:28.813 --> 00:08:32.649
when it comes to official policies
and the real truth on the ground.

00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:35.961
So this time, we were like,
we are going to do something different.

00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:37.710
We are going to use strategy,

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.699
and we are going to go back and apologize.

00:08:40.699 --> 00:08:42.350
Yes, apologize.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.863
We went back to the communities

00:08:43.863 --> 00:08:47.111
and we said we are 
very ashamed of what we did.

00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:51.681
We are here to apologize, and in fact,
we are here to make it up to you.

00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:53.251
How do we do that?

00:08:53.251 --> 00:08:56.217
We are going to promote
three of your main cultures.

00:08:56.217 --> 00:08:59.799
We know that it's music,
language, and embroidery.

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:01.325
Nobody believed us.
