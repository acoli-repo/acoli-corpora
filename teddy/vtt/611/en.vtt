I was talking to a guy
at a party in California

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:05.841
about tech platforms

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:08.563
and the problems
they're creating in society.

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.168
And he said, "Man, if the CEOs
just did more drugs

00:00:13.192 --> 00:00:14.375
and went to Burning Man,

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.041
we wouldn't be in this mess."

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:17.438
(Laughter)

00:00:17.462 --> 00:00:20.231
I said, "I'm not sure I agree with you."

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:24.223
For one thing, most of the CEOs
have already been to Burning Man.

00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:25.261
(Laughter)

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:28.612
But also, I'm just not sure
that watching a bunch of half-naked people

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:29.954
run around and burn things

00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:32.206
is really the inspiration
they need right now.
