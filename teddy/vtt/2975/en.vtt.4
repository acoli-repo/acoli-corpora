00:01:58.903 --> 00:02:00.386
were just too complicated.

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:04.099
So we divided the world
into three-meter squares.

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:08.676
The world divides into around 57 trillion
three-meter squares,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.891
and we found that there are
enough combinations

00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:12.725
of three dictionary words

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.341
that we could name every three-meter
square in the world uniquely

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:17.721
with just three words.

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:20.117
We used 40,000 words,

00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:21.734
so that's 40,000 cubed,

00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:24.991
64 trillion combinations of three words,

00:02:25.015 --> 00:02:28.903
which is more than enough for
the 57-trillion-odd three-meter squares,

00:02:28.927 --> 00:02:30.110
with a few spare.
