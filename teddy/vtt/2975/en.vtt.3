00:01:29.572 --> 00:01:31.647
where a keyboard player
called me and said,

00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:34.585
"Chris, don't panic,
but we may have just sound-checked

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:36.172
at the wrong people's wedding."

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.771
(Laughter)

00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:40.433
So not long after the fated Rome event,

00:01:40.457 --> 00:01:42.566
I chatted this through
with a friend of mine

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.754
who is a mathematician,

00:01:43.778 --> 00:01:46.588
and we thought it was a problem
we could do something about.

00:01:46.612 --> 00:01:48.949
We thought, well,
we could make a new system,

00:01:48.973 --> 00:01:51.045
but it shouldn't look like the old system.

00:01:51.628 --> 00:01:53.743
We agreed that addresses were bad.

00:01:54.474 --> 00:01:56.500
We knew we wanted something very precise,

00:01:56.524 --> 00:01:58.879
but GPS coordinates,
latitude and longitude,

00:01:58.903 --> 00:02:00.386
were just too complicated.
