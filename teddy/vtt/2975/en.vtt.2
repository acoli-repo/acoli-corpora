00:00:58.453 --> 00:01:00.505
I worked in the music
business for 10 years,

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:02.907
and what you may not know
about the music world

00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:06.344
is that every day, people struggle
with the problems of addressing.

00:01:06.368 --> 00:01:09.197
So from the musicians
who have to find the gigs

00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:11.650
to the production companies
who bring the equipment,

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:13.736
everyone somehow always gets lost.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.901
We even had to add someone
to our schedules

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.744
who was the person you called
when you thought you'd arrived

00:01:18.768 --> 00:01:20.152
but then realized you hadn't.

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:22.499
And we had some pretty bad days,

00:01:22.523 --> 00:01:25.708
like in Italy, where a truck driver
unloaded all the equipment

00:01:25.732 --> 00:01:28.315
an hour north of Rome,
not an hour south of Rome,

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:29.548
and a slightly worse day

00:01:29.572 --> 00:01:31.647
where a keyboard player
called me and said,
