We're really proud that the post services
of three African countries --

00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:33.872
Nigeria, Djibouti and Côte d'Ivoire,

00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:36.548
have gone straight to adopting
three-word addresses,

00:04:36.572 --> 00:04:38.645
which means that people in those countries

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.841
have a really simple way
to explain where they live, today.

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:46.846
For me, poor addressing
was an annoying frustration,

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.374
but for billions of people,

00:04:49.398 --> 00:04:51.811
it's a huge business inefficiency,

00:04:51.835 --> 00:04:54.516
severely hampers
their infrastructure growth,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.824
and can cost lives.

00:04:56.837 --> 00:04:58.465
We're on a mission to change that,

00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:59.702
three words at a time.

00:04:59.726 --> 00:05:00.877
Thank you.
