In Durban, South Africa,

00:03:30.487 --> 00:03:32.144
an NGO called Gateway Health

00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:35.118
have distributed 11,000
three-word address signs

00:03:35.142 --> 00:03:36.531
to their community,

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:38.934
so the pregnant mothers,
when they go into labor,

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.766
can call the emergency services

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.141
and tell them exactly
where to pick them up from,

00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:46.518
because otherwise, the ambulances
have often taken hours to find them.

00:03:46.964 --> 00:03:50.241
In Mongolia, the National Post Service
have adopted the system

00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:52.703
and are now doing deliveries
to many people's houses

00:03:52.727 --> 00:03:54.128
for the first time.

00:03:54.152 --> 00:03:57.835
The UN are using it
to geotag photos in disaster zones

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.531
so they can deliver aid
to exactly the right place.
