00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:03.643
So in the winter of 2012,

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:05.684
I went to visit my grandmother's house

00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:07.351
in South India,

00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:08.684
a place, by the way,

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:12.393
where the mosquitos have a special taste
for the blood of the American-born.

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:13.518
(Laughter)

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:14.792
No joke.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.708
When I was there,
I got an unexpected gift.

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:22.101
It was this antique instrument

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:24.059
made more than a century ago,

00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:26.726
hand-carved from a rare wood,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.101
inlaid with pearls

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:30.458
and with dozens of metal strings.
