00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.521
Recently, I flew over a crowd

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:09.906
of thousands of people in Brazil

00:00:09.906 --> 00:00:13.539
playing music by George Frideric Handel.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.543
I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam,

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:19.918
again playing music by this same composer.

00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:22.685
Let's take a look.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:31.265
(Music: George Frideric Handel, "Allegro."
Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)
