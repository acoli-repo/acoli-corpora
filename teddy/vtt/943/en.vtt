We look around the media, as we see on the news from Iraq,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Afghanistan, Sierra Leone,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But as a physicist,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I thought, well if you give me some data,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I could maybe understand this. You know, give us a go.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So as a naive New Zealander

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I thought, well I'll go to the Pentagon.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Can you get me some information?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
No. So I had to think a little harder.
