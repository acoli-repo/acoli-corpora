synthesized the first
commercially viable CFCs.

00:03:02.143 --> 00:03:08.224
And in fact, Midgley famously
inhaled CFCs and blew out a candle

00:03:08.248 --> 00:03:10.868
to demonstrate,
at a scientific conference,

00:03:10.892 --> 00:03:13.312
that they were safe and nonflammable.

00:03:13.336 --> 00:03:16.098
And in fact, as a scientist,
I can tell you there is no way

00:03:16.122 --> 00:03:18.416
you could get away
with that kind of antic today.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.630
I mean, wow.

00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:22.950
But really, at the time,

00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:26.925
CFCs were a really remarkable invention.

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.172
They allowed what we now know
as modern-day refrigeration
