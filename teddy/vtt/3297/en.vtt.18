00:08:53.846 --> 00:09:00.086
By the 2030s, we'll be avoiding millions
of new skin cancer cases per year

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.160
with a number that would only grow.

00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:07.955
If I'm lucky, I'll live long enough
to see the end of this animation

00:09:07.979 --> 00:09:11.176
and to see the ozone hole
restored to its natural state.

00:09:12.573 --> 00:09:15.902
So as we write the story
for earth's climate future

00:09:15.926 --> 00:09:17.410
for this century and beyond,

00:09:17.434 --> 00:09:20.895
we need to ask ourselves,
what will our actions be

00:09:20.919 --> 00:09:23.261
so that someone can stand on this stage

00:09:23.285 --> 00:09:27.745
in 30 or 50 or a hundred years

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:30.109
to celebrate the world
that they've avoided.
