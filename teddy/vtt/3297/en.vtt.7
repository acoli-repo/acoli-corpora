00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.172
They allowed what we now know
as modern-day refrigeration

00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:32.006
and air-conditioning and other things.

00:03:32.677 --> 00:03:38.391
So it wasn't actually until
over 40 years later, in the 1970s,

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:43.113
when scientists realized that CFCs
would break down high in the atmosphere

00:03:43.137 --> 00:03:45.443
and damage the ozone layer.

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:48.117
And this finding really set off
a lot of public concern.

00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:53.289
It led, ultimately, to the banning
of CFC usage in aerosol spray cans

00:03:53.313 --> 00:03:56.561
in the US and a few
other countries in 1978.

00:03:57.788 --> 00:03:59.383
Now, the story doesn't end there,

00:03:59.407 --> 00:04:02.430
because CFCs were used
in much more than just spray cans.
