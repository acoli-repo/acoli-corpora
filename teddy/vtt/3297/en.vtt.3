00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.813
And see, it turns out
these CFCs were a problem

00:01:32.837 --> 00:01:35.682
because they were destroying
the ozone layer.

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:38.302
Now I'm sure most of you
have heard of the ozone layer,

00:01:38.326 --> 00:01:39.768
but why does it matter?

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:44.402
Well, quite simply,
the ozone layer is earth's sunscreen,

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:45.850
and it's really fragile.

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:48.654
If you could take all of the ozone,

00:01:48.678 --> 00:01:51.840
which is mostly about
10 to 20 miles up above our heads,

00:01:51.864 --> 00:01:54.766
and compress it down
to the surface of the earth,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.239
it would form a thin shell
only about two pennies thick,

00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:00.332
about an eighth of an inch.
