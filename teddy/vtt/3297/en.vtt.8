00:04:03.684 --> 00:04:07.890
In 1985, scientists discovered
the Antarctic ozone hole,

00:04:08.905 --> 00:04:11.879
and this was a truly alarming discovery.

00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:14.333
Scientists did not expect this at all.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.794
Before the Antarctic ozone hole,

00:04:17.818 --> 00:04:21.595
scientists expected
maybe a five or 10 percent reduction

00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:23.651
