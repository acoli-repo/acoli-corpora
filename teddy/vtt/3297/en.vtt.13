00:06:29.518 --> 00:06:33.958
You know, I'll bet those of you
who drove here tonight,

00:06:33.982 --> 00:06:35.839
you probably wore your seat belt.

00:06:36.807 --> 00:06:38.015
And so ask yourself,

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.628
did you wear your seat belt
because someone told you

00:06:40.652 --> 00:06:42.559
with a hundred percent [certainty]

00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:44.991
that you would get
in a car crash on the way here?

00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:47.135
Probably not.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.477
So that's the first lesson.

00:06:49.501 --> 00:06:52.762
Risk management and decision making
always have uncertainty.

00:06:53.494 --> 00:06:57.254
Ignoring risk and focusing
only on uncertainty is a distraction.

00:06:58.372 --> 00:07:02.189
In other words, inaction is an action.
