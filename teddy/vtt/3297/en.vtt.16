While Montreal has become the brake pedal
for stopping ozone depletion,

00:08:07.674 --> 00:08:11.253

00:08:12.524 --> 00:08:15.854
It was actually the later
amendments to the protocol

00:08:15.878 --> 00:08:19.783
that really marked the decision
to hit the brakes on ozone depletion.

00:08:21.061 --> 00:08:22.443
So to those who despair

00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:25.800

didn't go far enough

00:08:25.824 --> 00:08:30.780
or that your limited actions on their own
won't solve global warming,
