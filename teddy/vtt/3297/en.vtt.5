00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:30.223
It's not an exaggeration

00:02:30.247 --> 00:02:33.795
to say that a threat to the ozone layer
is a threat to human safety.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.367
And actually, ironically,
it was human safety

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.667
that motivated the invention
of CFCs in the first place.

00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:43.858
You see, in the early days
of refrigeration,

00:02:43.882 --> 00:02:47.524
refrigerators used toxic
and flammable chemicals

00:02:47.548 --> 00:02:48.992
like propane and ammonia.

00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:51.966
For good reason,
the refrigeration industry

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.536
wanted a safe alternative,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.802
and they found that in 1928,

00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:58.080
when a scientist named Thomas Midgley

00:02:58.104 --> 00:03:01.151
synthesized the first
commercially viable CFCs.
