00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:30.321
[The Paris Climate Accord
is a product of the recognition

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:32.369
that climate change
is a global problem ...]

00:00:32.383 --> 00:00:34.574
This statement was not made
by President Obama.

00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:36.161
It was made by President Reagan,

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:39.371
and it wasn't about climate change
and the Paris Climate Accord.

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:41.614
It was actually
about the Montreal Protocol

00:00:41.638 --> 00:00:43.717
and stratospheric ozone depletion.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:49.733
Now, I'm sure that many of you aren't
familiar with this environmental problem,

00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:51.098
but you should be,

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:54.792
because it's a rare
environmental success story.

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:56.733
And it's worth revisiting,

00:00:56.757 --> 00:01:00.289
because sometimes, we need
to examine the world we've avoided
