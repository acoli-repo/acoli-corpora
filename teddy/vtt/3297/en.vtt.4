00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:00.332
about an eighth of an inch.

00:02:00.356 --> 00:02:03.787
And that thin shell does
an amazing amount of work, though.

00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:09.072
It filters out more than 90 percent
of the harmful UV radiation

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.246
coming from the sun.

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:16.519
And while I'm sure many of you
enjoy that suntan that you get

00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:20.344
from the remaining 10 percent,
it causes a lot of problems:

00:02:20.368 --> 00:02:21.518
cataracts,

00:02:22.754 --> 00:02:24.306
damage to crops,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.253
damage to immune systems

00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:27.881
and also skin cancer.

00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:30.223
It's not an exaggeration
