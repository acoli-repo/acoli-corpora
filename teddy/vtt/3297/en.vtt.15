00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.410
We see not just environmental groups
concerned about climate change

00:07:34.434 --> 00:07:37.024
but also civic and religious groups,

00:07:37.048 --> 00:07:39.381
the military and businesses.

00:07:40.744 --> 00:07:43.567
So wherever you find yourself
on that spectrum,

00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:45.295
we need you at the table,

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:47.511
because if we're going
to solve global warming,

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:49.595
it's going to take actions at all levels,

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:52.313
from the individual to the international

00:07:52.337 --> 00:07:54.042
and everything in between.

00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:57.771
Third lesson:

00:07:58.673 --> 00:08:01.244
don't let the perfect
be the enemy of the good.
