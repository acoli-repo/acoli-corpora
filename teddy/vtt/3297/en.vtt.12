First, we don't need
absolute certainty to act.

00:06:01.742 --> 00:06:03.454
When Montreal was signed,

00:06:03.478 --> 00:06:07.519
we were less certain then
of the risks from CFCs

00:06:07.543 --> 00:06:11.995
than we are now of the risks
from greenhouse gas emissions.

00:06:13.116 --> 00:06:16.894
A common tactic that people
who oppose climate action use

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:20.981
is to completely ignore risk
and focus only on uncertainty.

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:23.209
But so what about uncertainty?

00:06:23.937 --> 00:06:27.516
We make decisions in the face
of uncertainty all the time,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.494
literally all the time.

00:06:29.518 --> 00:06:33.958
You know, I'll bet those of you
