00:05:29.118 --> 00:05:33.118
And furthermore, because many
of those ozone-depleting substances

00:05:33.142 --> 00:05:35.860
are also very potent greenhouse gases,

00:05:35.884 --> 00:05:38.662
the Montreal Protocol
has actually delayed global warming

00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:39.971
by more than a decade.

00:05:40.628 --> 00:05:41.895
That's just wonderful.

00:05:42.728 --> 00:05:47.201
But I think it's worth
asking the question,

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:50.827
as we face our current
environmental crisis, global warming,

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.226
what lessons can we learn from Montreal?

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.589
Are there any? I think there are.

00:05:56.765 --> 00:06:01.082
First, we don't need
absolute certainty to act.
