00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.936
So it seems that the wise balance,
you could also say a conservative balance,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.936
between past and future,
between exploitation and exploration,

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.376
is already in place
and perhaps needed in our system.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.016
But again the good news is
now we have scientific tools

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.776
to investigate this equilibrium,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.080
perhaps pushing it further
in the near future.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.616
So as you can imagine,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.800
I was really fascinated by all this.
