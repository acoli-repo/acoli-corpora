00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.576
many different real systems.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.096
We were so excited.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.936
Of course, apparently,
we were on the right track,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.456
but of course, we couldn't stop,

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.976
so we didn't stop.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.096
So we kept going on,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.176
and at some point
we made another discovery

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.736
that we dubbed "correlated novelties."

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.016
It's very simple.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.936
So I guess we all experience this.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.520
So you listen to "Suzanne"
by Leonard Cohen,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.096
and this experience
triggers your passion for Cohen

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.936
so that you start frantically
listening to his whole production.
