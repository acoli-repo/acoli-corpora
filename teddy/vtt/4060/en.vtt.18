It's not something we can predefine.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.536
It's something that gets
continuously shaped and reshaped

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.160
by our actions and our choices.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.576
So we were so fascinated
by these connections we made --

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.496
scientists are like this.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.816
And based on this,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.056
we conceived our mathematical formulation
for the adjacent possible,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.536
20 years after the original
Kauffman proposals.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.696
In our theory -- this is a key point --

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.256
I mean, it's crucially based
on a complex interplay

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.056
between the way in which
this space of possibilities expands
