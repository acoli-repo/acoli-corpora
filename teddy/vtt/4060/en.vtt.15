00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.256
from what actually exists,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.816
and you can achieve them
through incremental modifications

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.400
and recombinations
of the existing material.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.416
So for instance, if I speak
about the space of my friends,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.416
my adjacent possible would be
the set of all friends of my friends

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.840
not already my friends.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.976
I hope that's clear.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.816
But now if I meet a new person,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.536
say Briar,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.616
all her friends would immediately enter
my adjacent possible,

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.160
pushing its boundaries further.
