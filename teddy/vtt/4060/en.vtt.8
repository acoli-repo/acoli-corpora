00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.416
But not all of them.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.376
So think about an alien invasion,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.776
but actually we have an excuse.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.296

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.815

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.176
looking at the future
with the eyes of the past,
