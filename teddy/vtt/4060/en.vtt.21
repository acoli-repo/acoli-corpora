It's neat. It's interesting.
It's beautiful. We were happy.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.696
But the question is, is that true?

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.600
Of course we should check with reality.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.976
So we went back to reality

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.136
and we collected a lot of data,
terabytes of data,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.496
tracking innovation in Wikipedia, Twitter,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.736
the way in which we write free software,

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.400
even the way we listen to music.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.896
I cannot tell you, we were
so amazed and pleased and thrilled

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.416
to discover that the same predictions
we made in the theory

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.016
were actually satisfied in real systems,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.576
many different real systems.
