with our immune system.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.016
And now comes the bad news.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.336
We are very, very bad
at grasping this space.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.376
Think of it. Let's make an experiment.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.280
Try to think about all the possible things
you could do in the next, say, 24 hours.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.976
Here the key word is "all."

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.800
Of course you can conceive a few options,
like having a drink, writing a letter,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.016
also sleeping during this boring talk,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.736
if you can.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.416
But not all of them.
