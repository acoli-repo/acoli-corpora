So the winter of 2012
was very special in Rome.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.720
Rome witnessed one of the greatest
snowfalls of its history.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.216
That winter was special also
for me and my colleagues,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.736
because we had an insight
about the possible mathematical scheme --

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.736
again, possible,
possible mathematical scheme,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.600
to conceive the occurrence of the new.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.936
I remember that day
because it was snowing,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.736
so due to the snowfall,
we were blocked, stuck in my department,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.176
and we couldn't go home,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.256
so we got another coffee, we relaxed
