00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.056
between the way in which
this space of possibilities expands

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.616
and gets restructured,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.136
and the way in which we explore it.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.016
After the epiphany of 2012,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.696
we got back to work, real work,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.616
because we had to work out this theory,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.056
and we came up with
a certain number of predictions

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.336
to be tested in real life.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.256
Of course, we need a testable framework

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.736
to study innovation.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.816
So let me drive you
across a few predictions we made.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.736
The first one concerns
the pace of innovation,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.656
so the rate at which you observe novelties
in very different systems.
