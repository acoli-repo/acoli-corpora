00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.616
or at least, what I know,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.696
and let me show you that what is known

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.296
could be a powerful
and fascinating starting point

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.416
to grasp the deep meaning
of words like novelty, innovation,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.000
creativity perhaps.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.216
So we are discussing the "new,"

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.896
and of course, the science behind it.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.896
The new can enter our lives
in many different ways,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.616
can be very personal,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.576
like I meet a new person,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.896
I read a new book,
or I listen to a new song.
