00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.176
looking at the future
with the eyes of the past,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.496
so relying on all
the time series of past events

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.016
and hoping that this is enough
to predict the future.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.216
But we know this is not working.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.456
For instance, this was the first attempt
for weather forecasts, and it failed.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.896
And it failed because
of the great complexity

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.856
of the underlying phenomenon.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.496
So now we know that predictions
had to be based on modeling,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.016
which means creating
a synthetic model of the system,
