00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.176
And what about Einstein?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.496
Was relativity theory another big leap
in the history of ideas

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.176
no one else could even conceive?

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.656
Or rather, was it again
something adjacent and possible,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.776
to Einstein of course,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.016
and he got there by small steps
and his very peculiar scientific path?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.496
Of course we cannot conceive this path,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.000
but this doesn't mean
that the path was not there.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.616
So all of this seems very evocative,
