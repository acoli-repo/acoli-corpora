00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.616
So all of this seems very evocative,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.176
but I would say hardly concrete

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.776
if we really want to grasp
the origin of great ideas

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.816
and more generally the way
in which the new enters our lives.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.816
As a physicist, as a scientist,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.016
I have learned that posing
the right questions

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.056
is half of the solution.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.816
But I think now we start having
a great conceptual framework

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.016
to conceive and address
the right questions.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.496
So let me drive you
to the edge of what is known,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.616
or at least, what I know,
