00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.216
Is that true? Probably not.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.456
Still, it's difficult to think
that no apple at all was there.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.096
I mean some stepping stone,
some specific conditions

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.136
that made universal gravitation
not impossible to conceive.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.536
And definitely this was not impossible,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.136
at least for Newton.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.416
It was possible,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.496
and for some reason, it was also there,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.296
available at some point,
easy to pick as an apple.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.936
Here is the apple.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.176
And what about Einstein?
