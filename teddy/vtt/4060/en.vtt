We have all probably wondered

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.416
how great minds achieved
what they achieved, right?

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.096
And the more astonishing
their achievements are,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.656
the more we call them geniuses,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.216
perhaps aliens

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.336
coming from a different planet,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.016
definitely not someone like us.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.816
But is that true?

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.640
So let me start with an example.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.256
You all know the story
of Newton's apple, right? OK.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.216
Is that true? Probably not.
