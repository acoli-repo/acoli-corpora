00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.376
So if you really want to look
from the mathematical point of view --

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.800
I'm sure you want --

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.176
you can actually look at this picture.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.096
So suppose now this is your universe.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.376
I know I'm asking a lot.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.040
I mean, this is your universe.
Now you are the red spot.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.936
And the green spot
is the adjacent possible for you,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.056
so something you've never touched before.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.416
So you do your normal life.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.096
You move. You move in the space.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.776
You have a drink.
You meet friends. You read a book.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.696
At some point,
you end up on the green spot,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.896
so you meet Briar for the first time.
