It happened a few months ago
to Volvo's self-driving cars

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.536
in the middle of the Australian Outback.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.256
(Laughter)

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.256
It is a general problem,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.256
and I guess this will affect
more and more in the near future

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.840
artificial intelligence
and machine learning.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.416
It's also a very old problem,
I would say 17th century,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.576
but I guess now we have new tools
and new clues to start solving it.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.776
So let me take a step back,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.536
five years back.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.536
Italy. Rome. Winter.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.136
So the winter of 2012
was very special in Rome.
