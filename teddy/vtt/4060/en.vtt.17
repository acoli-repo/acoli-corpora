00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.896
so you meet Briar for the first time.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.256
And what happens?

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.576
So what happens is there is a new part,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.056
a brand new part of the space,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.336
becoming possible for you
in this very moment,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.216
even without any possibility
for you to foresee this

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.296
before touching that point.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.016
And behind this there will be
a huge set of points

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.736
that could become possible
at some later stages.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.576
So you see the space
of the possible is very peculiar,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.816
because it's not predefined.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.136
It's not something we can predefine.
