00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.896
For instance, we discovered
that popular hits in music

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.816
are continuously born, you know that,

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.280
and then they disappear,
still leaving room for evergreens.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.216
So somehow waves of novelties ebb and flow

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.816
while the tides always hold the classics.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.800
There is this coexistence
between evergreens and new hits.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.616
Not only our theory
predicts these waves of novelties.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.096
This would be trivial.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.016
But it also explains why they are there,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.016
and they are there for a specific reason,

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.256
because we as humans
display different strategies
