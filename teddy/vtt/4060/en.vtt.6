00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.856
the space of the possible,
the space of possibilities.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.336
It's a very weird space,
so I'll try to get you through this space.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.376
So it could be a physical space.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.016
So in this case, for instance,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.096
novelty could be climbing
Machu Picchu for the first time,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.040
as I did in 2016.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.776
It could be a conceptual space,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.216
so acquiring new information,
making sense of it, in a word, learning.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.176
It could be a biological space.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.296
I mean, think about the never-ending
fight of viruses and bacteria

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.256
with our immune system.
