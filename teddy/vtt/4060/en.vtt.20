00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.656
so the rate at which you observe novelties
in very different systems.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.176
So our theory predicts
that the rate of innovation

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.136
should follow a universal curve,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.480
like this one.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.880
This is the rate of innovation versus time
in very different conditions.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.336
And somehow, we predict
that the rate of innovation

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.056
should decrease steadily over time.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.176
So somehow, innovation
is predicted to become more difficult

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.120
as your progress over time.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.496
It's neat. It's interesting.
It's beautiful. We were happy.
