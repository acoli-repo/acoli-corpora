00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.256
because we as humans
display different strategies

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.136
in the space of the possible.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.296
So some of us tend to retrace
already known paths.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.640
So we say they exploit.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.216
Some of us always launch
into new adventures.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.936
We say they explore.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.256
And what we discovered is
all the systems we investigated

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.456
are right at the edge
between these two strategies,

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.016
something like 80 percent exploiting,
20 percent exploring,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.720
something like
blade runners of innovation.
