00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.016
which means creating
a synthetic model of the system,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.176
simulating this model
and then projecting the system

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.736
into the future through this model.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.696
And now we can do this in a lot of cases

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.600
with the help of a lot of data.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.896
Looking at the future
with the eye of the past

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.656
could be misleading also for machines.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.896
Think about it.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.720
Now picture yourself for a second
in the middle of the Australian Outback.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.160
You stand there under the sun.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.056
So you see something weird happening.
