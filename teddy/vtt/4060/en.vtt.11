00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.056
So you see something weird happening.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.816
The car suddenly stops

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.896
very, very far from a kangaroo
crossing the street.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.376
You look closer

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.816
and you realize
that the car has no driver.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.856
It is not restarting, even after
the kangaroo is not there anymore.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.776
So for some reasons,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.336
the algorithms driving the car
cannot make sense

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.040
of this strange beast
jumping here and there on the street.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.840
So it just stops.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.856
Now, I should tell you,
this is a true story.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.576
It happened a few months ago
to Volvo's self-driving cars
