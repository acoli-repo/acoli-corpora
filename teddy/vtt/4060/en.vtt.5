00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.896
I read a new book,
or I listen to a new song.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.176
Or it could be global,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.256
I mean, something we call innovation.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.456
It could be a new theory,
a new technology,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.056
but it could also be a new book
if you're the writer,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.416
or it could be a new song
if you're the composer.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.736
In all of these global cases,
the new is for everyone,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.576
but experiencing the new
can be also frightening,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.336
so the new can also frighten us.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.536
But still, experiencing the new
means exploring a very peculiar space,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.656
the space of what could be,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.856
the space of the possible,
the space of possibilities.
