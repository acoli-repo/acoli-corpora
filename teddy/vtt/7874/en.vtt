00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:03.833
I am incredibly excited to be here today

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:06.252
because I want to tell you about an idea

00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:09.088
that's shaped the way
that I look at the world

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.342
and I think that anyone can use
to look at your own world,

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:17.889
whether youâ€™re working in finance,
business, journalism

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.933
or just looking around your everyday life

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:27.774
at things like face masks, dogs,
chocolate, really.

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:33.696
And the idea comes from the world
of cultural anthropology.
