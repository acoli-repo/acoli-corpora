00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The recent debate over copyright laws

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
like SOPA in the United States

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and the ACTA agreement in Europe

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
has been very emotional.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
could really bring a great deal to the debate.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'd therefore like to propose

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that we employ, we enlist,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the cutting edge field of copyright math

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
whenever we approach this subject.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For instance, just recently

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the Motion Picture Association revealed

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to copyright theft.
