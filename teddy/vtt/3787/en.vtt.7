WEBVTT

00:03:29.302 --> 00:03:32.227
can see our tweets, except when they can't,

00:03:32.227 --> 00:03:35.578
except when actually Twitter
is blocked from their country,

00:03:35.578 --> 00:03:38.921
or in some way the way we try to express ourselves

00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:41.856
has put some information
about the state of ourselves,

00:03:41.856 --> 00:03:43.219
the state of the country we live in,

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.703
which isn't available to anybody else.

00:03:45.703 --> 00:03:48.684
So we must protest and make sure

00:03:48.684 --> 00:03:50.808
that censorship is cut down,

00:03:50.808 --> 00:03:52.382
that the web is opened up

00:03:52.382 --> 00:03:54.839
where there is censorship.

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:57.549
We love the fact that the web is open.

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.754
It allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody.

00:03:59.754 --> 00:04:01.592
It doesn't matter who we are.
