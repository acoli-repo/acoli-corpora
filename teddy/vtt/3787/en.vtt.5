00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:30.761
somebody they care about might have,

00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:35.767
when they just talk across the Internet to somebody

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:40.276

Those sorts of things are not, they're not out there,

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:47.715

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:51.590
part of the deal with the web,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.026

it's just a transparent, neutral medium.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.952
I can talk to you over it without worrying

00:02:58.952 --> 00:03:01.811
about what we in fact now know is happening,
