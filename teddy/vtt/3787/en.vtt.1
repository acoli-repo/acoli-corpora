00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.144
I was I suppose the first user.

00:00:31.144 --> 00:00:33.687
There was a lot of concern

00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:35.206
that people didn't want to pick it up

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:37.030
because it would be too complicated.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.749
A lot of persuasion, a lot of wonderful

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:40.459
collaboration with other people,

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:42.888
and bit by bit, it worked.

00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:44.531
It took off. It was pretty cool.

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:47.748
And in fact, a few years later in 2000,

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:51.950
five percent of the world population

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.769
were using the world wide web.

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.480
In 2007, seven years later, 17 percent.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.820
In 2008, we formed the World Wide Web Foundation

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.394
partly to look at that
