WEBVTT

00:02:58.952 --> 00:03:01.811
about what we in fact now know is happening,

00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.261
without worrying about the fact

00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:06.207

00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:09.245

00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:11.860

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.545
we have to worry about

00:03:13.545 --> 00:03:17.119

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:21.315

00:03:21.315 --> 00:03:26.264
We revel in the fact that we
have this wonderful free speech.

00:03:26.264 --> 00:03:29.302
We can tweet, and oh, lots and lots of people

00:03:29.302 --> 00:03:32.227
can see our tweets, except when they can't,
