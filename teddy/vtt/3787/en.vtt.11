WEBVTT

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.160
by building stuff to respond to it very quickly.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.090
So this is just some of the things that I want,

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.526
from a big list, obviously it's longer.

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:39.767
You have your list.

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:42.541
I want us to use this 25th anniversary

00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:45.534
to think about what sort of a web we want.

00:05:45.534 --> 00:05:47.233
You can go to webat25.org

00:05:47.233 --> 00:05:48.236
and find some links.

00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:49.292
There are lots of sites where people

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:52.004
have started to put together a Magna Carta,

00:05:52.004 --> 00:05:53.530
a bill of rights for the web.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.043
How about we do that?

00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:59.670
How about we decide, these are, in a way,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.330
becoming fundamental rights, the right
to communicate with whom I want.
