WEBVTT

00:00:00.895 --> 00:00:02.543
TED is 30.

00:00:02.543 --> 00:00:05.181
The world wide web is celebrating this month

00:00:05.181 --> 00:00:07.453
its 25th anniversary.

00:00:07.453 --> 00:00:10.142
So I've got a question for you.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:14.966
Let's talk about the journey, mainly about the future.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.681
Let's talk about the state.

00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:18.995
Let's talk about what sort of a web we want.

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:22.315
So 25 years ago, then, I was working at CERN.

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:24.665
I got permission in the end after about a year

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:27.297
to basically do it as a side project.

00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:28.995
I wrote the code.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.144
I was I suppose the first user.
