WEBVTT

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.394
partly to look at that

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.244
and worry about that figure.

00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:06.303
And now here we are in 2014,

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:08.537
and 40 percent of the world

00:01:08.537 --> 00:01:12.553
are using the world wide web, and counting.

00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:14.555
Obviously it's increasing.

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:17.963
I want you to think about both sides of that.

00:01:17.963 --> 00:01:20.180
Okay, obviously to anybody here at TED,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.163
the first question you ask is, what can we do

00:01:23.163 --> 00:01:25.219
to get the other 60 percent on board

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:26.539
as quickly as possible?

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.854
Lots of important things. Obviously
it's going to be around mobile.

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:30.834
But also, I want you to think about the 40 percent,
