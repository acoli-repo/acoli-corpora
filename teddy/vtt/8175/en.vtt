Folks, in 2022, we know
capitalism has a problem.

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:09.255
The system that undergirds
much of our way of life in the West

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:14.177
is exacerbating injustice and inequality.

00:00:14.218 --> 00:00:17.722
We know that women
still get paid less than men.

00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:19.682
This is 2022.

00:00:19.724 --> 00:00:24.187
And the share of the bottom half
of the worldâ€™s population and wealth

00:00:24.187 --> 00:00:25.563
is just two percent.

00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:29.859
We know that the playing field
is not level.
