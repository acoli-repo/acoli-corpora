00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:32.244
AG: Pixar's first three films
got multiple Oscar nominations.

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:34.545
They grossed over a billion dollars.

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.174
The studio was a perfectly
calibrated hit machine.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.875
And that's when they made
a strange decision:

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.049
they hired Brad.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.049
He was coming off
a big project that tanked.

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:49.294
BB: "Don't make me go back there, man!
Don't make me go back!"

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.056
AG: And it wasn't his first failure.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.754
BB: I got fired from Disney,

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:57.181
and I was actually fired from two
of the first three jobs I held.

00:01:57.612 --> 00:01:59.933
AG: But Pixar saw promise in Brad.

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:02.846
He came to the studio
with a bold vision for a new film.
