00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:02.846
He came to the studio
with a bold vision for a new film.

00:02:03.173 --> 00:02:06.815
And he didn't recruit the star teams
who had created their earlier hits.

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:11.934
Instead, he deliberately assembled
a band of Pixar's biggest misfits.

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.109
BB: Black sheep.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.355
John Walker: Disgruntled.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.311
Nicole Paradis Grindle: I say, "pirate."

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:18.408
AG: Doesn't exactly sound
like a dream team.

00:02:18.432 --> 00:02:22.659
But somehow, the movie they made together
grossed over 600 million dollars,

00:02:22.683 --> 00:02:24.176
won two Oscars

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.467
and was Pixar's biggest hit yet.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.950
It was ... incredible.

00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:31.707
(Multiple voices) Incredible.
Incredible. Incredible.
