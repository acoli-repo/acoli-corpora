By the mid-90s, Disney films
had started to follow a formula.

00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:38.291
They would take an old story,
add a few musical numbers and -- voilà! --

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:40.894
"Pocahontas," "Hercules," "Mulan."

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:44.869
But then, something new
happened in animation.

00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:48.099
(Audio clip, "Toy Story")
To infinity and beyond!

00:00:50.688 --> 00:00:53.871
AG: Pixar reinvented how you make
an animated movie.

00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:57.061
Instead of drawing characters,
you code them on a computer,

00:00:57.085 --> 00:01:01.139
which makes them come alive in 3-D
instead of being flat and two-dimensional.
