So this unconventional director
went looking for a team

00:09:38.365 --> 00:09:40.410
of unconventional recruits --

00:09:40.434 --> 00:09:43.034
the outsiders among Pixar's insiders.

00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:44.752

00:09:53.982 --> 00:09:56.418
AG: Brad, have you ever been
a black sheep yourself?

00:09:56.982 --> 00:09:58.697
BB: Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:58.721 --> 00:10:00.285
Yes. Yeah.
