to shake things up.

00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:05.158
But there's evidence that you
don't have to turn to outside hires.

00:11:05.182 --> 00:11:08.435
You can go to the black sheep
already working within the company.

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:09.610
Consider one study

00:11:09.634 --> 00:11:12.618
that was done at a company
that makes oil drilling equipment.

00:11:12.642 --> 00:11:16.693
Supervisors evaluated how often employees
brought new and innovative ideas

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:17.868
to the table.

00:11:18.395 --> 00:11:20.569
The employees who were rated

00:11:20.593 --> 00:11:23.660
were the ones who felt
dissatisfied with their jobs.

00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:28.429
Their frustration with problems
motivated them to develop fresh solutions.

00:11:28.763 --> 00:11:32.363
But dissatisfaction
didn't always lead to creativity.
