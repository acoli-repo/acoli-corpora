00:07:28.474 --> 00:07:30.426
And they didn't look very convincing.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.237
To date, Pixar's movies
were mostly filled with toys,

00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:35.213
monsters and talking bugs.

00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.517
Now, Brad was pitching a movie

00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:41.625
that would require animating
a whole family of not just humans,

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:43.926
humans with superpowers.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.040
BB: It was full of water and fire and wind

00:07:48.064 --> 00:07:52.305
and all this stuff that CG animation
was no good at doing.

00:07:52.329 --> 00:07:53.599
Hair.

00:07:53.623 --> 00:07:55.972
AG: It turns out, hair was a real problem.

00:07:55.996 --> 00:07:59.499
Prior to "The Incredibles," no one had
even bothered to code long hair,

00:07:59.523 --> 00:08:01.975
because it was just impossible
in CG animation.
