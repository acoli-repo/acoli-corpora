It was the first big project
for both Brad and John.

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.988
On opening day, John went to see it
in a big theater in Times Square.

00:05:06.012 --> 00:05:08.318
JW: And there were three people in there.

00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:12.060
And I went, "What the heck is going on?"

00:05:12.084 --> 00:05:16.054
So I spent the rest of the day just
hanging around in front of the marquee

00:05:16.078 --> 00:05:18.799
and whenever anybody would come by
and look at the poster,

00:05:18.823 --> 00:05:21.823
I'd go, "It's a really good movie.
I'll buy your tickets."

00:05:21.847 --> 00:05:23.029
(Laughs)

00:05:23.053 --> 00:05:26.768
I probably bought, like,
10 people tickets to see it,

00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:29.744
because there was no one
in the theaters, it was empty.

00:05:29.768 --> 00:05:30.918
Empty.
