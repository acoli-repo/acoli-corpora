because the hair doesn't move much.

And, you know, we were doing a film
where it was part of Violet's character.

00:08:15.252 --> 00:08:17.997
AG: Violet is a member
of the Incredibles family --

00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:19.919
a shy, moody teenager.

00:08:19.943 --> 00:08:23.343

What do you know about normal?

00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:25.719
What does anyone in this family
know about normal?

00:08:25.743 --> 00:08:28.254
AG: She was supposed to spend
a huge part of the film

00:08:28.278 --> 00:08:30.355
covering her face
with her long, black hair.
