Put them on offense, not defense,

00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:34.172
by asking them to attack
the problems they see.

00:14:34.553 --> 00:14:37.608
And then invite them to run
with their best ideas.

00:14:37.632 --> 00:14:40.719
Lisa's approach has worked
in all kinds of environments:

00:14:40.743 --> 00:14:44.721
banks, tech companies,
city governments, schools.

00:14:45.204 --> 00:14:48.926
And Brad Bird did his own
version of it at Pixar.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:53.065
BB: Pixar kind of invented
a lot of the stuff

00:14:53.089 --> 00:14:55.553

00:14:55.577 --> 00:14:58.382
I mean, they were the best
in the world at it.

00:14:58.871 --> 00:15:02.717
Those methods weren't
going to work for our film.
