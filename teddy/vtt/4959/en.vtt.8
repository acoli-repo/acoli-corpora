Did you really want to embrace
something radically different?

00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:04.229
Of course not.

00:04:04.253 --> 00:04:07.357
You probably became
overconfident in your recipe

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:09.514
and resistant to try new things.

00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:11.419
Take Blockbuster Video.

00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:15.911
At one point, they were apparently
opening a new store every 17 hours.

00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:19.562
So they didn't see any reason to buy
a little mail-order company

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:21.163
called "Netflix."

00:04:21.187 --> 00:04:22.337
Oops!

00:04:23.124 --> 00:04:27.086
One day, the CEO of a successful company
gave me that line I hate:

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.213
"But that's the way we've always done it."

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:31.022
My answer?
