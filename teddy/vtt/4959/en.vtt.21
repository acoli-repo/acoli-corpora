BB: There's a big impetus,
especially with success,

00:10:31.768 --> 00:10:34.339
to repeat whatever has worked before.

00:10:34.363 --> 00:10:36.942
You know? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:39.880
But I was looking for a bunch of people

00:10:39.904 --> 00:10:43.746
that were kind of dissatisfied
with the way things were.

00:10:44.133 --> 00:10:46.581
AG: Turns out, Brad was onto something.

00:10:46.605 --> 00:10:49.292
Research shows that the kind
of frustration he harnessed

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:50.649
can fuel creativity.

00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:53.477
In other words,
the curmudgeons on your team

00:10:53.501 --> 00:10:55.768
could be great untapped resources.

00:10:56.284 --> 00:10:59.941
I'm sure you've seen companies
hire external consultants or executives

00:10:59.965 --> 00:11:01.413
to shake things up.
