00:08:28.278 --> 00:08:30.355
covering her face
with her long, black hair.

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:32.602
JW: We'd seen these beautiful tests.

00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:33.818
AG: Producer John Walker.

00:08:33.842 --> 00:08:34.994
JW: And it was like,

00:08:35.018 --> 00:08:38.523
wow, she's shaking her head,
and the hair is flowing,

00:08:38.547 --> 00:08:41.794
and it's gorgeous,
and it's going to be beautiful.

00:08:42.196 --> 00:08:44.291
AG: But the tests were oversimplified.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:47.715
The hair moved right,
but kind of looked like strips of rubber.

00:08:48.117 --> 00:08:50.680
When it was time to do
the full computer animation,

00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:52.504
Violet's hair looked awful.

00:08:53.014 --> 00:08:55.395
So John asked what it would take
to get it right.

00:08:55.419 --> 00:08:57.577
And he was shocked at the answer.

00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.783
JW: "We can't actually
do the movie like that.

00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:02.323
That would take 10 years
and 10 million dollars."
