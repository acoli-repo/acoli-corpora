AG: So Pixar hired
John Walker and Brad Bird.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.506
Brad had been working on a new story
for an animated film.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.780
It would be called "The Incredibles."

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.236
And it was different
than anything Pixar had ever done.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.966
BB: Everything that the film was,

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.990
was all the things that CG animation
was then terrible at.

00:07:17.014 --> 00:07:19.067
It was full of humans, which,

00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:21.811
they were the weakest thing
in CG animation,

00:07:21.835 --> 00:07:25.045
if you look at humans circa that time.

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:28.051
AG: Pixar films had only had humans
as minor characters.

00:07:28.474 --> 00:07:30.426
And they didn't look very convincing.
