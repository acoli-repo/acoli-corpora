00:12:27.934 --> 00:12:31.248
And what I thought we could do
is go through about -- I don't know,

00:12:31.272 --> 00:12:33.123
500 PowerPoint slides.

00:12:33.147 --> 00:12:34.998
Does that work for you all? (Laughter)

00:12:35.022 --> 00:12:36.201
No?

00:12:36.225 --> 00:12:37.636
AG: Her big breakthrough came

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.127
when she was giving a talk
to a few dozen executives

00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:41.450
at a manufacturing company.

00:12:41.474 --> 00:12:44.273

And so I called a break,

00:12:47.704 --> 00:12:50.101
and I said, "Listen,
I'm going to shake things up."

00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:52.228
AG: She looked at all these
bored executives,

00:12:52.252 --> 00:12:54.919
and told them to kill their own company.

00:12:55.258 --> 00:12:57.037
LB: I challenged each of those groups

00:12:57.061 --> 00:12:59.799
to identify who their number one
competitor was.

00:12:59.823 --> 00:13:02.434
And then I said, "Pretend
you're that competition.
