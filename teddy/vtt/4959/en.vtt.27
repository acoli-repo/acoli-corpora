LB: Really what it does is give people
a framework and permission

00:13:31.054 --> 00:13:33.220
to start attacking things
that aren't working.

00:13:33.244 --> 00:13:35.388
And that's what's energizing to people.

00:13:35.412 --> 00:13:37.237
They don't know the difference, Adam,

00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:39.410
between being in a groove
and being in a rut.

00:13:39.434 --> 00:13:42.458
And most people, when you talk about
complacency, are in a rut.

00:13:42.482 --> 00:13:44.114
And until you talk to them about,

00:13:44.138 --> 00:13:47.082
"What do you wish you could change?
Why are you frustrated?"

00:13:47.106 --> 00:13:48.410
they get pumped up.

00:13:48.434 --> 00:13:51.324
AG: One thing that's always
fascinated me about this exercise

00:13:51.348 --> 00:13:54.589
is how different it would be
if you ran it as "save the company."

00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:57.458
And I was interested in hearing

00:13:57.482 --> 00:13:59.949
what led you to the boldness
of killing the company

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:01.862
rather than saving the company.
