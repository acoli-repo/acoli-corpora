00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:30.314
When the chips are down, you're desperate,

00:03:30.338 --> 00:03:33.180
and you have nothing to lose
by taking some risks.

00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:35.985
But by then, it's often too late.

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.949
You don't have the resources
to run bold experiments.

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.279
The evidence suggests
that the best time to shake things up

00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:44.158
is actually when you're doing well.

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:47.553
That's when you have the time,
energy and freedom to innovate.

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:52.374
But sadly, research shows
that success often makes us complacent.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.285
Experts call it the "fat cat syndrome."

00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:59.390
Think about a time when you've been
at the top of your game.

00:03:59.414 --> 00:04:02.279
Did you really want to embrace
something radically different?
