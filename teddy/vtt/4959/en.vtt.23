But dissatisfaction
didn't always lead to creativity.

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:35.466
It only helped when people felt
committed to the company

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.076
and had access to the feedback
and support they needed.

00:11:38.744 --> 00:11:41.951
When you ignore them, disgruntled
people channel their frustration

00:11:41.975 --> 00:11:45.189
in unproductive or even
counterproductive directions.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.403
If you're aware they're out there, though,
and you really listen to them,

00:11:49.427 --> 00:11:51.034
they can become your allies.

00:11:52.688 --> 00:11:54.102
Lisa Bodell: They always say,

00:11:54.126 --> 00:11:57.113
"Innovation is the pirate ship
that sails into the yacht club."

00:11:57.137 --> 00:11:59.288
Nobody likes it, but
they appreciate it later.

00:11:59.312 --> 00:12:00.463
AG: This is Lisa Bodell.
