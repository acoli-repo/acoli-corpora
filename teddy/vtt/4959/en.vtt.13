00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:30.450
because we have the same group
that are doing things.

00:06:30.474 --> 00:06:34.181
And we're very proud of this group,
and this group is very talented.

00:06:34.205 --> 00:06:37.077
But we want to shake things up."

00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:40.813
And they felt like
whatever I was going to do,

00:06:40.837 --> 00:06:42.245
it was going to be different.

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:45.022
JW: And so they said, "OK, well, here.
Can you guys do it?

00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:47.316
Can you do it in half the time,
half the money?"

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.445
AG: They gave the answer
you'd probably give

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:51.485
if Steve Jobs had asked you that question.

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:52.817
JW: Well, sure we can!

00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:54.379
(Laughter)

00:06:54.403 --> 00:06:56.411
You know? You just say you can, right?

00:06:56.435 --> 00:06:58.664
And then you try to go
figure out how to do it.

00:06:58.966 --> 00:07:01.634
AG: So Pixar hired
John Walker and Brad Bird.
