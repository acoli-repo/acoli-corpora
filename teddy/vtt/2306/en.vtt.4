00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and get water and protein that is your starting material.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And this is an insight

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that came, about two decades ago,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
David Kaplan.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And so we get this starting material.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And so this starting material is back to the basic building block.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And then we use this to do a variety of things --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
like, for example, this film.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And we take advantage of something that is very simple.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The recipe to make those films

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is to take advantage of the fact

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
that proteins are extremely smart at what they do.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They find their way to self-assemble.
