00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The components of this material are just water and protein.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So this material is silk.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So it's kind of different

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
from what we're used to thinking about silk.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So the question is, how do you reinvent something

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that has been around for five millennia?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And so we marvel at silk worms --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The silk worm does a remarkable thing:

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it uses these two ingredients, protein and water,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that are in its gland,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so comparable to technical fibers
