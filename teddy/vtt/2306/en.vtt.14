00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Silk, during its self-assembly process,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
acts like a cocoon for biological matter.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And so if you change the recipe,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and you add things when you pour --

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
so you add things to your liquid silk solution --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
where these things are enzymes

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
or antibodies or vaccines,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the self-assembly process

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
preserves the biological function of these dopants.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So it makes the materials environmentally active

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and interactive.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So that screw that you thought about beforehand

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
can actually be used

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together --
