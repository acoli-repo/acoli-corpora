00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
in principle, can be implanted and disappear.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And what you see there in that tissue section,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
in fact, is you see that reflector tape.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So, much like you're seen at night by a car,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
then the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
you can see deeper parts of tissue

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And reintegration in the human body

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is not the only thing,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
but reintegration in the environment is important.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So you have a clock, you have protein,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and now a silk cup like this
