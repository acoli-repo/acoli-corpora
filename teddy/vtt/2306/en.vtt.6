00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So it would be able to replicate the information

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that is on the DVD.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And we can store information that's film with water and protein.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
which is right here, and the message is over there.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And much like in the DVD, you can read it out optically.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And this requires a stable hand,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So let me see.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So as you see the film go in transparently through there,
