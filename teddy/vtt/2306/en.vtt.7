So as you see the film go in transparently through there,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and then ...

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
(Applause)

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And the most remarkable feat

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So once you have these attributes

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
of this material,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
then you can do a lot of things.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's actually not limited to films.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And so the material can assume a lot of formats.
