00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to talk about a new, old material

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that still continues to amaze us,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and that might impact the way we think

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
about material science, high technology --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and maybe, along the way,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So that's kind of a bold statement.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll tell you a little bit more.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's sustainable; it's a sustainable material

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that is processed all in water and at room temperature --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and is biodegradable with a clock,
