00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and now a silk cup like this

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
can be thrown away without guilt --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
(Applause)

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
unlike the polystyrene cups

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's edible,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
It doesn't taste good,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Silk, during its self-assembly process,
