00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together --

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and deliver drugs at the same,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
while your bone is healing, for example.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So we've made a silk card

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
with penicillin in it.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
so 140 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And so that could be ---

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
(Applause)

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that could be potentially a good alternative

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to solar powered refrigerated camels. (Laughter)
