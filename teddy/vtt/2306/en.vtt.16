00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that could be potentially a good alternative

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to solar powered refrigerated camels. (Laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And of course, there's no use in storage if you can't use [it].

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And so there is this other unique material trait

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that these materials have, that they're programmably degradable.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And so what you see there is the difference.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
In the top, you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and in the bottom, a film that has been programmed to degrade in water.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And what you see is that the film on the bottom

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
releases what is inside it.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs
