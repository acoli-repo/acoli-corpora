00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And so the material can assume a lot of formats.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And then you go a little crazy, and so you do various optical components

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
or you do microprism arrays,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Or you can do beautiful things

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that, if the camera can capture, you can make.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
You can add a third dimensionality to the film.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And if the angle is right,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But you can do other things.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and so we've made optical fibers.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics.
