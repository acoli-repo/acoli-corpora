00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so comparable to technical fibers

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
like Kevlar.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And so in the reverse engineering process

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that we know about,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and that we're familiar with,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
for the textile industry,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and then weaves glamorous things.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We want to know how you go from water and protein

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So the insight

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is how do you actually reverse engineer this

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and go from cocoon to gland

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and get water and protein that is your starting material.
