00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Or if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So there's versatility, as you see,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
in the material formats,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that you can do with silk.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
But there are still some unique traits.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I mean, why would you want to do all these things for real?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning;

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And you see here a picture of a tissue section.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
in principle, can be implanted and disappear.
