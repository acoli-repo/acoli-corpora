00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that is processed all in water and at room temperature --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and is biodegradable with a clock,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or have it stable for years.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's edible; it's implantable in the human body

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
without causing any immune response.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It actually gets reintegrated in the body.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And it's technological,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so it can do things like microelectronics,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and maybe photonics do.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And the material

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
looks something like this.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The components of this material are just water and protein.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So this material is silk.
