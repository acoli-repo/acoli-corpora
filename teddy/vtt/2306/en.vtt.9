00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And you can think of different formats.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So for instance, if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
we do microneedle arrays.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
What you see there on the screen is a human hair

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
superimposed on the needle that's made of silk --

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
just to give you a sense of size.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
You can do bigger things.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You can do gears and nuts and bolts --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that you can buy at Whole Foods.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And the gears work in water as well.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So you think of alternative mechanical parts.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
to replace peripheral veins, for example,
