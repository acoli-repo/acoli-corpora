They find their way to self-assemble.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So the recipe is simple: you take the silk solution, you pour it,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and you wait for the protein to self-assemble.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And then you detach the protein and you get this film,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But I mentioned that the film is also technological.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And so what does that mean?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It means that you can interface it

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
with some of the things that are typical of technology,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
like microelectronics and nanoscale technology.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And the image of the DVD here

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
is just to illustrate a point

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface,
