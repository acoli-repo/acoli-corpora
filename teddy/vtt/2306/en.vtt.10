00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
to replace peripheral veins, for example,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
or maybe an entire bone.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And so you have here a little example

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
of a small skull --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
what we call mini Yorick.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
(Laughter)

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But you can do things like cups, for example,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and so, if you add a little bit of gold, if you add a little bit of semiconductors

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You can do electronic pieces

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
that fold and wrap.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Or if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So there's versatility, as you see,
