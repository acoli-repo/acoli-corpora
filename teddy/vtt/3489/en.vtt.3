00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:32.969
we'd spend our time in villages
learning local languages,

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:35.031
traveling on public transports.

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:39.535
And what this allowed us to do
was to get a really deep understanding

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:41.527
of what was going on at the field level.

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:42.969
Combined with this experience

00:01:42.993 --> 00:01:45.823
and hundreds of other Engineers
Without Borders experiences,

00:01:45.847 --> 00:01:49.644
we got a really interesting perspective
of what's going on in this aid industry.

00:01:49.668 --> 00:01:52.196
The aid industry has gotten
a lot of attention lately.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.320
A lot of economists have become authors
and have written about it.

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:57.839
There's a lot of controversy
about its effectiveness,

00:01:57.863 --> 00:02:00.944
some even asking
the question, "Has aid failed?"
