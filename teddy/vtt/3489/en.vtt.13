00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.271
The people who have that power
are the donors.

00:06:31.295 --> 00:06:34.548
And when you look at the system,
you can see some of the challenges.

00:06:34.572 --> 00:06:37.734
Development is the sector
that focuses more on pleasing the donors

00:06:37.758 --> 00:06:40.045
and making them happy
and communicating to them,

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:42.890
as opposed to understanding
the needs of the beneficiaries.

00:06:42.914 --> 00:06:46.315
Because of that, systematic challenge
is very slow to innovate,

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.829
there's very little change,

00:06:47.853 --> 00:06:50.675
and you get exactly the same project
built ten years later

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:52.420
that fails in exactly the same way.

00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:53.836
So what we do about this?

00:06:54.285 --> 00:06:55.885
First answer is easy:

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:57.923
we invest in the private
and public sectors

00:06:57.947 --> 00:06:59.126
in the developing world.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.005
They're inherently structurally built
to be more sustainable
