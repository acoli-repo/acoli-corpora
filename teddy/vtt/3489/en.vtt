Meet Inook. He's a pretty happy guy.

00:00:03.514 --> 00:00:05.097
And I'd be pretty happy, too,

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:09.116
if this was the first time my community
had just gained access to fresh water.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.884
Inook is from the country of Malawi,

00:00:10.908 --> 00:00:13.636
the small sliver of a country
in Southern Africa,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.803
known as "The Warm Heart of Africa."

00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:19.652
Over the past 10 years, five million
more people like Inook in Malawi

00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:21.335
have gained access to fresh water.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.120
But what's unfortunate
is that this picture is a lie.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.488
I'll come back to that in a second.
