You gave up your job in the oil
and gas sector to go volunteer in India.

That's really inspiring."

A year later, I contacted my NGO
to see how everything was going

00:09:06.824 --> 00:09:08.859
with the rainwater harvesting systems.

00:09:09.962 --> 00:09:13.614
And they told me that not a single one
was still operating.

00:09:15.654 --> 00:09:18.949
The reason was because a lot
of them had been built,

00:09:18.973 --> 00:09:21.334
but some of them had broken down

00:09:21.358 --> 00:09:24.173
because there was no maintenance
schedule put in place.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:28.088
I had made the exact same mistake
that I criticized earlier.
