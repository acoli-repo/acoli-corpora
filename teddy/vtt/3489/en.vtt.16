00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:01.134
and expected four of them to do OK,

00:08:01.158 --> 00:08:02.531
one of them to do fantastic

00:08:02.555 --> 00:08:04.279
and five of them to fail?

00:08:04.303 --> 00:08:08.419
And not all of the solutions
need to be that complex.

00:08:09.162 --> 00:08:12.626
Engineers Without Borders is working on
one that's actually quite simple;

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.311
it's admitting failure.

00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:17.245
My first project with Engineers
Without Borders was in India.

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:18.863
I worked with a bunch of schools,

00:08:18.887 --> 00:08:21.351
the poorest schools in India,
the untouchable caste.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:24.302
This is Bani, she was a girl
who was in one of those schools

00:08:24.326 --> 00:08:27.391
and she and her classmates had to spend
two to three hours a day

00:08:27.415 --> 00:08:30.040
walking to collect water
to bring it back to the school
