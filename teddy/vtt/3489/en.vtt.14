They're inherently structurally built
to be more sustainable

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:04.482
and to allow beneficiaries
to hold them accountable.

00:07:04.506 --> 00:07:07.550
However, 70% of people
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:07:07.574 --> 00:07:10.617
still make less than two dollars
a day and are still in poverty.

00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:13.918
And a lot of that reason is because
the private and the public sector

00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:15.615
are not serving them appropriately.

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.710
So we do need to invest in businesses
and governments in Africa,

00:07:18.734 --> 00:07:22.052
but it's still going to take a long time
for the problems to be fixed.

00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:24.068
Therefore, that leaves us with one option

00:07:24.092 --> 00:07:25.871
and we need to work with this system.

00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:27.286
Therefore, we have to fix it.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.767
We need to make it more accountable,
more creative and more transparent.
