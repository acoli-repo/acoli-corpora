00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.488
I'll come back to that in a second.

00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:34.960
Ten years ago, two Waterloo engineers
sparked a movement across Canada,

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:36.421
"Engineers Without Borders."

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:40.760
This movement was based on the concept
that it was completely unacceptable

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:44.194
that 5 million people in Malawi
did not have access to fresh water,

00:00:44.218 --> 00:00:47.116
when us engineers back in Canada
were working on problems

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.427
such as making a photocopier
increase its speed

00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:52.388
from 149 pages a minute
to 151 pages per minute.

00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:55.348
We needed to work
on problems that mattered.

00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:57.973
I was fortunate, I founded
the Calgary chapter here.

00:00:57.997 --> 00:01:00.419
I got to be the first director
of overseas programs
