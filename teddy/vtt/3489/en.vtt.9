00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.170
something like a well,
something like a school,

00:04:31.194 --> 00:04:33.037
something like giving a family a goat.

00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:35.524
It's not as sexy and easy
to tell your friends about

00:04:35.548 --> 00:04:38.995
how you helped fund a water committee
or paid for teacher salaries.

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:42.420
So when I say that
this picture of Inook is a lie,

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.899
it's not a lie when the picture is taken.

00:04:46.701 --> 00:04:50.348
It only becomes a lie
a year or two afterwards.

00:04:52.047 --> 00:04:55.114
When looking at these pictures,
one of my great colleagues said,

00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:57.653
"Everything people see
from Africa doesn't matter.

00:04:57.677 --> 00:05:01.209
And everything that matters
from Africa, people don't get to see."
