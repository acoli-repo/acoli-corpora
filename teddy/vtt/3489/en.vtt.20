00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.122
But Engineers Without Borders has
this culture of embracing failure openly

00:10:01.146 --> 00:10:02.560
and letting us talk about it.

00:10:02.584 --> 00:10:05.378
And it was only through a bunch
of us talking about failure

00:10:05.402 --> 00:10:08.098

00:10:08.122 --> 00:10:10.912
and we're making the same mistakes

00:10:10.936 --> 00:10:12.769
And we started to innovate and change.

00:10:12.793 --> 00:10:15.393

10 years later than what we thought
Engineers should be doing in development.

00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:22.418
We don't build water points anymore;
in fact, we don't build anything

00:10:22.442 --> 00:10:23.593
other than spreadsheets.

00:10:23.617 --> 00:10:25.831
We now have this innovative
marketing campaign,

00:10:25.855 --> 00:10:27.448
"Sponsor an African spreadsheet,"

00:10:27.472 --> 00:10:30.871
because we understand that
the problems are not hardware problems;
