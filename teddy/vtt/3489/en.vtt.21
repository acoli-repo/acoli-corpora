00:10:27.472 --> 00:10:30.871
because we understand that
the problems are not hardware problems;

00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:32.989
it's all about
that software side of things.

00:10:33.013 --> 00:10:35.302
But it's a hard concept
to get across to people;

00:10:35.326 --> 00:10:37.055
they want to fund wells and schools.

00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:39.453
But it's really about
the software side of things,

00:10:39.477 --> 00:10:42.174
and it's a lot longer a process
to fund those things.

00:10:42.198 --> 00:10:44.041
And it's not sexy, but it works.

00:10:44.065 --> 00:10:48.415
Our staff members were really exited
to share this failure internally,

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:51.745
but we still were not doing a good job
of letting other people know.

00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:55.216
And some very courageous field staff
were getting upset at the management

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.073
because other projects were
going to make the same failures;

00:10:58.097 --> 00:10:59.253
they weren't learning.

00:10:59.277 --> 00:11:01.034
So they pushed our management staff.
