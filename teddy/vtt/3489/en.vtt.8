Actually, Engineers Without Borders
has done some work

00:04:00.813 --> 00:04:04.423
and found out that even though there's 80%
coverage of water points,

00:04:04.447 --> 00:04:06.083
40% are not working.

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.360
See, this issue is ...

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:11.834
A lot of donors and projects

00:04:11.858 --> 00:04:13.438
the hardware side of the issue

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:17.503
and not really realizing the importance
of the software side of things.

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:21.744

of course you have to do maintenance.

00:04:21.768 --> 00:04:24.663
But when you think about it
as people donating to charities,

00:04:24.687 --> 00:04:26.148
it makes you feel a lot better

00:04:26.172 --> 00:04:28.856
if you know that your money went
to something tangible,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.170
something like a well,
something like a school,
