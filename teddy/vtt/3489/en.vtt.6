00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.287
down into a number of communities
where there are taps,

00:03:02.311 --> 00:03:03.890
and people can access that water.

00:03:03.914 --> 00:03:06.474
And he was going around
turning on some of those taps,

00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:07.713
and some weren't working.

00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:09.098
So he asked the community,

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.042
"How many of these aren't working?"

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.381
And they said, "Well, out of 113, 81."

00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:17.320
81? What's the problem? What's going on?

00:03:17.344 --> 00:03:21.537
He found out that a lot of the pipes
had sprung leaks and broken down.

00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:25.140
All right, not a big deal,
pipes break down everywhere.

00:03:25.164 --> 00:03:27.652
But the problem
with this project was that,

00:03:27.676 --> 00:03:29.686
even though the infrastructure was built,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.078
there was no thinking about
who was going to maintain the system.
