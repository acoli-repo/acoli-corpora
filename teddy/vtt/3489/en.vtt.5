00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:31.533
in democratically elected,
stable governments with no civil unrest,

00:02:31.557 --> 00:02:34.093
countries like Ghana, Malawi and Zambia.

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:37.335
So, I talked about Malawi.

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:42.088
The World Bank has stated
that 80% of the people in Malawi

00:02:42.112 --> 00:02:43.971
have access to fresh water sources.

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:46.927
So one of our staff members
in Malawi, this is Owen,

00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:48.906
was visiting one of those water points.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.459
It was a gravity-fed system

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:52.805
that was commissioned
by the Canadian government

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.836
and finished about a year and a half ago.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.248
A gravity-fed system
basically is a bunch of pipes

00:02:57.272 --> 00:02:59.666
that pipe water down
from an elevated region

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.287
down into a number of communities
where there are taps,
