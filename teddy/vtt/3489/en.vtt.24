"It's not just the development sector
that has this challenge,

00:12:01.115 --> 00:12:03.082
it crosses into a lot of other sectors."

00:12:03.106 --> 00:12:04.937
Two companies had big failures lately.

00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:08.531
What's interesting about them is,
one of them publicly admitted the failure

00:12:08.555 --> 00:12:12.057
and talked about what they learned
from it and what they'll do next time.

00:12:12.081 --> 00:12:15.187
The other one kind of tried
to not talk about it at all.

00:12:15.211 --> 00:12:19.994

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:29.015
think about: How does your organization
think about and share failure?

00:12:29.525 --> 00:12:31.135
Maybe ask the person next to you,
