00:05:58.855 --> 00:06:01.953
And then if we don't innovate, change
and adapt to their needs,

00:06:01.977 --> 00:06:03.148
we go out of business.

00:06:03.172 --> 00:06:05.140
They have a power to hold us accountable.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:06.701
If we look to the public sector,

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:09.768
it doesn't adapt and change
quite as fast as the private sector,

00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:11.054
but at the end of the day,

00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:14.356
if the elected government doesn't meet
the needs of its constituents,

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.497
they have a chance
to vote them out of power,

00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:18.192
therefore holding them accountable.

00:06:18.216 --> 00:06:19.665
But in the development sector,

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.287
if they don't serve the needs
of their beneficiaries --

00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:25.549
and they're not just NGOs, but governments
and businesses as well --

00:06:25.573 --> 00:06:28.686
the beneficiaries have no power
to vote them out or to fire them.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.271
The people who have that power
are the donors.
