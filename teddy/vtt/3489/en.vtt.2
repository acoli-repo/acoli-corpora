WEBVTT

00:00:57.997 --> 00:01:00.419
I got to be the first director
of overseas programs

00:01:00.443 --> 00:01:02.361
for Engineers Without Borders in Africa,

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:03.866
where I worked for four years.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.079
And I got to work
with hundreds of businesses,

00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:08.153
non-government organizations, governments,

00:01:08.177 --> 00:01:10.361
all working in this field of development.

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.931
It was really fantastic working
for Engineers Without Borders

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:17.111
because even though we worked
on hundred-million-dollar projects,

00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:18.316
we had this philosophy

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.879
that if we were really going to understand
the problems in local Africa,

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:24.564
we needed to live like local Africans.

00:01:24.588 --> 00:01:27.221
So, as a lot of ex-patriots
would spend most of the time

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.090
in the capital cities and boardrooms,

00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:32.969
we'd spend our time in villages
learning local languages,
