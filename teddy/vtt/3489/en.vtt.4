00:01:57.863 --> 00:02:00.944
some even asking
the question, "Has aid failed?"

00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:02.801
It's a very interesting question.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.561
Now, I can confidently say

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:08.034
on behalf of Engineers
Without Borders staff members

00:02:08.058 --> 00:02:11.708
that, failed or not, we definitely feel
that the aid system is broken.

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:13.828
And when I say broken,

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:16.549
I'm not talking about
what the media usually talks about.

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.634
It's not about corrupt dictators
or about corruption.

00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:22.484
Those issues still happen in Africa,

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:25.875
but they're much more the minority
than they are the mainstream today.

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:27.627
I'm talking about aid being broken

00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:31.533
in democratically elected,
stable governments with no civil unrest,
