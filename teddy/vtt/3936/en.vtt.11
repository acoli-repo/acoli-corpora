As a tribute to her trauma,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.416
she commissioned Montreal-based
architect Federico Carbajal

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.240
to construct a wire sculpture
of her damaged lower leg.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.560
Now, notice those bright red screws
magnified in the sculpture.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.920
These are the actual surgical screws
used in reconstructing her ankle.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.000
It's medical hardware
that's been repurposed as art.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.456
People often ask me how I choose
the art that I showcase online
