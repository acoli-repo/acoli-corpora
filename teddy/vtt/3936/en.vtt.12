People often ask me how I choose
the art that I showcase online

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.416
or feature in gallery shows.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.096
And for me it's a balance
between the technique

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.856
and a concept that pushes the boundaries
of anatomy as a way to know thyself,

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.200
which is why the work
of Michael Reedy struck me.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.576
His serious figure drawings
are often layered in elements of humor.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.680
For instance, take a look at her face.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.240
Notice those red marks.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.496
Michael manifests the consuming
insecurity of a skin condition

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.496
as these maniacal cartoon monsters
