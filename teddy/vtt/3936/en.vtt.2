Something no student of anatomy
could do without the help of visuals.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.936
Because at the end of the day,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.616
whether you remember
every little structure or not,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.216
these medical illustrations are what
makes studying anatomy so intriguing.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.696

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.960

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.976
These beautiful illustrations
are then shut back

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.976
into the pages of a medical textbook,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.216
or an app,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.600
referenced only when needed.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.656
And for the public,
