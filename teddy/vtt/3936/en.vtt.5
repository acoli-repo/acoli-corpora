And this drive to not only teach
but also to entertain

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.480
resulted in some of the strangest
anatomical illustrations.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.136
Anatomy was caught in a struggle
between science, art and culture

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.960
that lasted for over 500 years.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.856
Artists rendered
dissected cadavers as alive,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.560
posed in these humorous
anatomical stripteases.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.400
Imagine seeing that
in your textbooks today.
