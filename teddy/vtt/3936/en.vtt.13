00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.496
as these maniacal cartoon monsters

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.680
annoying and out of control
in the background.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.880
On the mirrored figure,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.776
he renders the full anatomy

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.936
and covers it in glitter,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.320
making it look like candy.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.856
By doing this,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.256
Michael downplays
the common perception of anatomy

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.760
so closely tied to just disease and death.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.616
Now, this next concept
might not make much sense,

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.560
but human anatomy
is no longer limited to humans.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.656
When you were a child,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.136
did you ever wish
that your toys could come to life?
