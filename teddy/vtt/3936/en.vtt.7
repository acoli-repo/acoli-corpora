The introduction of color

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.136
then brought a whole new
depth and clarity to anatomy

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.520
that made it stunning.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.776
By the early 20th century,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.256
the perfect balance of science
and art had finally been struck

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.096
with the emergence
of medical illustrators.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.976
They created a universal
representation of anatomy --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.856
something that was neither alive nor dead,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.240
that was free from those influences
of artistic culture.
