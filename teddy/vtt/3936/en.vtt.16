00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.856
Now, this next artist
I've been following for many years,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.200
watching him excite
the public about anatomy.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.216
Danny Quirk is a young artist

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.520
who paints his subjects
in the process of self-dissection.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.616
He bends the rules of medical illustration

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.040
by inserting a very dramatic
light and shadow.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.176
And this creates a 3-D illusion

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.320
that lends itself very well
to painting directly on the human skin.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.360
Danny makes it look as if a person's
skin has actually been removed.
