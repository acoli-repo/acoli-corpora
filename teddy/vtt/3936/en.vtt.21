But for them,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.976
anatomy isn't just something to memorize,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.160
but a base from which to understand
the human body on a meaningful level;

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.456
to depict it in ways that we can relate,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.816
whether it be through cartoons,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.056
body painting

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.280
or street art.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.056
Anatomical art has the power

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.096
to reach far beyond
the pages of a medical textbook,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.296
to ignite an excitement in the public,

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.760
and reinvigorate an enthusiasm
in the medical world,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.680
ultimately connecting our innermost selves
with our bodies through art.
