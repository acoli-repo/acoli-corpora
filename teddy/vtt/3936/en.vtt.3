And for the public,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.536
medical illustrations
may only be encountered passively

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.200

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.336

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.240
and are thrusting it
into the public space.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.776
For the past nine years,
I have been cataloguing and sharing

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.296
