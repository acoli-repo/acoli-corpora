Danny makes it look as if a person's
skin has actually been removed.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.775
And this effect --

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.000
also cool and tattoo-like --

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.799
easily transitions
into a medical illustration.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.296
Now Danny is currently
traveling the world,

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.336
teaching anatomy to the public
via his body paintings,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.416
which is why it was
so shocking to find out

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.160
that he was rejected
from medical illustration programs.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.920
But he's doing just fine.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.736
Then there are artists

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.536
who are extracting anatomy from both
the medical world and the art world
