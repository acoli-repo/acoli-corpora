00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.200
Fear of anatomy and guts
is a learned reaction.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.440
This anatomization also extends to
politically and socially charged objects.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.456
In Noah Scalin's "Anatomy of War,"

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.040
we see a gun dissected
to reveal human organs.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.896
But if you look closely,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.680
you'll notice that it lacks a brain.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.136
And if you keep looking,
you might also notice

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.256
that Noah has so thoughtfully
placed the rectum

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.160
at the business end of that gun barrel.
