As a lover of human anatomy,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.576
I'm so excited that we're finally
putting our bodies at the center of focus.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.176
Through practices
such as preventive medicine,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.656
patient empowerment

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.256
and self-monitoring --

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.816
down to now obsessing
over every single step we take in a day.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.456
All of this works to promote

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.240
a healthy connection
between ourselves and our bodies.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.016
Despite all this focus
on the healthy self,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.880
general public knowledge
of the anatomical self is lacking.
