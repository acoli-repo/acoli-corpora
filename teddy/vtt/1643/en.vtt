It is said that the grass is always greener

00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:07.726
on the other side of the fence,

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:10.872
and I believe this is true,

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:13.456
especially when I hear President Obama

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:15.954
often talk about the Korean education system

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:19.465
as a benchmark of success.

00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:21.862
Well, I can tell you that,

00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:25.409
in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.600
of the Korean school system,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.934
also known as pressure cooker,

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:35.593
not everyone can do well in that environment.
