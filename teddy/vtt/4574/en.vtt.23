00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.536
but solely because
that's what you believe in,

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.576
because that's what makes your heart sing.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.840

because that is what
is going to change this world

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.936
and that is what defines us.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.296
