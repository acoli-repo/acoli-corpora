My mom is a strong black woman

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.520
who raised her kids to have
the same sense of strength and pride.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.656
This spirit was epitomized
by a single wall

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.136
in our small, two-bedroom apartment
on the South Side of Chicago.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.416
Two pictures hung proudly:

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.536
one larger-than-life photo
of my siblings and I

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.416
and the other a picture of my mom

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.656
at 12 years old

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.400
staring into the eyes
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.816
When I was younger,
I used to stand on my tippy-toes,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.096
stare at that picture,
