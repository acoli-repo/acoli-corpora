00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.816
You know, for me, what kept me
pushing on through the rescue

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.776
was the thought of those child soldiers.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.656
It became personal.
I was able to go to Africa at one point.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.136
I met these incredible people.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.536
I have friends that have been
living in this conflict their entire life,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.976
and it was personal to me.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.080
But that doesn't have to be
what drives you.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.816
You know, you may want
to be the next Shepard Fairey

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.296
or the next JK Rowling

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.616
or the next whoever.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.816
It doesn't matter, but whatever you want,

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.416
chase after it
with everything that you have --

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.336
not because of the fame or the fortune,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.536
but solely because
that's what you believe in,
