00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:30.816
What do I do? What can one 17-year-old do?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.364
You've got to give me something.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.166
And they gave me something.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.496
The founders and filmmakers
at Invisible Children told me

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.776
that there was this bill,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.816
that if we could
just get this bill passed,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.616
it would do two things:
one, it would apprehend Joseph Kony

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.616
and the top commanders in his rebel army,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.816
and two, it would provide funding
for the recovery of these regions

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.936
that had been devastated
by 25 years of war.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.656
And I was like, done. Let me at it.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.160
I swear I will do whatever I can
to make this happen.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.096
So myself and 99 other
idealistic 18- to 20-year-olds
