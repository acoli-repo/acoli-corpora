00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.096
So myself and 99 other
idealistic 18- to 20-year-olds

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.200
hopped on a plane to intern
in San Diego with Invisible Children.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.096
I was postponing college.
We weren't getting paid for this

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.296
and you could call it irresponsible
or crazy -- my parents did.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.480
But for us, it would have been
insane not to go.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.375
We all felt this urgency,
and we would do whatever it took

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.120
to pass this bill.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.696
So we were given our first task.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.496
We were going to plan an event called
the Rescue of Joseph Kony's Child Soldiers

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.656
where participants would come
in a hundred cities worldwide

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.136
and rally in their city center
