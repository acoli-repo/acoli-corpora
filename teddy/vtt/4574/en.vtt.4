00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.136
and because I'm biracial,
they would tell me,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.816
"You can't be both.
You have to choose, black or white."

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.056
And in the end
I just resented being either.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.936
And then all of a sudden,
my senior year rolls around, 2008,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.936
and being mixed, being racially
ambiguous is this new cool fad,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.176
like, "Natalie, now it's OK
for you to like you. You're pretty now."

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.416
I was over it. I was tired of caring
about what other people thought

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.056
and I just wanted to hurry up,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.176
go through my classes,
whatever school I was going to be at next,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.456
and graduate.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.576
It wasn't until I was 17

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.696
and I saw a film
called "Invisible Children"

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.960
that something happened.
