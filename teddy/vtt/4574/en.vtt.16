00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.536
(Applause)

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.576
So you would think
that this is the moment in my life,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.040
the pinnacle that
made me an extraordinary.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.336
And it was an awesome moment.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.016

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.496

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.136

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.256
It made for a heck of a profile picture
on Facebook for a week.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.496
(Laughter)

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.656
But I had been extraordinary all along,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.880
and I wasn't alone.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.135
You see, even though
my story was featured in this film,
