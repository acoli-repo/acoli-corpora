00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.096
stare at that picture,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.695
close my eyes tightly,
and just pretend that it was me

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.536
gazing up at the man who revolutionized
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.336
who marched on Washington
and who transformed a generation

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.840
by his words, "I have a dream."

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.376
But I did get to meet him.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.296
Now, obviously, I didn't meet Dr. King,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.400
but I met a man named Dr. Vincent Harding.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.976
He worked with Dr. King from day one

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.600
and even wrote some of his
most iconic speeches.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.456
You see, this was a really
important moment for me as a kid,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.616
because it was the first time
that I realized

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.136
that it wasn't just Dr. King
who led this revolution,
