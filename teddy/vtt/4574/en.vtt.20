10 days after we were on Oprah,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.200
the bill was introduced into Congress.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.291
A year after that, it got unanimously

00:10:06.316 --> 00:10:09.856
267 cosponsors in Congress.

00:10:09.903 --> 00:10:11.292
And then one week after that,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.656
President Obama signed our bill into law.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.320
(Applause)

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.056
And none of us interns got to be there.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.056
We didn't get to be there in this moment.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.296
Our founders were there.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.376
They're the guys
cheesing in the background.
