00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.136
and rally in their city center

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.256
until a celebrity or a political figure

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.176
came and used their voice
on behalf of these child soldiers,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.400
and at that point each city was "rescued."

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.480
But the catch was, we weren't
leaving the cities until we were rescued.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.176
I was given Chicago and nine other cities

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.816
and I told my bosses, I was like,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.296
"If we're going for big-name people,
why not go for the queen bee? Right?

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.776
Why not go for Oprah Winfrey?"

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.576
They thought I was a little idealistic,
but I mean, we were trying to think big.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.256
We were doing an impossible thing,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.496
so why not try to reach
more impossible things?

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.000
And so we had from January
to April to get this done.
