00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.376
That is my hospital bill
from the kidney infection I got

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.816
from an overconsumption of caffeine
due to this event.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.856
(Laughter)

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.576
These were just some

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.136

all over the country to be reinforcements

00:05:56.017 --> 00:05:57.536
and join their voice with ours.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.816
And finally, on May 1,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.136
