00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.136
we wrapped ourselves around Oprah's studio

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.656
and we got her attention.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.336
This is a clip from a film
called "Together We Are Free"

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.240
documenting the rescue event
and my attempt to get Oprah.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.016
(Video) Oprah Winfrey:
When I drove into the office,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.136
there was a giant -- when you came in,
was there a group outside?

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.376
Crowd: Yes.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.816
OW: Holding up signs
asking if I would talk to them

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.096
for just five minutes,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.056
so I was happy to do so.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.336
And they are with a group
called "Invisible Children,"

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.216
and I told this group outside

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.576
that I'd give them a minute
to state their case.
