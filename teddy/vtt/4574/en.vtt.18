00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.616
The girl on the left, her name's Colleen.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.696
Colleen moved to Mexico,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.256
moved, for three months,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.896
to plan five events there,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.216
only to be kicked out
the day before the events

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.720
because of the swine flu.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.096
And then there was this family.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.536
This family, they didn't
get to come to the rescue.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.856
They couldn't make it out,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.216
but they ordered
a hundred boxes of pizza for us,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.056
delivered them to the corner
of Michigan and Randolph

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.136
where we were all silently protesting.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.936
You see, it was people like this
doing whatever they could,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.136
simultaneously, single-mindedly,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.136
without a care to who was watching,
