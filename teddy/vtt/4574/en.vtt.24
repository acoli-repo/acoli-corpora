00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.296
Despite what people think,

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.976
my Oprah moments,
my being on TED, doesn't define me,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.096
because if you were
to follow me home to LA,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.016
you would see me waiting tables
and nannying to pay the bills

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.440
as I chase after my dream
of becoming a filmmaker.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.496
In the small, anonymous, monotonous

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.256
every-single-day acts,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.000
I have to remind myself
to be extraordinary.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.456
And believe me, when the door
is closed and the cameras are off,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.136
it's tough.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.896
But if there's one thing
that I want to drive home to you,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.576
one thing that I can say,
not just to you but to myself,
