00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.416
One man,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.056
one man with one charismatic voice,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.656
started this whole thing.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.880
His name is Joseph Kony.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.656
When I saw this film, something happened.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.936
Something started
kind of stirring inside of me,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.696
and I couldn't identify what it was.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.856
I didn't know if it was rage,
if it was pity,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.136
if I felt guilty
because this was the first time

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.840
I'd heard about a 25-year-long war.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.416
I couldn't even give it a name.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.186
All I knew is that it kicked me off my ass
and I started asking questions.

00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:30.816
What do I do? What can one 17-year-old do?
