00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.336
Two things that I did
struggle with a lot

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.576
growing up was one --

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.896
that my dad has been sick my whole life.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.416
He suffers from Parkinson's
and pancreatitis,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.736
and as a kid, it was so hard
for me to watch my hero

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.040
in so much pain.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.976
And my other issue was with me.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.200
I guess you could say
I had an identity crisis.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.736
I had to move four times
during high school,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.056
and my freshman year I went
to an extremely racist high school.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.456
Kids were so cruel.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.136
They gave us hate letters,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.976
wrote terrible things on our lockers

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.136
and because I'm biracial,
they would tell me,
