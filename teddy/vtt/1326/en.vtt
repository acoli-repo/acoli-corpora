00:00:00.942 --> 00:00:03.770
Ah yes, those university days,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.673
a heady mix of Ph.D-level pure mathematics

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:10.144
and world debating championships,

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:15.397
or, as I like to say, "Hello, ladies. Oh yeah."

00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:17.389
Didn't get much sexier than the Spence

00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:18.853
at university, let me tell you.

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:23.239
It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.570
from Sydney, Australia, to be here on the TED stage

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.733
literally on the other side of the world.

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.366
And I wanted to let you know, a lot of the things you've heard

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.011
about Australians are true.
