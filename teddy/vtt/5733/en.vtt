00:00:00.806 --> 00:00:04.986
I was excited to be a part
of the "Dream" theme,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.389
and then I found out I'm leading off

00:00:08.413 --> 00:00:11.948
(Laughter)

00:00:11.972 --> 00:00:16.438
And certainly there are things
about the climate crisis that qualify.

00:00:16.462 --> 00:00:18.725
And I have some bad news,

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.915
but I have a lot more good news.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.336
I'm going to propose three questions

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.100
and the answer to the first one

00:00:27.124 --> 00:00:29.491
necessarily involves a little bad news.

00:00:29.515 --> 00:00:34.924
But -- hang on, because the answers
to the second and third questions
