00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.851
And it's true that I never saw
anyone who looked like me

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:33.393
in television or in films,

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:38.518
and sure, my family and friends
and teachers all constantly warned me

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:42.417
that people like me
didn't make it in Hollywood.

00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:46.601
But I was an American.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:51.059
I had been taught to believe
that anyone could achieve anything,

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:54.518
regardless of the color of their skin,

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:57.309
the fact that my parents
immigrated from Honduras,

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.500
the fact that I had no money.
