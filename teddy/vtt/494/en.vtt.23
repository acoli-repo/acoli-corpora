while I believed what
the system believed about me.

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:34.934
And I did.

00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.851
I, like everyone around me,

00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:42.625
believed that it wasn't possible
for me to exist in my dream as I was.

00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:47.250
And I went about
trying to make myself invisible.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.684
What this revealed to me
was that it is possible

00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:59.726
to be the person
who genuinely wants to see change

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:05.667
while also being the person whose actions
keep things the way they are.
