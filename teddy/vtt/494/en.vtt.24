00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:05.667
while also being the person whose actions
keep things the way they are.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.059
And what it's led me to believe
is that change isn't going to come

00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:15.018
by identifying the good guys
and the bad guys.

00:12:15.042 --> 00:12:17.851
That conversation
lets us all off the hook.

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:20.375
Because most of us
are neither one of those.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.101
Change will come

00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:25.059
when each of us has the courage

00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:29.309
to question our own fundamental
values and beliefs.

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:34.542
And then see to it that our actions
lead to our best intentions.
