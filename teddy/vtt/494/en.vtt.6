Not cardboard cutouts that stood
in the background of someone else's.

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:07.434
But when I dared to say that
to my manager --

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:11.143
that's the person I pay
to help me find opportunity --

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:14.184
his response was,

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:19.625
"Someone has to tell that girl
she has unrealistic expectations."

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:23.684
And he wasn't wrong.

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:26.143
I mean, I fired him, but he wasn't wrong.

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:28.309
(Laughter)

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:32.934
(Applause)
