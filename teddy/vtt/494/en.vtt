00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:04.059
On the red tiles in my family's den

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:08.226
I would dance and sing
to the made-for-TV movie "Gypsy,"

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.393
starring Bette Midler.

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:12.976
(Singing) "I had a dream.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.893
A wonderful dream, papa."

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:21.559
I would sing it with the urgency
and the burning desire of a nine-year-old

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:24.684
who did, in fact, have a dream.

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:28.476
My dream was to be an actress.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.851
And it's true that I never saw
anyone who looked like me
