00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:30.226
Just a few years ago, my agent called

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.226
to explain to me why
I wasn't getting a role in a movie.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.226
He said, "They loved you

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.893
and they really, really do want
to cast diversely,

00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:44.417
but the movie isn't financeable
until they cast the white role first."

00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:49.393
He delivered the message
with a broken heart

00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:53.250
and with a tone that communicated,
"I understand how messed up this is."

00:09:54.667 --> 00:10:00.601

hundreds of times before,
