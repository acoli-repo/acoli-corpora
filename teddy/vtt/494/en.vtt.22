00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.351
I thought sunscreen
and straightening irons

00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:08.458
would bring about change
in this deeply entrenched value system.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.434
But what I realized in that moment

00:11:13.458 --> 00:11:19.226
was that I was never actually asking
the system to change.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:24.833
I was asking it to let me in,
and those aren't the same thing.

00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:29.393
I couldn't change
what a system believed about me,

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:32.417
while I believed what
the system believed about me.
