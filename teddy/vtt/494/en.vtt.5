(Laughter)

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:35.476
These were the kinds of roles
that existed for someone like me.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.809
Someone they looked at
and saw as too brown, too fat,

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:43.559
too poor, too unsophisticated.

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:45.559
These roles were stereotypes

00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:49.226
and couldn't have been further
from my own reality

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.851
or from the roles I dreamt of playing.

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:55.809
I wanted to play people
who were complex and multidimensional,

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:59.768
people who existed in the center
of their own lives.

00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:04.518
Not cardboard cutouts that stood
in the background of someone else's.
