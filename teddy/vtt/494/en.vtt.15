00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:30.226
since I became the first and only Latina

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.208
to ever win an Emmy in a lead category.

00:07:34.333 --> 00:07:36.684
That is not a point of pride.

00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:39.226
That is a point of deep frustration.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.018
Not because awards prove our worth,

00:07:42.042 --> 00:07:45.851
but because who we see
thriving in the world

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:48.601
teaches us how to see ourselves,

00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:51.226
how to think about our own value,

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.934
how to dream about our futures.

00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.893
And anytime I begin to doubt that,

00:07:55.917 --> 00:08:01.018
I remember that there was a little girl,
living in the Swat Valley of Pakistan.
