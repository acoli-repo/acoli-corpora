00:06:30.042 --> 00:06:32.976
But I watched as very little happened.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.101
There was no watershed.

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:38.726
No one in the industry
was rushing to tell more stories

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.625
about the audience that was hungry
and willing to pay to see them.

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:50.750
Four years later,
when I got to play Ugly Betty,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.851
I saw the same phenomenon play out.

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:58.976
"Ugly Betty" premiered in the US
to 16 million viewers

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.208
and was nominated
for 11 Emmys in its first year.
