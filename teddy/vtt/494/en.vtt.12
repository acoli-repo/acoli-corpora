00:05:54.292 --> 00:06:00.559
I saw firsthand that people actually did
want to see stories about people like me.

00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:03.809
And that my unrealistic expectations

00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:07.893
to see myself authentically
represented in the culture

00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:10.125
were other people’s expectations, too.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.726
"Real Women Have Curves"

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.559
was a critical, cultural
and financial success.

00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:20.792
"Great," I thought, "We did it!

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.518
We proved our stories have value.

00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:27.375
Things are going to change now."
