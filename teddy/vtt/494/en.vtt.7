(Applause)

00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:38.143
Because whenever I did try to get a role
that wasn't a poorly written stereotype,

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:39.434
I would hear,

00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:42.559
"We're not looking
to cast this role diversely."

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:47.101
Or, "We love her,
but she's too specifically ethnic."

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:52.000
Or, "Unfortunately, we already have
one Latino in this movie."

00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:58.250
I kept receiving the same message
again and again and again.

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:04.750
That my identity was an obstacle
I had to overcome.
