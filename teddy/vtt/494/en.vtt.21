00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.792
A voice that said, "I'm tired.

00:10:31.917 --> 00:10:33.559
I've had enough."

00:10:33.583 --> 00:10:35.184
A voice that understood

00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:39.500
my tears and my pain
were not about losing a job.

00:10:40.417 --> 00:10:44.101
They were about what
was actually being said about me.

00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:48.018
What had been said about me my whole life

00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:51.018
by executives and producers

00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:54.059
and directors and writers
and agents and managers

00:10:54.083 --> 00:10:57.018
and teachers and friends and family.

00:10:57.042 --> 00:10:59.667
That I was a person of less value.
