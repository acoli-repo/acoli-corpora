00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.579
from a city called Kumasi
in a northern region of Ghana,

00:01:30.603 --> 00:01:31.787
in West Africa.

00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:35.713
He came for school, earning
his bachelor's degree in accounting

00:01:35.737 --> 00:01:37.641
and eventually became an accountant.

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:41.738
My mother, Georgina,
joined him years later.

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:43.821
She had a love of fashion

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:46.872
and worked in a sewing factory
in lower Manhattan,

00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:50.600
until she saved up enough to open
her own women's clothing store.

00:01:51.527 --> 00:01:53.457
I consider myself an American

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.846
and an African

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.024
and a Ghanaian.

00:01:57.548 --> 00:01:59.946
And there's millions of people
around the world

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.804
who are juggling
these different classifications.
