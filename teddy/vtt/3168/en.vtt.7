and many of them couldn't understand
why I sounded differently than they did

00:03:32.573 --> 00:03:35.606
or why my parents seemed
different than theirs.

00:03:36.336 --> 00:03:38.788
"Are you even black?" a student asked.

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:41.274
I mean, I thought I was black.

00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:42.948
(Laughter)

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.474
I thought my skin complexion settled that.

00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:46.705
(Laughter)

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.845
I asked my father about it,
and he shared his own confusion

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:53.473
over the significance of that
when he first came to the US.

00:03:54.806 --> 00:03:58.003
He explained to me that,
when he was in Ghana, everyone was black,

00:03:58.027 --> 00:03:59.840
so he never thought about it.
