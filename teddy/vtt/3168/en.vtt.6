00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:15.299

enough to eat in Ghana

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:17.763
and came to the US willingly.

00:03:17.787 --> 00:03:19.316

Junior high school was the first time

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.943
I went to school with a large number
of black American students,

00:03:28.845 --> 00:03:32.549
and many of them couldn't understand
why I sounded differently than they did
