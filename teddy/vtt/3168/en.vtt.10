A lot of people assume those targeted
Muslims only live in the Middle East,

00:05:02.074 --> 00:05:04.669
but a lot of those
banned people are Africans.

00:05:05.334 --> 00:05:10.116
So on these issues of education
and policy and religion,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.595
a lot of things we presume
about immigrants are incorrect.

00:05:14.634 --> 00:05:19.764
Even if we look at something
like workplace diversity and inclusion,

00:05:19.788 --> 00:05:22.822
if I asked you what
gender-ethnicity combination

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:26.854
is least likely to be promoted
to senior managerial positions,

00:05:26.878 --> 00:05:28.308
who would you think it was?

00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:30.626
The answer is not Africans this time.
