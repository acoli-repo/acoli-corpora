00:04:28.144 --> 00:04:30.787
if I asked you: What's the fastest-growing

00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:33.391
immigrant demographic
in the United States,

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:34.803
who would you think it was?

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:37.637
Nine out of 10 people
tell me it's Latinos,

00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:39.740
but it's actually African immigrants.

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:41.891
How about in academics?

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:45.214
What's the most educated
immigrant demographic?

00:04:45.754 --> 00:04:49.993
A lot of people presume it to be Asians,
but it's actually African immigrants.

00:04:50.017 --> 00:04:51.673
Even in matters of policy,

00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:54.596
did you know that three
out of the eight countries

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.019
in the so-called "travel ban"

00:04:56.043 --> 00:04:57.296
are African countries?

00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:02.050
A lot of people assume those targeted
Muslims only live in the Middle East,
