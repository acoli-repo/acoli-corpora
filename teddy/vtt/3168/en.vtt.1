00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.219
When I got to lunch
and I opened my thermos,

00:00:30.243 --> 00:00:33.320
releasing these new smells into the air,

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:35.763
my friends did not react favorably.

00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:37.236
(Laughter)

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.585
"What's that?" one of them asked.

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:42.392
"It's fufu," I responded.

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:43.431
(Laughter)

00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:46.791
"Ew, that smells funny.
What's a fufu?" they asked.

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:49.953
Their reaction made me lose my appetite.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.556
I begged my mother to never
send me to school with fufu again.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.086
I asked her to make me sandwiches
or chicken noodle soup

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.868
or any of the other foods
that my friends were eating.
