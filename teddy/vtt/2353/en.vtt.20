00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:02.893
it's 50 to 60 miles of effort,
and it's a lot of alone time.

00:10:02.917 --> 00:10:04.643
And for the most part,

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:08.101
you really have nothing to rely on
but yourself in those times.

00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:11.167
It's my average, and I'm trying
to get better little by little.

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:15.143
Well, this fall I was in Chicago
for the third time.

00:10:15.167 --> 00:10:16.518
It was my seventh marathon,

00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:19.476
and just like going back
to college for your junior year,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.101
you're anticipating
catching up with friends

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:25.268
and getting excited
about rolling right back into things.

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:28.684
Well, I attended the same pre-race meeting
and the same pre-race meal

00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:30.476
and caught up with those friends.
