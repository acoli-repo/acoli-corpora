00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:01.309
I was really careful not to compare

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:04.393
with how accomplished
those people on the internet were

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:05.684
and how fast they were,

00:08:05.708 --> 00:08:08.351
because if I had, I probably
never would have continued

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:09.809
going through with it.

00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:11.726
Well, the weekend of the race arrived,

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.458
and it was just like
going to college for the first time.

00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:16.434
You're dumped off,

00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:18.518
there's a whole bunch
of people around you,

00:08:18.542 --> 00:08:20.518
you don't really know very many of them,

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:22.768
somebody's got the cool stereo
and the cool TV

00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:26.309
and they're smart and they're pretty
and they're cute and they're handsome

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:28.268
and you don't know if you really belong.

00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:30.643
But then somebody says,
"Hey, let's go get food."
