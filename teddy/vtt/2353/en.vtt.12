00:05:58.292 --> 00:06:01.184
I continued to try to attack
things in that way,

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:06.309
and before I knew it I was being presented
with some pretty incredible challenges,

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:09.309
like completing a marathon
in a wheelchair.

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:11.393
In early 2016,
I met my physical therapist,

00:06:11.417 --> 00:06:14.934
and after a few really grueling sessions,
she must have sensed something,

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.684
because she pulled me aside and said,
"You know, you should do a half marathon.

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:21.726
In your wheelchair.
And, oh yeah, it's in 10 weeks."

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.601
And I thought in my mind, "You're crazy."
I didn't have a workout plan.

00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:30.434
I didn't have any way of knowing
how fast I needed to go
