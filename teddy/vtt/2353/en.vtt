00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:03.851
It seems we have been measured
almost all of our lives,

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:06.393
when we are infants,
with our height and our weight,

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:09.268
and as we grew it became
our speed and our strength.

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.268
And even in school there are test scores

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:13.833
and today with our salaries
and job performance.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:18.934
It seems as if those personal averages
are almost always used

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.958
to measure where we are
in comparison to our peers.

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:26.309
And I think we should look at that
a little differently.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.351
That personal average is just that,
it's something very personal

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:30.643
and it's for you,
