00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:31.851
Well, 45 minutes later, my wife came home,

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:34.018
and I heard her step out of the house

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:36.976
and, like, normal, if I needed help,
"Hey, do you need help?"

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.268
And I said, "Yes."

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:40.851
And there was a brief pause
and then I heard her yell,

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:42.143
"Do you need 9/11 help?"

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:43.893
And again I yelled, "Yes."

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:47.476
Well, not long after I was enjoying
my very first helicopter ride

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.834
all the way to the hospital.

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:54.059
Now, the injury wasn't
very dramatic or graphic.

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:55.875
I simply broke a bone or two.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.417
And in the process, I was told
I'd probably never walk again.
