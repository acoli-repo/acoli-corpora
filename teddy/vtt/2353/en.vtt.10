00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:01.018
as they could be,

00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:03.309
but it was never an entirely bad day.

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:06.184
So I'm guessing that all of you
have been through a meeting

00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:07.851
that probably didn't go very well,

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:10.518
or a commute that wasn't as great
as you would like it,

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:12.143
or even burned dinner at night.

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:14.542
Did those things
really ruin your entire day?

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:20.518
What I found in those scenarios
is the quicker you move on to what's next,

00:05:20.542 --> 00:05:22.601
the quicker you can start
attacking things.

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:25.643
And by moving on to next
as fast as possible,

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:29.059
you shrink the time you spend
in those bad scenarios

00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:31.101
and it gives more time for the good.
