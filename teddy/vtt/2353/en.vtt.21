00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:30.476
and caught up with those friends.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.059
And we lined up for the race,

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:34.226
and right at the start,
my average kicked in,

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.809
and before long I caught up
with some of those friends

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:39.434
and was able to keep pace with them
and push together.

00:10:39.458 --> 00:10:41.125
But it wasn't long before I faded.

00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:45.393
It just happened,
and I found myself all alone again

00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:50.917
with really nothing to rely on other than
what I had worked so hard to be at.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.351
But we turned into the wind
at the halfway point,

00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:56.351
and my average became a strong advantage,

00:10:56.375 --> 00:10:59.059
and it wasn't long
before I caught some of those friends

00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:01.143
and passed them all the way to the finish.
