00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.268
What I found out is that good and bad
really didn't have a lot of meaning

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:36.893
unless I had the context
of knowing what my average was.

00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:40.059
It was really up to me to decide
if something was bad or good

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:42.268

at that point in time,

00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:45.434
and it was in my control to determine
if it really was a bad day.

00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:48.268
In fact, it was my decision
on whether or not I could stop

00:04:48.292 --> 00:04:49.643
a streak of bad days.

00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:52.601
And what I found during
that time away from home

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:56.434
is I never had a bad day,
even with everything going on.

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:59.684
There were parts of my day
that were certainly not as pleasant

00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:01.018
as they could be,
