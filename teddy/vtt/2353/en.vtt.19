00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:31.018
I finished the race about 45 minutes
after the person that won it.

00:09:31.042 --> 00:09:34.226
But as I was leaving, those new friends,
who are very close today,

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.768
challenged me to stay involved

00:09:35.792 --> 00:09:40.292
and to keep working through
different races and competitions.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.726
And so I did what I knew how.
I went home, and I got busy.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.601
Now, as you can imagine,
being in a wheelchair,

00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:50.018
let alone training
for a marathon in a wheelchair,

00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:51.351
is a pretty lonely thing.

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:53.226
I have an incredible group of friends

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.893
that will ride bikes with me
and keep track of pace and help me out.

00:09:56.917 --> 00:09:59.393
But in the end, it's still
five to six days a week,

00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:02.893
it's 50 to 60 miles of effort,
and it's a lot of alone time.
