00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:01.143
and passed them all the way to the finish.

00:11:01.167 --> 00:11:03.559
And while I didn't set
a personal record that day,

00:11:03.583 --> 00:11:06.958
I did finish 30 seconds per mile
faster than my prior Chicago times

00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:11.250
and just left myself pretty excited.

00:11:13.458 --> 00:11:15.792
And so this is me. This is my average.

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:21.125
Seventy-five days from today,
I'll be in Boston for my second time.

00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.434
I'm super excited about that.

00:11:24.458 --> 00:11:27.851
But keep in mind,
this isn't really just about racing.

00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:32.059
I'm working really hard every day
to be better in so many other ways,
