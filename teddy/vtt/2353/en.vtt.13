00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:30.434
I didn't have any way of knowing
how fast I needed to go

00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:32.667
or how far I was supposed to go.

00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:34.976
But I simply got to work,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.268
and I started tracking

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:42.684
and I simply wanted to be as good as

00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:45.393

as much as I could.

00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:52.393
Well, I finished that race right in time
with what my average should have been,

00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:54.643
and somewhere along the way

00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:59.059
I kind of closed the door
on who I once was.

00:06:59.083 --> 00:07:00.476
That person who I was before
