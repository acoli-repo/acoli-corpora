00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.417
And in the process, I was told
I'd probably never walk again.

00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:04.351
It became very normal for me
to use a rope to sit up in bed,

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:06.643
because my abdominal muscles
no longer work.

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:09.768
Or to use a board to slide
out of bed into a wheelchair,

00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:12.167
or to even wait for people
to reach things for me.

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:17.893
Everything that I had learned
and had known about my height

00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:21.976
and my strength and my balance
and my mobility was blown away.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.292
My entire personal average had been reset.

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:28.893
Now you could be sure in those days
I was being measured more than ever,

00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:30.768
by the doctors and nurses for sure
