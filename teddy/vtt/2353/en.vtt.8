00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:03.309
but even around people
in the same situation in that hospital,

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:06.684
I found that I couldn't try to keep pace
or set pace with them as well,

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:08.768
and I was left with really only one choice

00:04:08.792 --> 00:04:11.476
and that was to focus on who I was
at that point in time

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.351
with where I needed to go
and to get back to who I needed to be.

00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:18.434
For the next six weeks,
for seven to eight hours a day,

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.768
that's what I did.

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.434
I built little by little,

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:23.309
and, as you might expect,

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:25.684
when you're recovering
from a spinal cord injury,

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:27.226
you're going to have a bad day.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.726
You might have a few in a row.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.268
What I found out is that good and bad
really didn't have a lot of meaning
