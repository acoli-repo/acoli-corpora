00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:30.643
and it's for you,

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.309
and I think if you focus on that
and work to build that,

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.268
you can really start to accomplish
some really amazing things.

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:39.684
This idea started for me
on a December evening in 2011.

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:42.143
I had just stepped outside
to do our evening chores

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.559
to feed our horses.

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:44.976
I hopped into our tractor,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.268
and a few minutes later,

00:00:46.292 --> 00:00:50.643
a five foot tall, 700-pound bale of hay
fell from the loader,

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.643
crushing me in the seat of the tractor

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.434
and in the process shattering
my T5 and T6 vertebrae.

00:00:56.458 --> 00:00:58.601
I didn't lose consciousness,

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:02.476
but I felt this buzz throughout my body,
and I knew what had happened right away.
