You try to do what you did
a couple of years ago,

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:31.809
and you do a couple of sets.

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:33.809
And then what do you do? A couple more.

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:36.309
And you're feeling
even better, so you do more.

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:39.893
And the next two weeks you complain
to your family about how sore you are.

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:41.184
(Laughter)

00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:44.434
Well, my team went all out and we won,
we won big,

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:47.434
and for the next three days
I could not straighten my arms,

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:50.393
which isn't that big a deal
except when you're in a wheelchair

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.934
and that's really what you
have to use to get around.

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.518
And that proved to be
a very important lesson for me.

00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:59.851
It was one thing that I couldn't
compare myself to myself,

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:03.309
but even around people
in the same situation in that hospital,
