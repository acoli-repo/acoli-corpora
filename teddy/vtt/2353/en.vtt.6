00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:00.268
And I'm afraid if I had not
made that realization,

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:04.125
my frustration would have turned into
something much harder to recover from.

00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:07.434
Now, luckily, a few weeks later,

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:10.309
I was transferred to a specialty
spinal cord rehab hospital

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:12.643
about 10 hours from home,
and wouldn't you know,

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.809
the first day of rehab
and the first session

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:16.453
we had something called fit class,

00:03:16.477 --> 00:03:18.476
and a group of us broke into teams

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.893
to see which team could do
the most reps in the weight machine.

00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:25.309
Now, we've all been there,
haven't been to the gym in a year or two.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:26.643
Neither had I.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:27.976
And so what do you do?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.309
You try to do what you did
a couple of years ago,
