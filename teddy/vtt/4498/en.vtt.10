00:04:58.977 --> 00:05:04.901
many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.

00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.656
Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend,

00:05:07.656 --> 00:05:12.672
or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that.

00:05:12.672 --> 00:05:16.023
Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.

00:05:16.023 --> 00:05:18.346
They talk about these kinds of experiences.

00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:20.611
You must have had such a moment.

00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:22.544
In that moment, art makes you happy

00:05:22.544 --> 00:05:24.221
because it's not work.

00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:26.754
Work doesn't make you happy, does it? Mostly it's tough.

00:05:26.754 --> 00:05:29.855
The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:31.545
It's a bit mischievous, actually.
