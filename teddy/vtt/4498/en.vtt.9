00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.087
but different things -- people and dogs, etc.

00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:32.500
But parents tell them,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.263
"It will all be washed away by the waves."

00:04:34.263 --> 00:04:36.085
In other words, it's useless.

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:37.229
There's no need.

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.095
But kids don't mind.

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:40.266
They have fun in the moment

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:42.432
and they keep playing in the sand.

00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:44.698
Kids don't do it because someone told them to.

00:04:44.698 --> 00:04:46.294
They aren't told by their boss

00:04:46.294 --> 00:04:49.219
or anyone, they just do it.

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:54.615
When you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.

00:04:54.615 --> 00:04:58.977
When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment,

00:04:58.977 --> 00:05:04.901
many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.
