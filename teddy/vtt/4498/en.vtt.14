00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:00.918
I was trying my best, and my teacher came around

00:07:00.918 --> 00:07:04.506
and asked me, "What are you doing?"

00:07:04.506 --> 00:07:06.320
"I'm drawing diligently," I said.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.223
"Why are you using only black?"

00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:10.603
Indeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.

00:07:10.603 --> 00:07:13.672
And I explained,

00:07:13.672 --> 00:07:16.919
"It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch."

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:17.917
Then my teacher said,

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:23.239
"Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling."

00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:25.974
Or so I wished.

00:07:25.974 --> 00:07:28.742
"Now you'll get it, you rascal!" was the response. (Laughter)

00:07:28.742 --> 00:07:30.346
"You'll get it!" he said.
