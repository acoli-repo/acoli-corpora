00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:00.965
And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts

00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:03.212
and justifying the next sentence,

00:04:03.212 --> 00:04:06.473
which is not much different from what a kid does.

00:04:06.473 --> 00:04:08.004
A kid who has just started to lie

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:11.130
is taking the first step as a storyteller.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.691
Kids do art.

00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.116
They don't get tired and they have fun doing it.

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:16.877
I was in Jeju Island a few days ago.

00:04:16.877 --> 00:04:21.989
When kids are on the beach, most of them love playing in the water.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.896
But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand,

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:27.140
making mountains and seas -- well, not seas,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.087
but different things -- people and dogs, etc.
