00:02:57.154 --> 00:03:00.970
but thinking up one sentence after the next

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.038
is the same thing a professional writer like me does.

00:03:05.038 --> 00:03:07.417
In essence, they are not different.

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:10.103
Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels,

00:03:10.103 --> 00:03:12.709
"Flaubert did not write a novel.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.714
He merely connected one sentence after another.

00:03:15.714 --> 00:03:20.441

00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:23.224
That's right -- a novel, basically, is writing one sentence,

00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:26.683
then, without violating the scope of the first one,

00:03:26.683 --> 00:03:28.388

00:03:28.388 --> 00:03:29.897
And you continue to make connections.

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:31.963
Take a look at this sentence:
