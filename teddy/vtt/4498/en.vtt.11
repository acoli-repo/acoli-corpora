It's a bit mischievous, actually.

00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:36.517
"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."

00:05:36.517 --> 00:05:38.002
Right? Why would work tire us if it's in our nature?

00:05:38.002 --> 00:05:39.663
Playing doesn't tire us.

00:05:39.663 --> 00:05:41.098
We can play all night long.

00:05:41.098 --> 00:05:43.531
If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.

00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:46.815
Why? Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue.

00:05:46.815 --> 00:05:51.497
But kids, usually they do art for fun. It's playing.

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:54.231
They don't draw to sell the work to a client

00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:57.256
or play the piano to earn money for the family.

00:05:57.256 --> 00:06:00.032
Of course, there were kids who had to.
