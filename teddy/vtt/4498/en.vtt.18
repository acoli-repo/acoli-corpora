That was Duchamp.

00:09:04.847 --> 00:09:09.297
So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories --

00:09:09.297 --> 00:09:13.424
that's indeed what contemporary art is all about.

00:09:13.424 --> 00:09:14.812
Picasso even made the statement,

00:09:14.812 --> 00:09:18.989
"I draw not what I see but what I think."

00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:21.506
Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.

00:09:21.506 --> 00:09:25.577
I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.

00:09:25.577 --> 00:09:29.379
Unfortunately, the little artists within us

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:34.866
are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.
