miming the guitar riffs.

00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:02.603
Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed.

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:05.082
Some people turn into rockers like this.

00:10:05.082 --> 00:10:07.155
Or some people dance in clubs.

00:10:07.155 --> 00:10:10.557
People who would have enjoyed telling stories

00:10:10.557 --> 00:10:13.567
end up trolling on the Internet all night long.

00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:16.962
That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side.

00:10:16.962 --> 00:10:20.915
Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids

00:10:20.915 --> 00:10:23.900
playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.633
They go, "Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you."

00:10:25.633 --> 00:10:27.268
The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else,

00:10:27.268 --> 00:10:31.277
but the dad alone builds castles.
