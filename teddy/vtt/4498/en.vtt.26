This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons

00:13:03.308 --> 00:13:06.238
why you can't write:

00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:09.073
"People will laugh at you. This is not good writing!

00:13:09.073 --> 00:13:10.623
What kind of sentence is this? Look at your handwriting!"

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.200
It will say a lot of things.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.704
You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.

00:13:14.704 --> 00:13:18.776
The really good writing I've seen in my class

00:13:18.776 --> 00:13:21.449
was not from the assignments with a long deadline,

00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:24.933
but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did

00:13:24.933 --> 00:13:28.335
in front of me with a pencil.

00:13:28.335 --> 00:13:30.174
The students go into a kind of trance.
