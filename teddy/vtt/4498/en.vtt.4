"Now you're showing your true colors," Mom says. She thinks, "Why does he take after his dad?"

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:05.361
She questions him, "What kind of a person are you going to be?"

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:06.932
But you shouldn't worry.

00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:13.152
The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.

00:02:13.152 --> 00:02:15.340
They are talking about things they didn't see.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.131
It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment.

00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:19.198
Parents should celebrate.

00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:23.355
"Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!"

00:02:23.355 --> 00:02:25.584
All right! It calls for celebration.

00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:28.973
For example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home."

00:02:28.973 --> 00:02:33.424
Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."
