00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:30.815
There are so many reasons why we can't be,

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:33.375
indeed, we're not sure why we should be.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.068
We don't know why we should be artists,

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:38.971
but we have many reasons why we can't be.

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.346
Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:47.214
Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:52.266
or for the thoroughly and professionally trained.

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:56.609
And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.227
Well you might have, but I don't think so.
