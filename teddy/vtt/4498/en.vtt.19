are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.471
They get locked in.

00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:37.554
That's our tragedy.

00:09:37.554 --> 00:09:42.814
So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?

00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:44.197
Our artistic desire doesn't go away.

00:09:44.197 --> 00:09:47.294
We want to express, to reveal ourselves,

00:09:47.294 --> 00:09:52.532
but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.

00:09:52.532 --> 00:09:55.499
In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing

00:09:55.499 --> 00:09:58.041
"She's Gone" or "Hotel California,"

00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:00.361
miming the guitar riffs.
