00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.009
Right this minute, we can turn off TV,

00:11:30.009 --> 00:11:32.458
log off the Internet,

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:35.158
get up and start to do something.

00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:36.893
Where I teach students in drama school,

00:11:36.893 --> 00:11:39.627
there's a course called Dramatics.

00:11:39.627 --> 00:11:43.817
In this course, all students must put on a play.

00:11:43.817 --> 00:11:47.929
However, acting majors are not supposed to act.

00:11:47.929 --> 00:11:49.949
They can write the play, for example,

00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:52.673
and the writers may work on stage art.

00:11:52.673 --> 00:11:54.969
Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.

00:11:54.984 --> 00:11:58.732
Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it,

00:11:58.732 --> 00:12:03.295
but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play.
