00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:31.963
Take a look at this sentence:

00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:34.430
"One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug."

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.876
Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."

00:03:36.876 --> 00:03:40.044
Writing such an unjustifiable sentence

00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:42.492
and continuing in order to justify it,

00:03:42.492 --> 00:03:46.921
Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.

00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:49.670
Kafka did not show his work to his father.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.994
He was not on good terms with his father.

00:03:51.994 --> 00:03:55.790
On his own, he wrote these sentences.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.053
Had he shown his father, "My boy has finally lost it," he would've thought.

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:00.965
And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts
