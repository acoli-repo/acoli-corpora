No crows are brought up.

00:08:30.888 --> 00:08:34.221
Most of the works have no title, Untitled.

00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:37.322
Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century

00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:42.691
is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation --

00:08:42.691 --> 00:08:44.170
essentially the same as I did.

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.918
Of course, my work was very amateur,

00:08:46.918 --> 00:08:50.207
but let's turn to more famous examples.

00:08:50.207 --> 00:08:52.808
This is Picasso's.

00:08:52.808 --> 00:08:58.609
He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it "Bull's Head." Sounds convincing, right?

00:08:58.609 --> 00:09:03.253
Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called "Fountain".
