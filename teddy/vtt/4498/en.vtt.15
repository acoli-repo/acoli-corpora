"You'll get it!" he said.

00:07:30.346 --> 00:07:33.028
You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc.,

00:07:33.028 --> 00:07:35.463
but I was coloring everything in black,

00:07:35.463 --> 00:07:37.147
so he dragged me out of the group.

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:39.167
There were a lot of girls there as well,

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.718
so I was utterly mortified.

00:07:40.718 --> 00:07:45.170
None of my explanations or excuses were heard,

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.383
and I really got it big time.

00:07:48.383 --> 00:07:52.901
If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before,

00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:55.214
"Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing,

00:07:55.214 --> 00:07:58.589
but he has a gift for making up stories," and he would have encouraged me.

00:07:58.589 --> 00:08:02.041
But such a teacher is seldom found.
