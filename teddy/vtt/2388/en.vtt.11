00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.887
Perhaps the reason no one had 
attempted this journey until now,

00:05:31.887 --> 00:05:33.145
in more than a century,

00:05:33.145 --> 00:05:38.418
was that no one had been quite
stupid enough to try.

00:05:38.418 --> 00:05:40.437
And while I can't claim we were exploring

00:05:40.437 --> 00:05:43.454
in the genuine Edwardian
sense of the word —

00:05:43.454 --> 00:05:47.192
we weren't naming any mountains
or mapping any uncharted valleys —

00:05:47.192 --> 00:05:51.573
I think we were stepping into uncharted
territory in a human sense.

00:05:51.573 --> 00:05:54.962
Certainly, if in the future we learn
there is an area of the human brain

00:05:54.962 --> 00:05:58.779
that lights up when one curses oneself,

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.945
I won't be at all surprised.
