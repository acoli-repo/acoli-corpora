00:12:56.758 --> 00:13:00.233
You could fit the entirety of Manhattan
in the gap on the horizon.

00:13:00.233 --> 00:13:03.447
That's 20 miles between
Mount Hope and Mount Kiffin.

00:13:03.447 --> 00:13:09.680
I've never felt as small 
as I did in Antarctica.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.785
When we got down
to the mouth of the glacier,

00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:16.431
we found fresh snow had obscured
the dozens of deep crevasses.

00:13:16.431 --> 00:13:19.381
One of Shackleton's men described
crossing this sort of terrain

00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:24.375
as like walking over the glass roof
of a railway station.

00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:27.289
We fell through more times
than I can remember,

00:13:27.289 --> 00:13:30.721
usually just putting a ski
or a boot through the snow.
