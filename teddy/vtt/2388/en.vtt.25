00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:30.913
and it's something my ego
is still struggling with.

00:12:30.913 --> 00:12:33.955
This was the biggest dream I've ever had,

00:12:33.955 --> 00:12:36.047
and it was so nearly perfect.

00:12:36.967 --> 00:12:38.648
On the way back down to the coast,

00:12:38.648 --> 00:12:40.839
our crampons — they're 
the spikes on our boots

00:12:40.839 --> 00:12:43.765
that we have for traveling
over this blue ice on the glacier —

00:12:43.765 --> 00:12:45.420
broke on the top of the Beardmore.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.185
We still had 100 miles to go downhill

00:12:47.185 --> 00:12:49.419
on very slippery rock-hard blue ice.

00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:51.810
They needed repairing almost every hour.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.761
To give you an idea of scale,

00:12:53.761 --> 00:12:56.758
this is looking down towards the mouth
of the Beardmore Glacier.

00:12:56.758 --> 00:13:00.233
You could fit the entirety of Manhattan
in the gap on the horizon.
