So in the oasis of 
intelligentsia that is TED,

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:09.285
I stand here before you this evening

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:15.159
as an expert in dragging heavy
stuff around cold places.

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.145
I've been leading polar expeditions 
for most of my adult life,

00:00:18.145 --> 00:00:21.827
and last month, my teammate 
Tarka L'Herpiniere and I

00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:27.025
finished the most ambitious 
expedition I've ever attempted.

00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:30.014
In fact, it feels like I've been
transported straight here
