00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.964
Antarctica was, for the most part,
a century ago, uncharted.

00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:34.475
Some of you may know the story.

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:37.288
Scott's last expedition, the 
Terra Nova Expedition in 1910,

00:03:37.288 --> 00:03:39.802
started as a giant
siege-style approach.

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:42.031
He had a big team using ponies,

00:03:42.031 --> 00:03:44.778
using dogs, using petrol-driven tractors,

00:03:44.778 --> 00:03:48.175
dropping multiple, pre-positioned
depots of food and fuel

00:03:48.175 --> 00:03:51.883
through which Scott's final team of five
would travel to the Pole,

00:03:51.883 --> 00:03:55.187
where they would turn around and ski 
back to the coast again on foot.

00:03:55.187 --> 00:03:57.599
Scott and his final team of five

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.284
arrived at the South Pole 
in January 1912
