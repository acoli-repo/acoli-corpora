the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station
at the South Pole.

00:08:03.044 --> 00:08:04.995
They have an airstrip,
they have a canteen,

00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:06.448
they have hot showers,

00:08:06.448 --> 00:08:08.353
they have a post office, a tourist shop,


00:08:08.353 --> 00:08:12.091
a basketball court that doubles
as a movie theater.

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:14.066
So it's a bit different these days,

00:08:14.066 --> 00:08:15.862
and there are also acres of junk.

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:17.292
I think it's a marvelous thing


00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:22.576
that humans can exist
365 days of the year

00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:26.131
with hamburgers and hot showers
and movie theaters,

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.887
but it does seem to produce
a lot of empty cardboard boxes.

00:08:28.887 --> 00:08:30.949
