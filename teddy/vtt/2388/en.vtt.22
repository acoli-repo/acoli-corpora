00:10:58.664 --> 00:11:00.916
hypothermia doesn't leave you much choice.

00:11:00.916 --> 00:11:03.726
You become utterly incapacitated.

00:11:03.726 --> 00:11:06.907
It's like being a drunk toddler.

00:11:06.907 --> 00:11:08.880
You become pathetic.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.999
I remember just wanting
to lie down and quit.

00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:15.173
It was a peculiar, peculiar feeling,

00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:20.412
and a real surprise to me
to be debilitated to that degree.

00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:24.894
And then we ran out of food completely,

00:11:24.894 --> 00:11:28.352
46 miles short of the first of the depots

00:11:28.352 --> 00:11:30.217
that we'd laid on our outward journey.
