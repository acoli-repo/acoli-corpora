00:00:56.211 --> 00:01:01.683
and while we weren't sequencing genomes
or building space telescopes,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.474
this is a story about giving everything
we had to achieve something

00:01:06.474 --> 00:01:08.310
that hadn't been done before.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.455
So I hope in that you might 
find some food for thought.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:16.066
It was a journey, an 
expedition in Antarctica,

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:20.743
the coldest, windiest, driest and
highest altitude continent on Earth.

00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:22.804
It's a fascinating place.
It's a huge place.

00:01:22.804 --> 00:01:25.119
It's twice the size of Australia,

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.211
a continent that is the same size
as China and India put together.
