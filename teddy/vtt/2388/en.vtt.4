00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:04.476
in 105 days, an 1,800-mile round trip
on foot from the coast of Antarctica

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:07.247
to the South Pole and back again.

00:02:07.247 --> 00:02:09.491
In the process, we broke the record


00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:15.084
for the longest human-powered polar
journey in history by more than 400 miles.

00:02:15.087 --> 00:02:19.498
(Applause)

00:02:19.498 --> 00:02:21.913
For those of you from the Bay Area,

00:02:21.913 --> 00:02:26.030
it was the same as walking from 
here to San Francisco,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.908
then turning around
and walking back again.

00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:33.827
So as camping trips go, it was a long one,
