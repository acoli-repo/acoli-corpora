00:06:59.868 --> 00:07:01.865
were the same that we faced:

00:07:01.865 --> 00:07:05.602
those of the weather and of 
what Scott called glide,

00:07:05.603 --> 00:07:08.951
the amount of friction between
the sledges and the snow.

00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:12.799
The lowest wind chill 
we experienced was in the -70s,

00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:15.378
and we had zero visibility,
what's called white-out,

00:07:15.378 --> 00:07:18.391
for much of our journey.

00:07:18.391 --> 00:07:20.742
We traveled up and down one of the largest

00:07:20.742 --> 00:07:23.955
and most dangerous glaciers
in the world, the Beardmore glacier.

00:07:23.955 --> 00:07:27.381
It's 110 miles long; most of its surface
is what's called blue ice.

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:30.979
You can see it's a beautiful, 
shimmering steel-hard blue surface
