00:09:28.297 --> 00:09:30.328
and we had a safety net, of course,

00:09:30.328 --> 00:09:32.452
of ski planes and satellite phones

00:09:32.452 --> 00:09:36.505
and live, 24-hour tracking beacons
that didn't exist for Scott,

00:09:36.515 --> 00:09:38.257
but in hindsight,

00:09:38.257 --> 00:09:40.323
rather than making our lives easier,

00:09:40.323 --> 00:09:42.482
the safety net actually allowed us

00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:46.337
to cut things very fine indeed,

00:09:46.337 --> 00:09:50.104
to sail very close to our absolute
limits as human beings.

00:09:50.104 --> 00:09:53.577
And it is an exquisite form of torture

00:09:53.577 --> 00:09:56.414
to exhaust yourself to the point
of starvation day after day

00:09:56.414 --> 00:10:00.676
while dragging a sledge
full of food.
