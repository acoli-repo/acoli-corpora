00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.211
a continent that is the same size
as China and India put together.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.088
As an aside, I have experienced 


00:01:32.088 --> 00:01:34.312
an interesting phenomenon
in the last few days,

00:01:34.312 --> 00:01:38.087
something that I expect Chris Hadfield
may get at TED in a few years' time,

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:40.144
conversations that go something like this:

00:01:40.144 --> 00:01:41.767
"Oh, Antarctica. Awesome.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:47.604
My husband and I did Antarctica
with Lindblad for our anniversary."

00:01:47.604 --> 00:01:50.951
Or, "Oh cool, did you go there
for the marathon?"

00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:53.060
(Laughter)

00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:58.482
Our journey was, in fact,
69 marathons back to back

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:04.476
in 105 days, an 1,800-mile round trip
on foot from the coast of Antarctica
