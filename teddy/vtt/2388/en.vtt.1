00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:30.014
In fact, it feels like I've been
transported straight here

00:00:30.014 --> 00:00:32.666
from four months in the middle of nowhere,

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:37.754
mostly grunting and swearing, 
straight to the TED stage.

00:00:37.754 --> 00:00:41.935
So you can imagine that's a transition
that hasn't been entirely seamless.

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:43.815
One of the interesting side effects

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:46.403
seems to be that my short-term
memory is entirely shot.

00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:48.665
So I've had to write some notes

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:53.363
to avoid too much grunting and swearing
in the next 17 minutes.

00:00:53.363 --> 00:00:56.211
This is the first talk I've given
about this expedition,

00:00:56.211 --> 00:01:01.683
and while we weren't sequencing genomes
or building space telescopes,
