00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:30.979
You can see it's a beautiful, 
shimmering steel-hard blue surface

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:34.817
covered with thousands 
and thousands of crevasses,

00:07:34.817 --> 00:07:38.798
these deep cracks in the glacial ice 
up to 200 feet deep.

00:07:38.798 --> 00:07:40.315
Planes can't land here,

00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:43.775
so we were at the most risk,

00:07:43.775 --> 00:07:48.219
technically, when we had the slimmest
chance of being rescued.

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:52.115
We got to the South Pole
after 61 days on foot,

00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:54.694
with one day off for bad weather,

00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:57.261
and I'm sad to say, it was
something of an anticlimax.

00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:59.726
There's a permanent American base,

00:07:59.726 --> 00:08:03.044
the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station
at the South Pole.
