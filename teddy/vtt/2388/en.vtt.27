00:13:27.289 --> 00:13:30.721
usually just putting a ski
or a boot through the snow.

00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:33.324
Occasionally we went in all 
the way up to our armpits,

00:13:33.324 --> 00:13:36.767
but thankfully never deeper than that.

00:13:36.767 --> 00:13:40.947
And less than five weeks ago,
after 105 days,

00:13:40.947 --> 00:13:44.522
we crossed this oddly 
inauspicious finish line,

00:13:44.522 --> 00:13:47.544
the coast of Ross Island 
on the New Zealand side of Antarctica.

00:13:47.544 --> 00:13:49.694
You can see the ice in the foreground

00:13:49.694 --> 00:13:52.556
and the sort of rubbly rock behind that.

00:13:52.556 --> 00:13:56.358
Behind us lay an unbroken 
ski trail of nearly 1,800 miles.

00:13:56.358 --> 00:13:58.866
We'd made the longest ever
polar journey on foot,

00:13:58.866 --> 00:14:03.256
something I'd been dreaming 
of doing for a decade.
