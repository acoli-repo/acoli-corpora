00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.945
I won't be at all surprised.

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:05.997
You've heard that the average American
spends 90 percent of their time indoors.

00:06:05.997 --> 00:06:09.253
We didn't go indoors
for nearly four months.

00:06:09.253 --> 00:06:11.495
We didn't see a sunset either.

00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:13.151
It was 24-hour daylight.

00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:15.306
Living conditions were quite spartan.

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:20.148
I changed my underwear 
three times in 105 days

00:06:20.148 --> 00:06:24.072
and Tarka and I shared 
30 square feet on the canvas.

00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:28.813
Though we did have some technology
that Scott could never have imagined.

00:06:28.813 --> 00:06:32.180
And we blogged live every evening
from the tent via a laptop
