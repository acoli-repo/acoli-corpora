00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.712
none had made it to the pole and back,

00:03:00.712 --> 00:03:04.590
and five had died in the process.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.237
This is Captain Robert Falcon Scott.

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:10.000
He led the last team
to attempt this expedition.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.438
Scott and his rival Sir Ernest Shackleton,

00:03:12.438 --> 00:03:15.154
over the space of a decade,

00:03:15.154 --> 00:03:19.414
both led expeditions battling to become
the first to reach the South Pole,

00:03:19.427 --> 00:03:22.446
to chart and map
the interior of Antarctica,

00:03:22.446 --> 00:03:24.581
a place we knew less about, at the time,

00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:26.485
than the surface of the moon,

00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:28.830
because we could see
the moon through telescopes.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.964
Antarctica was, for the most part,
a century ago, uncharted.
