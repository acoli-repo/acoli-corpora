00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.284
arrived at the South Pole 
in January 1912

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:06.274
to find they had been beaten to it
by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen,

00:04:06.274 --> 00:04:07.908
who rode on dogsled.

00:04:07.908 --> 00:04:09.997
Scott's team ended up on foot.

00:04:09.997 --> 00:04:14.595
And for more than a century
this journey has remained unfinished.

00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:17.520
Scott's team of five died 
on the return journey.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.633
And for the last decade,

00:04:19.633 --> 00:04:22.954
I've been asking myself why that is.

00:04:22.954 --> 00:04:26.246
How come this has remained 
the high-water mark?

00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:28.596
Scott's team covered 1,600 miles on foot.

00:04:28.596 --> 00:04:30.497
No one's come close to that ever since.
