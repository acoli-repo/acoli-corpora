00:08:28.887 --> 00:08:30.949
You can see on the left of 
this photograph,

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:32.384
several square acres of junk

00:08:32.384 --> 00:08:34.897
waiting to be flown out
from the South Pole.

00:08:34.897 --> 00:08:38.929
But there is also a pole at the South Pole,

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.325
and we got there on foot, unassisted,

00:08:42.325 --> 00:08:43.971
unsupported, by the hardest route,

00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:46.316
900 miles in record time,

00:08:46.316 --> 00:08:48.364
dragging more weight
than anyone in history.

00:08:48.364 --> 00:08:50.333
And if we'd stopped there 
and flown home,

00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:53.467
which would have been
the eminently sensible thing to do,

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:55.348
then my talk would end here

00:08:55.348 --> 00:08:58.938
and it would end something like this.

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:03.743
If you have the right team around you,
the right tools, the right technology,
