00:04:58.873 --> 00:05:01.996
and we set off from the coast
of Antarctica in October last year,

00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:04.214
dragging everything ourselves,

00:05:04.214 --> 00:05:06.814
a process Scott called "man-hauling."

00:05:06.814 --> 00:05:09.837
When I say it was like walking from
here to San Francisco and back,

00:05:09.837 --> 00:05:13.214
I actually mean it was like dragging
something that weighs a shade more

00:05:13.214 --> 00:05:15.638
than the heaviest ever NFL player.

00:05:15.638 --> 00:05:17.681
Our sledges weighed 200 kilos,

00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:20.746
or 440 pounds each at the start,

00:05:20.746 --> 00:05:25.020
the same weights that the weakest
of Scott's ponies pulled.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.200
Early on, we averaged 0.5 miles per hour.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.887
Perhaps the reason no one had 
attempted this journey until now,
