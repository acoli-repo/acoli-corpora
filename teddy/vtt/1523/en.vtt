00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.590
So in 1781, an English composer,

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.729
technologist and astronomer called William Herschel

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:09.472
noticed an object on the sky that

00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:12.340
didn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.434
And Herschel's recognition
that something was different,

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:17.301
that something wasn't quite right,

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.123
was the discovery of a planet,

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:21.200
the planet Uranus,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.555
a name that has entertained

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:25.715
countless generations of children,

00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:28.050
but a planet that overnight

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.666
doubled the size of our known solar system.
