Sending rockets into space requires
sacrificing expensive equipment,

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:18.848
burning massive amounts of fuel,
and risking potential catastrophe.

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:21.684
So in the space race of the 21st century,

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:26.689
some engineers are abandoning rockets
for something much more exciting:

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:27.815
elevators.

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:31.360
Okay, so maybe riding an elevator
to the stars
