Mind reading is important for lying

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:06.032
because the basis of lying is that I know

00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:07.207
you don't know

00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:08.382
what I know.

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:09.777
Therefore, I can lie to you.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.680
The second key ingredient
for good lying is self-control.

00:04:15.704 --> 00:04:20.327
It is the ability to control your speech,
your facial expression

00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.891
and your body language,

00:04:21.915 --> 00:04:23.993
so that you can tell a convincing lie.

00:04:24.938 --> 00:04:28.664
