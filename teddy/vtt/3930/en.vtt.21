remotely, inexpensively,

00:10:32.408 --> 00:10:36.068
with an accuracy at about 85 percent,

which is far better than chance level.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.890
And in addition, we discovered
a Pinocchio effect.

00:10:44.336 --> 00:10:46.391
No, not this Pinocchio effect.

00:10:46.415 --> 00:10:47.422

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:49.568
This is the real Pinocchio effect.

00:10:49.592 --> 00:10:51.009
When people lie,

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:54.812

00:10:54.836 --> 00:10:58.097
and the facial blood flow
on the nose increases.

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:02.886
Of course, lying is not the only situation
