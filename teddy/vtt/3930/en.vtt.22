Of course, lying is not the only situation

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.758
that will evoke our hidden emotions.

00:11:05.782 --> 00:11:07.656
So then we asked ourselves,

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.027
in addition to detecting lies,

00:11:10.051 --> 00:11:12.384
how can our technology be used?

00:11:13.027 --> 00:11:16.573
One application is in education.

00:11:16.597 --> 00:11:21.258
For example, using this technology,
we can help this mathematics teacher

00:11:21.282 --> 00:11:24.189
to identify the student in his classroom

00:11:24.213 --> 00:11:28.958
who may experience high anxiety
about the topic he's teaching

00:11:28.982 --> 00:11:30.491
so that he can help him.
