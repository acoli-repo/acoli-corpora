00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.423
Would you like to give it a try?

00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:32.401
Yes? OK.

00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:34.564
So I'm going to show you two videos.

00:05:35.024 --> 00:05:36.175
In the videos,

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.256
the children are going to respond
to a researcher's question,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.762
"Did you peek?"

00:05:40.786 --> 00:05:42.340
So try to tell me

00:05:42.364 --> 00:05:43.762
which child is lying

00:05:43.786 --> 00:05:45.896
and which child is telling the truth.

00:05:46.272 --> 00:05:47.991
Here's child number one.

00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:50.228
Are you ready?

00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:52.926
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:55.855
Kang Lee: And this is child number two.

00:05:57.501 --> 00:05:59.693
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.
