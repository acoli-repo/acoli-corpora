Unfortunately, such emotion-related
facial blood flow changes

00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:32.656
are too subtle to detect by our naked eye.

00:09:33.632 --> 00:09:37.400
So to help us reveal
people's facial emotions,

00:09:37.424 --> 00:09:40.458
we have developed a new imaging technology

00:09:40.482 --> 00:09:43.631
we call "transdermal optical imaging."

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:48.632
To do so, we use a regular
video camera to record people

00:09:48.656 --> 00:09:51.742
when they experience
various hidden emotions.

00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:56.479
And then, using our image
processing technology,

00:09:56.503 --> 00:10:02.039
we can extract transdermal images
of facial blood flow changes.
