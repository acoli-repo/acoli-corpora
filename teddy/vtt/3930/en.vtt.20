00:09:56.503 --> 00:10:02.039
we can extract transdermal images
of facial blood flow changes.

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:08.747
By looking at transdermal video images,

00:10:08.771 --> 00:10:10.558
now we can easily see

00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:17.368
facial blood flow changes associated
with the various hidden emotions.

00:10:17.944 --> 00:10:19.732
And using this technology,

00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:24.424
we can now reveal the hidden emotions
associated with lying,

00:10:24.448 --> 00:10:27.358
and therefore detect people's lies.

00:10:27.382 --> 00:10:29.821
We can do so noninvasively,

00:10:29.845 --> 00:10:32.384
remotely, inexpensively,
