In cooking, you need good ingredients

The first key ingredient
is theory of mind,

00:03:45.243 --> 00:03:47.078
or the mind-reading ability.

00:03:47.768 --> 00:03:49.846

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.478
that different people have

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:58.303

00:03:58.327 --> 00:03:59.550
and what you know.

00:03:59.914 --> 00:04:02.161
Mind reading is important for lying
