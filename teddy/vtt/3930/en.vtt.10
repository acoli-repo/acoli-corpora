So if you discover your two-year-old
is telling his or her first lie,

00:05:07.094 --> 00:05:09.078
instead of being alarmed,

00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:10.594
you should celebrate --

00:05:10.618 --> 00:05:12.140
(Laughter)

00:05:12.164 --> 00:05:17.894
because it signals that your child
has arrived at a new milestone

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:19.553
of typical development.

00:05:21.085 --> 00:05:24.221
Now, are children poor liars?

00:05:24.878 --> 00:05:27.872
Do you think you can easily
detect their lies?

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.423
Would you like to give it a try?
