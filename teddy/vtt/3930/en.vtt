Hi.

00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:04.807
Let me ask the audience a question:

00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:07.026
Did you ever lie as a child?

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.717
If you did, could you please
raise your hand?

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:14.599
Wow! This is the most honest
group of people I've ever met.

00:00:14.623 --> 00:00:16.580
(Laughter)

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:18.313
So for the last 20 years,

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:21.752
I've been studying
how children learn to tell lies.

00:00:21.776 --> 00:00:24.080
And today, I'm going to share with you

00:00:24.104 --> 00:00:26.266
some of the discoveries we have made.

00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:31.549
But to begin, I'm going to tell you
a story from Mr. Richard Messina,
