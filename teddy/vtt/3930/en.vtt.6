00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:01.201
At four years of age,

00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:03.172
more than 80 percent lie.

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:06.785
And after four years of age,

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.198
most children lie.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.543
So as you can see,

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:14.030
lying is really a typical part
of development.

00:03:14.054 --> 00:03:16.844
And some children begin to tell lies

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:19.307
as young as two years of age.

00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:23.995
So now, let's take a closer look
at the younger children.

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:29.149
Why do some but not all
young children lie?
