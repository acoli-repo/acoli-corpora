00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:31.549
But to begin, I'm going to tell you
a story from Mr. Richard Messina,

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.702
who is my friend and an elementary
school principal.

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.827
He got a phone call one day.

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:40.430
The caller says,

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:44.336
"Mr. Messina, my son Johnny
will not come to school today

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.823
because he's sick."

00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:48.234
Mr. Messina asks,

00:00:48.258 --> 00:00:50.272
"Who am I speaking to, please?"

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:52.278
And the caller says,

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.967
"I am my father."

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:56.778
(Laughter)

00:00:58.227 --> 00:00:59.909
So this story --

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.465
(Laughter)
