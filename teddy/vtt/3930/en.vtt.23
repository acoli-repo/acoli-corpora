so that he can help him.

00:11:31.337 --> 00:11:34.077
And also we can use this in health care.

00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:37.469
For example, every day I Skype my parents,

00:11:37.493 --> 00:11:39.575
who live thousands of miles away.

00:11:40.178 --> 00:11:41.999
And using this technology,

00:11:42.023 --> 00:11:45.505
I can not only find out
what's going on in their lives

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:51.831
but also simultaneously monitor
their heart rate, their stress level,

00:11:51.855 --> 00:11:55.080
their mood and whether or not
they are experiencing pain.

00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:57.649
And perhaps in the future,

00:11:57.673 --> 00:12:00.962
their risks for heart attack
or hypertension.
