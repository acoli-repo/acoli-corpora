00:01:27.703 --> 00:01:31.752
and they are going to become
pathological liars for life.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.914
Well, it turns out

00:01:34.938 --> 00:01:37.236
all of the three beliefs are wrong.

00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:41.327
We have been playing guessing games

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.433
with children all over the world.

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:44.943
Here is an example.

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:49.332
So in this game, we asked children
to guess the numbers on the cards.

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.836
And we tell them if they win the game,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.017
they are going to get a big prize.

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:57.002
But in the middle of the game,

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:59.786
we make an excuse and leave the room.
