In the spring of 2016,

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:07.450
a legal battle between Apple
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.152
captured the world's attention.

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:12.972
Apple has built security features
into its mobile products

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:16.829
which protect data on its devices
from everyone but the owner.

00:00:16.853 --> 00:00:21.498
That means that criminals, hackers
and yes, even governments

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:22.842
are all locked out.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.779

You see, Apple has made
a conscious decision
