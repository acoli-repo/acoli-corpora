Christopher Soghoian: Putting a sticker --
actually, I like Band-Aids,

00:06:31.863 --> 00:06:34.128
because you can remove them
and put them back on

00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:36.464
whenever you want to make
a call or a Skype call.

00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:38.190
Putting a sticker over your web cam

00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:40.890
is probably the best thing
you can do for your privacy

00:06:40.914 --> 00:06:42.420
in terms of bang for buck.

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:46.341
There really is malware,
malicious software out there

00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:48.222
that can take over your web cam,

00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:50.116
even without the light turning on.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.309
This is used by criminals.
This is used by stalkers.

00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:58.271
You can buy $19.99 "spy
on your ex-girlfriend" software online.

00:06:58.295 --> 00:06:59.446
It's really terrifying.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.994
And then, of course,
it's used by governments.
