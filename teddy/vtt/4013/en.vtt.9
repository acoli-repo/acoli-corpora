for the poor and vulnerable users

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.318
who are depending on these devices.

00:04:41.342 --> 00:04:43.602
This is actually a problem
for our democracy.

00:04:44.237 --> 00:04:45.705

Modern social movements
rely on technology --

00:04:49.413 --> 00:04:54.836
from Black Lives Matter to the Arab Spring
to Occupy Wall Street.

00:04:55.238 --> 00:04:59.213
The organizers of these movements
and the members of these movements

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:03.177
increasingly communicate
and coordinate with smartphones.
