are using devices that leave them
completely vulnerable to surveillance.

In the United States, where I live,

00:03:33.078 --> 00:03:37.027
African-Americans are more likely
to be seen as suspicious

00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:38.902
or more likely to be profiled,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.305
and are more likely to be targeted
by the state with surveillance.

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:46.797
But African-Americans
are also disproportionately likely

00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:49.917
to use Android devices
that do nothing at all

00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:52.011

00:03:52.974 --> 00:03:54.298
This is a problem.

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:58.045

It's a tool used by those in power
