Apple encrypts all data
stored on iPhones by default,

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:05.922
and text messages sent from one
Apple customer to another Apple customer

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:07.648
are encrypted by default

00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:10.189
without the user having

and it has a password,

00:01:16.724 --> 00:01:20.366

getting any data off of it,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.802
if they can do it at all.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:26.512
In contrast, the security of Android
just really isn't as good.

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:29.582
Android phones, or at least
most of the Android phones

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:31.212
that have been sold to consumers,
