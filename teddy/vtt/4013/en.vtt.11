00:05:30.676 --> 00:05:34.497
And so if we do nothing
to address the digital security divide,

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:38.389
if we do nothing to ensure
that everyone in our society

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:41.452
gets the same benefits of encryption

00:05:41.476 --> 00:05:45.133
and is equally able to protect themselves
from surveillance by the state,

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:49.939
not only will the poor and vulnerable
be exposed to surveillance,

00:05:50.404 --> 00:05:53.345
but future civil rights
movements may be crushed

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:55.789
before they ever reach
their full potential.

00:05:55.813 --> 00:05:56.980
Thank you.

00:05:57.004 --> 00:06:00.111
