00:00:01.116 --> 00:00:03.156
I'm an identical twin.

00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:07.196
This is a picture of me
and my twin brother,

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:10.076
running a 60-meters race, five years old.

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:11.236
(Laughter)

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:12.956
I can't tell who's who.

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:16.916
My mom can still not tell
the difference either.

00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:21.676
Also, at the time, I didn't know
that the air we were breathing

00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:23.156
when we were running

00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:26.516
had a concentration
of 320 particles per million.

00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:30.956
Today, that is 410.
