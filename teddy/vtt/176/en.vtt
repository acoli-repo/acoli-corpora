00:00:00.597 --> 00:00:02.338
One of my earliest memories

00:00:02.362 --> 00:00:05.458
is of trying to wake up
one of my relatives and not being able to.

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:08.435
And I was just a little kid,
so I didn't really understand why,

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:09.769
but as I got older,

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:11.936
I realized we had
drug addiction in my family,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.794
including later cocaine addiction.

00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:18.597
I'd been thinking about it a lot lately,
partly because it's now exactly 100 years

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:21.667
since drugs were first banned
in the United States and Britain,

00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:24.206
and we then imposed that
on the rest of the world.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.726
It's a century since we made
this really fateful decision

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.803
to take addicts and punish them
and make them suffer,
