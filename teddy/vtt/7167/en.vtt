00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:08.913
For decades, scientists have
tried to use brain modulation

00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:11.663
to treat neurological disorders.

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:14.663
Techniques usually involved
sticking wires onto our head,

00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:16.954
then helmets that immobilized our head

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:20.538
and zapping our brain
with magnetic or electrical pulses.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.788
Given what we now know about the millions
of circuits that our brain has,

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.788
this was much like trying to fix a pothole
by resurfacing the entire road.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.996
Brain modulation can actually
come in different forms.
