But when you open them,
you have different rarities of the toys.

00:02:31.462 --> 00:02:33.901
I thought that was interesting;
I thought about this

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:36.834
and the caviar vending machine
and the Art-o-mat all together.

00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:39.816
And for some reason, I was one night
drawing a vending machine,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.175
thinking of doing paintings
of a vending machine.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.979
The vial of my DNA was sitting there,

00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.929
and I saw a beautiful collaboration
between the strands of DNA

00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:48.626
and the coils of a vending machine.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.147
So I decided to create an art installation
called the DNA Vending Machine.

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.405
Here it is.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:58.506

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.588
