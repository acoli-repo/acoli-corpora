00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:30.076
and learn how to do things
like grow E. coli that glows in the dark

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.852
or learn how to take strawberry DNA.

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:34.927
In fact, I saw Oliver do
one of these strawberry DNA extractions

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.988
about a year ago, and this is what led me
into this bizarre path

00:00:38.012 --> 00:00:39.954
that I'm going to talk to you right now.

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:43.024
Strawberry DNA is really fascinating,
because it's so beautiful.

00:00:43.048 --> 00:00:45.832
I'd never thought about DNA
being a beautiful thing before,

00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:47.247
before I saw it in this form.

00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:49.573
A lot of people, especially
in the art community,

00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:51.843
don't necessarily engage
in science in this way.

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:53.742
I instantly joined Genspace after this,

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.350
and asked Oliver, "If we can do
this with strawberries,

00:00:56.374 --> 00:00:57.761
can we do this with people?"

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:00.414
About 10 minutes later,
we were both spitting in vials,
