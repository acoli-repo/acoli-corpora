These are people who don't necessarily
regularly engage with science.

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:35.059
You can kind of tell from their reactions.

00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:36.882
(Laughter)

00:01:36.906 --> 00:01:38.510
But they became fascinated by it,

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:41.961
and it was really exciting for me
to see them get excited about science.

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:44.115
And so I started doing this regularly.

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:45.712
(Laughter)

00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:48.015
It's an odd thing to do
with your Friday nights,

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.618
but this is what I started doing.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.859
I started collecting a whole group
of my friends' DNA in small vials

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:54.060
and categorizing them.

00:01:54.084 --> 00:01:55.529
This is what that looked like.

00:01:55.553 --> 00:01:58.267
And it started to make me think
about a couple of things.

00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:00.499
First, this looked a lot
like my Facebook wall.
