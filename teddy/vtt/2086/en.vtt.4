First, this looked a lot
like my Facebook wall.

00:02:00.523 --> 00:02:03.711
So in a way, I created
sort of a genetic social network.

00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:04.970
And the second thing was,

00:02:04.994 --> 00:02:07.783
one time a friend came over
and looked at this on my table

00:02:07.807 --> 00:02:10.000
and was like, 
"Uh ... why are they numbered?

00:02:10.024 --> 00:02:12.301
Is this person more rare
than the other one?"

00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:14.111
And I hadn't even thought about that.

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:15.295
They were just numbered

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.930
because that was the order
that I extracted the DNA in.

00:02:17.954 --> 00:02:20.064
But that made me think
about collecting toys,

00:02:20.088 --> 00:02:23.303
and what's going on right now
in the toy world with blind box toys,

00:02:23.327 --> 00:02:25.386
and being able to collect these rare toys.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.407
You buy these boxes, but aren't sure
what's going to be inside.

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.438
But when you open them,
you have different rarities of the toys.
