00:03:59.648 --> 00:04:01.636
We're in the first edition of 100 pieces,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.614
hoping to do another edition pretty soon.

00:04:03.638 --> 00:04:05.717
I'd like to get it
into more of a metro hub,

00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:07.424
like Grand Central or Penn Station,

00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:10.298
next to some of the other
vending machines in that location.

00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:12.703
But really, with this
and a lot of my art projects,

00:04:12.727 --> 00:04:14.559
I want to ask the audience a question:

00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:18.405
When biotechnology and DNA sequencing
becomes as cheap as, say, laser cutting

00:04:18.429 --> 00:04:22.315
or 3D printing or buying caviar
from a vending machine,

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:25.639
will you submit your sample of DNA
to be part of the vending machine?

00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:27.450
How much will these samples be worth?

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:29.339
Will you buy someone else's sample?

00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:31.724
And what will you be able to do
with that sample?
