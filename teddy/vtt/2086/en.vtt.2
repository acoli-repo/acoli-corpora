About 10 minutes later,
we were both spitting in vials,

00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:02.956
coming up with a protocol
for human DNA extraction.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.483
I started doing this on my own.

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:06.469
This is what my DNA actually looks like.

00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:09.044
And I was at a dinner party
with some artist friends,

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:11.087
and I was telling them about this project,

00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:13.829
and they couldn't believe
that you could actually see DNA.

00:01:13.853 --> 00:01:16.685
So I said, all right, let's get out
some supplies right now.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.861
And I started having these bizarre
dinner parties on Friday nights,

00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:22.558
where people would come over
and we'd do DNA extractions,

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.226
and I would capture them on video,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.932
because it created
this kind of funny portrait as well.

00:01:26.956 --> 00:01:29.445
(Laughter)

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.870
These are people who don't necessarily
regularly engage with science.
