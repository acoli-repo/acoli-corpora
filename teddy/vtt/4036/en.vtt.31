Chris Anderson: So interesting, Stuart.

00:15:32.796 --> 00:15:35.966
We're going to stand here a bit
because I think they're setting up

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.141
for our next speaker.

00:15:37.165 --> 00:15:38.703
A couple of questions.

00:15:38.727 --> 00:15:44.180
So the idea of programming in ignorance
seems intuitively really powerful.

00:15:44.204 --> 00:15:45.798
As you get to superintelligence,

00:15:45.822 --> 00:15:48.080
what's going to stop a robot

00:15:48.104 --> 00:15:50.956
reading literature and discovering
this idea that knowledge

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.552
is actually better than ignorance

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:56.794
and still just shifting its own goals
and rewriting that programming?

00:15:57.692 --> 00:16:04.048
Stuart Russell: Yes, so we want
it to learn more, as I said,
