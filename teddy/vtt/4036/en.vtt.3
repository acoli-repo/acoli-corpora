00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:31.990
And I think this could be,
as some people have described it,

00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:34.030
the biggest event in human history.

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:39.494
So why are people saying things like this,

00:01:39.518 --> 00:01:42.394
that AI might spell the end
of the human race?

00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:45.097
Is this a new thing?

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:49.231
Is it just Elon Musk and Bill Gates
and Stephen Hawking?

00:01:49.953 --> 00:01:53.215
Actually, no. This idea
has been around for a while.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.201
Here's a quotation:

00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:59.575
"Even if we could keep the machines
in a subservient position,

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.583
for instance, by turning off the power
at strategic moments" --
