00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:01.718
is maybe not a good idea --

00:03:02.488 --> 00:03:03.979
what can we do about that?

00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:08.770
Well, really nothing,

00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:11.304
and because of all
the benefits that I mentioned

00:03:11.328 --> 00:03:13.044
and because I'm an AI researcher,

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.859
I'm not having that.

00:03:15.283 --> 00:03:17.751

the problem a bit more.

00:03:21.317 --> 00:03:22.688
What exactly is the problem?

00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:25.958
Why is better AI possibly a catastrophe?

00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:28.896
So here's another quotation:

00:03:29.935 --> 00:03:33.270
"We had better be quite sure
that the purpose put into the machine
