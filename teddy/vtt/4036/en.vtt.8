That was the purpose
that he put into the machine,

00:04:01.513 --> 00:04:02.963
so to speak,

00:04:02.987 --> 00:04:06.431
and then his food and his drink
and his relatives turned to gold

00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:08.736
and he died in misery and starvation.

00:04:10.444 --> 00:04:12.785
So we'll call this
"the King Midas problem"

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:16.114
of stating an objective
which is not, in fact,

00:04:16.138 --> 00:04:18.551
truly aligned with what we want.

00:04:18.575 --> 00:04:21.828
In modern terms, we call this
"the value alignment problem."

00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:28.532
Putting in the wrong objective
is not the only part of the problem.

00:04:28.556 --> 00:04:29.708
There's another part.
