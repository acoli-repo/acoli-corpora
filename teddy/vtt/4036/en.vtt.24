of many different people,

00:12:00.148 --> 00:12:02.054
and there are different ways to do that.

00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:05.767
Economists, sociologists,
moral philosophers have understood that,

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:08.246
and we are actively
looking for collaboration.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.521
Let's have a look and see what happens
when you get that wrong.

00:12:11.545 --> 00:12:13.678
So you can have
a conversation, for example,

00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:15.646
with your intelligent personal assistant

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.955
that might be available
in a few years' time.

00:12:17.979 --> 00:12:20.503
Think of a Siri on steroids.

00:12:21.627 --> 00:12:25.949
So Siri says, "Your wife called
to remind you about dinner tonight."

00:12:26.616 --> 00:12:29.124
And of course, you've forgotten.
"What? What dinner?

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:30.573
What are you talking about?"
