00:06:28.171 --> 00:06:31.958
I just mean whatever it is
that the human would prefer

00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:33.325
their life to be like.

00:06:35.364 --> 00:06:37.673
And so this actually violates Asimov's law

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:40.026
that the robot has to protect
its own existence.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.773
It has no interest in preserving
its existence whatsoever.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.188
The second law is a law
of humility, if you like.

00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:53.717
And this turns out to be really
important to make robots safe.

00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:56.883
It says that the robot does not know

00:06:56.907 --> 00:06:58.935
what those human values are,

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:02.137
so it has to maximize them,
but it doesn't know what they are.
