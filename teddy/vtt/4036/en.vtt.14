00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:02.137
so it has to maximize them,
but it doesn't know what they are.

00:07:03.254 --> 00:07:05.880
And that avoids this problem
of single-minded pursuit

00:07:05.904 --> 00:07:07.116
of an objective.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.312
This uncertainty turns out to be crucial.

00:07:09.726 --> 00:07:11.365
Now, in order to be useful to us,

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.120
it has to have some idea of what we want.

00:07:15.223 --> 00:07:20.650
It obtains that information primarily
by observation of human choices,

00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:23.475
so our own choices reveal information

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:26.799
about what it is that we prefer
our lives to be like.

00:07:28.632 --> 00:07:30.315
So those are the three principles.
