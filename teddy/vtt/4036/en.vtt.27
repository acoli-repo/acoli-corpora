00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:30.553
"Yes, I didn't even have time for lunch."

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:31.859
"You must be very hungry."

00:13:31.883 --> 00:13:34.529
"Starving, yeah.
Could you make some dinner?"

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.160
"There's something I need to tell you."

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.339
(Laughter)

00:13:40.193 --> 00:13:45.098
"There are humans in South Sudan
who are in more urgent need than you."

00:13:45.122 --> 00:13:46.226
(Laughter)

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.325
"So I'm leaving. Make your own dinner."

00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:50.349
(Laughter)

00:13:50.823 --> 00:13:52.562
So we have to solve these problems,

00:13:52.586 --> 00:13:55.101
and I'm looking forward
to working on them.

00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:56.968
There are reasons for optimism.

00:13:56.992 --> 00:13:58.151
One reason is,

00:13:58.175 --> 00:14:00.043
there is a massive amount of data.
