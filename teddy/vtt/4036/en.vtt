00:00:00.712 --> 00:00:02.264
This is Lee Sedol.

00:00:02.288 --> 00:00:06.285
Lee Sedol is one of the world's
greatest Go players,

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:09.194
and he's having what my friends
in Silicon Valley call

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:10.728
a "Holy Cow" moment --

00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:11.825
(Laughter)

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.037
a moment where we realize

00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:17.357
that AI is actually progressing
a lot faster than we expected.

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:21.201
So humans have lost on the Go board.
What about the real world?

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:23.325
Well, the real world is much bigger,

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.598
much more complicated than the Go board.

00:00:25.622 --> 00:00:27.441
It's a lot less visible,

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:29.503
but it's still a decision problem.
