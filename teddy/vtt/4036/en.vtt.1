00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:33.269
And if we think about some
of the technologies

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:35.042
that are coming down the pike ...

00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:40.073
Noriko [Arai] mentioned that reading
is not yet happening in machines,

00:00:40.097 --> 00:00:41.597
at least with understanding.

00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:43.157
But that will happen,

00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:44.952
and when that happens,

00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:46.163
very soon afterwards,

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:50.759
machines will have read everything
that the human race has ever written.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.880
And that will enable machines,

00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:56.824
along with the ability to look
further ahead than humans can,

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:58.528
as we've already seen in Go,

00:00:58.552 --> 00:01:00.716
if they also have access
to more information,
