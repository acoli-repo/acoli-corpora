If you put an objective into a machine,

00:04:32.127 --> 00:04:34.575
even something as simple as,
"Fetch the coffee,"

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:37.749
the machine says to itself,

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:41.356

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:47.962
I will disable my 'off' switch.

00:04:48.534 --> 00:04:51.493
I will do anything to defend myself
against interference

00:04:51.517 --> 00:04:54.146

that I have been given."

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.182
So this single-minded pursuit

00:04:57.213 --> 00:05:00.158
in a very defensive mode
of an objective that is, in fact,
