00:07:28.632 --> 00:07:30.315
So those are the three principles.

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:32.657
Let's see how that applies
to this question of:

00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:35.470
"Can you switch the machine off?"
as Turing suggested.

00:07:37.073 --> 00:07:39.193
So here's a PR2 robot.

00:07:39.217 --> 00:07:41.038
This is one that we have in our lab,

00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:43.965
and it has a big red "off" switch
right on the back.

00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:47.156
The question is: Is it
going to let you switch it off?

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.645
If we do it the classical way,

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:52.151
we give it the objective of, "Fetch
the coffee, I must fetch the coffee,

00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:54.755
I can't fetch the coffee if I'm dead,"

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:58.120
so obviously the PR2
has been listening to my talk,

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:01.897
and so it says, therefore,
"I must disable my 'off' switch,
