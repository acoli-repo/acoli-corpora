00:08:29.747 --> 00:08:32.222
Well, I don't really know what wrong is,

00:08:32.246 --> 00:08:34.290
but I know that I don't want to do it."

00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:37.324
So that's the first and second
principles right there.

00:08:37.348 --> 00:08:40.707
"So I should let the human switch me off."

00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:45.677
And in fact you can calculate
the incentive that the robot has

00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:48.194
to allow the human to switch it off,

00:08:48.218 --> 00:08:50.132
and it's directly tied to the degree

00:08:50.156 --> 00:08:52.902
of uncertainty about
the underlying objective.

00:08:53.977 --> 00:08:56.926
And then when the machine is switched off,

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.755
that third principle comes into play.

00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:01.841
It learns something about the objectives
it should be pursuing,
