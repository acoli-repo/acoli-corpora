00:06:00.371 --> 00:06:02.972
I'm trying to redefine AI

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:05.057
to get away from this classical notion

00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:09.648
of machines that intelligently
pursue objectives.

00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:12.510
There are three principles involved.

00:06:12.534 --> 00:06:15.823
The first one is a principle
of altruism, if you like,

00:06:15.847 --> 00:06:19.109
that the robot's only objective

00:06:19.133 --> 00:06:23.379
is to maximize the realization
of human objectives,

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:24.793
of human values.

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:28.147
And by values here I don't mean
touchy-feely, goody-goody values.

00:06:28.171 --> 00:06:31.958
I just mean whatever it is
that the human would prefer
