because gorillas' ancestors did this
a few million years ago,

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:35.864
and now we can ask the gorillas:

00:02:36.752 --> 00:02:37.912
Was this a good idea?

00:02:37.936 --> 00:02:41.466
So here they are having a meeting
to discuss whether it was a good idea,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.836
and after a little while,
they conclude, no,

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.205
this was a terrible idea.

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.011
Our species is in dire straits.

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:52.801
In fact, you can see the existential
sadness in their eyes.

00:02:52.825 --> 00:02:54.465
(Laughter)

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.329
So this queasy feeling that making
something smarter than your own species

00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:01.718
is maybe not a good idea --
