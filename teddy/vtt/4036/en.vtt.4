00:02:02.607 --> 00:02:05.844
and I'll come back to that

00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:08.672
"we should, as a species,

00:02:10.177 --> 00:02:13.625
So who said this?
This is Alan Turing in 1951.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.063
Alan Turing, as you know,
is the father of computer science

00:02:17.087 --> 00:02:20.135
and in many ways,
the father of AI as well.

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.121
So if we think about this problem,

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:26.932
the problem of creating something
more intelligent than your own species,

00:02:26.956 --> 00:02:29.578
we might call this "the gorilla problem,"
