00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:01.841
It learns something about the objectives
it should be pursuing,

00:09:01.865 --> 00:09:04.398
because it learns that
what it did wasn't right.

00:09:04.422 --> 00:09:07.992
In fact, we can, with suitable use
of Greek symbols,

00:09:08.016 --> 00:09:10.147
as mathematicians usually do,

00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:12.155
we can actually prove a theorem

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:15.732
that says that such a robot
is provably beneficial to the human.

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:19.559
You are provably better off
with a machine that's designed in this way

00:09:19.583 --> 00:09:20.829
than without it.

00:09:21.237 --> 00:09:24.143
So this is a very simple example,
but this is the first step

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:28.070
in what we're trying to do
with human-compatible AI.
