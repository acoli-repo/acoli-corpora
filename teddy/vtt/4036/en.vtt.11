00:05:29.226 --> 00:05:31.316
HAL has an objective, a mission,

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.072
which is not aligned
with the objectives of the humans,

00:05:35.096 --> 00:05:36.906
and that leads to this conflict.

00:05:37.494 --> 00:05:40.463
Now fortunately, HAL
is not superintelligent.

00:05:40.487 --> 00:05:44.074
He's pretty smart,
but eventually Dave outwits him

00:05:44.098 --> 00:05:45.947
and manages to switch him off.

00:05:49.828 --> 00:05:51.447
But we might not be so lucky.

00:05:56.193 --> 00:05:57.785
So what are we going to do?
