00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:02.388
In the middle of my Ph.D.,

00:00:02.388 --> 00:00:05.850
I was hopelessly stuck.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.630
Every research direction that I tried

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.246
led to a dead end.

00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:11.148
It seemed like my basic assumptions

00:00:11.148 --> 00:00:13.076
just stopped working.

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:16.075
I felt like a pilot flying through the mist,

00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:18.870
and I lost all sense of direction.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.351
I stopped shaving.

00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:23.092
I couldn't get out of bed in the morning.

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:24.825
I felt unworthy

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:27.978
of stepping across the gates of the university,

00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:30.126
because I wasn't like Einstein or Newton
