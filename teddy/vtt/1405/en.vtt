00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.787
So, before I became a dermatologist,

00:00:02.787 --> 00:00:05.339
I started in general medicine,

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.555
as most dermatologists do in Britain.

00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:09.603
At the end of that time, I went off to Australia,

00:00:09.603 --> 00:00:11.499
about 20 years ago.

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:13.620
What you learn when you go to Australia

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.346
is the Australians are very competitive.

00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:18.403
And they are not magnanimous in victory.

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.467
And that happened a lot:

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:22.899
"You pommies, you can't play cricket, rugby."

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.017
I could accept that.

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:27.347
But moving into work --

00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:29.885
and we have each week what's called a journal club,

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:32.343
when you'd sit down with the other doctors
