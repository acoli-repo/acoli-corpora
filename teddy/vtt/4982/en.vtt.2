MH: In the gym, what you hate the most
is usually what you need the most.

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:07.779
AG: And some people at the gym
are a little lopsided.

00:01:07.803 --> 00:01:10.334
MH: You might go into a gym
and you look at someone,

00:01:10.358 --> 00:01:12.068
and you see them from the waist up.

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:15.493
They're very developed, they've got
a big chest, big shoulders, big pecs

00:01:15.517 --> 00:01:16.671
and everything else.

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:19.732
Then all of a sudden you see
their skinny little toothpick legs.

00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:23.593
That's obviously a very undeveloped person
or a wrongly developed person.

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:25.569
You should develop the whole body.

00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:29.268
AG: And if you push that to the extreme,
is there an injury risk?

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:31.141
MH: Oh, yeah, very much so.
