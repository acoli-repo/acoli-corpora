Adam Grant: Hello, there.

00:00:03.357 --> 00:00:05.254
Michael Hartle: Hey, Adam. How are you?

00:00:05.278 --> 00:00:07.635
AG: Do you know that you sound
like a powerlifter?

00:00:07.659 --> 00:00:09.460
MH: (Laughs) I do, huh?

00:00:09.807 --> 00:00:12.815
AG: Just wondering if you actually
worked on your voice muscles.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.688
MH: Yes. I do squats with my voice muscle
and squats with my body, yes.

00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:18.228
(Laughter)

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:21.720
AG: Michael Hartle is a chiropractic
physician in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.926
He wasn't always strong.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.507
MH: When I was in high school,
I could barely bench 135.

00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:32.055
AG: But for the last 20 years,
he's basically been The Hulk.
