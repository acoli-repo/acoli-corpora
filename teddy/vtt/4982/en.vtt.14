00:06:59.441 --> 00:07:01.452
But you've got 73 percent of people going,

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:04.300
"I can modify my job to fit
my strengths, but I just don't."

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:05.474
AG: Why not?

00:07:05.498 --> 00:07:07.021
MB: I think deep down,

00:07:07.045 --> 00:07:10.160
we don't actually think

00:07:10.184 --> 00:07:12.482
that our unique way
of engaging with the world

00:07:12.506 --> 00:07:13.904
is worth uncovering.

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.671
And what we need sometimes
is someone going,

00:07:16.695 --> 00:07:19.260
"No, no, no -- that's you. That's weird."

00:07:19.284 --> 00:07:21.823
Like, not everyone does X or does Y.

00:07:21.847 --> 00:07:24.593
It does take a while for you to go,

00:07:24.617 --> 00:07:28.442
"This, actually, is the way I uniquely
engage with the world."

00:07:28.466 --> 00:07:29.791
AG: Strengths are important

00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:32.156
and emphasizing them
is definitely more productive
