00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:02.372
the creative colleague,
who's still generating new ideas

00:08:02.396 --> 00:08:05.190
when it's long past time
to finish an old project;

00:08:05.603 --> 00:08:09.380
the empathetic service reps,
who show so much concern

00:08:09.404 --> 00:08:11.338
that customers take advantage of them.

00:08:12.823 --> 00:08:15.704
It seems that if you lean
too heavily on your strengths,

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.528
they can become weaknesses.

00:08:18.556 --> 00:08:21.056
I was curious about Marcus's take on this.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.055
Each spring, I cohost the Wharton
People Analytics Conference,

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:26.965
which focuses on using evidence
to improve work.

00:08:27.481 --> 00:08:29.895
So I invited Marcus to debate onstage,

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:33.777
because the data suggest
that overusing strengths is a big problem.
