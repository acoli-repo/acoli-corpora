00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.889
Help me apply this in my own life.

00:10:01.913 --> 00:10:04.301
So, apparently when I took
the StrengthsFinder,

00:10:04.325 --> 00:10:05.760
I took an early version of it,

00:10:05.784 --> 00:10:09.839
and one of my strengths was
that I was logical and data-driven.

00:10:09.863 --> 00:10:12.110
And I think you have a term for that now.

00:10:12.928 --> 00:10:14.507
MB: Logical and data-driven?

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:15.689
"Annoying."

00:10:15.713 --> 00:10:16.714
(Laughter)

00:10:16.738 --> 00:10:17.888
AG: Thank you.

00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:20.336
You are really all about strengths.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.278
I was hoping it would be true.

00:10:23.298 --> 00:10:26.243
MB: I don't actually do this
myself, are you kidding?

00:10:27.433 --> 00:10:29.387
So, well, "Analytical" would be one.

00:10:29.411 --> 00:10:32.957
AG: And I think there was a little bit
of "Woo" -- winning over others --
