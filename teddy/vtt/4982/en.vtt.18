00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:02.704
You can use your
strengths unintelligently.

00:09:02.728 --> 00:09:05.283
If you think you can ever have
too much of a strength,

00:09:05.307 --> 00:09:07.046
your coaching then sounds like this:

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.371
"Be less of yourself, Adam.

00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:09.570
Turn yourself down."

00:09:09.594 --> 00:09:12.849
And for you, you're like,
"How do I metabolize that?"

00:09:12.873 --> 00:09:14.168
Whereas if I say to you,

00:09:14.192 --> 00:09:18.167
"Listen, you've got a great strength
in..." -- maybe you're super assertive --

00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:19.476
"Stop pissing people off,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.268
and start using that to persuade them
to do something they didn't intend to do."

00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:25.645
And then you lean in and go,
"How do I do that?"

00:09:25.669 --> 00:09:27.128
Now all of a sudden, I'm like,

00:09:27.152 --> 00:09:30.301
"I don't know. Here's what I would do,
but what you might try ..."
