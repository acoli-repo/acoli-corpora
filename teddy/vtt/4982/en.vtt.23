00:11:27.934 --> 00:11:30.534
Obviously, every strength
has a dark side, if you will.

00:11:30.558 --> 00:11:33.909
I mean, you say to someone,
"I just have incredibly high standards.

00:11:33.933 --> 00:11:35.959
Those are the high standards that I have,"

00:11:35.983 --> 00:11:38.918
and somebody behind your back
is going, "Stupid perfectionist.

00:11:38.942 --> 00:11:40.100
Just ... anal."

00:11:40.719 --> 00:11:41.995
Or, "I'm super assertive."

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:43.343
"Aggressive."

00:11:44.577 --> 00:11:47.319
Every strength has that kind of dark side.

00:11:48.395 --> 00:11:49.744
You're a logic bully.

00:11:49.768 --> 00:11:52.512
And by the way,
that's a great word combination.

00:11:52.536 --> 00:11:53.541
(Laughter)

00:11:53.565 --> 00:11:54.844
"Logic bully."

00:11:55.371 --> 00:11:58.768
But weirdly, if I was coaching you,

00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:01.144
I'd go, "People follow you
because of that."
