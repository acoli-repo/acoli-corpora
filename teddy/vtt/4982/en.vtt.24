00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:01.144
I'd go, "People follow you
because of that."

00:12:01.918 --> 00:12:03.260
Don't turn that down.

00:12:03.284 --> 00:12:06.021
Turn that up, because people
follow you because of that.

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:07.742
So turn it up.

00:12:08.044 --> 00:12:09.298
Step into it.

00:12:09.322 --> 00:12:10.476
And --

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.292
AG: ... and bully you more. (Laughs)

00:12:12.316 --> 00:12:15.655
MB: Well, more like, learn how
you can leave space for people

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:18.685
to model what you're doing
as they make their own decisions.

00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:22.248
Is it true that in general people tend
to want to own their own decisions

00:12:22.272 --> 00:12:24.249
because their learning is emergent? Yes.

00:12:24.273 --> 00:12:27.147
Is it therefore true that
you telling them exactly what to do

00:12:27.171 --> 00:12:29.443
removes from them
the opportunity to learn? Yes.

00:12:29.467 --> 00:12:31.345
Are you also a teacher? Yes.
