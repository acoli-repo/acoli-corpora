He's won a national title
in the bench press.

How much did you lift?

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:43.358

which is 242.5 kilos.

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:45.537
AG: Oh, my gosh.

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:48.379

MH: (Laughs) Yes, sir. Exactly.

00:00:54.403 --> 00:00:57.363
AG: Powerlifters know something
that many amateurs don't:

00:00:57.387 --> 00:00:59.791
you're at your strongest
when you're well-rounded.

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:03.998
MH: In the gym, what you hate the most
is usually what you need the most.
