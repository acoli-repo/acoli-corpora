00:09:27.152 --> 00:09:30.301
"I don't know. Here's what I would do,
but what you might try ..."

00:09:30.325 --> 00:09:33.074
That just feels better than me
going, "Turn yourself down.

00:09:33.098 --> 00:09:34.558
You're at 11. Turn it to six."

00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:35.884
And you're like, "I can't."

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.249
Or "You're too empathetic."

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.071
No.

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:42.305
You can never be too --
if you've got empathy, you're empathetic.

00:09:42.329 --> 00:09:45.289
A challenge with you then is
how do leverage that intelligently

00:09:45.313 --> 00:09:47.101
to create the outcomes that you want?

00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:49.434
You can't be crying
all over people all the time.

00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:51.729
But that doesn't mean
you have too much empathy.

00:09:51.753 --> 00:09:54.611
It means we've got to help you
channel that productively.

00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:56.691
It leads to different conversations.

00:09:56.715 --> 00:09:57.961
AG: Great.

00:09:57.985 --> 00:09:59.454
I think I'm on board.
