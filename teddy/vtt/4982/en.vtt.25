Are you also a teacher? Yes.

00:12:31.369 --> 00:12:33.384
So therefore, if you want people to learn,

00:12:33.408 --> 00:12:35.235
you've got to use your logic bullyness

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:37.433
to help them step into
their own intelligence.

00:12:38.005 --> 00:12:40.855
And you would find lots
of tricks and techniques to do that.

00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:42.039
But I would say to you,

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:50.895
And we know you're not perfect.

00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:54.765
There's a whole bunch of qualities that
teachers and professors and so forth have

00:12:54.789 --> 00:12:55.990
that you don't have.

00:12:56.014 --> 00:12:59.784
But these ones that you do have are really
distinctive and elevating for people.

00:12:59.808 --> 00:13:02.301
And my challenge in helping
you grow would be to say,
