00:14:59.142 --> 00:15:01.605
and employees have feedback
they want to give you

00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:04.093
and they've written that feedback
on a set of cards.

00:15:04.117 --> 00:15:07.514
And so you're handed the cards,
and then when you turn one over,

00:15:07.538 --> 00:15:11.609
you read the feedback they have for you,
and then you react to it.

00:15:11.966 --> 00:15:13.883
And so, one of the cards said,

00:15:13.907 --> 00:15:18.551
"You're like Mary effing Poppins,
practically perfect in every way."

00:15:18.871 --> 00:15:21.403
And when I turned that card over,

00:15:21.427 --> 00:15:23.469
I laughed first of all, so hard.

00:15:23.493 --> 00:15:25.220
And I thought, "Oh, my gosh.

00:15:25.244 --> 00:15:27.506
First of all, I can't believe
people think this.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.690
And second of all,

00:15:28.714 --> 00:15:32.006
one of the biggest things I've had
to work on the last five-plus years
