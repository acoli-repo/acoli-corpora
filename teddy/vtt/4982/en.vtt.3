00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:31.141
MH: Oh, yeah, very much so.

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:34.098
AG: Do you think that this
is not just a metaphor,

00:01:34.122 --> 00:01:35.633
but that it's true in our lives

00:01:35.657 --> 00:01:38.101
that the same way
you can overdevelop one muscle

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:40.205
and, you know, underdevelop another,

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.269

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.820
If you always focus on one part of it
and not the whole, global picture,

00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:54.614
yeah, you're going to have issues.

00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:55.987
AG: If you're a powerlifter,

00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:59.145
you can't get stronger if you don't work
on your weakest muscles.

00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:01.950
You've probably been told
the same thing at work:
