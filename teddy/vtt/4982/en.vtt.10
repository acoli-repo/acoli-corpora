Your strengths are broader aptitudes
you have or build

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.426

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.733
influencing people

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:09.674
or developing relationships.

00:05:10.696 --> 00:05:13.696
Marcus played a major role
in launching an influential movement

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.173

MB: Our whole message ought to be:

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:22.283

00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:25.871
And therefore, the question should be:
How can you be amazing?

like Facebook and McKinsey

00:05:29.784 --> 00:05:32.272
call themselves "strengths-based."
