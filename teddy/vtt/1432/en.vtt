Probably a lot of you know
the story of the two salesmen

00:00:03.551 --> 00:00:06.469
who went down to Africa in the 1900s.

00:00:06.493 --> 00:00:09.133
They were sent down to find
if there was any opportunity

00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:10.365
for selling shoes,

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.717
and they wrote telegrams
back to Manchester.

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.551
And one of them wrote,

00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:17.737
"Situation hopeless. Stop.
They don't wear shoes."

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:19.904
And the other one wrote,

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:22.936
"Glorious opportunity.
They don't have any shoes yet."

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.260
(Laughter)

00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:27.443
Now, there's a similar situation
in the classical music world,

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:31.376
because there are some people who think
that classical music is dying.
