00:00:01.316 --> 00:00:05.396
When we think about climate
change and pollution,

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:08.636
we usually think about oil-soaked birds,

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:12.076
fossil gas platforms in the Arctic

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:15.356
or black smoke rising above coal plants.

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:20.316
We never think about banks,
insurers and investors.

00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:22.516
But we should.

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:27.116
Because money is a driving force
beyond fossil fuel extraction

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:29.436
and environmental destruction.

00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:34.316
The most polluting sector
on the planet is not fossil fuels.
