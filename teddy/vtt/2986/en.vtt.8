00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.601
You can see the new dry forest.

00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:03.827
Trees were open grown
and fairly far apart.

00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:06.296
Fires were frequent here,
and when they occurred,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.898
they weren't that severe,

00:04:07.922 --> 00:04:09.352
while further up the mountain,

00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:11.499
in the moist and the cold forests,

00:04:11.523 --> 00:04:14.761
trees were more densely grown
and fires were less frequent,

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:18.103
but when they occurred,
they were quite a bit more severe.

00:04:18.127 --> 00:04:21.770
These different forest types,
the environments that they grew in

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:24.857
and fire severity --
they all worked together

00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.529
to shape this historical patchwork.

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:31.813
And there was so much power
