00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.230
These are what we call "megafires."

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.999
Megafires are the result of the way
we've managed this western landscape

00:01:06.023 --> 00:01:08.639
over the last 150 years

00:01:08.663 --> 00:01:10.776
in a steadily warming climate.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.576
Much of the destruction
that we are currently seeing

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.535
could actually have been avoided.

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:22.138
I've spent my entire career
studying these western landscapes,

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:24.130
and the science is pretty clear:

00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:28.929
if we don't change a few
of our fire-management habits,

00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:33.377
we're going to lose many more
of our beloved forests.
