00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:31.677
so much less smoke than wildfires do.

00:11:31.701 --> 00:11:33.050
It's not even close.

00:11:33.074 --> 00:11:34.301
But there's a hitch:

00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:39.951
prescribed burning smoke is currently
regulated under air quality rules

00:11:39.975 --> 00:11:41.910
as an avoidable nuisance.

00:11:42.557 --> 00:11:44.238
But wildfire smoke?

00:11:44.262 --> 00:11:46.304
It simply gets a pass.

00:11:48.153 --> 00:11:50.718
Makes sense, doesn't it? (Laughs)

00:11:50.742 --> 00:11:52.017
So you know what happens?

00:11:52.041 --> 00:11:55.288
We do far too little prescribed burning,

00:11:55.312 --> 00:11:59.123
and we continually eat smoke
in the summers

00:11:59.147 --> 00:12:00.548
from megafires.
