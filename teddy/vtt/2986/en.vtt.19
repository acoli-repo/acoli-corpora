What's more, our summers
are getting hotter

00:09:30.605 --> 00:09:32.760
and they're getting drier

00:09:32.784 --> 00:09:34.606
and they're getting windier.

00:09:35.163 --> 00:09:40.656
And the fire season is now
40 to 80 days longer each year.

00:09:41.168 --> 00:09:43.668
Because of this,
climatologists are predicting

00:09:43.692 --> 00:09:46.912
that the area burned since 2000

00:09:46.936 --> 00:09:49.721
will double or triple

00:09:49.745 --> 00:09:51.649
in the next three decades.

00:09:53.015 --> 00:09:56.389
And we're building houses
in the middle of this.

00:09:56.413 --> 00:09:58.522
Two recently published studies tell us

00:09:58.546 --> 00:10:03.083
that more than 60 percent
of all new housing starts are being built
