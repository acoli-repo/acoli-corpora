00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:33.629
In the US, an area that's larger
than the state of Oregon has burned

00:00:33.653 --> 00:00:35.453
in just the last 10 years,

00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:40.192
and tens of thousands of homes
have been destroyed.

00:00:41.098 --> 00:00:45.862
Acres burned and homes destroyed
have steadily increased

00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:48.845
over the last three decades,

00:00:50.328 --> 00:00:55.784
and individual fires that are bigger
than 100,000 acres --

00:00:55.808 --> 00:00:57.436
they're actually on the rise.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.230
These are what we call "megafires."
