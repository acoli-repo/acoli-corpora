00:05:57.737 --> 00:06:01.709
interrupting further the flow of fire
across this landscape.

00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:05.593
And then something happened
which caused a sudden pivot

00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:07.038
in our society.

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:11.562
In 1910, we had a huge wildfire.

00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:14.302
It was the size
of the state of Connecticut.

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:17.915
We called it "the Big Burn."

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:21.888
It stretched from eastern Washington
to western Montana,

00:06:21.912 --> 00:06:25.595
and it burned, in a few days,
three million acres,

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:30.080
devoured several towns,
and it killed 87 people.
