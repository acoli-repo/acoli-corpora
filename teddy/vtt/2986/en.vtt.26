That option is actually not on the table.

00:13:07.038 --> 00:13:12.219
Until we, the owners of public lands,
make it our high priority

00:13:12.243 --> 00:13:14.956
to do something about
the current situation,

00:13:16.002 --> 00:13:19.623
we're going to experience
continued losses to megafires.

00:13:19.647 --> 00:13:21.164
So it's up to us.

00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:24.288
We can spread this message
to our lawmakers,

00:13:24.312 --> 00:13:27.751
folks who can help us manage our fires

00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:30.137
and our forests.
