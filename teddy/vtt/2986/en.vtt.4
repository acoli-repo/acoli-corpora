Well, that's what I want

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.808
You see this forest?

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:10.161
Isn't it beautiful?

00:02:17.877 --> 00:02:20.116
Well, the forests that we see today

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:26.531
look nothing like the forests
of 100 or 150 years ago.

Thankfully, panoramic photos
were taken in the 1930s
