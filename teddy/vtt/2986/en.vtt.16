00:07:57.758 --> 00:08:02.078
then along comes fire suppression
and logging, removing the big trees,

00:08:02.102 --> 00:08:03.427
and you know what happened?

00:08:03.451 --> 00:08:05.705
All these factors worked together

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:08.614
to allow the forest to fill in,

00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:12.617
creating what I call
the current epidemic of trees.

00:08:13.163 --> 00:08:15.146
(Laughter)

00:08:16.678 --> 00:08:17.854
Go figure.

00:08:17.878 --> 00:08:18.925
(Laughter)

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:22.545
More trees than the landscape can support.

00:08:23.506 --> 00:08:28.266
So when you compare what forests
looked like 100 years ago and today,

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.776
the change is actually remarkable.
