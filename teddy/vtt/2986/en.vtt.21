00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.520
We need to restore
the power of the patchwork.

00:10:33.544 --> 00:10:36.693
We need to put the right kind of fire

00:10:36.717 --> 00:10:38.619
back into the system again.

00:10:38.643 --> 00:10:44.805
It's how we can resize
the severity of many of our future fires.

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:47.746
And the silver lining is
that we have tools

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.244
and we have know-how to do this.

00:10:50.268 --> 00:10:52.407
Let's look at some of the tools.

00:10:52.431 --> 00:10:57.198
We can use prescribed burning
to intentionally thin out trees

00:10:57.222 --> 00:10:59.048
and burn up dead fuels.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.829
We do this to systematically
reduce them and keep them reduced.
