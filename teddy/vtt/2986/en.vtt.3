00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:33.377
we're going to lose many more
of our beloved forests.

00:01:34.062 --> 00:01:36.753
Some won't recover in our lifetime

00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:39.579
or my kids' lifetime.

00:01:39.603 --> 00:01:43.982
It's time we confront
some tough truths about wildfires,

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:48.113
and come to understand that we need
to learn to better live with them

00:01:49.162 --> 00:01:52.112
and change how they come to our forests,

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.242
our homes

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:56.591
and our communities.

00:01:57.654 --> 00:01:59.484
So why is this happening?

00:01:59.508 --> 00:02:02.134
Well, that's what I want
to talk to you about today.
