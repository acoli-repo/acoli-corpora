from acre to acre,

00:09:06.365 --> 00:09:10.462
but now, so do diseases
and insect outbreaks,

00:09:11.896 --> 00:09:15.224
which are killing or reducing the vitality

00:09:15.248 --> 00:09:18.045
of really large sections of forest now.

00:09:18.488 --> 00:09:21.347
And after a century without fire,

00:09:21.371 --> 00:09:24.950

on the forest floor,

00:09:24.974 --> 00:09:27.001
they're at powder-keg levels.

00:09:27.956 --> 00:09:30.581
What's more, our summers
are getting hotter
