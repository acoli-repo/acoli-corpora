00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:02.869
For 10,000 years, Native Americans
lived on this landscape,

00:05:02.893 --> 00:05:06.426
and they intentionally burned it -- a lot.

00:05:07.284 --> 00:05:11.176
They used fire to burn meadows
and to thin certain forests

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.245
so they could grow more food.

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:16.274
They used fire to increase graze

00:05:16.298 --> 00:05:20.134
for the deer and the elk
and the bison that they hunted.

00:05:20.158 --> 00:05:22.671
And most importantly, they figured out

00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:25.321
if they burned in the spring and the fall,

00:05:25.345 --> 00:05:28.884
they could avoid the out-of-control
fires of summer.

00:05:29.508 --> 00:05:33.992
European settlement -- it occurred
much later, in the mid-1800s,
