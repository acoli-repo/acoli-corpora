00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:30.080
devoured several towns,
and it killed 87 people.

00:06:30.104 --> 00:06:31.853
Most of them were firefighters.

00:06:33.178 --> 00:06:37.161
Because of the Big Burn, wildfire
became public enemy number one,

00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:40.606
and this would shape the way
that we would think about wildfire

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.911
in our society

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:43.766
for the next hundred years.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.311
Thereafter, the Forest Service,
just five years young at the time,

00:06:48.335 --> 00:06:53.467
was tasked with the responsibility
of putting out all wildfires

00:06:53.491 --> 00:06:57.033
on 193 million acres of public lands,

00:06:57.057 --> 00:06:58.997
and they took this responsibility

00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:00.184
very seriously.
