00:12:26.623 --> 00:12:30.362
And as you've probably figured out by now,

00:12:30.386 --> 00:12:32.592
this is actually a social problem.

00:12:32.616 --> 00:12:35.599
It's got ecological
and climate explanations,

00:12:35.623 --> 00:12:40.319
but it's a social problem,
and it will take us humans to solve it.

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:43.458
Public support for these tools is poor.

00:12:43.482 --> 00:12:47.164
Prescribed burning and managed wildfires
are not well-supported.

00:12:47.188 --> 00:12:51.836
We actually all simply want fires
to magically go away

00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:55.670
and take that pesky smoke
with them, don't we?

00:12:57.122 --> 00:13:02.150
But there is no future
without lots of fire and lots of smoke.
