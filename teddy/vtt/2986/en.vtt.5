00:02:27.318 --> 00:02:30.981
Thankfully, panoramic photos
were taken in the 1930s

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.893
from thousands of western
mountaintop lookouts,

00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:37.356
and they show a fair approximation

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.224
of the forest that we inherited.

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:44.558
The best word to describe
these forests of old is "patchy."

00:02:45.303 --> 00:02:49.301
The historical forest landscape
was this constantly evolving patchwork

00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:53.084
of open and closed
canopy forests of all ages,

00:02:53.108 --> 00:02:56.600
and there was so much evidence of fire.

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:01.467
And most fires were pretty small
by today's standards.
