00:05:29.508 --> 00:05:33.992
European settlement -- it occurred
much later, in the mid-1800s,

00:05:34.016 --> 00:05:38.291
and by the 1880s, livestock
grazing was in high gear.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:42.096
I mean, if you think about it,
the cattle and the sheep ate the grasses

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.161
which had been the conveyer belt
for the historical fires,

00:05:46.185 --> 00:05:50.279
and this prevented once-frequent fires
from thinning out trees

00:05:50.303 --> 00:05:51.924
and burning up dead wood.

00:05:52.634 --> 00:05:57.713
Later came roads and railroads,
and they acted as potent firebreaks,

00:05:57.737 --> 00:06:01.709
interrupting further the flow of fire
across this landscape.
