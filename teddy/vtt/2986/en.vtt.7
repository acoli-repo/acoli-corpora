00:03:27.727 --> 00:03:30.425
or it's on a ridge top
or in a valley bottom;

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.294
elevation, how far up the mountain it is;

00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:37.914
and weather, whether a place
gets a lot of snow and rain,

00:03:37.938 --> 00:03:39.986
sunlight and warmth.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.079
These things all worked together

00:03:43.103 --> 00:03:45.006
to shape the way the forest grew.

00:03:45.974 --> 00:03:51.139
And the way the forest grew
shaped the way fire behaved

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:52.511
on the landscape.

00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:58.680
There was crosstalk
between the patterns and the processes.

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.601
You can see the new dry forest.
