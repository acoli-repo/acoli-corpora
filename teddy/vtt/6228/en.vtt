Chris Anderson: You were something
of a mathematical phenom.

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:06.739
You had already taught at Harvard
and MIT at a young age.

00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:08.953
And then the NSA came calling.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:10.668
What was that about?

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:15.130
Jim Simons: Well the NSA --
that's the National Security Agency --

00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:17.123
they didn't exactly come calling.

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:21.939
They had an operation at Princeton,
where they hired mathematicians

00:00:21.963 --> 00:00:24.905
to attack secret codes
and stuff like that.

00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:26.966
And I knew that existed.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.495
And they had a very good policy,

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.369
because you could do half your time
at your own mathematics,
