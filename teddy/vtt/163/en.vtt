I am failing as a woman,

00:00:02.832 --> 00:00:05.127
I am failing as a feminist.

00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:08.229
I have passionate opinions
about gender equality,

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:12.290
but I worry that to freely accept
the label of "feminist,"

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:14.613
would not be fair to good feminists.

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:17.557
I'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one.

00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:20.445
Oh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:22.802
Or at least, I wrote an essay,

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:25.001
and then I wrote a book
called "Bad Feminist,"

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:28.461
and then in interviews, people started
calling me The Bad Feminist.

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:29.651
(Laughter)

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:33.712
So, what started as a bit
of an inside joke with myself
