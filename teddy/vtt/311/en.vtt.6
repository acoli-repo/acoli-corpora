00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:01.417
they become orphans of the narrative.

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:04.319
Many of them get destroyed, believe it or not,

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.956
or they get simply shelved,

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:08.198
out of sight and out of mind.

00:03:08.198 --> 00:03:10.714
I decided a few years ago

00:03:10.714 --> 00:03:13.380
to photograph every single exhumed item

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.281
in order to create a visual archive

00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:18.631
that survivors could easily browse.

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:22.688
As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community.

00:03:22.688 --> 00:03:25.431
I like to move beyond raising awareness.

00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:27.615
And in this case, someone may

00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:29.216
recognize these items

00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:31.912
or at least their photographs will remain
