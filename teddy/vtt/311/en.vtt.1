00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:30.199
exchanged for prisoners of war.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.212
These items have been recovered

00:00:32.212 --> 00:00:35.050
from numerous mass graves across my homeland,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.580
and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.714
from newly discovered mass graves,

00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:41.250
20 years after the war.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.333
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.611
During the four years of conflict

00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:50.457
that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s,

00:00:50.457 --> 00:00:53.888
approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians,

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:55.823
went missing, presumed killed,

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:57.803
and another 100,000 were killed

00:00:57.803 --> 00:00:59.530
during combat operations.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.159
Most of them were killed
