00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.561
It is also about destroying their property,

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:33.451
their cultural heritage,

00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:36.713
and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed.

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:39.210
Genocide is not only about the killing;

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.383
it is about the denied identity.

00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:43.813
There are always traces —

00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:45.532
no such thing as a perfect crime.

00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:48.267
There are always remnants of the perished ones

00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:50.785
that are more durable than their fragile bodies

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:54.523
and our selective and fading memory of them.

00:01:54.523 --> 00:01:57.180
These items are recovered

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.352
from numerous mass graves,

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:01.766
and the main goal of this collection of the items
