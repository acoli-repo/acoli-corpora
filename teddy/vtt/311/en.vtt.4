WEBVTT

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:01.766
and the main goal of this collection of the items

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:03.234
is a unique process

00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:06.512
of identifying those who disappeared in the killings,

00:02:06.512 --> 00:02:09.482
the first act of genocide on European soil

00:02:09.482 --> 00:02:10.905
since the Holocaust.

00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:13.419
Not a single body should remain undiscovered

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:15.285
or unidentified.

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:16.650
Once recovered,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.573
these items that the victims carried with them

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:21.052
on their way to execution

00:02:21.052 --> 00:02:23.409
are carefully cleaned, analyzed,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.647
catalogued and stored.

00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:28.797
Thousands of artifacts are
packed in white plastic bags

00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:31.200
just like the ones you see on CSI.
