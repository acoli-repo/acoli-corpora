00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.385
These are simple objects:

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:06.180
clocks, keys, combs, glasses.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.520
They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.517
carried with them on their final journey.

00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:14.240
We are all familiar with these mundane,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.974
everyday objects.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.559
The fact that some of the victims carried

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.973
personal items such as
toothpaste and a toothbrush

00:00:20.973 --> 00:00:23.492
is a clear sign they had no idea

00:00:23.492 --> 00:00:25.320
what was about to happen to them.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.711
Usually, they were told that they were going to be

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:30.199
exchanged for prisoners of war.
