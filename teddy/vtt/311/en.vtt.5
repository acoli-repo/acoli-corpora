00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:31.200
just like the ones you see on CSI.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.938
These objects are used as a forensic tool

00:02:33.938 --> 00:02:36.393
in visual identification of the victims,

00:02:36.393 --> 00:02:39.640
but they are also used as
very valuable forensic evidence

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.477
in the ongoing war crimes trials.

00:02:42.477 --> 00:02:44.568
Survivors are occasionally called

00:02:44.568 --> 00:02:47.119
to try to identify these items physically,

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.449
but physical browsing is extremely difficult,

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.551
an ineffective and painful process.

00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:57.344
Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:58.486
are done with these objects,

00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:01.417
they become orphans of the narrative.
