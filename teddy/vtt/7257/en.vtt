This, this is Yoli.

00:00:04.746 --> 00:00:08.538
I went to her childcare program
that she started out of her home

00:00:08.538 --> 00:00:10.163
in the community where I grew up.

00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:12.621
I was in her program when I was four.

00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:16.496
Over the years, she served hundreds
of children in our community.

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:18.538
Her program was so fun.

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.288
We played outside,
we played hide and seek,

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.621
there was play dough, there were blocks.

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:26.288
Yoli would ask us things like,

00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:28.038
â€œHow are you feeling today?

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.496
Are you feeling happy?

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:31.038
Are you feeling sad?
