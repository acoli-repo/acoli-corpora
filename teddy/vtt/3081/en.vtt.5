00:02:28.487 --> 00:02:30.835
I thought the key to getting
the best performance

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.757
was a risk-reward system

00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:36.964
where you could give the high performers
bonuses and promotions

00:02:36.988 --> 00:02:39.591
and give the underperformers
something to worry about.

00:02:40.435 --> 00:02:44.442
But in this company, we had fixed salaries

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:45.656
and lifelong jobs.

00:02:46.903 --> 00:02:48.382
Careers were set,

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:50.840
so my toolkit wasn't very effective,

00:02:50.864 --> 00:02:52.116
and I was frustrated.

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:58.058
But then I saw that this company
was producing some pockets of excellence,

00:02:58.082 --> 00:03:00.201
areas in which they beat the competition
