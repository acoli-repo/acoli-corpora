This creates a beautiful fairness circle.

00:09:31.934 --> 00:09:33.616
But while we start off fair ...

00:09:34.934 --> 00:09:39.997
one drop of unfairness
contaminates the whole pool,

00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:43.140
and unfortunately,
there's plenty of drops in that pool.

00:09:44.606 --> 00:09:48.567
So our effort should be to filter out

00:09:48.591 --> 00:09:50.687
as much unfairness
as we can from everywhere,

00:09:50.711 --> 00:09:53.473
starting from our communities,
starting from our companies.

00:09:54.687 --> 00:10:00.235
I worry about this a lot because I lead
a team of 3,000 excellent people,
