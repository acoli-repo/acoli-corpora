00:00:01.087 --> 00:00:04.507
For me, it was not being invited
to a friend's wedding.

00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:07.334
At first, I didn't really mind.

00:00:07.358 --> 00:00:10.020
I thought he was having a small reception.

00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:13.497
But then I kept meeting people
who were going to the same wedding,

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:15.965
and they weren't as close
to the groom as I was ...

00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:18.679
and I felt left out.

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:19.989
That really sucked.

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:21.552
It felt really unfair.

00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:27.312
For my daughters, Lipsi
and Greta, it was last week.

00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:30.702
They were taking turns
massaging their mom's back
