Did we have a killer application
that no one else had? No.

00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:38.095
Was it one genius who was finding oil

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.547
No, we hadn't hired a senior guy in years.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.658
So what was our secret sauce?

00:03:45.723 --> 00:03:47.845
I started looking at them
really carefully.

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.256

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.495
writing off more than a billion
dollars for the company,

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.200
and found oil on the eighth.

00:03:56.865 --> 00:03:58.190
I was nervous for him ...
