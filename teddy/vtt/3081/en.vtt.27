00:13:29.354 --> 00:13:33.173
But fairness is a risk worth taking,

00:13:33.197 --> 00:13:35.753
so we should be asking ourselves,

00:13:35.777 --> 00:13:38.093
where can we take this risk?

00:13:39.031 --> 00:13:43.278
Where can we push ourselves
a little bit further,

00:13:43.302 --> 00:13:46.261
to go beyond what's rational
and do what's right?

00:13:47.865 --> 00:13:49.016
Thank you.
