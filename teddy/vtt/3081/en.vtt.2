00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:01.764
probably also had to do with unfairness.

00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:06.288
That's because unfairness
triggers us so strongly

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:07.820
that we can't think straight.

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:10.469
We become afraid and suspicious.

00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:13.938
Our unfairness antennae stick up.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.438
We feel pain, and we walk away.

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.290
Unfairness is one of the defining
issues of our society,

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:25.450
it's one of the root causes
of polarization,

00:01:25.474 --> 00:01:27.137
and it's bad news for business.

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:32.589
At work, unfairness makes people
defensive and disengaged.
