00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:01.629
These are tough questions.

00:12:03.241 --> 00:12:07.122
But if we take the time to ask ourselves

00:12:07.146 --> 00:12:11.248
whether the rational answer
is the right one ...

00:12:12.529 --> 00:12:15.386
we all know deep inside
what the answer is.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.021
We've known since we were babies.

00:12:18.975 --> 00:12:21.315
And to know what the right answer is

00:12:21.339 --> 00:12:23.227
is pretty cool for decision-making.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.847
And if we turn on our hearts,

00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:30.514
that's the key to getting
the real best out of people,
