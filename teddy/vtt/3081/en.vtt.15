00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:32.221
has six-month old babies

00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:36.054
watching a ball
trying to struggle up a hill.

00:07:36.943 --> 00:07:40.970
And there's a helpful, friendly square
that pushes the ball up the hill,

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:44.239
and then a mean triangle
pushes the ball back down.

00:07:45.042 --> 00:07:47.424
After watching this several times,

00:07:47.448 --> 00:07:49.518
they ask the babies to pick,

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:50.884
to choose what to play with.

00:07:50.908 --> 00:07:54.201
They can pick a ball,
a square or a triangle.

00:07:55.265 --> 00:07:57.456
They never pick up the triangle.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.344
All the babies want to be the square.
