00:02:58.082 --> 00:03:00.201
areas in which they beat the competition

00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:02.646
in very tough, competitive sectors.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.384
This was true in trading,

00:03:04.408 --> 00:03:06.527
in project management --

00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:08.400
it was very true in exploration.

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:12.195
Our exploration team
was finding more oil and gas

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.098
than any other company in the world.

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:16.028
It was a phenomenon.

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:19.537
Everyone was trying
to figure out how this was possible.

00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:21.778
I thought it was luck,

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:25.651
but after each new discovery,
that became less and less likely.

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:29.500
So did we have a special tool? No.
