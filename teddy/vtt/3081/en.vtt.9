00:04:29.715 --> 00:04:32.688
And for me, this is
the definition of fairness.

00:04:32.712 --> 00:04:36.513
It's when you can lower those
unfairness antennae, put them at rest.

00:04:36.537 --> 00:04:37.968
Then great things follow.

00:04:38.376 --> 00:04:42.097
These guys could be true to their purpose,
which was finding oil and gas.

00:04:42.645 --> 00:04:46.248
They didn't have to worry
about company politics or greed or fear.

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:50.339
They could be good risk-takers,

00:04:50.363 --> 00:04:52.862
because they weren't too defensive

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:55.592
and they weren't gambling
to take huge rewards.

00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:59.059
And they were excellent team workers.

00:04:59.528 --> 00:05:01.149
They could trust their colleagues.
