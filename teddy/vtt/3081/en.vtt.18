00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.130
not being invited to the friend's wedding,

00:09:01.154 --> 00:09:04.147
my lizard brain is generating
the same response

00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:07.019
as if I'm about to be pushed out
from my community.

00:09:08.763 --> 00:09:13.065
So science explains quite nicely
why fairness is good

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:15.462
and why unfairness
makes us really defensive,

00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:19.001
but science also shows
that in a fair environment,

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:22.100
not only do we all want to be the square,

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:24.209
but we tend to be the square,

00:09:24.233 --> 00:09:27.734
and this allows other people
to be fair in turn.

00:09:27.758 --> 00:09:30.264
This creates a beautiful fairness circle.
