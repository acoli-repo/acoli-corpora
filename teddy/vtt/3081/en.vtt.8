00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:02.047
but he was so relaxed.

00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:04.891
I mean, these guys
knew what they were doing.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.338
And then it hit me: it was about fairness.

00:04:09.502 --> 00:04:11.217
These guys were working in a company

00:04:11.241 --> 00:04:14.036
where they didn't need to worry
about short-term results.

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:19.063
They weren't going to be penalized
for bad luck or for an honest mistake.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.762
They knew they were valued
for what they were trying to do,

00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:24.032
not the outcome.

00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:27.056
They were valued as human beings.
They were part of a community.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.691
Whatever happened,
the company would stand by them.

00:04:29.715 --> 00:04:32.688
And for me, this is
the definition of fairness.
