00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:32.589
At work, unfairness makes people
defensive and disengaged.

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:40.380
A study shows that 70 percent
of workers in the US are disengaged,

00:01:40.404 --> 00:01:42.016
and this is costing the companies

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.552
550 billion dollars a year every year.

00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:50.917
This is, like, half the total
spent on education in the US.

00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:54.041
This is the size of the GDP
of a country like Austria.

00:01:56.255 --> 00:01:59.582
So removing unfairness
and promoting fairness

00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:00.811
should be our priority.
