00:09:54.687 --> 00:10:00.235
I worry about this a lot because I lead
a team of 3,000 excellent people,

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:04.529
and the difference between
3,000 happy, motivated team workers

00:10:04.553 --> 00:10:07.536
and 3,000 clock-watchers is everything.

00:10:09.154 --> 00:10:14.507
So the first thing I try to do
in my fairness crusade

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.877
is to try to take myself
out of the equation.

00:10:17.901 --> 00:10:19.997
That means being aware of my own biases.

00:10:20.021 --> 00:10:22.671
For example, I really like
people who say yes

00:10:22.695 --> 00:10:23.933
to whatever I suggest.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.302
(Laughter)

00:10:25.326 --> 00:10:27.354
But that's not very good for the company

00:10:27.378 --> 00:10:29.856
and not very good
for anyone who has different ideas.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.120
So we try to actively promote
a culture of diversity of opinions
