00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:32.449
and when unfairness triggers a threat,
that's all we can think about.

00:08:32.473 --> 00:08:35.497
Motivation, creativity, teamwork,

00:08:35.521 --> 00:08:37.044

And it makes sense
that we're wired this way,

00:08:40.326 --> 00:08:41.841
because we're social animals.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.484
We need to be part
of a community to survive.

00:08:46.134 --> 00:08:48.222

00:08:53.746 --> 00:08:55.635
We need to be in that community.

00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:58.236
So whether I like it or not,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.130
not being invited to the friend's wedding,
