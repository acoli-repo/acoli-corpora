00:05:58.451 --> 00:06:03.325
Or the other guy, who asked me
for a budget to build a cheese factory

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.931
next to our plant in Ecuador,
in the village.

00:06:06.955 --> 00:06:09.813
It didn't make any sense:
no one ever built a cheese factory.

00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:13.399
But this is what the village wanted,
because the milk they had would spoil

00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:16.018
before they could sell it,
so that's what they needed.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.646
And so we built it.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.654
So in these examples and many others,

00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:22.654
I learned that to be fair,

00:06:22.678 --> 00:06:26.259
my colleagues and I, we needed
to take a risk and stick our head out,

00:06:26.283 --> 00:06:28.162
but in a fair system, you can do that.

00:06:28.186 --> 00:06:29.397
You can dare to be fair.
