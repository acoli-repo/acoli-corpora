00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:32.960
has underpinned all memory research since.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.152
H.M. died at the age of 82 after
a mostly peaceful life in a nursing home.

00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:42.556
Over the years, he had been examined
by more than 100 neuroscientists,

00:04:42.556 --> 00:04:45.750
making his the most 
studied mind in history.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.915
Upon his death, his brain was
preserved and scanned

00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:52.356
before being cut into over 2000
individual slices

00:04:52.356 --> 00:04:57.624
and photographed to form a digital map
down to the level of individual neurons,

00:04:57.624 --> 00:05:02.017
all in a live broadcast
watched by 400,000 people.
