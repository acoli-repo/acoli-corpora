00:03:57.685 --> 00:04:01.151
even though he had no memory
of previous attempts.

00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:06.644
His unconscious motor centers remembered
what the conscious mind had forgotten.

00:04:06.644 --> 00:04:11.690
What Milner had discovered was that the
declarative memory of names, dates and facts

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.256
is different from the procedural memory
of riding a bicycle or signing your name.

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.500
And we now know that procedural memory

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.852
relies more on the basal ganglia 
and cerebellum,

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:26.117
structures that were intact in H.M.'s brain.

00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:29.556
This distinction between "knowing that"
and "knowing how"

00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:32.960
has underpinned all memory research since.
