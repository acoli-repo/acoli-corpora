00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:04.834
After immediate sensory data is temporarily
transcribed by neurons in the cortex,

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.742
it travels to the hippocampus,

00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:12.066
where special proteins work to strengthen 
the cortical synaptic connections.

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:13.749
If the experience was strong enough,

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.682
or we recall it periodically
in the first few days,

00:03:16.682 --> 00:03:22.147
the hippocampus then transfers the memory
back to the cortex for permanent storage.

00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:25.371
H.M.'s mind could form
the initial impressions,

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:29.325
but without a hippocampus
to perform this memory consolidation,

00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:33.361
they eroded, 
like messages scrawled in sand.
