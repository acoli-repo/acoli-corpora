00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:31.123
he managed to remember it 
for fifteen minutes

00:02:31.123 --> 00:02:33.474
by repeating it to himself constantly.

00:02:33.474 --> 00:02:38.064
But only five minutes later,
he forgot the test had even taken place.

00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:41.812
Neuroscientists had though of memory
as monolithic,

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:45.800
all of it essentially the same
and stored throughout the brain.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.868
Milner's results were not only the first
clue for the now familiar distinction

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:52.536
between short-term and long-term memory,

00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:56.125
but show that each uses 
different brain regions.

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:59.369
We now know that memory formation
involves several steps.

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:04.834
After immediate sensory data is temporarily
transcribed by neurons in the cortex,
