they eroded, 
like messages scrawled in sand.

00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:36.565
But this was not the 
only memory distinction Milner found.

00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:41.194
In a now famous experiment,
she asked H.M. to trace a third star

00:03:41.194 --> 00:03:45.753
in the narrow space between 
the outlines of two concentric ones

00:03:45.753 --> 00:03:49.373
while he could only see
his paper and pencil through a mirror.

00:03:49.373 --> 00:03:52.490
Like anyone else performing such 
an awkward task for the first time,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.297
he did horribly.

00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:57.685
But surprisingly, he improved over 
repeated trials,

00:03:57.685 --> 00:04:01.151
even though he had no memory
of previous attempts.
