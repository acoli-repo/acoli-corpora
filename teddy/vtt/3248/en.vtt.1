00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:30.511
that I had a great upbringing
here at Kakuma.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.499
But I was happy,

00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:34.989
I was smart, I had friends

00:00:35.013 --> 00:00:37.908
and above all, I had hope
for a brighter future.

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.921
That's not to say that we didn't
have our obstacles.

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:43.576
I mean, boy were there struggles.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.090
I would sometimes get sick with malaria

00:00:46.114 --> 00:00:49.572
and didn't always know
where our next meal would come from.

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:53.022
But the sense of community
that is here in Kakuma

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:55.491
and the pride that everyone here possesses

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:57.474
is simply unparalleled.

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:02.771
When I was younger,
I remember conflicts breaking out.
