00:02:58.182 --> 00:03:00.417
Back here, we all played together.

00:03:01.024 --> 00:03:02.595
Gender didn't matter,

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.764
and race most certainly never mattered.

00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:07.405
I remember asking myself,

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:09.341
"Why don't they understand Swahili?

00:03:09.653 --> 00:03:12.592
Swahili is the language
that brings people together."

00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:15.787
To make matters worse,

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:19.513
the school I was enrolled in
didn't have an English immersion program.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.225
So everyday I would get up,

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:24.344
go to school, sit in my desk

00:03:24.368 --> 00:03:25.585
and never learn a thing.

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.770
This is when I started losing hope,

00:03:28.794 --> 00:03:31.876
and I wanted nothing more
than return to Kakuma,
