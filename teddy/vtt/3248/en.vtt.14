(Applause and cheering)

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.503
I was given the distinct pleasure
of partnering up with UNICEF,

00:07:10.527 --> 00:07:14.150
knowing firsthand the work
that they do for children in need.

00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:16.946
And I want you to remember

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.976
that although the children
here may be refugees,

00:07:21.016 --> 00:07:22.913
they are children.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.325
They deserve every opportunity
to flourish, to hope, to dream --

00:07:29.114 --> 00:07:30.742
to be successful.
