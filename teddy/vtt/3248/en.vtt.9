00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:33.670
Specifically, when I started
wearing the head scarf known as a hijab.

00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:37.318
When I first started
wearing it, I was excited.

00:04:37.342 --> 00:04:42.031
I remember admiring my mother's,
and I wanted to emulate her beauty.

00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:44.292
But when I started middle school,

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:47.092
the students teased me
about not having hair,

00:04:47.116 --> 00:04:48.726
so to prove them wrong,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.193
I started showing them my hair --

00:04:51.217 --> 00:04:55.321
something that goes against my beliefs,
but something I felt pressured to do.

00:04:55.943 --> 00:04:58.307
I wanted so badly to fit in at the time.
