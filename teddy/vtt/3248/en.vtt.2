When I was younger,
I remember conflicts breaking out.

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:06.414
That tends to happen when people
come from different backgrounds

00:01:06.438 --> 00:01:08.302
and don't speak the same language.

00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:09.607
Eventually, Swahili --

00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:10.870
the main language here --

00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:12.096
became our common ground.

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:14.795
I made friends with the kids at the camp

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.502
and even started embracing
some of their cultures,

00:01:17.526 --> 00:01:21.172
celebrating holidays like Christmas
even though I was raised Muslim.

00:01:21.772 --> 00:01:24.462
The other kids would embrace
my culture as well,

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:26.911
sometimes even praying right alongside me.

00:01:27.943 --> 00:01:30.661
It was easy, as children,
to come together,
