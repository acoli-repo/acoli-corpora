00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.259
It was at this moment that I decided
to step outside of my comfort zone

00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:33.437
and compete in a pageant
wearing a hijab and burkini.

00:05:34.422 --> 00:05:37.519
I saw it as an opportunity
to be a voice for women

00:05:37.543 --> 00:05:40.075
who, like myself,
had felt underrepresented.

00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:43.824
And although I didn't capture the crown,

00:05:43.848 --> 00:05:46.299
that experience opened
so many doors for me.

00:05:46.952 --> 00:05:50.943
I was receiving emails and messages
from women all over the world,

00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:55.158
telling me that I've inspired them
by simply staying true to myself.

00:05:56.107 --> 00:05:58.053
The other "firsts" kept coming.

00:05:58.763 --> 00:06:03.504
I was invited to New York City
by fashion icon Carine Roitfeld
