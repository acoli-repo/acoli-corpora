It was easy, as children,
to come together,

00:01:30.685 --> 00:01:32.137
blend all of our beliefs

00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:35.616
to form our own unique,
multicultural environment.

00:01:37.258 --> 00:01:38.976
My name is Halima Aden

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.680
and I'm a black, Muslim,
Somali-American from Kenya.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.988
(Applause)

00:01:47.012 --> 00:01:49.279
Some have called me a trailblazer --

00:01:49.303 --> 00:01:52.322
I was the first Muslim
homecoming queen at my high school,

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:55.109
the first Somali student
senator at my college

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.940
and the first hijab-wearing
woman in many places,

00:01:57.964 --> 00:02:00.935
like the Miss Minnesota USA
beauty pageant,
