00:02:30.472 --> 00:02:32.092
But it hasn't always been easy.

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:36.535
When we first arrived to the United States
and made St. Louis, Missouri home,

00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:41.427
I remember asking my mom,
"Is this really America?"

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:45.068
There were things
that were sadly familiar,

00:02:45.092 --> 00:02:46.614
like hearing gunshots at night

00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:48.466
and the streets looking impoverished.

00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:52.164
But there were things
that were also very different.

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:53.876
Like when I started first grade,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.008
I noticed how the kids played in groups.

00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:58.158
In America, we call them "cliques."

00:02:58.182 --> 00:03:00.417
Back here, we all played together.
