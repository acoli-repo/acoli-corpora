00:03:28.794 --> 00:03:31.876
and I wanted nothing more
than return to Kakuma,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.056
a refugee camp.

00:03:35.838 --> 00:03:38.747
Soon, my mother learned
that many Somalis found refuge

00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:40.713
in a small town in Minnesota.

00:03:41.113 --> 00:03:43.883
So when I was eight,
we moved to Minnesota.

00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:49.440
My life changed as I met
other students who spoke Somali,

00:03:49.464 --> 00:03:52.719
attended a school that had
an English immersion program

00:03:52.743 --> 00:03:55.482
and found teachers that would go
above and beyond,

00:03:55.506 --> 00:03:58.156
staying there after school hours
and lunch breaks,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.306
dedicated to helping me
find success in the classroom.
