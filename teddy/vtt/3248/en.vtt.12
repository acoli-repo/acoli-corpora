00:05:58.763 --> 00:06:03.504
I was invited to New York City
by fashion icon Carine Roitfeld

00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:05.751
to shoot my very first editorial.

00:06:06.212 --> 00:06:09.776
It was around this time that I became
the first hijab-wearing model,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.344
and in my first year,

00:06:11.368 --> 00:06:14.646
I graced the covers
of nine fashion magazines.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.967
It was a whirlwind, to say the least.

00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:20.360
But with all the overnight success,

00:06:20.384 --> 00:06:23.304
there was one thing
that remained constant --

00:06:23.328 --> 00:06:27.115
the thought that this could be
what brings me back here to Kakuma,

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:28.773
the place that I call home.
