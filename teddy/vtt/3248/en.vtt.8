00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.306
dedicated to helping me
find success in the classroom.

00:04:02.427 --> 00:04:07.332
Being a child refugee has taught me
that one could be stripped of everything:

00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:10.300
food, shelter, clean drinking water,

00:04:10.324 --> 00:04:11.913
even friendship,

00:04:11.937 --> 00:04:15.016
but the one thing that no one
could ever take away from you

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.371
is your education.

00:04:16.778 --> 00:04:19.533
So I made studying my top priority

00:04:19.557 --> 00:04:22.105
and soon started flourishing
within the classroom.

00:04:24.154 --> 00:04:27.381
As I grew older,
I became more aware of others

00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:29.812
and how they viewed
my race and background.
