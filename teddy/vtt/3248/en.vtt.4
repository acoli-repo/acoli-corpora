00:01:57.964 --> 00:02:00.935
like the Miss Minnesota USA
beauty pageant,

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.018
the runways of Milan
and New York Fashion Weeks

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:07.080
and even on the historic cover
of British "Vogue."

00:02:07.778 --> 00:02:08.928
As you can see,

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.849
I'm not afraid to be the first,
to step out on my own,

00:02:12.873 --> 00:02:14.469
to take risks and seek change,

00:02:14.493 --> 00:02:16.994
because that's what being
a minority is about.

00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:19.939
It's about using yourself
as a vessel to create change

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:24.476
and being a human representation
for the power of diversity.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.532
And now I use my platform to spread
an important message of acceptance.
