00:00:01.592 --> 00:00:03.809
This is me at age seven.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.537
And this is also me.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.821
(Applause and cheering)

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:17.191
To be standing here in Kakuma
refugee camp feels so surreal,

00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:19.676
and I'm overcome with so much emotion.

00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:22.258
These very grounds are where I was born

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:24.459
and spent the first
seven years of my life.

00:00:25.878 --> 00:00:27.958
I think many people are surprised to hear

00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:30.511
that I had a great upbringing
here at Kakuma.
