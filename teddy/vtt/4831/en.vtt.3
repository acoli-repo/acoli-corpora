Some recent studies in mice suggest
that the repetition of a physical motion

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:36.013
increases the layers of myelin sheath
that insulates the axons.

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:40.453
And the more layers, the greater
the insulation around the axon chains,

00:01:40.453 --> 00:01:43.313
forming a sort of superhighway
for information

00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:46.163
connecting your brain to your muscles.

00:01:46.163 --> 00:01:48.112
So while many athletes and performers

00:01:48.112 --> 00:01:50.893
attribute their successes 
to muscle memory,

00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:54.003
muscles themselves 
don't really have memory.

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:57.263
Rather, it may be the myelination
of neural pathways

00:01:57.263 --> 00:02:00.215
that gives these athletes 
and performers their edge
