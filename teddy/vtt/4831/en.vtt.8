00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:03.577
Group A physically practiced 
one-handed free throws

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.977
while Group B only 
mentally practiced them.

00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:09.816
When they were tested at the end
of the two week experiment,

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:13.247
the intermediate and experienced
players in both groups

00:04:13.247 --> 00:04:16.977
had improved by nearly the same amount.

00:04:16.977 --> 00:04:20.287
As scientists get closer to unraveling
the secrets of our brains,

00:04:20.287 --> 00:04:24.458
our understanding of effective practice
will only improve.

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:27.788
In the meantime, effective practice
is the best way we have

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:29.698
of pushing our individual limits,

00:04:29.698 --> 00:04:31.199
achieving new heights,
