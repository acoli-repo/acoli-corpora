00:01:57.263 --> 00:02:00.215
that gives these athletes 
and performers their edge

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:04.743
with faster and more efficient 
neural pathways.

00:02:04.743 --> 00:02:06.593
There are many theories that attempt

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:10.715
to quantify the number of hours,
days, and even years of practice

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:13.318
that it takes to master a skill.

00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:15.747
While we don't yet have a magic number,

00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:20.368
we do know that mastery isn't simply about
the amount of hours of practice.

00:02:20.368 --> 00:02:24.268
It's also the quality and effectiveness
of that practice.

00:02:24.268 --> 00:02:26.083
Effective practice is consistent,

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:27.596
intensely focused,

00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:29.947
and targets content or weaknesses

00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:34.153
that lie at the edge 
of one's current abilities.
