00:02:55.364 --> 00:03:00.275
those students were able to stay 
on task for only six minutes at a time.

00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:03.155
Laptops, smartphones, 
and particularly Facebook

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.655
were the root of most distractions.

00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:07.855
Start out slowly or in slow-motion.

00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:12.865
Coordination is built with repetitions,
whether correct or incorrect.

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:16.465
If you gradually increase the speed
of the quality repetitons,

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:18.985
you have a better chance 
of doing them correctly.

00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:23.796
Next, frequent repetitions with allotted
breaks are common practice habits

00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:26.186
of elite performers.

00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:29.606
Studies have shown that many top athletes,
musicians, and dancers

00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:34.816
spend 50-60 hours per week on activities
related to their craft.
