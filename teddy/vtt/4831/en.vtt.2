00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:04.113
So how does practice or repetition
affect the inner workings of our brains?

00:01:04.113 --> 00:01:06.262
The axons that exist in the white matter

00:01:06.262 --> 00:01:09.262
are wrapped with a fatty substance
called myelin.

00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:14.721
And it's this myelin covering, or sheath,
that seems to change with practice.

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:18.422
Myelin is similar to insulation
on electrical cables.

00:01:18.422 --> 00:01:22.612
It prevents energy loss from electrical
signals that the brain uses,

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:26.243
moving them more efficiently
along neural pathways.

00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:30.653
Some recent studies in mice suggest
that the repetition of a physical motion
