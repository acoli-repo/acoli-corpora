00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.550
Our brains have two kinds 
of neural tissue:

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.443
grey matter

00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:35.070
and white matter.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.881
The grey matter processes information
in the brain,

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:41.671
directing signals and sensory stimuli
to nerve cells,

00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:46.701
while white matter is mostly made up
of fatty tissue and nerve fibers.

00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:48.650
In order for our bodies to move,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.551
information needs to travel from
the brain's grey matter,

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.948
down the spinal cord,

00:00:52.948 --> 00:00:56.191
through a chain of nerve fibers
called axons

00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:58.193
to our muscles.

00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:04.113
So how does practice or repetition
affect the inner workings of our brains?
