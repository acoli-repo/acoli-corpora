You probably don't think about it,

00:00:03.197 --> 00:00:05.430
but every day nature
is trying to kill you.

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:09.097
We as humans place constant pressure
on our natural world.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.630
And in response, nature fights back
to balance the scales.

00:00:12.663 --> 00:00:16.597
Nature has been adapting and reacting to
the presence of human developments,

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.697
just like we've been adapting
and reacting to nature.

00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:23.463
And nature is telling us
we are on an unsustainable path.

00:00:23.497 --> 00:00:25.763
It is time to course correct.

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:28.897
This does not mean abandoning technology,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.297
but it means harnessing
the power of biology itself
