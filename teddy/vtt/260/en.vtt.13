Approved methods weren’t working,
so they bent and broke rules

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.726
to get hands-on practice with experts.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.351
In my setting, residents got involved
in robotic surgery in medical school

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:42.958
at the expense
of their generalist education.

00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:50.268
And they spent hundreds of extra hours
with simulators and recordings of surgery,

00:06:50.292 --> 00:06:52.833
when you were supposed to learn in the OR.

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:56.851
And maybe most importantly,
they found ways to struggle

00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:00.625
in live procedures
with limited expert supervision.
