watching an expert for a bit,

00:01:31.542 --> 00:01:34.684
getting involved in easy,
safe parts of the work

00:01:34.708 --> 00:01:36.893
and progressing to riskier
and harder tasks

00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:39.250
as they guide and decide she’s ready.

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:42.934
My whole life I’ve been fascinated
by this kind of learning.

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.625
It feels elemental,
part of what makes us human.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.167
It has different names: apprenticeship,
coaching, mentorship, on the job training.

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:56.833
In surgery, it’s called
“see one, do one, teach one.”

00:01:57.625 --> 00:01:58.969
But the process is the same,

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:03.167
and it’s been the main path to skill
around the globe for thousands of years.
