00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:03.167
and it’s been the main path to skill
around the globe for thousands of years.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:08.833
Right now, we’re handling AI
in a way that blocks that path.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:12.315
We’re sacrificing learning
in our quest for productivity.

00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:16.101
I found this first in surgery
while I was at MIT,

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:18.601
but now I’ve got evidence
it’s happening all over,

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:22.500
in very different industries
and with very different kinds of AI.

00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:28.934
If we do nothing, millions of us
are going to hit a brick wall

00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.375
as we try to learn to deal with AI.
