To find out, I’ve connected with a small
but growing group of young researchers

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:37.976
who’ve done boots-on-the-ground studies
of work involving AI

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.976
in very diverse settings
like start-ups, policing,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.601
investment banking and online education.

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:49.476
Like me, they spent at least a year
and many hundreds of hours observing,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.417
interviewing and often working
side-by-side with the people they studied.

00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:56.875
We shared data, and I looked for patterns.

00:04:57.917 --> 00:05:03.125
No matter the industry, the work,
the AI, the story was the same.
