doing traditional and robotic surgery,
interviewing them

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:03.463
and in general hanging out
with the residents as they tried to learn.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.601
I covered 18 of the top
US teaching hospitals,

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:09.083
and the story was the same.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.417
Most residents were in Kristen's shoes.

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.750
They got to “see one” plenty,

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:17.875
but the “do one” was barely available.

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:20.861
So they couldn’t struggle,
and they weren’t learning.

00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:25.101
This was important news for surgeons, but
I needed to know how widespread it was:

00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:28.958
Where else was using AI
blocking learning on the job?
