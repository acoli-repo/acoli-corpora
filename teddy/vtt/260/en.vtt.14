00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:00.625
in live procedures
with limited expert supervision.

00:07:01.792 --> 00:07:06.101
I call all this “shadow learning,”
because it bends the rules

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:08.125
and learner’s do it out of the limelight.

00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:13.643
And everyone turns a blind eye
because it gets results.

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.833
Remember, these are
the star pupils of the bunch.

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:21.000
Now, obviously, this is not OK,
and it’s not sustainable.

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:23.893
No one should have to risk getting fired

00:07:23.917 --> 00:07:26.067
to learn the skills
they need to do their job.

00:07:26.792 --> 00:07:28.848
But we do need to learn from these people.

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:32.167
They took serious risks to learn.
