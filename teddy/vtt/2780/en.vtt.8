00:03:58.987 --> 00:04:01.387
we needed to examine the whole body,

00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:04.498
and then we needed to drill down
all the way from the organs,

00:04:04.522 --> 00:04:05.855
into the tissues,

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.381
all the way to single cells,

00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:09.742
so that we could properly
make a diagnosis.

00:04:10.762 --> 00:04:13.593
So with our marching orders
from the President himself,

00:04:13.617 --> 00:04:16.730
we embarked on the purest
of the scientific method:

00:04:16.754 --> 00:04:17.929
collecting data --

00:04:17.953 --> 00:04:20.040
all the data we could get our hands on --

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:21.321
making hypotheses,

00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:22.582
creating solutions,

00:04:22.606 --> 00:04:23.798
one after the other.

00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:28.880
So we met with hundreds of individuals
who worked at government agencies,

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:32.840
from the tax agency, the lands
office, utilities company,
