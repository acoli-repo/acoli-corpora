00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:33.114
slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness,

00:06:33.138 --> 00:06:35.455
waiting to grease the palms
of their friends.

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.125
What we found was an overwhelming
sense of helplessness.

00:06:41.684 --> 00:06:42.946
Our government was sick,

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.494
because government
employees felt helpless.

00:06:46.993 --> 00:06:50.076
They felt that they were not
empowered to drive change.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.236
And when people feel stuck and helpless,

00:06:54.968 --> 00:06:57.463
they stop seeing their role
in a bigger system.

00:06:58.265 --> 00:07:02.734
They start to think the work they do
doesn't matter in driving change.
