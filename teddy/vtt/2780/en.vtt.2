That patient was my government.

00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:03.276
(Laughter)

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:07.704
See, many of us will agree that lots
of governments are unhealthy today.

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:10.959
(Laughter)

00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:15.617
(Applause)

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:18.556
And Kenya was no exception.

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:21.478
When I returned to Kenya in 2014,

00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:24.206
there was 17 percent youth unemployment.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.133
And Nairobi, the major business hub,

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:31.232
was rated 177th on the quality
of living index.
