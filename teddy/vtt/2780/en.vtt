00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:02.866
Growing up in Kenya,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.441
I knew I always wanted
to study biochemistry.

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:12.619
See, I had seen the impact of the high
prevalence of diseases like malaria,

00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:15.336
and I wanted to make medicines
that would cure the sick.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.150
So I worked really hard,

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:20.961
got a scholarship to the United States,
where I became a cancer researcher,

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:22.214
and I loved it.

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:24.699
For someone who wants to cure diseases,

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:26.434
there is no higher calling.

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.673
Ten years later, I returned
to Kenya to do just that.
