00:06:58.265 --> 00:07:02.734
They start to think the work they do
doesn't matter in driving change.

00:07:02.758 --> 00:07:04.564
And when that happens,

00:07:04.588 --> 00:07:06.181
things slow down,

00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:07.625
fall through the cracks

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:09.415
and inefficiencies flourish.

00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:12.936
Now imagine with me,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.898
if you had a process
you had to go through --

00:07:16.922 --> 00:07:18.692
had no other alternative --

00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:21.763
and this process was inefficient, complex

00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:23.851
and very, very slow.

00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:25.099
What would you do?

00:07:26.482 --> 00:07:29.810
I think you might start by trying
to find somebody to outsource it to,

00:07:29.834 --> 00:07:32.179
so that they can just
take care of that for you.
