00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.673
Ten years later, I returned
to Kenya to do just that.

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:33.162
A freshly minted PhD,

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:35.387
ready to take on this horrific illness,

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:38.322
which in Kenya was almost
certainly a death sentence.

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.552
But instead of landing a job
in a pharmaceutical company

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.465
or a hospital,

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.861
I found myself drawn
to a different kind of lab,

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.742
working with a different
kind of patient --

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.120
a patient whose illness was so serious

00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:55.029
it impacted every single
person in my country;

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:57.958
a patient who needed to get healthy fast.

00:00:58.328 --> 00:01:00.731
That patient was my government.
