00:07:59.376 --> 00:08:00.746
and before you know it,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.335
the whole body is sick.

00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:05.889
Knowing this,

00:08:05.913 --> 00:08:07.468
we had to start by making sure

00:08:07.492 --> 00:08:12.069
that every single stakeholder
we worked with had a shared vision

00:08:12.093 --> 00:08:13.522
for what we wanted to do.

00:08:14.192 --> 00:08:16.226
So we met with everyone,

00:08:16.656 --> 00:08:19.215
from the clerk whose sole job
is to remove staples

00:08:19.239 --> 00:08:20.788
from application packets,

00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:24.431
to the legal drafters
at the attorney general's office,

00:08:25.187 --> 00:08:28.184
to the clerks who are responsible
for serving business owners

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:30.640
when they came to access
government services.
