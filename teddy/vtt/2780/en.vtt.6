00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.220
the World Bank has a ranking called
the "Ease of Doing Business Ranking,"

00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:04.281
which measures how easy
or difficult it is to start a business

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:05.902
in any given country.

00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:07.545
And as you can imagine,

00:03:08.404 --> 00:03:12.025
starting or running a business
in a country with an ailing government --

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.498
almost impossible.

00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:18.156
The President of Kenya knew this,
which is why in 2014,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.549
he came to our lab and asked
us to partner with him

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:24.843
to be able to help Kenya
to jump-start business growth.

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.411
He set an ambitious goal:

00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:32.700
he wanted Kenya to be ranked top 50
in this World Bank ranking.
