00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:33.326
Previous research has shown that people 
with naturally high levels

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:37.486
of healthy cholesterol have lower 
rates of heart disease.

00:01:37.486 --> 00:01:39.991
So what makes this headline misleading:

00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:44.311
"Healthium reduces risk of heart disease."

00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:48.791
The problem with this headline is that the
research didn’t actually investigate

00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:51.561
whether Healthium reduces heart disease.

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.651
It only measured Healthium’s impact

00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:56.791
on levels of a particular 
kind of cholesterol.

00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:59.931
The fact that people with naturally high
levels of that cholesterol

00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:01.951
have lower risk of heart attacks
