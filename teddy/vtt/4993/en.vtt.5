By the end of the study, the chocolate 
eaters are less stressed

than their chocolate-free counterparts.

00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:37.301
What’s wrong with this headline:

00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:41.371
"Eating chocolate reduces 
stress in students"

00:02:43.408 --> 00:02:48.638
It’s a stretch to draw a conclusion about 
students in general from a sample of ten.

00:02:48.638 --> 00:02:52.024
That’s because the fewer participants are
in a random sample,

00:02:52.024 --> 00:02:54.884
the less likely it is that the sample will
closely represent

00:02:54.884 --> 00:02:57.934
the target population as a whole.

00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:02.734
For example, if the broader population of 
students is half male and half female,
