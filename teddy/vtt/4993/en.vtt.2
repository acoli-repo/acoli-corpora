00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:02.827
A real study would detail many more 
factors and how it accounted for them,

00:01:02.827 --> 00:01:04.837
but for the purposes of this exercise,

00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:08.837
assume all the information 
you need is included.

00:01:11.048 --> 00:01:14.098
Let’s start by considering the 
cardiovascular effects

00:01:14.098 --> 00:01:17.068
of a certain vitamin, Healthium.

00:01:17.068 --> 00:01:19.868
The study finds that participants taking
Healthium

00:01:19.868 --> 00:01:24.078
had a higher level of healthy cholesterol 
than those taking a placebo.

00:01:24.078 --> 00:01:28.036
Their levels became similar to those of 
people with naturally high levels

00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:29.936
of this kind of cholesterol.

00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:33.326
Previous research has shown that people 
with naturally high levels
