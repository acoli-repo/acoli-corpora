00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:02.734
For example, if the broader population of 
students is half male and half female,

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:04.784
the chance of drawing a sample of 10

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:10.144
that’s skewed 70% male and 
30% is about 12%.

00:03:10.144 --> 00:03:15.693
In a sample of 100 that would be less than
a .0025% chance,

00:03:15.693 --> 00:03:17.525
and for a sample of 1000,

00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:22.795
the odds are less than 6 x 10^-36.

00:03:22.795 --> 00:03:25.137
Similarly, with fewer participants,

00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:29.340
each individual’s outcome has a larger 
impact on the overall results—

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.550
and can therefore skew big-picture trends.
