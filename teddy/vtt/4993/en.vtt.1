00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:31.537
attention-grabbing headlines 
and the often specific,

00:00:31.537 --> 00:00:34.977
incremental results of the medical 
research they cover.

00:00:34.977 --> 00:00:39.357
So how can you avoid being 
misled by grabby headlines?

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:42.467
The best way to assess a headline’s 
credibility

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:45.807
is to look at the original 
research it reports on.

00:00:45.807 --> 00:00:48.217
We’ve come up with a hypothetical research
scenario

00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:50.507
for each of these three headlines.

00:00:50.507 --> 00:00:53.357
Keep watching for the explanation
of the first example;

00:00:53.357 --> 00:00:56.447
then pause at the headline to 
answer the question.

00:00:56.447 --> 00:00:58.517
These are simplified scenarios.

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:02.827
A real study would detail many more 
factors and how it accounted for them,
