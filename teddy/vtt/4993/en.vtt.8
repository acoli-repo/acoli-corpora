00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:03.099
but if it’s based on many studies 
that have found similar results,

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.699
it’s more credible.

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.919
We’ve still got one more puzzle.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:11.899
In this scenario, a study tests a new drug
for a rare, fatal disease.

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:14.156
In a sample of 2,000 patients,

00:04:14.156 --> 00:04:17.636
the ones who start taking the drug upon 
diagnosis

00:04:17.636 --> 00:04:21.052
live longer than those who 
take the placebo.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.642
This time, the question 
is slightly different.

00:04:23.642 --> 00:04:28.012
What’s one more thing you’d like to know 
before deciding if the headline,

00:04:28.012 --> 00:04:33.619
"New drug prolongs lives of patients
with rare disease", is justified?
