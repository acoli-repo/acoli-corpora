Before making this call,

00:04:36.472 --> 00:04:40.792
you’d want to know how much the drug 
prolonged the patients’ lives.

00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:43.163
Sometimes, a study can have results that,

00:04:43.163 --> 00:04:48.243
while scientifically valid, don’t have 
much bearing on real world outcomes.

00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:52.941
For example, one real-life clinical trial 
of a pancreatic cancer drug

00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:57.457
found an increase in life expectancy—
of ten days.

00:04:57.457 --> 00:05:00.277
