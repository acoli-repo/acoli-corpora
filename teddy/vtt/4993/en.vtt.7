00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.550
and can therefore skew big-picture trends.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.490
Still, there are a lot of good reasons for
scientists to run small studies.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.269
By starting with a small sample,

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.039
they can evaluate whether the results are 
promising enough

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:45.139
to run a more comprehensive, 
expensive study.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.609
And some research requires very specific
participants

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.999
that may be impossible to 
recruit in large numbers.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.329
The key is reproducibility—

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.629
if an article draws a conclusion 
from one small study,

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.649
that conclusion may be suspect—

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:03.099
but if it’s based on many studies 
that have found similar results,
