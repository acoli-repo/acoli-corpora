00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:01.951
have lower risk of heart attacks

00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:04.391
doesn’t mean that the same 
will be true of people

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:07.731
who elevate their cholesterol
levels using Healthium.

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:10.141
Now that you’ve cracked the 
case of Healthium,

00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:13.581
try your hand at a particularly alluring 
mystery:

00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:17.321
the relationship between eating chocolate
and stress.

00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:20.281
This hypothetical study 
recruits ten students.

00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:23.531
Half begin consuming a 
daily dose of chocolate,

00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:25.141
while half abstain.

00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:28.691
As classmates, they all follow 
the same schedule.

00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:32.481
By the end of the study, the chocolate 
eaters are less stressed
