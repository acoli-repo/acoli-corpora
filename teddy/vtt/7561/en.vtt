00:00:02.457 --> 00:00:06.002
So what does it mean to be a woman?

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:09.714
We all have XX chromosomes, right?

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:11.883
Actually, that's not true.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:14.635
Some women are mosaics.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:20.058
They have a mix of chromosome types
with X, with XY or with XXX.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.352
If it's not just
about our chromosomes,

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:25.646
then what is being a woman about?

00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:27.940
Being feminine?

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.400
Getting married?

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:30.651
Having kids?
