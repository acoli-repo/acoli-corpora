There are more than a trillion
galaxies in the universe.

00:00:05.976 --> 00:00:09.238
And my team discovered
an extremely rare one,

00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:14.375
a galaxy that doesn't look
quite like anything observed before.

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:17.712
This galaxy is so peculiar,

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:21.410
that it challenges our theories
and our assumptions

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:23.632
about how the universe works.

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:28.473
The majority of the galaxies are spiral,

00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:30.430
similar to our own Milky Way.
