00:00:58.974 --> 00:01:04.058
Hoag-type galaxies are among the rarest
types of galaxies currently known.

00:01:04.538 --> 00:01:08.418
There are fewer than one
in 1,000 galaxies.

00:01:10.072 --> 00:01:16.001
It's a mystery how the stars
in the outer ring are just floating there

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:18.152
in such an orderly manner.

00:01:18.898 --> 00:01:20.631
That's interesting, right?

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.255
Hold on.

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:24.946
Things are about to get more mysterious.

00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:29.042
The galaxy that my team
discovered is even rarer

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.170
and much more complex than that.
