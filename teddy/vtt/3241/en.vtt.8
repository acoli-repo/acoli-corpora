Further research into how
this extremely rare galaxy was formed

00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:06.966
can provide us with new clues
on how the universe works.

00:04:09.257 --> 00:04:13.915
This discovery tells us
that we still have a lot to learn,

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.849
and we should keep looking
deeper and deeper in space

00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:20.206
and keep searching for the unknown.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.120
Thank you.
