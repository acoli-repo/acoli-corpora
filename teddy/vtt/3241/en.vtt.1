00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:30.430
similar to our own Milky Way.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.132
We have strong theories about how
these common galaxies form and evolve.

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:42.708
But we don't understand
how rare galaxies form and evolve.

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:47.432
An especially puzzling rare case
is Hoag's Object.

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:55.006
It has a very symmetric central body
surrounded by a circular outer ring,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.926
with nothing visible connecting them.

00:00:58.974 --> 00:01:04.058
Hoag-type galaxies are among the rarest
types of galaxies currently known.
