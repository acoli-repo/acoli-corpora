00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:01.141
I model the bright central body

00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:03.649
and remove my model from the image

00:03:03.673 --> 00:03:06.022
to check for any hidden features,

00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:12.022
because a bright structure in a galaxy
may blind our views of faint features,

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:16.814
just like using sunglasses
when you are blinded by the intense light.

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:20.751
The result was a big surprise.

00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:25.042
This galaxy doesn't just
have an outer ring,

00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:28.788
it has an additional, diffused inner ring.

00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:34.354
We were having a hard time
explaining the origin of the outer ring
