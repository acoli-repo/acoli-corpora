Well, actually, this is one
of the nearby galaxies.

00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:36.069
I study this object in different light --

00:02:36.796 --> 00:02:40.290
in ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared.

00:02:41.448 --> 00:02:45.678
Small details on our body,
like a scar or wrinkles,

00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:47.321
tell the story of our lives.

00:02:47.773 --> 00:02:51.869
Similarly, a galaxy's structure
in different light

00:02:51.893 --> 00:02:55.424
can help us trace back
their origin and evolution.

00:02:55.927 --> 00:02:57.894
How do I look for these details?

00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:01.141
I model the bright central body
