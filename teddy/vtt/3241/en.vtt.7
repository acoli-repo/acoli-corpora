00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:34.354
We were having a hard time
explaining the origin of the outer ring

00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:35.915
in Hoag-type galaxies.

00:03:36.314 --> 00:03:40.266
Now we also need to explain
this mysterious second ring.

00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:44.246
There is currently no known mechanism

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.993
that can explain the existence of an inner
ring in such a peculiar galaxy.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.093
So the discovery of Burçin's Galaxy
clearly highlights the gap

00:03:54.117 --> 00:03:56.646
in our knowledge of galaxy evolution.

00:03:57.601 --> 00:04:02.339
Further research into how
this extremely rare galaxy was formed
