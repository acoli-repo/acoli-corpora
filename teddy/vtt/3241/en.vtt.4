00:01:58.427 --> 00:02:04.865
But my research showed
this is an entirely new galaxy type,

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:08.859
now commonly referred to
as "Burçin's Galaxy."

00:02:09.957 --> 00:02:11.108
(Laughs)

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:14.657
(Cheers) (Applause)

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:19.213
We will not be visiting
this galaxy anytime soon.

00:02:19.237 --> 00:02:25.677
It is approximately 359 million
light years away from Earth.

00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:28.065
You may think this is far.

00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:32.011
Well, actually, this is one
of the nearby galaxies.
