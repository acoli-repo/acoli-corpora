00:05:58.553 --> 00:06:00.922
you need to know who you're up against.

00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:04.590
You need to learn their motivations
and points of view.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.796
In the case of gun control,

00:06:06.796 --> 00:06:10.349
we really underestimated our opponents.

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.274
After a very successful
gun-collection program,

00:06:13.274 --> 00:06:14.618
we were elated.

00:06:14.618 --> 00:06:17.454
We had support from
80 percent of Brazilians,

00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:20.335
and thought that this could help us
win the referendum

00:06:20.335 --> 00:06:22.747
to ban gun sales to civilians.

00:06:22.747 --> 00:06:25.928
But we were dead wrong.

00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:29.249
During a televised 20-day public debate,

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:33.103
our opponent used
our own arguments against us.
