00:02:57.857 --> 00:03:00.295
we not only changed national legislation

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:04.033
that made it much more difficult
for civilians to buy a gun,

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:09.683
but we collected and destroyed
almost half a million weapons.

00:03:09.683 --> 00:03:14.262
This was one of the biggest
buyback programs in history --

00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:16.921
(Applause) --

00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:20.542
but we also suffered some setbacks.

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:26.324
We lost a referendum to ban
gun sales to civilians in 2005.

00:03:26.324 --> 00:03:29.597
The second initiative was also home-grown,

00:03:29.597 --> 00:03:35.147
but is today a global movement to reform
the international drug control regime.
