00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:02.993
About 12 years ago,

00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:05.245
I gave up my career in banking

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:08.356
to try to make the world a safer place.

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:12.565
This involved a journey into
national and global advocacy

00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:17.388
and meeting some of the most
extraordinary people in the world.

00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:22.566
In the process, I became
a civil society diplomat.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:26.072
Civil society diplomats do three things:

00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:28.603
They voice the concerns of the people,

00:00:28.603 --> 00:00:31.691
are not pinned down by national interests,
