00:09:55.265 --> 00:10:00.780
Amazingly, it was a local soap opera
called "Mulheres Apaixonadas" --

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.498
or "Women in Love" --

00:10:02.498 --> 00:10:06.410
that kicked off Brazil's
national gun control campaign.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.872
In one highly viewed episode,

00:10:08.872 --> 00:10:13.074
a soap opera lead actress
was killed by a stray bullet.

00:10:13.074 --> 00:10:17.370
Brazilian grannies
and housewives were outraged,

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.644
and in a case of art imitating life,

00:10:20.644 --> 00:10:25.938
this episode also included footage
of a real gun control march

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:28.422
that we had organized right here,


00:10:28.422 --> 00:10:31.255
outside in Copacabana Beach.
