00:00:56.961 --> 00:01:00.211
but here I am to share some lessons

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:05.227
about two powerful civil society 
movements that I've been involved in.

00:01:05.227 --> 00:01:09.035
They are in issues
that I'm passionate about:

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:13.214
gun control and drug policy.

00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:16.859
And these are issues that matter here.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.253
Latin America is ground zero
for both of them.

00:01:22.253 --> 00:01:24.296
For example, Brazil --

00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:30.550
this beautiful country hosting TEDGlobal
has the world's ugliest record.
