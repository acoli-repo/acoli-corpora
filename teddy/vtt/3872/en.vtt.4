Brazil is also one of the world's
largest consumers of drugs,

00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:07.066
and the War on Drugs
has been especially painful here.

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:10.339
Around 50 percent of the homicides
in the streets in Brazil

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.776
are related to the War on Drugs.

00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:19.464
The same is true for about
25 percent of people in jail.

00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:24.596
And it's not just Brazil that is affected
by the twin problems of guns and drugs.

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:31.620
Virtually every country and city across
Central and South America is in trouble.
