00:08:54.222 --> 00:09:00.538
The War on Drugs has simply failed
across every metric.

00:09:00.538 --> 00:09:03.440
Drugs are cheaper
and more available than ever,

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.227
and consumption has risen globally.

00:09:06.227 --> 00:09:08.409
But even worse,

00:09:08.409 --> 00:09:14.980
it also generated massive
negative unintended consequences.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.626
It is true that some people
have made these arguments before,

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:20.366
but we've made a difference

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:23.378
by anticipating the arguments
of our opponents

00:09:23.378 --> 00:09:25.484
and by leveraging powerful voices

00:09:25.484 --> 00:09:30.374
that a few years ago
would probably have resisted change.
