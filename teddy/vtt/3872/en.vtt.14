WEBVTT

00:06:58.458 --> 00:07:00.385
They used our national flag,

00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:02.080
our independence anthem.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.915
They invoked women's rights

00:07:03.915 --> 00:07:09.302
and misused images of Mandela,
Tiananmen Square, and even Hitler.

00:07:09.302 --> 00:07:13.272
They won by playing with people's fears.

00:07:13.272 --> 00:07:17.916
In fact, guns were almost completely
ignored in their campaign.

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:21.213
Their focus was on individual rights.

00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:22.792
But I ask you,

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:25.021
which right is more important,

00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:26.832
the right to life

00:07:26.832 --> 00:07:29.897
or the right to have a gun
that takes life away?

00:07:29.897 --> 00:07:34.150
(Applause)
