00:11:29.818 --> 00:11:34.044
Don't be afraid to bring
together odd bedfellows.

00:11:34.044 --> 00:11:36.018
What we've learned in Brazil --

00:11:36.018 --> 00:11:38.363
and this doesn't only
apply to my country --

00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:42.995
is the importance of bringing diverse
and eclectic folks together.

00:11:42.995 --> 00:11:45.131
If you want to change the world,

00:11:45.131 --> 00:11:49.427
it helps to have a good cross-section
of society on your side.

00:11:49.427 --> 00:11:52.027
In both the case of guns and drugs,

00:11:52.027 --> 00:11:55.463
we brought together
a wonderful mix of people.

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:59.667
We mobilized the elite
and got huge support from the media.

00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:04.124
We gathered the victims,
human rights champions, cultural icons.
