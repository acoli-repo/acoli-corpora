00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:01.431
Across the Americas, from the US
and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay,

00:04:01.431 --> 00:04:03.579
change is in the air.

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.381
But rather than tell you the whole story
about these two movements,

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:11.189
I just want to share with you
four key insights.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.788
I call them lessons to change the world.

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.017
There are certainly many more,

00:04:17.017 --> 00:04:20.314
but these are the ones
that stand out to me.

00:04:20.314 --> 00:04:22.496
So the first lesson is:

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:25.770
Change and control the narrative.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.604
It may seem obvious,

00:04:27.604 --> 00:04:30.646
but a key ingredient
to civil society diplomacy
