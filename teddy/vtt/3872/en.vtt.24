00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:04.124
We gathered the victims,
human rights champions, cultural icons.

00:12:04.124 --> 00:12:06.701
We also assembled
the professional classes --

00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:09.697
doctors, lawyers, academia and more.

00:12:09.697 --> 00:12:12.437
What I've learned over the last years

00:12:12.437 --> 00:12:18.337
is that you need coalitions of the willing
and of the unwilling to make change.

00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:20.204
In the case of drugs,

00:12:20.204 --> 00:12:23.791
we needed libertarians,
anti-prohibitionists, legalizers,

00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:26.136
and liberal politicians.

00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:28.597
They may not agree on everything;

00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:32.846
in fact, they disagree
on almost everything.
