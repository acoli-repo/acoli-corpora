00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:31.053
that makes the entrepreneur
a hero is "Atlas Shrugged."

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.491
Everything else in the world
looks at entrepreneurs

00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:34.786
and says we're bad people.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.018
I look at even my family.

00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:38.493
Both my grandfathers and my dad
were entrepreneurs.

00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:41.540
My brother, sister and I,
all three of us own companies as well.

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:45.131
We all decided to start these things
because it's the only place we fit.

00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:48.227
We didn't fit in normal work;
we couldn't work for somebody else,

00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:50.591
we're stubborn and we have
all these other traits.

00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:52.528
But kids could be entrepreneurs as well.

00:03:52.552 --> 00:03:54.465
I'm a big part of a couple organizations

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.161
called the Entrepreneurs' Organization
and the Young Presidents' Organization.

00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:01.630
I just came back from speaking
in Barcelona at the YPO global conference.
