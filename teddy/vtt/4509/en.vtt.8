00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:01.630
I just came back from speaking
in Barcelona at the YPO global conference.

00:04:01.654 --> 00:04:04.976
And everyone I met over there
who's an entrepreneur

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.516
struggled with school.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.119
I have 18 out of the 19 signs
of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.

00:04:10.143 --> 00:04:12.952
So this thing right here
is freaking me out.

00:04:12.976 --> 00:04:15.380
(Laughter)

00:04:15.404 --> 00:04:17.203
It's probably why I'm a bit panicked,

00:04:17.227 --> 00:04:19.631
other than all the caffeine
I've had and the sugar.

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:21.976
But this is really creepy
for an entrepreneur.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.143
Attention deficit disorder,
bipolar disorder.

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:27.167
Do you know that bipolar disorder
is nicknamed the CEO disease?

00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:29.865
Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.281
All three of the founders
of Netscape had it.
