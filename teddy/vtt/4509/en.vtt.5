00:02:29.695 --> 00:02:32.108
what if we saw the ones
with entrepreneurial traits

00:02:32.132 --> 00:02:33.868
and taught them to be entrepreneurs?

00:02:33.892 --> 00:02:35.996
We could have these kids
spreading businesses

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.049
instead of waiting
for government handouts.

00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:40.803
What we do is teach our kids
the things they shouldn't do:

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.615
don't hit; don't bite; don't swear.

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.673
Right now we teach our kids
to go after really good jobs;

00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:48.277
the school system teaches them
to go after things like

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.682
being a doctor and being a lawyer
and being an accountant and a dentist

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:52.960
and a teacher and a pilot.

00:02:52.984 --> 00:02:55.644
And the media says it's really cool
if we could go out

00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:57.167
and be a model or a singer

00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:00.126
or a sports hero like Luongo or Crosby.
