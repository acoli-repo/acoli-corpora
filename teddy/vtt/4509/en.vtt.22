00:10:59.468 --> 00:11:02.669
That doesn't make sense. Figure out
a way to make more money faster.

00:11:02.693 --> 00:11:05.604
Every week, I'd go to the corner store
and buy all these pops,

00:11:05.628 --> 00:11:08.651
Then I'd deliver them
to these 70-year-old women playing bridge.

00:11:08.675 --> 00:11:11.119
They'd give me their orders
for the following week.

00:11:11.143 --> 00:11:12.777
I'd deliver pop and charge twice.

00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:14.110
I had this captured market.

00:11:14.134 --> 00:11:17.794
You didn't need contracts, you just needed
to have a supply and demand

00:11:17.818 --> 00:11:19.651
and this audience who bought into you.

00:11:19.675 --> 00:11:21.871
These women weren't going
to go to anybody else

00:11:21.895 --> 00:11:24.373
because they liked me,
and I kind of figured it out.

00:11:24.397 --> 00:11:26.515
I went and got golf balls
from golf courses.

00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:28.651
But everybody else was looking in the bush

00:11:28.675 --> 00:11:30.727
and looking in the ditches for golf balls.
