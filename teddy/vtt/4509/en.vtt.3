00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:32.467
Unfortunately, the school system
is grooming this world to say,

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:34.615
"Let's be a lawyer,"
or, "Let's be a doctor."

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:36.117
We're missing that opportunity,

00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:38.574
because no one ever says,
"Hey, be an entrepreneur."

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.649
Entrepreneurs are people --
we have a lot of them in this room --

00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:44.490
who have ideas and passions
or see these needs in the world

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:46.164
and decide to stand up and do it.

00:01:46.188 --> 00:01:49.038
And we put everything on the line
to make that stuff happen.

00:01:49.062 --> 00:01:51.791
We have the ability
to get the groups of people around us

00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:53.688
that want to build that dream with us.

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:57.395
And I think if we could get kids
to embrace the idea at a young age,

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:58.633
of being entrepreneurial,

00:01:58.657 --> 00:02:01.644
we could change everything
in the world that's a problem today.
