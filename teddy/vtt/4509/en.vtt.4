00:01:58.657 --> 00:02:01.644
we could change everything
in the world that's a problem today.

00:02:01.668 --> 00:02:04.074
Every problem out there,
somebody has the idea for.

00:02:04.098 --> 00:02:06.705
And as a young kid,
nobody can say it can't happen,

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.981
because you're too dumb to realize
that you couldn't figure it out.

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:13.081
I think we have an obligation
as parents and a society

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:17.271
to start teaching our kids to fish
instead of giving them the fish --

00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:20.160
the old parable: "Give a man
a fish, you feed him for a day.

00:02:20.184 --> 00:02:22.534
Teach a man to fish,
you feed him for a lifetime."

00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:24.766
If we can teach our kids
to be entrepreneurial,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.520
the ones that show the traits to be,

00:02:26.544 --> 00:02:29.671
like we teach the ones who have
science gifts to go on in science,

00:02:29.695 --> 00:02:32.108
what if we saw the ones
with entrepreneurial traits
