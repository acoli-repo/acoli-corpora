to find these kids
who have the entrepreneurial traits,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.976
and to groom them or show them

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.678
that being an entrepreneur
is actually a cool thing.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.035
It's not something
that is a bad thing and is vilified,

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.483
which is what happens in a lot of society.

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:44.642
Kids, when we grow up, have dreams,

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.672
and we have passions, and we have visions,

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:48.629
and somehow we get those things crushed.

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:50.668
We get told that we need to study harder

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:52.960
or be more focused or get a tutor.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:56.912
My parents got me a tutor in French,
and I still suck in French.

00:00:58.472 --> 00:00:59.625
Two years ago,

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.243
I was the highest-rated lecturer
at MIT's Entrepreneurial Master's Program.
