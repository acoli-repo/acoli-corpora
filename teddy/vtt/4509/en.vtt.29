00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.464
when they don't even feel the pain yet.

00:14:31.488 --> 00:14:35.650
Don't read bedtime stories every night --
maybe four nights of the week,

00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:37.953
and three nights, have them tell stories.

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:40.737
Why don't you sit down with kids
and give them four items,

00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:43.651
a red shirt, a blue tie,
a kangaroo and a laptop,

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:46.104
and have them tell a story
about those four things?

00:14:46.128 --> 00:14:47.526
My kids do that all the time.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.867
It teaches them to sell,
teaches them creativity,

00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:51.706
teaches them to think on their feet.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.651
Do that kind of stuff, have fun with it.

00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:55.993
Get kids to stand up
in front of groups and talk,

00:14:56.017 --> 00:14:58.092
even if it's just
in front of their friends,

00:14:58.116 --> 00:14:59.598
and do plays and have speeches.

00:14:59.622 --> 00:15:02.367
Those are entrepreneurial traits
you want to be nurturing.
