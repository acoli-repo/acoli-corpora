00:12:59.068 --> 00:13:02.165
but why don't we get them games,
if they're entrepreneurial kids,

00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:04.676
that nurture the traits
you need to be entrepreneurs?

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.990
Why don't you teach them
not to waste money?

00:13:07.014 --> 00:13:09.926
I remember being told to walk
out into the middle of a street

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.120
in Banff, Alberta.

00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:12.954
I'd thrown a penny out in the street,

00:13:12.978 --> 00:13:14.511
and my dad said, "Go pick it up.

00:13:14.535 --> 00:13:18.147
I work too damn hard for my money.
I'm not going to see you waste a penny."

00:13:18.171 --> 00:13:19.855
I remember that lesson to this day.

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:21.773
Allowances teach kids the wrong habits.

00:13:21.797 --> 00:13:25.368
Allowances, by nature,
are teaching kids to think about a job.

00:13:25.392 --> 00:13:28.369
An entrepreneur doesn't expect
a regular paycheck.

00:13:28.393 --> 00:13:32.074
Allowance is breeding kids at a young age
to expect a regular paycheck.
