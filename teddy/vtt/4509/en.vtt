00:00:01.198 --> 00:00:04.001
I would be willing to bet
I'm the dumbest guy in the room,

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:06.987
because I couldn't get through school;
I struggled with school.

00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:10.221
But I knew at a very early age
that I loved money, I loved business

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:12.132
and I loved this entrepreneurial thing.

00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:13.941
I was raised to be an entrepreneur.

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:16.418
What I've been really

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:19.259
and I've never spoken

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:21.340

anyone's heard it,

00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:22.862
except my wife, three days ago.

00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:24.784
She said, "What are you talking about?"

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:27.747
I told her that I think
we miss an opportunity

00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:30.976
to find these kids
who have the entrepreneurial traits,
