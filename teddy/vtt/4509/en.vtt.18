00:08:57.968 --> 00:09:00.500
My dad owned an automotive
and industrial repair shop.

00:09:00.524 --> 00:09:02.940
He had all these old
automotive parts lying around.

00:09:02.964 --> 00:09:04.639
They had this old brass and copper.

00:09:04.663 --> 00:09:07.640
I asked what he did with it,
and he said he just throws it out.

00:09:07.664 --> 00:09:10.650
I said, "Wouldn't somebody pay
for that?" And he goes, "Maybe."

00:09:10.674 --> 00:09:12.603
Remember: at 10 years old, 34 years ago,

00:09:12.627 --> 00:09:15.726
I saw opportunity in this stuff,
I saw there was money in garbage.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.102
And I collected it from the automotive
shops in the area on my bicycle.

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:22.211
Then my dad would drive me on Saturdays
to a scrap metal recycler

00:09:22.235 --> 00:09:23.390
where I got paid.

00:09:23.414 --> 00:09:25.134
And I thought that was kind of cool.

00:09:25.158 --> 00:09:28.207
Strangely enough, 30 years later,
we're building 1-800-GOT-JUNK?

00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:29.719
and making money off that, too.

00:09:29.743 --> 00:09:32.797
I built these little pincushions
when I was 11 years old in Cubs.
