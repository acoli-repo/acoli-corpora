I was the highest-rated lecturer
at MIT's Entrepreneurial Master's Program.

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:06.070
It was a speaking event
in front of groups of entrepreneurs

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:07.251
from around the world.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.558
He can't focus, but he loves walking
around and getting people energized."

00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:18.602
No one said, "Get him
a coach in speaking."

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:20.733
They said, get me a tutor

So as kids show these traits --
and we need to start looking for them --

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.384
I think we should be raising kids
to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:32.467
Unfortunately, the school system
is grooming this world to say,
