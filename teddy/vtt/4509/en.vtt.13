00:06:29.607 --> 00:06:31.925
There was about 1,000 hangers
that I'd collected,

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.251
because, when I told her
I was going out to play,

00:06:34.275 --> 00:06:36.331
I was going door to door
in the neighborhood

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:38.417
to collect hangers to put in the basement,

00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:41.037
because I saw her
a few weeks before that --

00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:44.039
you could get paid, they used to pay
two cents per coat hanger.

00:06:44.063 --> 00:06:46.425
So I was like, well,
there's all kinds of hangers,

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:47.651
so I'll just go get them.

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:49.587
I knew she wouldn't want me to get them,

00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.816
so I just did it anyway.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.651
And I learned that you could
actually negotiate with people.

00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:57.147
This one guy offered me three cents
and I got him up to three and a half.

00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:58.617
I even knew at seven years old

00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:00.895
that I could get
a fractional percent of a cent,
