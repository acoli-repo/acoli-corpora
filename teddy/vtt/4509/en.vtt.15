00:07:29.563 --> 00:07:31.240
And he's like, "We don't need one."

00:07:31.264 --> 00:07:32.912
I said, "But you've got two cars."

00:07:32.936 --> 00:07:34.342
Remember, I'm nine years old.

00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:37.874
I'm like, "You have two cars and they
don't have license-plate protectors.

00:07:37.898 --> 00:07:40.712
And this car has one license plate
that's all crumpled up."

00:07:40.736 --> 00:07:42.290
He said, "That's my wife's car."

00:07:42.314 --> 00:07:45.651

00:07:48.675 --> 00:07:51.269
If I couldn't sell all four,
I could at least get one.

00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:52.741
I learned that at a young age.

00:07:52.765 --> 00:07:54.059
I did comic book arbitrage.

00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:56.403
When I was about 10 years old,
I sold comic books

00:07:56.427 --> 00:07:58.167
out of our cottage on Georgian Bay.

00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:00.296
I would go biking
up to the end of the beach,
