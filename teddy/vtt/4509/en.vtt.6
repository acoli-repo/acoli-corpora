00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:00.126
or a sports hero like Luongo or Crosby.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.726
Our MBA programs do not teach kids
to be entrepreneurs.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.312
The reason I avoided an MBA program,
other than that I didn't get into any,

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:09.799
since I had a 61 percent
average out of high school,

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:11.018
then a 61 percent average

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:13.717
at the only school in Canada
that accepted me, Carlton,

00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:16.707
is that our MBA programs don't teach
kids to be entrepreneurs.

00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:18.658
They teach them to work in corporations.

00:03:18.682 --> 00:03:21.785
So who's starting these companies?
It's these random few people.

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.812
Even in popular literature,
the only book I've ever found --

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:27.035
and this should be
on all your reading lists --

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:28.449
the only book I've ever found

00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:31.053
that makes the entrepreneur
a hero is "Atlas Shrugged."
