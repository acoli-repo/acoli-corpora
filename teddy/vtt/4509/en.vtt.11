The definition of entrepreneur
is "a person who organizes, operates

00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:33.576
and assumes the risk
of a business venture."

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.006
That doesn't mean you have
to go to an MBA program,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.900
or that you have to get through school.

00:05:37.924 --> 00:05:41.095
It just means that those few things
have to feel right in your gut.

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:43.585
We've heard, "Is it nurture
or is it nature?" Right?

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:45.587
Is it thing one or thing two? What is it?

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:48.240
Well, I don't think it's either.
I think it can be both.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:49.867
I was groomed as an entrepreneur.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.651
When I was growing up
as a young kid, I had no choice,

00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:54.651
because I was taught at a very early age,

00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:57.285
when my dad realized I didn't fit
into everything else

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:59.144
that was being taught to me in school,

00:05:59.168 --> 00:06:02.119
that he could teach me
to figure out business at an early age.
