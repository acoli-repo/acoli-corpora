00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.358
I'm 10 years old;
you're not going to say no,

00:10:00.382 --> 00:10:03.563
especially if you have two options,
the brown one or the clear one.

00:10:03.587 --> 00:10:05.512
So I learned that lesson at a young age.

00:10:05.536 --> 00:10:07.894
I learned that manual labor really sucks.

00:10:07.918 --> 00:10:10.199
Right, like cutting lawns is brutal.

00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:14.045
But because I had to cut lawns
all summer for all of our neighbors

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:15.252
and get paid to do that,

00:10:15.276 --> 00:10:18.746
I realized that recurring revenue
from one client is amazing,

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.166
that if I land this client once,

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.313
and every week I get paid by that person,

00:10:23.337 --> 00:10:27.651
that's way better than trying to sell
one clothespin thing to one person,

00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:29.296
because you can't sell them more.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.789
So I love that recurring revenue model
I started to learn at a young age.
