00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:00.895
that I could get
a fractional percent of a cent,

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.266
and people would pay it,
because it multiplied up.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.021
At seven years old I figured it out.

00:07:05.045 --> 00:07:07.254
I got three and a half cents
for 1,000 hangers.

00:07:07.278 --> 00:07:09.390
I sold license plate
protectors door to door.

00:07:09.414 --> 00:07:11.301
My dad actually made me go find someone

00:07:11.325 --> 00:07:13.085
who would sell me them at wholesale.

00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:15.798
At nine years old, I walked
around in the city of Sudbury

00:07:15.822 --> 00:07:17.980
selling license-plate
protectors door to door.

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.184
And I remember
this one customer so vividly --

00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:23.759
I also did some other stuff
with these clients, I sold newspapers,

00:07:23.783 --> 00:07:25.935
and he wouldn't buy
a newspaper from me, ever.

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:29.539
But I was convinced I was going to get him
to buy a license-plate protector.

00:07:29.563 --> 00:07:31.240
And he's like, "We don't need one."
