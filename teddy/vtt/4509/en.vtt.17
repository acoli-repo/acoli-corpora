00:08:29.866 --> 00:08:31.787
and didn't like that he was paying more.

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:34.174
I was forced to get
a paper route at 10 years old.

00:08:34.198 --> 00:08:37.718
I didn't want a paper route, but my dad
said, "That's your next business."

00:08:37.742 --> 00:08:40.066
Not only did he get me one,
but I had to get two.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.781
He wanted me to hire someone
to deliver half the papers,

00:08:42.805 --> 00:08:43.956
which I did.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.988
Then I realized: collecting tips
is how you made all the money.

00:08:47.012 --> 00:08:48.740
So I'd collect tips and get payment.

00:08:48.764 --> 00:08:51.651
I would collect for the papers --
he could just deliver them.

00:08:51.675 --> 00:08:53.690
Because then I realized
I could make money.

00:08:53.714 --> 00:08:56.548
By this point, I was definitely
not going to be an employee.

00:08:56.572 --> 00:08:57.944
(Laughter)

00:08:57.968 --> 00:09:00.500
My dad owned an automotive
and industrial repair shop.
