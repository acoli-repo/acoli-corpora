00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:00.874
Each of my kids has two piggy banks.

00:14:00.898 --> 00:14:04.353
Fifty percent of all the money they earn
goes in their house account,

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:06.155
50 percent goes in their toy account.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:08.550
The toy account,
they spend on whatever they want.

00:14:08.574 --> 00:14:12.082
The 50 percent in their house account,
every six months, goes to the bank.

00:14:12.106 --> 00:14:13.257
they walk up with me.

00:14:13.281 --> 00:14:16.079
Every year, all the money
in the bank goes to their broker.

00:14:16.103 --> 00:14:19.071
Both my nine- and seven-year-olds
have a stockbroker already.

00:14:19.095 --> 00:14:21.295
I'm teaching them
to force that savings habit.

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.606
It drives me crazy
that 30-year-olds are saying,

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.822
"Maybe I'll start contributing
to my RSP now."

00:14:25.846 --> 00:14:27.577
Shit, you've missed 25 years.

00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:29.566
You can teach those habits to young kids,

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.464
when they don't even feel the pain yet.
