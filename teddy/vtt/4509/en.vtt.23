00:11:28.675 --> 00:11:30.727
and looking in the ditches for golf balls.

00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:34.458
I'm like, screw that. They're in the pond.
And nobody's going into the pond.

00:11:34.482 --> 00:11:37.870
So I'd go into the ponds and crawl
around and pick them up with my toes,

00:11:37.894 --> 00:11:39.487
just pick them up with both feet.

00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:41.321
You can't do it onstage.

00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:44.274
You get the golf balls,
throw them in your bathing suit trunks

00:11:44.298 --> 00:11:47.037
and when you're done, you've got
a couple hundred of them.

00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:49.818
But the problem is, people
didn't want all the golf balls.

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.938
So I just packaged them.
I'm like 12, right?

00:11:51.962 --> 00:11:53.399
I packaged them up three ways.

00:11:53.423 --> 00:11:55.822
I had the Pinnacles, DDHs
and the really cool ones.

00:11:55.846 --> 00:11:57.377
Those sold for two dollars each.

00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:00.447
Then I had the good ones
that didn't look crappy: 50 cents each.
