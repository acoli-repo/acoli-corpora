00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:00.447
Then I had the good ones
that didn't look crappy: 50 cents each.

00:12:00.471 --> 00:12:03.049
And then I'd sell 50 at a time
of all the crappy ones.

00:12:03.073 --> 00:12:05.325
And they could use those
for practice balls.

00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:07.435
I sold sunglasses when I was in school,

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.824
to all the kids in high school.

00:12:09.848 --> 00:12:12.435
This is what really kind of gets
everybody hating you,

00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:15.957
because you're trying to extract money
from all your friends all the time.

00:12:15.981 --> 00:12:17.163
But it paid the bills.

00:12:17.187 --> 00:12:19.056
So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.834
Then when the school shut me down --

00:12:20.858 --> 00:12:23.787
they called me into the office
and told me I couldn't do it --

00:12:23.811 --> 00:12:27.362
I went to the gas stations and sold
lots of them to the gas stations

00:12:27.386 --> 00:12:29.933
and had the gas stations
sell them to their customers.

00:12:29.957 --> 00:12:32.321
That was cool because then,
I had retail outlets.
