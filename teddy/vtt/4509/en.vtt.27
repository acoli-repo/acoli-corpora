Allowance is breeding kids at a young age
to expect a regular paycheck.

00:13:32.098 --> 00:13:34.787
That's wrong, for me,
if you want to raise entrepreneurs.

00:13:34.811 --> 00:13:36.798
What I do with my kids, nine and seven,

00:13:36.822 --> 00:13:39.292
is teach them to walk
around the house and the yard,

00:13:39.316 --> 00:13:41.293
looking for stuff that needs to get done.

00:13:41.317 --> 00:13:42.704
Come and tell me what it is.

00:13:42.728 --> 00:13:44.651
Or I'll say, "Here's what I need done."

00:13:44.675 --> 00:13:46.773
And then, you know
what we do? We negotiate.

00:13:46.797 --> 00:13:48.651
They go around looking for what it is,

00:13:48.675 --> 00:13:50.651
then we negotiate what they'll get paid.

00:13:50.675 --> 00:13:52.301
They don't have a regular check,

00:13:52.325 --> 00:13:54.563
but they have opportunities
to find more stuff,

00:13:54.587 --> 00:13:57.651
and learn the skill of negotiating
and of finding opportunities.

00:13:57.675 --> 00:13:59.081
You breed that kind of stuff.

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:00.874
Each of my kids has two piggy banks.
