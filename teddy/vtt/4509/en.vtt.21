00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.789
So I love that recurring revenue model
I started to learn at a young age.

00:10:32.813 --> 00:10:36.273
Remember, I was being groomed to do this.
I was not allowed to have jobs.

00:10:36.297 --> 00:10:38.715
I would go to the golf course
and caddy for people,

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:42.229
but I realized there was this one hill
on our golf course, the 13th hole,

00:10:42.253 --> 00:10:43.427
that had this huge hill,

00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:45.524
and people could never
get their bags up it.

00:10:45.548 --> 00:10:48.437
So I'd sit there in a lawn chair
and carry for all the people

00:10:48.461 --> 00:10:49.637
who didn't have caddies.

00:10:49.661 --> 00:10:52.532
I'd carry their golf bags to the top;
they'd pay me a dollar,

00:10:52.556 --> 00:10:55.517
while my friends worked for hours
hauling some guy's bag around

00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:56.699
for 10 bucks.

00:10:56.723 --> 00:10:59.444
I'm like, "That's stupid.
You have to work for five hours.

00:10:59.468 --> 00:11:02.669
That doesn't make sense. Figure out
a way to make more money faster.
