00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I'm here to explain

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And to do that, I'd like to talk first

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
about environmental toxins in our bodies.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So some of you may know

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
about the chemical Bisphenol A, BPA.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that's found in the lining of canned foods

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and some plastics.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So BPA mimics the body's own hormones

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and causes neurological and reproductive problems.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And it's everywhere.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
A recent study found BPA

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
in 93 percent of people six and older.
