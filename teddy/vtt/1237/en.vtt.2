00:00:56.293 --> 00:01:01.149
or see inside our body without an x-ray,

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:04.980
and really challenge
what we mean by a camera.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.574
Now if I take a laser pointer
and turn it on and off

00:01:09.598 --> 00:01:12.401
in one trillionth of a second --

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:15.212
which is several femtoseconds --

00:01:15.236 --> 00:01:19.233
I'll create a packet of photons
barely a millimeter wide.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.769
And that packet of photons, that bullet,

00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:24.719
will travel at the speed of light,

00:01:24.743 --> 00:01:28.701
and again, a million times faster
than an ordinary bullet.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:34.133
Now, if you take that bullet
and take this packet of photons
