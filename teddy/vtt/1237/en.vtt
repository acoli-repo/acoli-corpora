00:00:00.902 --> 00:00:06.856
Doc Edgerton inspired us
with awe and curiosity

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.118
with this photo of a bullet
piercing through an apple,

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:15.994
and exposure just a millionth of a second.

00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:24.550
But now, 50 years later,
we can go a million times faster

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:29.336
and see the world
not at a million or a billion,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.413
but one trillion frames per second.
