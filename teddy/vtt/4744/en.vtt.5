00:02:28.827 --> 00:02:30.784
Now you have enough space for one group of particles

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:33.633
to get passed others and the ketchup flows.

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:37.716
Now let's say you apply a very weak force but for a very long time.

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:41.253
Turns out, we're not exactly sure what happens in this scenario.

00:02:41.253 --> 00:02:45.009
One possibility is that the tomato particles near the walls of the container

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.299
slowly get bumped towards the middle,

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.800
leaving the soup they were dissolved in,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.383
which remember is basically water,

00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:51.884
near the edges.

00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:54.383
That water serves as a lubricant betwen the glass bottle

00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:56.436
and the center plug of ketchup,

00:02:56.436 --> 00:02:58.551
and so the ketchup flows.

00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:01.941
Another possibility is that the particles slowly rearrange themselves
