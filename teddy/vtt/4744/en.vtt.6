00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:01.941
Another possibility is that the particles slowly rearrange themselves

00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:05.801
into lots of small groups, which then flow past each other.

00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.133
Scientists who study fluid flows are still actively researching

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:11.326
how ketchup and its merry friends work.

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:13.411
Ketchup basically gets thinner the harder you push,

00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:16.498
but other substances, like oobleck or some natural peanut butters,

00:03:16.498 --> 00:03:19.301
actually get thicker the harder you push.

00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:21.717
Others can climb up rotating rods,

00:03:21.717 --> 00:03:24.090
or continue to pour themselves out of a beeker,

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.012
once you get them started.

00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:27.384
From a physics perspective, though,

00:03:27.384 --> 00:03:30.217
ketchup is one of the more complicated mixtures out there.
