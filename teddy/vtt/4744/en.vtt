00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:08.684
French fries are delicious.

00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:12.684
French fries with ketchup are a little slice of heaven.

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:14.432
The problem is it's basically impossible

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:16.463
to pour the exactly right amount.

00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:19.768
We're so used to pouring ketchup that we don't realize

00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:21.851
how weird its behavior is.

00:00:21.851 --> 00:00:26.430
Imagine a ketchup bottle filled with a straight up solid like steel.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.475
No amount of shaking would ever get the steel out.

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.395
Now imagine that same bottle full of a liquid like water.
