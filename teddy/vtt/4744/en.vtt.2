Ketchup, though, is part of a merry band of linear rule breakers

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:03.286
called Non-Newtonian fluids.

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:06.368
Mayonnaise, toothpaste, blood, paint, peanut butter

00:01:06.368 --> 00:01:09.870
and lots of other fluids respond to force non-linearly.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.915
That is, their apparent thickness changes

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:15.336
depending on how hard you push, or how long, or how fast.

00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:18.551
And ketchup is actually Non-Newtonian in two different ways.

00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:22.849
Way number one: the harder you push, the thinner ketchup seems to get.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.715
Below a certain pushing force,

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:26.717
ketchup basically behaves like a solid.

00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:29.134
But once you pass that breaking point,

00:01:29.134 --> 00:01:33.384
it switches gears and becomes a thousand times thinner than it was before.
