ketchup is one of the more complicated mixtures out there.

00:03:30.217 --> 00:03:32.467
And as if that weren't enough, the balance of ingredients

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:35.300
and the presence of natural thickeners like xanthan gum,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.934
which is also found in many fruit drinks and milkshakes,

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:39.605
can mean that two different ketchups

00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:41.549
can behave completely differently.

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.234
But most will show two telltale properties:

00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:46.069
sudden thinning at a threshold force,

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.321
and more gradual thinning after a small force

00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:50.365
is applied for a long time.

00:03:50.365 --> 00:03:53.327
And that means you could get ketchup out of the bottle in two ways:

00:03:53.327 --> 00:03:55.966
either give it a series of long, slow languid shakes

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.467
making sure you don't ever stop applying force,

00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:02.504
or you could hit the bottle once very, very hard.
