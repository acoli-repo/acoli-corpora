00:01:29.134 --> 00:01:33.384
it switches gears and becomes a thousand times thinner than it was before.

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:35.384
Sound familiar right?

00:01:35.384 --> 00:01:39.276
Way number two: if you push with a force below the threshold force

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:41.569
eventually, the ketchup will start to flow.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.158
In this case, time, not force, is the key to releasing ketchup

00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:46.992
from its glassy prison.

00:01:46.992 --> 00:01:49.620
Alright, so, why does ketchup act all weird?

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.634
Well, it's made from tomatoes, pulverized, smashed, thrashed,

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:55.457
utterly destroyed tomatoes.

00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:56.801
See these tiny particles?

00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.586
This is what remains of tomatoes cells

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.215
after they go through the ketchup treatment.
