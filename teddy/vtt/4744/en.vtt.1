00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.395
Now imagine that same bottle full of a liquid like water.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:34.434
That would pour like a dream.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.851
Ketchup, though, can't seem to make up its mind.

00:00:36.851 --> 00:00:38.933
Is it is a solid? Or a liquid?

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.654
The answer is, it depends.

00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:44.846
The world's most common fluids like water, oils and alcohols

00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:47.597
respond to force linearly.

00:00:47.597 --> 00:00:51.238
If you push on them twice as hard, they move twice as fast.

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:54.355
Sir Isaac Newton, of apple fame, first proposed this relationship,

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:57.739
and so those fluids are called Newtonian fluids.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.695
Ketchup, though, is part of a merry band of linear rule breakers
