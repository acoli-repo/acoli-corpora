00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.215
after they go through the ketchup treatment.

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:02.925
And the liquid around those particles?

00:02:02.925 --> 00:02:05.967
That's mostly water and some vinegar, sugar, and spices.

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:08.190
When ketchup is just sitting around,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.551
the tomato particles are evenly and randomly distributed.

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:13.967
Now, let's say you apply a weak force very quickly.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.522
The particles bump into each other,

00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:17.218
but can't get out of each other's way,

00:02:17.218 --> 00:02:18.717
so the ketchup doesn't flow.

00:02:18.717 --> 00:02:21.777
Now, let's say you apply a strong force very quickly.

00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:24.613
That extra force is enough to squish the tomato particles,

00:02:24.613 --> 00:02:25.945
so maybe instead of little spheres,

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.827
they get smushed into little ellipses, and boom!

00:02:28.827 --> 00:02:30.784
Now you have enough space for one group of particles
