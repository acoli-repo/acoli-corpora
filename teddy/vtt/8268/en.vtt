00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:01.622
When it comes to our careers,

00:00:01.622 --> 00:00:03.583
the analogy we've been given is a ladder.

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:05.626
We're climbing, climbing, climbing,

00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:07.170
seeing just how high we can get.

00:00:07.462 --> 00:00:09.547
But if we want to be
a part of organizations

00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:11.007
that are diverse and inclusive

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.092
and truly reflect
the world that we live in,

00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:14.343
that's simply not enough.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.679
While we climb, we also need to lift.

00:00:16.888 --> 00:00:19.766

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:22.477
Itâ€™s no secret

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:25.563
that our companies and organizations
rarely have leadership teams

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:27.565
that represent the communities they serve.

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:29.692
That makes them
less effective in their work,

00:00:29.692 --> 00:00:30.693
less innovative
