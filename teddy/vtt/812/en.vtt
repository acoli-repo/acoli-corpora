I would like to tell you all

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that you are all actually cyborgs,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but not the cyborgs that you think.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or use one of your cell phone devices.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So what's a good definition for cyborg?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, traditional definition is "an organism

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to which exogenous components have been added

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
for the purpose of adapting to new environments."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
People aren't supposed to be there.
