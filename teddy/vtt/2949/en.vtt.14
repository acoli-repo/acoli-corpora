00:06:59.888 --> 00:07:02.779
so we need to remove
all these colonial statues.

00:07:02.803 --> 00:07:05.297
We have have our own statues now,

00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:10.193
our African leaders --
Bhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah --

00:07:10.217 --> 00:07:14.450
all those who paid their lives
for our liberation.

00:07:14.474 --> 00:07:16.782
We can't continue in the 21st century,

00:07:16.806 --> 00:07:18.843
and after 21 years of democracy,

00:07:18.867 --> 00:07:21.007
have the colonizers in our own country.

00:07:21.031 --> 00:07:24.004
They belong somewhere.
Maybe in a museum; not here.

00:07:24.028 --> 00:07:27.178
I mean learning institutions,
places where young people,

00:07:27.202 --> 00:07:28.780
young minds are being shaped.

00:07:28.804 --> 00:07:33.494
So we cannot continue to have Louis Botha,
Rhodes, all these people,
