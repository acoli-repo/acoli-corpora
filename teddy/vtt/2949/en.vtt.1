00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:30.754
You breathe their air.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:32.815
You see them,

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:34.253
so they must see you.

00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:38.988
And yet, you still can't help but wonder:

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.309
Do I only exist when people speak to me?

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:47.750
Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:53.509
But through various artworks
that reflect upon our society,

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:57.683
I came to understand
how a young black girl can grow up

00:00:57.707 --> 00:01:02.821
feeling as if she's not seen,
and perhaps she doesn't exist.
