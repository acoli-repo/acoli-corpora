00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.400
From then on,

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:37.645
I realized that my spiritual
beliefs and dreams

00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:40.184
texture my material reality.

00:10:41.429 --> 00:10:44.792
But for me, Chapungu's story
felt incomplete.

00:10:44.816 --> 00:10:46.565
This soapstone bird,

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:50.956
a spiritual medium and messenger
of God and the ancestors,

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.079
needed me to continue her story.

00:10:53.681 --> 00:10:58.097
And so I dabbled in the dream space
a little bit more,

00:10:58.121 --> 00:11:00.752
and this is how "Falling" was born.
