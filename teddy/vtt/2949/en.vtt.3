00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:30.064
I felt a deep sense
of dislocation and invisibility.

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:33.386
I couldn't see myself represented.

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:37.216
I couldn't see the women who've raised me,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.102
the ones who've influenced me,

00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:41.857
and the ones that have made
South Africa what it is today.

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:44.824
I decided to do something about it.

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:49.698
What do you think when you see this?

00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:53.872
If you were a black girl,

00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:55.631
how would it make you feel?

00:01:57.273 --> 00:01:59.718
Walking down the street,

00:01:59.742 --> 00:02:02.656
what does the city you live in say to you?
