After Zimbabwe gained its independence,

00:12:02.673 --> 00:12:06.594
all the birds except for one
were returned to the monument.

00:12:07.164 --> 00:12:12.290
"Falling" explores the mythological belief
that there will be unrest

00:12:12.314 --> 00:12:14.991
until the final bird is returned.

00:12:16.898 --> 00:12:18.221
Through my work,

00:12:18.245 --> 00:12:21.675
I have realized a lot
about the world around me:

00:12:22.237 --> 00:12:24.233
how we move through spaces,

00:12:25.289 --> 00:12:27.624
who we choose to celebrate

00:12:27.648 --> 00:12:29.304
and who we remember.
