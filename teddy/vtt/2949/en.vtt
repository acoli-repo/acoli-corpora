00:00:00.824 --> 00:00:04.744
I'd like for you to take a moment
to imagine this with me.

00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:09.252
You're a little girl of five years old.

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.798
Sitting in front of a mirror,

00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:13.321
you ask yourself,

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:15.586
"Do I exist?"

00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:19.906
In this space, there is
very little context,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.494
and so you move into a different one,

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:24.092
one filled with people.

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:28.387
Surely, now you know you're not
a figment of your own imagination.

00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:30.754
You breathe their air.
