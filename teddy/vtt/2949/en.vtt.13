I think it's just my interpretation

00:06:33.028 --> 00:06:36.399
that we are bringing the statue down

00:06:36.423 --> 00:06:38.648
and bringing up something

00:06:38.672 --> 00:06:43.277
that's supposed to represent
African pride, I think.

00:06:43.301 --> 00:06:44.821
Or something like that.

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:49.277
Something should stand while Rhodes falls,

00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:52.008
I think that's what it's saying. Yeah.

00:06:52.748 --> 00:06:53.964
Yes. Thank you.

00:06:53.988 --> 00:06:57.451
Man 3: What is behind me
represents the African culture.

00:06:57.475 --> 00:06:59.864
We can't have the colonialist law,

00:06:59.888 --> 00:07:02.779
so we need to remove
all these colonial statues.
