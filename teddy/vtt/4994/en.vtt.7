They're looking at each other now. 
It's everything in this

00:03:31.868 --> 00:03:32.728
room

00:03:32.728 --> 00:03:37.598
and outside this room and down 
the street and in the sky.

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:41.818
It's everyone on campus and at the mall, 
and all the people

00:03:41.818 --> 00:03:46.839
waiting at the hospital.
And at the post office. And, yeah,

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:51.028
it's a flower, too. All the flowers. 
The whole garden.

00:03:51.028 --> 00:03:57.108
The opposite of a gun is 
wherever you point it.

00:03:57.108 --> 00:04:03.438
Don’t write that on the board, 
they say. Just say poem.
