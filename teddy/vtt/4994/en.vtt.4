00:01:58.644 --> 00:02:03.094
of Stupid-land? You should be, 
When's the election?

00:02:03.094 --> 00:02:07.682
It’s a teddy bear, a sword, 
a perfect, perfect peach.

00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:12.839
Go back to the first one, 
it's a flower, a white rose.

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.459
When the bell rings, I reach 
for an eraser but a girl

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.639
snatches it from my hand. 
Nothing's decided, she says,

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.959
We’re not done here. 
I leave all the answers

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.719
on the board. The next day 
some of them have

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.189
stopped talking to each other, 
they’ve taken sides.
