a loaded gun, it goes and 
I write it on the board,

00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:35.041
pausing so they can call 
out the antonyms –

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:37.525
My Your

00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:40.045
Life Death

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:43.945
Had stood ? Will sit

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:45.945

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.155

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.399
lightning and its sound, 
the children just stare at me,

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.879
and then it comes, a flurry, 
a hail storm of answers –
