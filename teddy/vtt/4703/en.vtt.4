00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:00.824
and both carbons are on the same side.

00:02:00.824 --> 00:02:02.648
The second way is like this.

00:02:02.648 --> 00:02:04.193
Now the hydrogens and carbons

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.718
are on opposite sides of the double bond.

00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:08.326
Now, even though both of these molecules

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:10.826
are made up of exactly the same building blocks,

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:13.329
they are two completely different substances,

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.468
and they behave completely differently inside of us.

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:18.972
The configuration on the left is called CIS,

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.376
which you've probably never heard of.

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:22.084
The one of the right is called TRANS,

00:02:22.084 --> 00:02:24.713
and you probably have heard of trans fats before.

00:02:24.713 --> 00:02:25.883
They don't go rancid,

00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:27.843
they're more stable during deep frying,

00:02:27.843 --> 00:02:29.817
and they can change the texture of foods

00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:31.806
in ways that other fats just can't.
