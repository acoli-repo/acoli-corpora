00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:31.354
Fatty acids with only single bonds

00:01:31.354 --> 00:01:32.834
are called saturated,

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.619
and those with one or more double bonds

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.667
are called unsaturated.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:39.256
Now, most unsaturated fats are good for you,

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:42.090
while saturated fats are bad for you in excess.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.713
For saturated fats, the story pretty much ends there

00:01:44.713 --> 00:01:47.120
but not for unsaturated fats.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.831
The double bonds in these molecules

00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:50.515
have a kind of weird property;

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:52.139
they're rigid.

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:54.062
So, that means there are two ways

00:01:54.062 --> 00:01:55.883
to arrange every double bond.

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:57.005
The first is like this,

00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:58.902
where both hydrogens are on same side

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:00.824
and both carbons are on the same side.
