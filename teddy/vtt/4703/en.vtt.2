00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:00.929
The three long chains on the right

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:02.379
are called fatty acids,

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.273
and it's subtle differences in the structures of these chains

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:06.783
that determine whether a fat is,

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:08.938
let's say, solid or liquid;

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:11.143
whether or not it goes rancid quickly;

00:01:11.143 --> 00:01:15.236
and, most importantly, how good or how bad it is for you.

00:01:15.236 --> 00:01:17.024
Let's take a look at some of these differences.

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:18.075
One is length.

00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:20.160
Fatty acids can be short or long.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.414
Another, more important difference

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:24.280
is the type of bond between the carbon atoms.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.914
Some fatty acids have only single bonds.

00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:29.831
Others have both single and double bonds.

00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:31.354
Fatty acids with only single bonds
