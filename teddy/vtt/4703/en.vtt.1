00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:30.931
doesn't impact our weight

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.858
or our cholesterol

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:33.064
or our risk of heart disease

00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:35.924
nearly as much as what kind of fat we eat.

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:37.123
But let's back up:

00:00:37.123 --> 00:00:39.347
What is fat?

00:00:39.347 --> 00:00:40.925
If we were to zoom in on a salmon,

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:42.003
which is a fatty fish,

00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:42.823
past the organs,

00:00:42.823 --> 00:00:43.613
past the tissues,

00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:45.329
into the cells,

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.421
we would see that the stuff we call fat

00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:50.626
is actually made up of molecules called triglycerides,

00:00:50.626 --> 00:00:52.545
and they are not all alike.

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:53.629
Here's one example.

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.730
Those three carbons on the left, that's glycerol.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.262
Now, you can think of that as the backbone

00:00:57.262 --> 00:00:59.635
that holds the rest of the molecule together.

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:00.929
The three long chains on the right
