Don't let nutrition labels or advertising fool you.

00:03:02.034 --> 00:03:04.090
The FDA allows manufacturers to claim

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.759
that their products contain

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.004
"0" grams of trans fat

00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:12.635
even if they actually have up to half a gram per serving.

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:14.104
But there are no hard and fast rules

00:03:14.104 --> 00:03:15.683
about how small a serving can be,

00:03:15.683 --> 00:03:18.730
and, that means, you'll have to rely on seeing those key words,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.005
partially hydrogenated,

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.858
because that's how trans fats are made,

00:03:22.858 --> 00:03:25.776
by partially hydrogenating unsaturated fats.

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:28.967
So, let's go back to our olive oil and pancake mix from before.

00:03:28.967 --> 00:03:31.609
Olive oil is 100% fat.
