00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:31.806
in ways that other fats just can't.

00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:34.097
They're also terrible for your health,

00:02:34.097 --> 00:02:35.974
by far worse than saturated fat,

00:02:35.974 --> 00:02:38.019
even though technically they're a type

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.978
of unsaturated fat.

00:02:39.978 --> 00:02:41.321
Now, I know that seems crazy,

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:42.517
but your body doesn't care

00:02:42.517 --> 00:02:44.656
what a molecule looks like on paper.

00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:46.575
All that matters is the 3-D shape

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:47.694
where the molecule fits,

00:02:47.694 --> 00:02:48.406
where it doesn't,

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:50.990
and what pathways it interferes with.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.950
So, how do you know if a food

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.827
has trans fat in it?

00:02:53.827 --> 00:02:55.012
Well, the only sure way to know

00:02:55.012 --> 00:02:56.084
is if you see the words,

00:02:56.084 --> 00:02:59.255
"partially hydrogenated" in the ingredients list.

00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:02.034
Don't let nutrition labels or advertising fool you.
