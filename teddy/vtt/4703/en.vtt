00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:15.924
Olive oil is 100% fat;

00:00:15.924 --> 00:00:16.964
there's nothing else in it.

00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:18.232
Pancake mix, on the other hand,

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:20.489
is only about 11% fat.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.761
And, yet, olive oil is good for you,

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:24.931
and pancake mix is not.

00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:26.312
Why is that?

00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.478
As it turns out,

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:29.889
the amount of fat we eat

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:30.931
doesn't impact our weight
