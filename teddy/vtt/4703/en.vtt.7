00:03:28.967 --> 00:03:31.609
Olive oil is 100% fat.

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.339
Pancake mix is only 11% fat.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.205
But olive oil is mostly unsaturated fat,

00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:39.840
and it has no trans fat at all.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.001
On the other hand, more than half the fat

00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:45.008
in pancake mix is either saturated or trans fat.

00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:47.339
And, so, even though olive oil has 10 times

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.133
as much fat as pancake mix,

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:50.593
it's healthy for you,

00:03:50.593 --> 00:03:52.386
whereas pancake mix is not.

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:54.180
Now, I'm not trying to pick on pancake mix.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.264
There are lots of foods

00:03:55.264 --> 00:03:57.183
with this type of fat profile.

00:03:57.183 --> 00:03:58.409
The point is this:

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.103
It's not how much fat you eat,
