00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.096
And so inside the library,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.696
it is routine to see people
visibly intoxicated on opioids:

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.776
eyes closing, body swaying slowly.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.816
It is routine for me
to ask them if they are OK,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.416
but at the same time remind them

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.136
if they can't keep their eyes open,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.696
they have to go.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.096
It is routine for our volunteer, Teddy,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.440
to pick up dozens of discarded needles
on our property and throughout the park.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.216
And it is normal for kids
to come into the library

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.136
to tell me or our guard, Sterling,
