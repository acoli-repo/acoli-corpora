WEBVTT

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.816
with all kinds of services and programs

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.176
from assisting with job seeking efforts

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.856
to locating resources for voter rights

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.176
to providing free meals
to kids and teens even.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.136
But what we think of as community support
takes on new urgency

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.360
when you're in the middle
of an opioid and overdose crisis.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.336
I work at the McPherson Square Library
of the Free Library of Philadelphia.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.216
It's located in Kensington,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.536
one of the lowest income
communities in Philadelphia,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.080
with a long history of being isolated
from resources and opportunity.
