00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.216
And what we're trying to do at McPherson

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.240
is find ways to support
this community out of crisis.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.096
And perhaps now, because of the epidemic,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.336
more people are paying
attention to Kensington.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.416
But regardless of that,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.656
at McPherson,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.456
we will continue to do what we can
with the resources we have

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.096
and we will continue to provide
whatever help we can

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.520
in hopes of keeping our community
safe and healthy

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.120
because public libraries
have always been more than just books.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.416
We are physical shelter,
