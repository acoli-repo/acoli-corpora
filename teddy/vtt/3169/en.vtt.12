00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.136
because at the time,
it was all we could do.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.136
So we waited and we watched
this man lose air --

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.856
seize up.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.200
He was dying.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.736
I don't know how many of you
have witnessed an overdose on opioids,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.216
but it's horrific

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.856
because you know the gasping for air,

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.256
the loss of color in someone's face,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.880
is a timer running down
on the chances of this person surviving.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.736
But luckily for this man,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.176
the ambulance arrived

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.680
and he received a dose
of naloxone through injection.
