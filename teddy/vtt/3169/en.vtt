When you walk into your
neighborhood public library,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.256
you expect the librarian
to help you find your next favorite book

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.936
or some accurate information
on a topic at interest.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.256
You don't probably expect the librarian

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.936
to come running out from behind
the reference desk with Narcan,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.400
ready to revive someone
overdosing on heroin or fentanyl.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.256
But this is happening at some libraries.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.576
Public libraries have always been
about community support

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.816
with all kinds of services and programs
