I'm not sharing this
to sensationalize Kensington.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.640
I'm sharing this because
this is the reality of a community

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.216
that is constantly striving
to move forward,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.696
but due to factors like structural racism,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.216
urban segregation,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.576
the cyclical nature of poverty,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.896
of trauma --

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.296
the community has inequitable access

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.560
to education, health care,
employment and more.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.256
And this is also what it's like
when the drug trade and use

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.120
affects every aspect
of life in the neighborhood.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.360
And the opioid epidemic
has only amplified that stress.
