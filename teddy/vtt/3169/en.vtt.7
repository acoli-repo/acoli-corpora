00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.376
Like many other communities,
we were just not prepared.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.936
We began to take notice
of IDs we were seeing:

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.816
addresses from nearby and upstate counties

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.176
and then slowly out-of-state ones.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.376
People from Arkansas,
Ohio, South Carolina, Alabama

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.760
coming to Philadelphia for cheap heroin.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.016
People began to linger longer
and longer in our public restroom,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.416
causing us to pay
more attention to the restroom

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.656
than to our daily responsibilities

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.080
because it was an accessible place
to use drugs just purchased.
