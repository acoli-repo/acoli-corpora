00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.360
And the opioid epidemic
has only amplified that stress.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.736
When I was hired
by the Free Library in 2013,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.816
I specifically chose to work at McPherson

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.896
because I understand what it's like
to grow up in an environment

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.096
where substance use disorder
shapes the everyday,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.816
and I wanted to use
those personal experiences

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.280
as a guide for my work.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.496
But before I get to that,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.176
I want to share what it was like

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.520
to witness this epidemic
grow in Kensington.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.376
Like many other communities,
we were just not prepared.
