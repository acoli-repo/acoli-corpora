00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.920
Then there were the overdoses.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.296
So many occurred outside in the park,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.520
some inside the library.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.776
Sterling, our guard, would spend his time
walking in and out of the building

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.056
and throughout the park,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.296
constantly making sure everyone was safe,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.176
because at times,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.520
our fear of having someone
overdose and die came close.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.376
One overdose in particular
occurred after school,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.776
so the library was full of kids,
noise and commotion.
