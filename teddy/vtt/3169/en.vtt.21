The opioid epidemic
is not just about those living

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.656
with opioid use disorder

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.136
because the reach of the epidemic
goes well beyond those living with this

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.416
and their families.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.560
It impacts the entire community.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.976
Kensington was a community
in crisis before this

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.976
for reasons that are endemic
and intertwined,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.056
and anyone familiar
with the neighborhood can think of why:

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.496
racial disparities,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.120
failure of local and federal government
to properly fund schools,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.880
lack of economic opportunity.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.216
