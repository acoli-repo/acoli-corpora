WEBVTT

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.080
with a long history of being isolated
from resources and opportunity.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.936
And because of that,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.840
it has been the center to the city's
drug trade and drug use for decades.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.616
And so inside the neighborhood,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.696
our library is nestled inside of a park,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.056
which has unfortunately
garnered a reputation

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.856
for being a place to find and use drugs,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.496
especially heroin,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.336
out in the open,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.656
putting us and the community
in direct contact

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.416
with the drug trade
and use on a daily basis.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.096
And so inside the library,
