00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.816
And I remember he jolted
like he was electrocuted,

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.286
and he pulled the needle out,

00:06:35.316 --> 00:06:37.170
and he told the paramedics to back off.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.680
And then he stood up, and he walked out.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.296
And we --

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.936
we went back to work

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.136
because people were still asking
for time on the computers,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.336
kids still needed help with their homework

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.576
and this was our job --

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.800
our purpose.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.656
I think that incident stays with me
because of the waiting.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.240
It made me feel helpless.
