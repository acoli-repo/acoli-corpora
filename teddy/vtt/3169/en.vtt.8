00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.080
because it was an accessible place
to use drugs just purchased.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.616
One day our toilet clogged
so badly in the restroom,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.456
we were forced to close
our library for two days

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.240
because the culprit of the clog
was discarded needles.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.056
For a while prior to that incident,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.255
we had been asking for a sharps
container for the restroom,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.495
and after that,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.656
the library administration
quickly approved installing one

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.840
along with hiring bathroom monitors.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.336
And as the weather warmed,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.976
we struggled to respond.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.976
People began camping out
in the park for days, weeks.
