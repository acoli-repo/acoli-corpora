I struggled in school, struggled to read,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.256
I was prone to anger and depression.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.616
When I was 11 years old,
I started smoking,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.480
which shortly after led to my own
experiences with drugs and alcohol.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.000
I convinced myself that my parents' past
would be my future.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.816
But eventually both of my parents
entered recovery

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.016
and maintained recovery from opioid use.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.576
And their strength and their commitment

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.256
provided support and stability
for me and my siblings,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.776
and it was those personal experiences
that brought me to McPherson.
