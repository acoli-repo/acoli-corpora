00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.616
So finally in late February of 2017,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.856
after much advocating,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.456
we finally received training
from Prevention Point Philadelphia

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.936
and about a month of so later,

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.840
I utilized Narcan for the first time
to save someone's life.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.816
It was after school again,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.336
and Teddy came into the library

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.896
and said someone was overdosing
on a front bench.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.576
Someone on staff called 911 again,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.336
and I grabbed the Narcan kit.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.016
The woman was barely in her 20s
and barely breathing.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.656
Her friend was frantically
slapping her in the face

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.000
in hopes of reviving her.
