00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.616
when Galileo got his hands
on one of the first telescopes,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.016
and as he gazed into the night sky,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.736
what he found there was a planet, Jupiter,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.760
with four moons circling around it.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.136
He then used those moons
to follow the path of Jupiter

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.896
and found that Jupiter
also was not going around the Earth

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.880
but around the Sun.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.440
So the prediction test failed.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.496
And this led to
the discarding of the theory

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.696
that the Earth was the center
of the universe.
