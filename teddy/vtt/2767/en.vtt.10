WEBVTT

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.800
will teach us what we don't actually know.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.416
Now, I am a surgeon

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.856
who looks after patients with sarcoma.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.080
Sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.760
It's the cancer of flesh and bones.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.576
And I would tell you that every one
of my patients is an outlier,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.800
is an exception.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.216
There is no surgery I have ever performed
for a sarcoma patient

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.496
that has ever been guided
by a randomized controlled clinical trial,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.240
what we consider the best kind
of population-based evidence in medicine.
