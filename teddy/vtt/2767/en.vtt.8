I didn't get one of those
little doohickeys

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.736
that your mechanic
has to plug into your car

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.136
and find out exactly what's wrong with it,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.256
because the textbook of medicine

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.800
is not closed.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.160
Medicine is science.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.240
Medicine is knowledge in process.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.656
We make an observation,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.815
we guess an explanation
of that observation,

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.456
and then we make a prediction
that we can test.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.056
Now, the testing ground
of most predictions in medicine

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.616
is populations.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.216
And you may remember
from those boring days in biology class
