that something or other
has been scientifically proven.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.456
But I hope that you understand
that science never proves anything

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.360
definitively forever.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.336
Hopefully science remains curious enough

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.776
to look for

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.776
and humble enough to recognize

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.296
when we have found

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.016
the next outlier,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.536

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.856
which, like Jupiter's moons,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.480
teaches us what we don't actually know.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.696
We're going to change gears
here for a second.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.656
