00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.616
and lead us into a much greater sense
of perhaps what a tree is.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.136
We often talk about
losing the forests for the trees,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.976
but one also loses a tree

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.520
within a forest.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.856
But the tree that stands out by itself

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.776
makes those relationships
that define a tree,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.616
the relationships between trunk
and roots and branches,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.880
much more apparent.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.056
Even if that tree is crooked

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.056
or even if that tree
has very unusual relationships

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.376
between trunk and roots and branches,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.096
it nonetheless draws our attention
