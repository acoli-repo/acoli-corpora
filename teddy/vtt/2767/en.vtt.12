00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.136
I'll ask a colleague

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.176
who may have a similar
albeit distinct patient with sarcoma.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.896
We'll even establish
international collaborations.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.056
Those patients will start
to talk to each other through chat rooms

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.280
and support groups.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.376
It's through this kind
of humbly curious communication

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.960
that we begin to try and learn new things.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.296
As an example, this is a patient of mine

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.000
who had a cancer near his knee.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.856
Because of humbly curious communication

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.976
in international collaborations,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.536
we have learned that we can repurpose
the ankle to serve as the knee
