We make an observation,
guess an explanation for that observation,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.616
and then make a prediction
that we can test

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.560
with an experiment or other observation.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.416
A couple of examples.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.016
First of all, people noticed
that the Earth was below, the sky above,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.920
and both the Sun and the Moon
seemed to go around them.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.256
Their guessed explanation

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.360
was that the Earth must be
the center of the universe.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.440
The prediction: everything
should circle around the Earth.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.776
This was first really tested

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.616
when Galileo got his hands
on one of the first telescopes,
