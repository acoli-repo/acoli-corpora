People talk about thinking
outside the box,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.456
but we don't even have a box in sarcoma.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.816
What we do have as we take
a bath in the uncertainty

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.976
and unknowns and exceptions
and outliers that surround us in sarcoma

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.536
is easy access to what I think
are those two most important values

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.096
for any science:

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.320
humility and curiosity.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.296
Because if I am humble and curious,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.616
when a patient asks me a question,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.080
and I don't know the answer,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.136
I'll ask a colleague
