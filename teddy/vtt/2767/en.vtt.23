00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.256
I'll never forget the night

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.520
that I walked into
one of my patients' rooms.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.936
I had been operating long that day

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.976
but I still wanted to come and see him.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.200
He was a boy I had diagnosed
with a bone cancer a few days before.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.896
He and his mother had been meeting
with the chemotherapy doctors

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.136
earlier that day,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.136
and he had been admitted
to the hospital to begin chemotherapy.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.336
It was almost midnight
when I got to his room.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.536
He was asleep, but I found his mother

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.136
reading by flashlight

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.616
next to his bed.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.440
She came out in the hall
to chat with me for a few minutes.
