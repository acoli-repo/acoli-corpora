00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.816
can be just as important

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.080
as the words that we use
in these conversations.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.616
What are the unknowns?

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.840
What are the experiments
that are being done?

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.376
Do this little exercise with me.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.616
Up there on the screen,
you see this phrase, "no where."

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.920
Notice where the blank is.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.880
If we move that blank one space over

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.216
"no where"

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.936
becomes "now here,"

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.856
the exact opposite meaning,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.080
just by shifting the blank one space over.
