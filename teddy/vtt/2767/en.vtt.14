00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.936
Now, very importantly,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.816
all the new thinking that outliers
and exceptions lead us to in medicine

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.200
does not only apply
to the outliers and exceptions.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.096
It is not that we only learn
from sarcoma patients

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.080
ways to manage sarcoma patients.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.976
Sometimes, the outliers

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.696
and the exceptions

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.960
teach us things that matter quite a lot
to the general population.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.216
Like a tree standing outside a forest,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.256
the outliers and the exceptions
draw our attention

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.616
and lead us into a much greater sense
of perhaps what a tree is.
