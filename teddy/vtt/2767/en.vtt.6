The caduceus, or the symbol of medicine,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.136
means a lot of different things
to different people,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.416
but most of our
public discourse on medicine

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.216
really turns it into
an engineering problem.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.976
We have the hallways of Congress,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and the boardrooms of insurance companies
that try to figure out how to pay for it.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.296
The ethicists and epidemiologists

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.016
try to figure out
how best to distribute medicine,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.696
and the hospitals and physicians
are absolutely obsessed

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.656
with their protocols and checklists,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.216
trying to figure out
how best to safely apply medicine.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.360
These are all good things.
