00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.040
Science.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.176
The very word for many of you conjures
unhappy memories of boredom

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.096
in high school biology or physics class.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.216
But let me assure that what you did there

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.416
had very little to do with science.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.736
That was really the "what" of science.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.480
It was the history
of what other people had discovered.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.056
What I'm most interested in as a scientist

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.216
is the "how" of science.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.056
Because science is knowledge in process.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.536
We make an observation,
guess an explanation for that observation,
