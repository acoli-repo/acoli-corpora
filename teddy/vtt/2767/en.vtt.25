00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.760
I didn't stop to correct her thinking.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.936
She was trusting in a protocol

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.176
that even if complied with,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.600
wouldn't necessarily save her son.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.160
I didn't tell her.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.760
I didn't fill in that blank.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.056
But a year and a half later

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.800
her boy nonetheless died of his cancer.
