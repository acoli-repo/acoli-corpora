00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.360
These are all good things.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.696
However, they also all assume

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.696
at some level

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.240
that the textbook of medicine is closed.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.656
We start to measure
the quality of our health care

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.216
by how quickly we can access it.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.336
It doesn't surprise me
that in this climate,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.176
many of our institutions
for the provision of health care

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.696
start to look a heck of a lot
like Jiffy Lube.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.296
(Laughter)

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.256
The only problem is that
when I graduated from medical school,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.336
I didn't get one of those
little doohickeys
