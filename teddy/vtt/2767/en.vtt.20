00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.800
draws our attention

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.000
and leads us to new kinds of thinking.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.936
Now, many of you may say,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.496
and may rightly say,

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.416
that yeah, Kevin, that's great,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.496
but you're not talking
about a bird's wing.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.000
You're not talking about moons
floating around some planet Jupiter.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.056
This is a person.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.336
This outlier, this exception,
may lead to the advancement of science,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.560
but this is a person.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.896
And all I can say

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.280
is that I know that all too well.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.160
I have conversations with these patients
with rare and deadly diseases.
