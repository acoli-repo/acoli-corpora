00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.160
the src oncogene.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.536
Now, I will not tell you
that src is the most important oncogene.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.776
I will not tell you

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.296
that src is the most frequently
turned on oncogene in all of cancer.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.760
But it was the first oncogene.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.296
The exception, the outlier

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.840
drew our attention and led us to something

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.560
that taught us very important things
about the rest of biology.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.976
Now, TP53 is the most important
tumor suppressor gene.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.736
It is the most frequently turned off
tumor suppressor gene
