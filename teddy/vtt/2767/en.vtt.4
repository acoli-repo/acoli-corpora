00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.320
This led us to learn something new.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.176
We began to pay more attention
to the bird and the bird's wings,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.576
and just think of all the discoveries

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.639
that have flown
from that line of thinking.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.776
So the test failures,
the exceptions, the outliers

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.360
teach us what we don't know
and lead us to something new.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.200
This is how science moves forward.
This is how science learns.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.096
Sometimes in the media,
and even more rarely,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.536
but sometimes even scientists will say

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.320
that something or other
has been scientifically proven.
