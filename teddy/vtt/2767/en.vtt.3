00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.696
that the Earth was the center
of the universe.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.816
Another example: Sir Isaac Newton
noticed that things fall to the Earth.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.760
The guessed explanation was gravity,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.656
the prediction that everything
should fall to the Earth.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.240
But of course, not everything
does fall to the Earth.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.760
So did we discard gravity?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.336
No. We revised the theory and said,
gravity pulls things to the Earth

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.560
unless there is an equal
and opposite force in the other direction.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.320
This led us to learn something new.
