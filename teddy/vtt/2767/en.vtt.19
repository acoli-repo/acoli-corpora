00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.736
It is the most frequently turned off
tumor suppressor gene

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.560
in almost every kind of cancer.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.656
But we didn't learn about it
from common cancers.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.096
We learned about it
when doctors Li and Fraumeni

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.696
were looking at families,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.736
and they realized that these families

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.280
had way too many sarcomas.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.696
I told you that sarcoma is rare.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.896
Remember that a one
in a million diagnosis,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.056
if it happens twice in one family,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.480
is way too common in that family.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.336
The very fact that these are rare

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.800
draws our attention
