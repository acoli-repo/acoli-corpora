00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.096
it nonetheless draws our attention

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.016
and allows us to make observations

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.280
that we can then test
in the general population.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.976
I told you that sarcomas are rare.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.640
They make up about one percent
of all cancers.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.240
You also probably know that cancer
is considered a genetic disease.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.176
By genetic disease we mean
that cancer is caused by oncogenes

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.576
that are turned on in cancer

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.640
and tumor suppressor genes
that are turned off to cause cancer.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.576
You might think
that we learned about oncogenes

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.816
and tumor suppressor genes
from common cancers

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.816
like breast cancer and prostate cancer
