00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.160
I have conversations with these patients
with rare and deadly diseases.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.736
I write about these conversations.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.056
These conversations are terribly fraught.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.896
They're fraught with horrible phrases

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.160
like "I have bad news"
or "There's nothing more we can do."

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.960
Sometimes these conversations
turn on a single word:

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.960
"terminal."

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.840
Silence can also be rather uncomfortable.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.936
Where the blanks are in medicine

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.816
can be just as important
