She came out in the hall
to chat with me for a few minutes.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.376
It turned out that
what she had been reading

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.576
was the protocol
that the chemotherapy doctors

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.840
had given her that day.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.440
She had memorized it.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.736
She said, "Dr. Jones, you told me

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.936
that we don't always win

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.240
with this type of cancer,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.160
but I've been studying this protocol,
and I think I can do it.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.536
I think I can comply
with these very difficult treatments.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.536
I'm going to quit my job.
I'm going to move in with my parents.
