00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.216
And you may remember
from those boring days in biology class

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.416
that populations tend to distribute

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.656
around a mean

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.536
as a Gaussian or a normal curve.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.216
Therefore, in medicine,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.456
after we make a prediction
from a guessed explanation,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.360
we test it in a population.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.256
That means that what we know in medicine,

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.536
our knowledge and our know-how,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.816
comes from populations

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.616
but extends only as far

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.376
as the next outlier,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.616
the next exception,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.376
which, like Jupiter's moons,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.800
will teach us what we don't actually know.
