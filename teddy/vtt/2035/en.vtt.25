00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.976
Autonomy: the urge
to direct our own lives.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.245
Mastery: the desire to get better
and better at something that matters.

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:38.976
Purpose: the yearning to do what we do

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.193
in the service of something
larger than ourselves.

00:12:42.217 --> 00:12:45.511
These are the building blocks
of an entirely new operating system

00:12:45.535 --> 00:12:46.976
for our businesses.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.561
I want to talk today only about autonomy.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.976
In the 20th century, we came up
with this idea of management.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.294
Management did not emanate from nature.

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:59.976
Management is not a tree,
it's a television set.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.224
Somebody invented it.
