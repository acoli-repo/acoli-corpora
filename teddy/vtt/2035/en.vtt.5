And eventually, after five or ten minutes,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.976
most people figure out the solution,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.745
which you can see here.

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.559
The key is to overcome
what's called functional fixedness.

00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:42.547
You look at that box and you see it

But it can also have this other function,

The candle problem.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.971
I want to tell you about an experiment
using the candle problem,

00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:54.454
done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,

00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:56.599
who is now at Princeton University, US,

00:02:56.623 --> 00:02:59.976
This shows the power of incentives.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.976
He gathered his participants and said:
