00:09:57.699 --> 00:10:01.101
Same deal. A bunch of games,
three levels of rewards.

00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:02.214
What happens?

00:10:03.141 --> 00:10:06.141
People offered the medium level of rewards

00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:08.745
did no better than people
offered the small rewards.

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:13.248
But this time,
people offered the highest rewards,

00:10:13.272 --> 00:10:14.768
they did the worst of all.

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:20.190
In eight of the nine tasks we examined
across three experiments,

00:10:20.214 --> 00:10:23.683
higher incentives led
to worse performance.

00:10:25.474 --> 00:10:31.450
Is this some kind of touchy-feely
socialist conspiracy going on here?
