00:04:28.658 --> 00:04:31.676
for nearly 40 years.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.976
These contingent motivators --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.374
if you do this, then you get that --

00:04:36.398 --> 00:04:37.976
work in some circumstances.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.812
But for a lot of tasks,
they actually either don't work

00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:43.732
or, often, they do harm.

00:04:44.688 --> 00:04:49.577
This is one of the most robust findings
in social science,

00:04:50.785 --> 00:04:53.134
and also one of the most ignored.

00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:54.748
I spent the last couple of years

00:04:54.772 --> 00:04:56.843
looking at the science
of human motivation,

00:04:56.867 --> 00:04:59.229
particularly the dynamics
of extrinsic motivators

00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:00.976
and intrinsic motivators.
