00:07:29.134 --> 00:07:33.762
are the more right-brained
creative, conceptual kinds of abilities.

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:36.167
Think about your own work.

00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:37.936
Think about your own work.

00:07:38.873 --> 00:07:40.455
Are the problems that you face,

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:42.976
or even the problems
we've been talking about here,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.888
do they have a clear set of rules,

00:07:45.912 --> 00:07:47.499
and a single solution?

00:07:47.523 --> 00:07:49.976
No. The rules are mystifying.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.246
The solution, if it exists at all,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.976
is surprising and not obvious.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.754
Everybody in this room

00:07:57.778 --> 00:08:01.976
is dealing with their own version
of the candle problem.
