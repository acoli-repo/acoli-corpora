00:01:56.644 --> 00:02:00.868
I give you a candle,
some thumbtacks and some matches.

00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:01.963
And I say to you,

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.976
"Your job is to attach

00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:25.501
melt the side of the candle,
try to adhere it to the wall.

00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:27.620
It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:30.976
And eventually, after five or ten minutes,
