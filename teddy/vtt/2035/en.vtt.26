00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.224
Somebody invented it.

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:04.248
It doesn't mean
it's going to work forever.

00:13:04.272 --> 00:13:06.279
Management is great.

00:13:06.303 --> 00:13:08.357
Traditional notions
of management are great

00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:09.976
if you want compliance.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.183
But if you want engagement,
self-direction works better.

00:13:13.207 --> 00:13:17.247
Some examples of some kind
of radical notions of self-direction.

00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:20.207
You don't see a lot of it,

00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:23.707
but you see the first stirrings
of something really interesting going on,

00:13:23.731 --> 00:13:27.374
what it means is paying people adequately
and fairly, absolutely --

00:13:27.398 --> 00:13:29.683
getting the issue of money off the table,

00:13:29.707 --> 00:13:31.682
and then giving people lots of autonomy.
