00:08:26.814 --> 00:08:30.457
This is not a philosophy.

00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:32.743
I'm an American;
I don't believe in philosophy.

00:08:32.767 --> 00:08:34.454
(Laughter)

00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:38.333
This is a fact --

00:08:38.357 --> 00:08:40.801
or, as we say in my hometown
of Washington, D.C.,

00:08:40.825 --> 00:08:42.415
a true fact.

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:44.883
(Laughter)

00:08:44.907 --> 00:08:48.701
(Applause)

00:08:48.725 --> 00:08:50.367
Let me give you an example.

00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:51.976
Let me marshal the evidence here.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.113
I'm not telling a story,
I'm making a case.

00:08:54.137 --> 00:08:56.408
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, some evidence:

00:08:56.432 --> 00:08:59.807
Dan Ariely, one of the great
economists of our time,

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:03.302
he and three colleagues
did a study of some MIT students.
