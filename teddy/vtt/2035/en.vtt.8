If you want people to perform better,
you reward them. Right?

00:04:02.147 --> 00:04:04.976
Bonuses, commissions,
their own reality show.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.018
Incentivize them.

00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:09.245
That's how business works.

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.282
But that's not happening here.

00:04:11.306 --> 00:04:12.976
You've got an incentive designed

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.796
to sharpen thinking
and accelerate creativity,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.976
and it does just the opposite.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.976
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.931
What's interesting about this experiment

00:04:23.955 --> 00:04:25.525
is that it's not an aberration.

00:04:25.549 --> 00:04:28.634
This has been replicated
over and over again

00:04:28.658 --> 00:04:31.676
for nearly 40 years.
