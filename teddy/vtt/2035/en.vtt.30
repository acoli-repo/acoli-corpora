things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.920
Let me give you an even more
radical example of it:

00:15:04.944 --> 00:15:08.817
something called the Results Only
Work Environment (the ROWE),

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:10.907
created by two American consultants,

00:15:10.931 --> 00:15:13.610
in place at a dozen companies
around North America.

00:15:13.634 --> 00:15:16.239
In a ROWE people don't have schedules.

00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:19.215
They show up when they want.

00:15:19.239 --> 00:15:23.293
They don't have to be in the office
at a certain time, or any time.

00:15:23.317 --> 00:15:25.262
They just have to get their work done.

00:15:25.286 --> 00:15:29.445
How they do it, when they do it,
where they do it, is totally up to them.
