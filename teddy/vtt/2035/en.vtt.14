00:06:59.412 --> 00:07:02.187
in North America, in Australia,

00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:05.777
white-collar workers are doing
less of this kind of work,

00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:08.181
and more of this kind of work.

00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:12.836
That routine, rule-based,
left-brain work --

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.576
certain kinds of accounting,
financial analysis,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.295
computer programming --

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.514
has become fairly easy to outsource,

00:07:19.538 --> 00:07:21.569
fairly easy to automate.

00:07:21.593 --> 00:07:23.769
Software can do it faster.

00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:26.118
Low-cost providers can do it cheaper.

00:07:26.142 --> 00:07:29.110
So what really matters

00:07:29.134 --> 00:07:33.762
are the more right-brained
creative, conceptual kinds of abilities.
