But for 21st century tasks,

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:35.198
that mechanistic,
reward-and-punishment approach

00:05:35.222 --> 00:05:36.890
doesn't work,

00:05:36.914 --> 00:05:38.396
often doesn't work,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.591
and often does harm.

00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:40.798
Let me show you.

00:05:40.822 --> 00:05:43.899
Glucksberg did another similar experiment,

00:05:43.923 --> 00:05:46.536
he presented the problem
in a slightly different way,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.580
like this up here.

00:05:48.502 --> 00:05:51.779
Attach the candle to the wall
so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.

00:05:51.803 --> 00:05:54.279
Same deal. You: we're timing for norms.

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:56.745
You: we're incentivizing.

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:58.220
What happened this time?

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.404
This time, the incentivized group
kicked the other group's butt.
