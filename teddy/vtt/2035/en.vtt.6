00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.325
To one group he said,

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.976
"I'm going to time you to establish norms,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.541
averages for how long it typically takes
someone to solve this sort of problem."

00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:16.976
To the second group he offered rewards.

He said, "If you're in the top 25%

00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:28.976
you get 20 dollars."
