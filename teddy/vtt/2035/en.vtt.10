00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.412
And I'm telling you, it's not even close.

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.774
If you look at the science,
there is a mismatch

00:05:05.798 --> 00:05:07.651
between what science knows

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:09.086
and what business does.

That's actually fine for many kinds
of 20th century tasks.

00:05:29.532 --> 00:05:31.643
But for 21st century tasks,
