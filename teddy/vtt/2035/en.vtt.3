00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.174
dare I say lawyerly case,

00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:33.947
for rethinking how we run our businesses.

00:01:35.793 --> 00:01:37.778
So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:39.245
take a look at this.

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:41.576
This is called the candle problem.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.274
Some of you might know it.

00:01:43.298 --> 00:01:44.976
It's created in 1945

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.976
by a psychologist named Karl Duncker.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.976
He created this experiment

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.131
that is used in many other experiments
in behavioral science.

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:54.976
And here's how it works.
Suppose I'm the experimenter.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.620
I bring you into a room.

00:01:56.644 --> 00:02:00.868
I give you a candle,
some thumbtacks and some matches.
