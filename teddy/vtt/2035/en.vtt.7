Now this is several years ago,
adjusted for inflation,

00:03:31.907 --> 00:03:34.452
it's a decent sum of money
for a few minutes of work.

00:03:34.476 --> 00:03:35.976
It's a nice motivator.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.143
Question:

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:40.484
How much faster did this group
solve the problem?

00:03:41.377 --> 00:03:42.623
Answer:

00:03:42.647 --> 00:03:48.289
It took them, on average,
three and a half minutes longer.

00:03:48.313 --> 00:03:49.528
3.5 min longer.

00:03:49.552 --> 00:03:51.374
This makes no sense, right?

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.501
I mean, I'm an American.
I believe in free markets.

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:56.976
That's not how it's supposed
to work, right?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.184
(Laughter)

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:02.123
If you want people to perform better,
you reward them. Right?
