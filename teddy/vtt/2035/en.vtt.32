The mid-1990s, Microsoft started
an encyclopedia called Encarta.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.317
They had deployed
all the right incentives,

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:11.190
They paid professionals
to write and edit thousands of articles.

00:16:11.214 --> 00:16:13.803
Well-compensated managers
oversaw the whole thing

00:16:13.827 --> 00:16:16.085
to make sure it came in
on budget and on time.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.504
A few years later,
another encyclopedia got started.

00:16:20.528 --> 00:16:21.925
Different model, right?

00:16:23.346 --> 00:16:25.006
Do it for fun.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.597
No one gets paid a cent,
or a euro or a yen.

00:16:29.096 --> 00:16:31.020
Do it because you like to do it.
