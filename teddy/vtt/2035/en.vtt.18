00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:03.302
he and three colleagues
did a study of some MIT students.

00:09:03.326 --> 00:09:05.976
They gave these MIT
students a bunch of games,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.976
games that involved creativity,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.278
and motor skills, and concentration.

00:09:10.302 --> 00:09:12.383
And the offered them, for performance,

00:09:12.407 --> 00:09:14.421
three levels of rewards:

00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:18.691
small reward, medium reward,
large reward.

00:09:18.715 --> 00:09:22.852
If you do really well
you get the large reward, on down.

00:09:22.876 --> 00:09:24.210
What happened?

00:09:24.234 --> 00:09:26.976
As long as the task
involved only mechanical skill

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.976
bonuses worked as they would be expected:

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.697
the higher the pay,
the better the performance.
