00:10:25.474 --> 00:10:31.450
Is this some kind of touchy-feely
socialist conspiracy going on here?

00:10:31.474 --> 00:10:34.250
No, these are economists from MIT,

00:10:34.274 --> 00:10:36.976
from Carnegie Mellon,
from the University of Chicago.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.621
Do you know who sponsored this research?

00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:43.765
The Federal Reserve Bank
of the United States.

00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:45.609
That's the American experience.

00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:48.408
Let's go across the pond
to the London School of Economics,

00:10:48.432 --> 00:10:50.976
LSE, London School of Economics,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.444
alma mater of eleven
Nobel Laureates in economics.

00:10:54.468 --> 00:10:56.976
Training ground for great
economic thinkers

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.976
like George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.287
and Mick Jagger.
