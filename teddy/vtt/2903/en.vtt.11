00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.096
the only image that we
could publish was this,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.056
which was on the stand
on the week that everybody voted.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.416
(Laughter)

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.896
Because we knew
somebody would feel this --

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.136
(Laughter)

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.840
when the result of the election
was announced.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.320
And when we found out the result,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.456
we really were at a loss,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.496
and this is the image
that was sent by Bob Staake again,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.560
and that really hit a chord.
