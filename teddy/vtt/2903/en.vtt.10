00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.736
So this is the image
that we published by Bob Staake

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.600
right after the election of Barack Obama,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.296
and captured a historic moment.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.536
But we can't really plan for this,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.936
because in order to do this,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.296
we have to let the artist
experience the emotions that we all feel

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.800
when that is happening.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.136
So back in November 2016,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.936
during the election last year,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.096
the only image that we
could publish was this,
