00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.376
or Valentine's Day,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.776
and they send me sketches.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.696
And once the sketches
are approved by the editor,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.080
David Remnick,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.336
it's a go.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.336
And I love the way

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.616
those images are actually
not telling you what to think.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.856
But they do make you think,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.896
because the artist is actually --

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.176
it's almost a puzzle;

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.696
the artist is drawing the dots,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.416
and you, the reader,
have to complete the picture.
