but also what made them laugh,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.336
what their prejudices were.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.936
And you really got a sense

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.440
of what it felt like
to be alive in the '30s.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.336
So I called on contemporary artists,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.576
such as Adrian Tomine here.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.736
I often call on narrative artists --

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.416
cartoonists, children's book authors --

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.960
and I give them themes such as,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.176
you know, what it's like
to be in the subway,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.376
or Valentine's Day,
