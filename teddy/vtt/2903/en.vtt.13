00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.776
I have seen over 1,000 images
come to life week after week,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.376
and I'm often asked
which one is my favorite,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.256
but I can't pick one

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.216
because what I'm most proud of
is how different every image is,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.456
one from the other.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.936
And that's due to the talent
and the diversity

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.920
of all of the artists that contribute.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.376
And now, well,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.256
now, we're owned by Russia,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.496
so --

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.736
(Laughter)

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.456
