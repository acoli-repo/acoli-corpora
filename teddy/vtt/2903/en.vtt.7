how those images really capture --

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.016
play with the stereotypes.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.416
But when you get it,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.000
it rearranges the stereotypes
that are in your head.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.856
But the images don't
just have to show people,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.216
sometimes it can be a feeling.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.280

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.016
like everybody else,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.256
where I really didn't know how to deal
with what we were going through,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.696
and I felt that no image
could capture this moment,
