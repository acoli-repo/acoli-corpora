00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.746
Clouds.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.368
Have you ever noticed how much
people moan about them?

00:00:05.392 --> 00:00:07.615
They get a bad rap.

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.162
If you think about it,
the English language

00:00:10.186 --> 00:00:14.455
has written into it negative
associations towards the clouds.

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.922
Someone who's down or depressed,

00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:18.613
they're under a cloud.

00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:20.304
And when there's bad news in store,

00:00:20.328 --> 00:00:23.152
there's a cloud on the horizon.

00:00:23.176 --> 00:00:25.184
I saw an article the other day.

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:28.370
It was about problems
with computer processing

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.192
over the Internet.
