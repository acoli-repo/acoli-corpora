This is Villa de Tamazulapan del Progreso,

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:07.170
a beautiful little village
in the Mixtec region of Oaxaca.

00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:08.755
My village,

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:12.341
and the surrounding
154 villages of the region,

00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:15.595
have a population of about 400,000 people.

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:17.305
For many centuries,

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:19.932

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:20.975

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:22.602
and many culinary traditions.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.106
And one of those culinary traditions
is our special connection with chocolate,

00:00:27.106 --> 00:00:28.983
dating back 800 years.

00:00:29.484 --> 00:00:34.030
Our ancient, indigenous communities
were among the first cultures in the world
