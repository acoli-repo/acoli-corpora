00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:04.981
About 10 years ago, I took on the task
to teach global development

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.151
to Swedish undergraduate students.

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:10.056
That was after having spent
about 20 years,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.957
together with African institutions,

00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:13.579
studying hunger in Africa.

00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:17.601
So I was sort of expected
to know a little about the world.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.976
And I started, in our medical university,
Karolinska Institute,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.530
an undergraduate course
called Global Health.

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:27.376
But when you get that opportunity,
you get a little nervous.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.734
I thought, these students coming to us
actually have the highest grade
