I won't put you at a test here,

right answer out of five possible.

00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:19.094

00:01:19.118 --> 00:01:20.284
and for my course.

00:01:25.428 --> 00:01:27.994
I really realized my discovery.

00:01:28.018 --> 00:01:32.943
I have shown that Swedish top students
know, statistically,
