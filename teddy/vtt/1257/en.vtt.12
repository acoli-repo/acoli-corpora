00:05:56.184 --> 00:06:00.671
in which we could display
the distribution in the world

00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:01.975
of income.

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:05.695
This is the world distribution
of income of people.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.345
One dollar, 10 dollars
or 100 dollars per day.

00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:14.483
There's no gap between rich
and poor any longer. This is a myth.

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:16.522
There's a little hump here.

00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:18.835
But there are people all the way.

00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:23.245
And if we look where the income ends up,

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:27.464
this is 100 percent
of the world's annual income.

00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:29.953
And the richest 20 percent,

00:06:29.977 --> 00:06:34.096
they take out of that about 74 percent.
