00:02:58.058 --> 00:03:00.443
So this is what I could display here.

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:02.124
I put fertility rate here --

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:05.286
number of children per woman:
one, two, three, four,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.341
up to about eight children per woman.

00:03:07.365 --> 00:03:11.345
We have very good data
since 1962, 1960, about,

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:13.402
on the size of families in all countries.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.801
The error margin is narrow.

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:16.833
Here, I put life expectancy at birth,

00:03:16.857 --> 00:03:20.324
from 30 years in some countries,
up to about 70 years.

00:03:20.348 --> 00:03:23.751
And in 1962, there was really
a group of countries here

00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:25.632
that were industrialized countries,

00:03:25.656 --> 00:03:28.750
and they had small families
and long lives.

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:30.874
And these were the developing countries.
