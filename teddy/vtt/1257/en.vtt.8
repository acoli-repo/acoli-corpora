Your yellow ones here
are the Arabic countries,

00:04:02.037 --> 00:04:05.938
and they get longer life,
but not larger families.

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:08.584
The Africans are the green here.
They still remain here.

00:04:08.608 --> 00:04:11.249
This is India; Indonesia
is moving on pretty fast.

00:04:11.273 --> 00:04:15.379
In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh
still among the African countries.

00:04:15.403 --> 00:04:18.631
But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle
that happens in the '80s --

00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:22.839
and they move up into that corner.

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:26.161
And in the '90s, we have
the terrible HIV epidemic

00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:29.694
that takes down the life expectancy
of the African countries.

00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:33.366
And the rest of them all
move up into the corner,
