00:01:28.018 --> 00:01:32.943
I have shown that Swedish top students
know, statistically,

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:35.976
significantly less about the world
than the chimpanzees.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.976
(Laughter)

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.459
Because the chimpanzee
would score half right

00:01:41.483 --> 00:01:44.113
if I gave them two bananas
with Sri Lanka and Turkey.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:47.559
They would be right half of the cases.
But the students are not there.

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:51.798
The problem for me was not ignorance;
it was preconceived ideas.

00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:54.559
I did also an unethical study

00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:57.110
of the professors
of the Karolinska Institute,

00:01:57.134 --> 00:01:59.675
which hands out
the Nobel Prize in Medicine,

00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:01.995
and they are on par
with the chimpanzee there.
