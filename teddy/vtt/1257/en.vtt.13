00:06:29.977 --> 00:06:34.096
they take out of that about 74 percent.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.036
And the poorest 20 percent,
they take about two percent.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.815
And this shows that the concept
of developing countries

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.406
is extremely doubtful.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.311
We think about aid,

00:06:45.335 --> 00:06:48.948
like these people here giving aid
to these people here.

00:06:48.972 --> 00:06:52.092
But in the middle, we have
most of the world population,

00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:54.725
and they have now
24 percent of the income.

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:56.405
We heard it in other forms.

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:59.130
And who are these?

00:06:59.154 --> 00:07:01.374
Where are the different countries?
