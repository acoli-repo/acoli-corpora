I thought, these students coming to us
actually have the highest grade

00:00:30.758 --> 00:00:32.781
you can get in the Swedish college system,

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:36.170
so I thought, maybe they know everything
I'm going to teach them about.

00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:38.191
So I did a pretest when they came.

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:41.708
And one of the questions
from which I learned a lot was this one:

00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:46.001
"Which country has the highest
child mortality of these five pairs?"

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.960
And I put them together
so that in each pair of countries,

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:53.429
one has twice the child
mortality of the other.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:57.698
And this means that
it's much bigger, the difference,

00:00:57.722 --> 00:00:59.524
than the uncertainty of the data.

00:00:59.548 --> 00:01:01.859
I won't put you at a test here,
but it's Turkey,
