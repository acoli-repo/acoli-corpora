00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:01.995
and they are on par
with the chimpanzee there.

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:04.454
(Laughter)

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:08.661
This is where I realized that
there was really a need to communicate,

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:11.589
because the data
of what's happening in the world

00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:13.574
and the child health of every country

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:14.935
is very well aware.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.726
So we did this software,
which displays it like this.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.708
Every bubble here is a country.

00:02:19.732 --> 00:02:24.721
This country over here is China.

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:25.908
This is India.

00:02:25.932 --> 00:02:28.179
The size of the bubble is the population,

00:02:28.203 --> 00:02:31.759
and on this axis here,
I put fertility rate.
