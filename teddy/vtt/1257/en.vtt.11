00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:30.332
And today, we have in Vietnam

00:05:30.356 --> 00:05:35.158
the same life expectancy
and the same family size

00:05:35.182 --> 00:05:37.945
here in Vietnam, 2003,

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.036
as in United States, 1974,
by the end of the war.

00:05:42.513 --> 00:05:45.809
I think we all, if we don't
look at the data,

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:49.054
we underestimate
the tremendous change in Asia,

00:05:49.078 --> 00:05:53.769
which was in social change
before we saw the economic change.

00:05:53.793 --> 00:05:56.160
So let's move over to another way here

00:05:56.184 --> 00:06:00.671
in which we could display
the distribution in the world
