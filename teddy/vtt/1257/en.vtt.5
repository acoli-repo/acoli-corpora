00:02:28.203 --> 00:02:31.759
and on this axis here,
I put fertility rate.

00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:34.226
Because my students, what they said

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.809
when they looked upon the world,
and I asked them,

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:39.556
"What do you really
think about the world?"

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.849
Well, I first discovered
that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.

00:02:42.873 --> 00:02:43.918
(Laughter)

00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:46.457
And they said, "The world
is still 'we' and 'them.'

00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:49.934
And 'we' is the Western world
and 'them' is the Third World."

00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:52.891
"And what do you mean
with 'Western world?'" I said.

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:54.892
"Well, that's long life and small family.

00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:57.304
And 'Third World' is short life
and large family."

00:02:58.058 --> 00:03:00.443
So this is what I could display here.
