"NXTHVN" is a project that started
about five years ago.

00:11:31.517 --> 00:11:34.779
NXTHVN is a 40,000-square-foot
arts incubator

00:11:34.803 --> 00:11:36.962
in the heart of the Dixwell neighborhood

00:11:36.986 --> 00:11:38.343
in New Haven, Connecticut.

00:11:38.367 --> 00:11:41.453
This is a predominantly
Black and Brown neighborhood.

00:11:41.477 --> 00:11:48.038
It is a neighborhood that has
the history of jazz at every corner.

00:11:48.062 --> 00:11:51.979
Our neighborhood, in many ways,
has been disinvested in.

00:11:52.373 --> 00:11:58.225
Schools are struggling to really
prepare our population

00:11:58.249 --> 00:12:00.526
for the futures ahead of them.
