00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:30.425
the artists, rather --
that I was told were the masters.

00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:33.458
Looking at the Rembrandts
["The Night Watch"],

00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:35.443
Renoir ["Luncheon of the Boating Party"],

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:37.025
Manet ["Luncheon on the Grass"],

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.368
it becomes quite obvious

00:01:38.392 --> 00:01:41.637
that if I'm going to learn
how to paint a self-portrait

00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:43.809
by studying those people,

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:45.798
I'm going to be challenged

00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:49.198
when it comes to mixing my skin

00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:52.465
or mixing the skin
of those people in my family.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:56.866
There's literally formulas
written down historically

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.761
to tell me how to paint white skin --

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:02.455
what colors I should use
for the underpainting,
