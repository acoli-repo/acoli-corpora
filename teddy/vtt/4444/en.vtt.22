have to struggle through
in order to set their kids out

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.300
on the path of life.

00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:08.008
What's encouraging for me

00:11:08.032 --> 00:11:12.916
is that this practice of mine

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.810
has given me the opportunity

00:11:15.834 --> 00:11:19.612
to work with young people in my community.

00:11:19.636 --> 00:11:22.838
I'm quite certain
the answers are not in me,

00:11:22.862 --> 00:11:24.392
but if I'm hopeful at all,

00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:26.630
it's that they may be in them.
