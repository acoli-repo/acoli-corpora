00:04:57.315 --> 00:05:01.220
I reconnected with my father, and ...

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.236
I really didn't know how
to make a place for him in my life.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.629
As with most things I don't understand,

00:05:10.653 --> 00:05:12.796
I work them out in the studio.

00:05:13.406 --> 00:05:17.154
And so I just started making
these portraits of mug shots,

00:05:17.178 --> 00:05:21.172
starting because I did
a Google search for my father,

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:24.069
just wondering what had happened
over this 15-year period.

00:05:24.093 --> 00:05:25.555
Where had he gone?

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:29.002
And I found his mug shot,
which of course was of no surprise.

00:05:29.026 --> 00:05:34.055
But I found in that first search
97 other Black men
