I believe there is beauty

00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:08.494
in hearing the voices of people
who haven't been heard.

00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:17.721
That's a complex idea,

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:23.406

are not always lovely.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.963
But somehow,

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:28.692
if they're reflective of truth,

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:33.963
I think, fundamentally,
that makes them beautiful.
