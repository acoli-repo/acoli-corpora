00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:30.680
in some cases,

00:06:30.704 --> 00:06:32.896
for that one worst thing
that they've done.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.969
So to a degree,

00:06:34.993 --> 00:06:38.878
it's a way of just saying,

00:06:38.902 --> 00:06:40.275
"I see you.

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:41.504
We see you."

00:06:42.274 --> 00:06:46.030
And I think that, as a gesture,

00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:47.949
is beautiful.

00:06:49.052 --> 00:06:51.361
In the painting "Behind
the Myth of Benevolence,"

00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:56.264
there's almost this curtain
of Thomas Jefferson

00:06:56.288 --> 00:07:02.604
painted and pulled back
to reveal a Black woman who's hidden.
