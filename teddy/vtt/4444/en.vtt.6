We have been there.

00:03:04.047 --> 00:03:05.507
We have been here.

00:03:06.173 --> 00:03:10.695
We've continued to be seen
as not beautiful,

00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:13.679
but we are,

00:03:13.703 --> 00:03:15.111
and we are here.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.129
So many of the things that I make

00:03:19.153 --> 00:03:24.979
