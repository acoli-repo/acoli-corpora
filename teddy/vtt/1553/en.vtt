00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have a studio in Berlin --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
let me cue on here --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is down there in this snow, just last weekend.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In the studio we do a lot of experiments.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I would consider the studio more like a laboratory.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I have occasional meetings with scientists.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And I have an academy, a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We have an annual gathering of people,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and that is called Life in Space.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Life in Space is really not necessarily about

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
how we do things, but why we do things.
