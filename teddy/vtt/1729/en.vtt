00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have a doppelganger.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
(Laughter)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Dr. Gero is a brilliant

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but slightly mad scientist

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in the "Dragonball Z: Android Saga."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If you look very carefully,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you see that his skull has been replaced

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
with a transparent Plexiglas dome

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so that the workings of his brain can be observed

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and also controlled with light.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That's exactly what I do --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
optical mind control.
