00:01:59.612 --> 00:02:02.505
You could basically imagine it has a large hall

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:04.961
filled with hard drives storing data

00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:07.235
they are collecting.

00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:09.392
And it's a pretty big building.

00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:11.243
How big? Well, I can give you the numbers --

00:02:11.243 --> 00:02:13.265
140,000 square meters --

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.871
but that doesn't really tell you very much.

00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:19.047
Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison.

00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:21.503
You think about the largest IKEA store

00:02:21.503 --> 00:02:23.250
you've ever been in.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.719
This is five times larger.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.795
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:31.802
Right? It's pretty big.
