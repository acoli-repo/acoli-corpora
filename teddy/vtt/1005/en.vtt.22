WEBVTT

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:03.142
or store their data in clouds like iCloud

00:11:03.142 --> 00:11:07.036
or Skydrive or DropBox,

00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:11.339
or maybe use online services like
Amazon web services or sales support?

00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:15.296
And the answer is, every single Swedish
business leader does that every single day.

00:11:15.296 --> 00:11:16.895
And then we turn it around.

00:11:16.895 --> 00:11:18.800
How many American leaders

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.093
use Swedish webmails and cloud services?

00:11:23.093 --> 00:11:25.133
And the answer is zero.

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:27.402
So this is not balanced.

00:11:27.402 --> 00:11:32.027
It's not balanced by any means, not even close.
