00:06:59.732 --> 00:07:01.481
are running loose.

00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:03.322
They are completely out of control,

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:07.764
and they should be brought back under control.

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.579
So what do we actually know about the leaks?

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:14.689
Everything is based on the files

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:17.187
leaked by Mr. Snowden.

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:20.035
The very first PRISM slides

00:07:20.035 --> 00:07:22.024
from the beginning of June

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:24.118
detail a collection program where the data

00:07:24.118 --> 00:07:25.904
is collected from service providers,

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.782
and they actually go and name the service providers

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.113
they have access to.
