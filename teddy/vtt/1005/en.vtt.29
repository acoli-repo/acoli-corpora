00:14:28.047 --> 00:14:30.902
And if we indeed need a Big Brother,

00:14:30.902 --> 00:14:34.380
I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.540
than a foreign Big Brother.

00:14:37.545 --> 00:14:42.604
And when the leaks started,
the very first thing I tweeted about this

00:14:42.604 --> 00:14:44.678
was a comment about how,

00:14:44.678 --> 00:14:46.366
when you've been using search engines,

00:14:46.366 --> 00:14:50.015
you've been potentially leaking all that
to U.S. intelligence.

00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:51.987
And two minutes later, I got a reply

00:14:51.987 --> 00:14:54.323
by somebody called Kimberly from the United States

00:14:54.323 --> 00:14:56.490
challenging me, like, why am I worried about this?

00:14:56.503 --> 00:15:00.535
What am I sending to worry about this?
Am I sending naked pictures or something?
