00:05:29.798 --> 00:05:32.873
that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes

00:05:32.873 --> 00:05:36.710
such as infiltrating standardization bodies

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.458
to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.

00:05:41.458 --> 00:05:43.495
And what that means

00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:45.315
is that you take something which is secure,

00:05:45.315 --> 00:05:47.736
an encryption algorithm which is so secure

00:05:47.736 --> 00:05:50.843
that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,

00:05:50.843 --> 00:05:52.585
nobody can decrypt that file.

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:56.998
Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file,

00:05:56.998 --> 00:05:59.058
it's going to take millions of years.

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:01.305
So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.
