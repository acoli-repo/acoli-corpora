They even have a specific date

00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:35.719

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:37.358

00:07:37.358 --> 00:07:39.645

the collection from Microsoft

00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:43.365

00:07:43.365 --> 00:07:46.097

Skype, Apple and so on.

00:07:52.357 --> 00:07:55.205
And every single one of these companies denies.

00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:59.600
They all say that this simply isn't true,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.208
that they are not giving
backdoor access to their data.
