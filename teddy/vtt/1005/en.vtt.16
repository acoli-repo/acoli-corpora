00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.208
that they are not giving
backdoor access to their data.

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:08.331
Yet we have these files.

00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:10.652
So is one of the parties lying,

00:08:10.652 --> 00:08:13.975
or is there some other alternative explanation?

00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:16.897
And one explanation would be

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:19.784
that these parties, these service providers,

00:08:19.784 --> 00:08:21.700
are not cooperating.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.721
Instead, they've been hacked.

00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:27.938
That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.

00:08:27.938 --> 00:08:32.116
In this case, they've been hacked
by their own government.
