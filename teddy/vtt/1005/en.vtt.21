Many countries spy, not all of them,
but let's take an example.

00:10:32.414 --> 00:10:34.525
Let's take, for example, Sweden.

00:10:34.525 --> 00:10:35.901
I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:38.180
has a little bit of a similar law to the United States.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.303
When your data traffic goes through Sweden,

00:10:40.303 --> 00:10:43.113
their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law

00:10:43.113 --> 00:10:45.114
to intercept that traffic.

00:10:45.114 --> 00:10:48.319
All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers

00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:51.191
and politicians and business leaders

00:10:51.191 --> 00:10:54.264
use, every day, U.S.-based services,

00:10:54.264 --> 00:10:57.532
like, you know, run Windows or OSX,

00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:59.742
or use Facebook or LinkedIn,

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:03.142
or store their data in clouds like iCloud
