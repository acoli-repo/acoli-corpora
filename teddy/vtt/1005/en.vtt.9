00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:30.695
They're about doing surveillance on people

00:04:30.695 --> 00:04:34.455
they know are innocent.

00:04:34.455 --> 00:04:36.700
So the four main arguments

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.852
supporting surveillance like this,

00:04:38.852 --> 00:04:41.087
well, the first of all is that whenever you start

00:04:41.087 --> 00:04:42.982
discussing about these revelations,

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:45.275
there will be naysayers trying to minimize

00:04:45.275 --> 00:04:47.463
the importance of these revelations, saying that

00:04:47.463 --> 00:04:49.076
we knew all this already,

00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:52.656
we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here.

00:04:52.656 --> 00:04:55.871
And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you

00:04:55.871 --> 00:05:01.583
that we knew this already,
because we did not know this already.
