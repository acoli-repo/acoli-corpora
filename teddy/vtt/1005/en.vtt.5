00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:31.802
Right? It's pretty big.

00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:34.648
We estimate that just the electricity bill

00:02:34.648 --> 00:02:36.524
for running this data center

00:02:36.524 --> 00:02:39.922
is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:42.431
And this kind of wholesale surveillance

00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:45.167
means that they can collect our data

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:47.170
and keep it basically forever,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.679
keep it for extended periods of time,

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.925
keep it for years, keep it for decades.

00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:56.304
And this opens up completely new kinds of risks

00:02:56.304 --> 00:02:58.250
to us all.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.878
And what this is is that it is wholesale
