00:12:57.573 --> 00:13:01.814
and throw it in the trash
just because there are terrorists?

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:04.338
And the same thing with the Bill of Rights
and all the amendments

00:13:04.338 --> 00:13:06.655
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:11.806
and the E.U. conventions on human rights
and fundamental freedoms

00:13:11.806 --> 00:13:13.323
and the press freedom?

00:13:13.323 --> 00:13:17.138
Do we really think terrorism
is such an existential threat,

00:13:17.138 --> 00:13:20.264
we are ready to do anything at all?

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.154
But people are scared about terrorists,

00:13:25.154 --> 00:13:27.568
and then they think that
maybe that surveillance is okay

00:13:27.568 --> 00:13:29.612
because they have nothing to hide.

00:13:29.612 --> 00:13:32.319
Feel free to survey me if that helps.
