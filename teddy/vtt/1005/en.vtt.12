00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:01.305
So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.

00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:03.379
You take something which is that good

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:05.863
and then you weaken it on purpose,

00:06:05.863 --> 00:06:11.473
making all of us less secure as an end result.

00:06:11.473 --> 00:06:13.604
A real-world equivalent would be that

00:06:13.604 --> 00:06:16.256
intelligence agencies would force

00:06:16.256 --> 00:06:19.083
some secret pin code into every single house alarm

00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:20.876
so they could get into every single house

00:06:20.876 --> 00:06:23.122
because, you know, bad people
might have house alarms,

00:06:23.122 --> 00:06:25.561
but it will also make all of us

00:06:25.561 --> 00:06:27.790
less secure as an end result.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.530
