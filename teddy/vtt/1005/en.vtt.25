00:12:28.742 --> 00:12:33.548
to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament,

00:12:33.548 --> 00:12:36.702
and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists

00:12:36.702 --> 00:12:39.720
from inside the E.U. Parliament, right?

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.668
It's not the war on terror.

00:12:41.668 --> 00:12:45.810
Part of it might be, and there are terrorists,

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.237
but are we really thinking about terrorists

00:12:48.237 --> 00:12:50.406
as such an existential threat

00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:54.082
that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?

00:12:54.082 --> 00:12:57.573
Are the Americans ready
to throw away the Constituion

00:12:57.573 --> 00:13:01.814
and throw it in the trash
just because there are terrorists?
