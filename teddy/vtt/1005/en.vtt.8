If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer,

00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:05.813
or they're trying to catch a drug lord

00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:09.417
or trying to prevent a school shooting,

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:11.094
and they have leads and they have suspects,

00:04:11.094 --> 00:04:14.811
then it's perfectly fine for them
to tap the suspect's phone,

00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:18.167
and to intercept his Internet communications.

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:20.105
I'm not arguing that at all,

00:04:20.105 --> 00:04:22.929
but that's not what programs like PRISM are about.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.814
They are not about doing surveillance on people

00:04:25.814 --> 00:04:29.018
that they have reason
to suspect of some wrongdoings.

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:30.695
They're about doing surveillance on people
