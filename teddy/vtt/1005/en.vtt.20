00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:01.374
here's the secondary target,

00:10:01.374 --> 00:10:02.798
here's the teaming.

00:10:02.798 --> 00:10:06.654
They probably have a team building
on Thursday evening in a pub.

00:10:06.654 --> 00:10:09.695
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art

00:10:09.695 --> 00:10:11.402
like, you know, "Success,"

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:14.666
when they gain access to services like this.

00:10:14.666 --> 00:10:17.492
What the hell?

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:21.518
And then there's the argument

00:10:21.518 --> 00:10:23.178
that okay, yes, this might be going on,

00:10:23.178 --> 00:10:25.815
but then again, other countries are doing it as well.

00:10:25.815 --> 00:10:28.238
All countries spy.

00:10:28.238 --> 00:10:29.976
And maybe that's true.

00:10:29.976 --> 00:10:32.414
Many countries spy, not all of them,
but let's take an example.
