Backdooring encryption algorithms

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.626
just boggles the mind.

00:06:34.626 --> 00:06:38.401
But of course, these intelligence agencies
are doing their job.

00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:40.158
This is what they have been told to do:

00:06:40.158 --> 00:06:42.388
do signals intelligence,

00:06:42.388 --> 00:06:44.400
monitor telecommunications,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.822
monitor Internet traffic.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.530
That's what they're trying to do,

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.612
and since most, a very big part
of the Internet traffic today is encrypted,

00:06:50.612 --> 00:06:52.569
they're trying to find ways around the encryption.

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.626
One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,

00:06:55.626 --> 00:06:57.511
which is a great example

00:06:57.511 --> 00:06:59.732
about how U.S. intelligence agencies

00:06:59.732 --> 00:07:01.481
are running loose.
