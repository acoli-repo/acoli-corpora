00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Today I'm going to take you on a voyage

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to some place so deep,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
so dark, so unexplored

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's a place of myth and legend.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's a place marked on ancient maps

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as "here be monsters."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Instead, they just make me green with envy

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that my colleague from IUCN
