Who here is fascinated
by life under the sea?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.336
Fantastic.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.920
Now, what did we just do?

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.576
Let's dissect this for a second.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.096
The simple action
of an individual raising a hand

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.960
led many others to do the same.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.216
Now, it's true that when individuals
in a social network

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.816
have common priorities,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.816
it's often beneficial to copy one another.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.696
Think back to grade school and dressing
like the cool kids made you "cool."
