but are exposed to predators.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.696
And this perspective from above

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.216
shows us the feeding behavior
and precise movements

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.816
of many different fish,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.480
shown here with colored dots.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.136
And by analyzing
thousands of fish movements

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.376
to and from feeding grounds,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.000
we discovered a pattern.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.336
These fish, despite being
from different species

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.176
and not swimming in schools,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.216
were copying one another,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.456
such that one fish entering
these dangerous feeding grounds
