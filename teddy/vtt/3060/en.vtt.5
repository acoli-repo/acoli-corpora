00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.456
such that one fish entering
these dangerous feeding grounds

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.880
could lead many others to do the same.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.256
And fish stayed for longer
and ate more algae

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.296
when they were surrounded
by more feeding fish.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.256
Now, this could be happening

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.856
because even simple movements
by individual fish

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.856
can inadvertently communicate
vital information.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.856
For example, if even one fish
sees a predator and flees,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.616
this can alert many others to danger.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.560
And a fish safely entering feeding grounds
can show others that the coast is clear.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.336
So it turns out that even when
these fish are different species,
