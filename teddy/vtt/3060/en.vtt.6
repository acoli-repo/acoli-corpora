00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.336
So it turns out that even when
these fish are different species,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.976
they are connected within social networks

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
which can provide information
on when it's safe to eat.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.816
And our analyses indicate that fish simply
copying other fish in their social network

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.896
could account for over 60 percent
of the algae eaten by the fish community,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.936
and thus could be critical
to the flow of energy and resources

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.960
through coral reef ecosystems.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.256
But these findings also suggest
that overfishing,
