00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.256
But these findings also suggest
that overfishing,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.256
a common problem in coral reefs,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.736
not only removes fish,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.816
but it could break up
the social network of remaining fish,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.616
which may hide more and eat less algae

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.176
because they're missing
critical information.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.160
And this would make coral reefs
more vulnerable than we currently predict.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.376
So remarkably, fish social networks

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.296
allow the actions of one to spread to many

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.256
and could affect entire coral reefs,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.536
which feed millions of us
