00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.936
some of which, on rare occasion,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.360
appear to realize I'm watching them.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.920
(Laughter)

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.336
So clearly, clearly, for reef fish,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.696
dining out can be scary.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.256
But I wanted to understand
how these fish do their job

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.856
in risky situations.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.136
So my colleagues and I
put massive video camera stands

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.496
in a coral reef

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.216
to remotely monitor entire feeding grounds

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.816
that produce a lot of algae

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.600
but are exposed to predators.
