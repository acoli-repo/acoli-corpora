00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.016
But coral reefs depend on fish

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.120
that perform a critical job
by eating algae.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.896
Because if left unchecked,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.816
these algae can kill coral
and take over entire coral reefs,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.440
a costly change that is difficult
or impossible to reverse.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.176
So to understand
how fish may prevent this,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.136
I spy on them

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.216
while they're eating algae,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.296
which can be difficult for them to do

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.136
in open parts of the reef
exposed to predators,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.936
some of which, on rare occasion,
