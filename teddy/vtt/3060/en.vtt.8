00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.536
which feed millions of us

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.336
and support the global economy

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.840
for all of us.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.136
Now, our discovery
points us towards better ways

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.336
to sustainably manage coral reefs,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.936
but it also shows us,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.136
we humans are not just affected
by the actions of other humans,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.055
but we could be affected
by the actions of individual fish

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.856
on a distant coral reef

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.336
through their simple copying behavior.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.576
Thank you.
