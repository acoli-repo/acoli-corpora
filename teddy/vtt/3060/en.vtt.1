Think back to grade school and dressing
like the cool kids made you "cool."

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.416
But copying behavior
is also common in wild animals.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.176
For example, some birds
copy the alarm calls of other birds

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.000
to spread information
about approaching predators.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.176
But could copying behavior in wild animals

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.840
affect entire ecosystems
that we humans depend on?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.616
I was led to this question
while studying coral reefs,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.136
which support millions of people
through fisheries and tourism

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.736
here in Africa and around the world.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.016
But coral reefs depend on fish
