00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It's great being here at TED.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You know, I think there might be some presentations

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that will go over my head,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but the most amazing concepts

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
are the ones that go right under my feet.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The little things in life,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
sometimes that we forget about,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
like pollination, that we take for granted.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And you can't tell the story about pollinators --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
without telling the story about the invention of flowers

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and how they co-evolved

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
over 50 million years.
