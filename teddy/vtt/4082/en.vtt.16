00:07:58.386 --> 00:08:02.394
But keep in mind, most victims of human
trafficking are poor and marginalized.

00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:04.424
They're migrants, people of color.

00:08:04.448 --> 00:08:06.130
Sometimes they're in the sex trade.

00:08:06.634 --> 00:08:08.800
And for populations like these,

00:08:08.824 --> 00:08:11.862
the criminal justice system is
too often part of the problem,

00:08:11.886 --> 00:08:13.338
rather than the solution.

00:08:14.444 --> 00:08:19.089
In study after study, in countries ranging
from Bangladesh to the United States,

00:08:19.113 --> 00:08:23.850
between 20 and 60 percent of the people
in the sex trade who were surveyed

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:28.542
said that they had been raped or assaulted
by the police in the past year alone.
