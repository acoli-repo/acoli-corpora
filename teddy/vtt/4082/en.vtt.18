their striking trafficked workers.

00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:06.472
If those workers run away,

00:09:06.496 --> 00:09:11.208
they risk becoming part of the great mass
of undocumented workers

00:09:11.232 --> 00:09:14.684
who are also subject to the whims
of law enforcement if they're caught.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.860
Law enforcement is supposed to identify
victims and prosecute traffickers.

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:28.719
But out of an estimated 21 million victims
of human trafficking in the world,

00:09:28.743 --> 00:09:33.159
they have helped and identified
fewer than 50,000 people.
