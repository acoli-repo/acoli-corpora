As a journalist, I really care about how
we relate to each other through language,

00:04:34.396 --> 00:04:38.087
and the way we tell that story,
with all the gory, violent detail,

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:43.149
the salacious aspects -- I call that
"look at her scars" journalism.

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:46.040
We use that story to convince ourselves

00:04:46.064 --> 00:04:50.678
that human trafficking is a bad man
doing a bad thing to an innocent girl.

00:04:51.328 --> 00:04:53.224
That story lets us off the hook.

00:04:53.248 --> 00:04:56.986
It takes away all the societal context
that we might be indicted for,

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.169
for the structural inequality,
or the poverty,

00:04:59.193 --> 00:05:00.946
or the barriers to migration.
