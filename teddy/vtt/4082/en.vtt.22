00:10:57.953 --> 00:11:02.099
to make thousands in recruitment fees
for this company, Global Horizons.

00:11:02.776 --> 00:11:04.604
But once they were brought over,

00:11:04.628 --> 00:11:06.653
their passports were confiscated.

00:11:06.677 --> 00:11:09.298
Some of the men were beaten
and held at gunpoint.

00:11:09.791 --> 00:11:12.413
They worked so hard
they fainted in the fields.

00:11:14.138 --> 00:11:16.362
This case hit me so hard.

00:11:17.572 --> 00:11:19.653
After I came back home,

00:11:19.677 --> 00:11:23.702
I was wandering through the grocery store,
and I froze in the produce department.

00:11:24.688 --> 00:11:28.084
I was remembering the over-the-top meals
the Global Horizons survivors

00:11:28.108 --> 00:11:30.935
would make for me every time
I showed up to interview them.
