to bail out all the guilt
and shame and rage I felt

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:05.133
over everything she had endured
to care for me for as long as she had --

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.949
I thought if I said those words to her,
I would never stop crying again.

00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:14.304
Because she had saved me.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.481
And I had not saved her.

00:03:20.877 --> 00:03:24.321
I'm a journalist, and I've been writing
and researching human trafficking

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:26.446
for the past eight years or so,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.421
and even so, I never put together
this personal story
