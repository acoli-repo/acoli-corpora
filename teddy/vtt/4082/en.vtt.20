I've heard one expert say that trafficking
happens where need meets greed.

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:09.793
I'd like to add one more element to that.

00:10:10.772 --> 00:10:14.927
Trafficking happens in sectors where
workers are excluded from protections,

00:10:14.951 --> 00:10:17.239
and denied the right to organize.

00:10:17.874 --> 00:10:20.035
Trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum.

00:10:20.538 --> 00:10:24.045
It happens in systematically
degraded work environments.

00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:26.400
You might be thinking,

00:10:26.424 --> 00:10:29.525
oh, she's talking about failed states,
or war-torn states, or --

00:10:29.549 --> 00:10:31.652
I'm actually talking
about the United States.
