I am hugely disappointed.

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:04.641
Partly because we don't even talk
about the problem right at all.

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:07.987
When I say "human trafficking,"

00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:11.251
most of you probably don't think
about someone like my auntie.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.551
You probably think
about a young girl or woman,

00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:18.007
who's been brutally forced
into prostitution by a violent pimp.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.625
That is real suffering,
and that is a real story.

00:04:23.578 --> 00:04:24.861
That story makes me angry

00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:28.326
for far more than just the reality
of that situation, though.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.372
As a journalist, I really care about how
we relate to each other through language,
