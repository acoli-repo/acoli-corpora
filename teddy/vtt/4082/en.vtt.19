00:09:28.743 --> 00:09:33.159
they have helped and identified
fewer than 50,000 people.

00:09:33.742 --> 00:09:35.361
That's like comparing

00:09:35.385 --> 00:09:39.256
the population of the world
to the population of Los Angeles,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.581
proportionally speaking.

00:09:41.997 --> 00:09:48.419
As for convictions, out of an estimated
5,700 convictions in 2013,

00:09:48.443 --> 00:09:51.278
fewer than 500 were for labor trafficking.

00:09:51.976 --> 00:09:53.668
Keep in mind that labor trafficking

00:09:53.692 --> 00:09:56.858
accounts for 68 percent
of all trafficking,

00:09:56.882 --> 00:09:59.945
but fewer than 10 percent
of the convictions.
