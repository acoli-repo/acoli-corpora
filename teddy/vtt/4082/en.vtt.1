It sounded like the setup to a joke,
but I knew she was serious.

00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:33.200
Because when I first started seeing her,

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:35.830
I was trying to be
the funniest person in the room.

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:40.012
And I would try and crack these jokes,
but she caught on to me really quickly,

00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:43.813
and whenever I tried to make a joke,
she would look at me and say,

00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:46.967
"That is actually really sad."

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:48.888
(Laughter)

00:00:48.912 --> 00:00:50.088
It's terrible.

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:54.044
So I knew I had to be serious,
and I asked my parents

00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:56.642
who had actually raised me
until I was three?

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.040
And to my surprise, they said

00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:02.814
my primary caregiver had been
a distant relative of the family.
