About 10 years ago, I went through
a little bit of a hard time.

00:00:04.175 --> 00:00:06.449
So I decided to go see a therapist.

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:10.195
I had been seeing her for a few months,
when she looked at me one day and said,

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.063
"Who actually raised you
until you were three?"

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:17.146
Seemed like a weird question.
I said, "My parents."

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.148
And she said, "I don't think
that's actually the case;

00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:22.329
because if it were,

00:00:22.353 --> 00:00:26.175
we'd be dealing with things that are
far more complicated than just this."

00:00:26.906 --> 00:00:30.487
It sounded like the setup to a joke,
but I knew she was serious.
