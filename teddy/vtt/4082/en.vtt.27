00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:32.974
saying that it was up to all of us
to learn everything we can

00:13:32.998 --> 00:13:36.808
about the labor and supply chains
of the products that we support.

00:13:37.909 --> 00:13:39.601
I totally agree.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.773
What would happen
if each one of us decided

00:13:43.797 --> 00:13:46.354
that we are no longer going
to support companies

00:13:46.378 --> 00:13:49.944
if they don't eliminate exploitation
from their labor and supply chains?

00:13:50.326 --> 00:13:53.027
If we demanded laws calling for the same?

00:13:53.729 --> 00:13:56.627
If all the CEOs out there decided

00:13:56.651 --> 00:14:00.153
that they were going to go through
their businesses and say, "no more"?
