00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:30.528
I loved her, but [with] the ferocity
that a child has sometimes

00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:35.470
before she understands that love
also requires letting go.

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:40.243
But my clearest and sharpest
memory of my auntie,

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.230
is also one of my first
memories of life at all.

00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:49.099
I remember her being beaten and slapped
by another member of my family.

00:01:49.686 --> 00:01:52.583
I remember screaming hysterically
and wanting it to stop,

00:01:52.607 --> 00:01:55.381
as I did every single time it happened,

00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:58.142
for things as minor as wanting
to go out with her friends,

00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.610
or being a little late.
