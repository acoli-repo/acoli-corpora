00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.421
and even so, I never put together
this personal story

00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:33.491
with my professional life
until pretty recently.

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:37.553
I think this profound disconnect
actually symbolizes

00:03:37.577 --> 00:03:40.284
most of our understanding
about human trafficking.

00:03:40.977 --> 00:03:46.604
Because human trafficking is far more
prevalent, complex and close to home

00:03:46.628 --> 00:03:48.240
than most of us realize.

00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:51.369
I spent time in jails and brothels,

00:03:51.393 --> 00:03:54.951
interviewed hundreds of survivors
and law enforcement, NGO workers.

00:03:55.578 --> 00:03:58.555
And when I think about what we've done
about human trafficking,

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.483
I am hugely disappointed.
