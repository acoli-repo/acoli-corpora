Other drugs combat male pattern baldness

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.973
by blocking the conversion 
of testosterone to DHT

00:04:06.973 --> 00:04:10.386
so that it doesn't affect 
those sensitive follicles.

00:04:10.386 --> 00:04:13.914
Stem cells also play a role in regulating
the growth cycle,

00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:17.250
and so scientists are investigating
whether they can manipulate

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.263
the activity of these cells to encourage
follicles to start producing hair again.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.423
And in the meantime,

00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:27.240

or considering baldness,
