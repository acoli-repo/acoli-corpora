00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:31.371
After this productive period,

00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:36.316
signals within the skin instruct
some follicles to enter a new phase

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:39.819
known as catagen, or the regressing stage,

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.413
causing hair follicles to shrink
to a fraction of their original length.

00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:47.299
Catagen lasts for
about two to three weeks

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.993
and cuts blood supply to the follicle,
creating a club hair,

00:01:51.993 --> 00:01:54.147
meaning it's ready to be shed.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:57.609
Finally, hairs enter telogen,
the resting phase,

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:59.894
which lasts for ten to twelve weeks,

00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:03.978
and affects about 
5-15% of your scalp follicles.
