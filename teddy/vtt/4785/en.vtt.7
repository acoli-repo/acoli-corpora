Some women experience this
after childbirth.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.980
Follicles might also lose the ability
to go into anagen, the growth phase.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.892
People going through chemotherapy
treatment temporarily experience this.

00:03:40.892 --> 00:03:42.825
But while balding may look permanent,

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:46.520
scientific investigation 
has revealed the opposite.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.253
Below the skin's surface,

00:03:48.253 --> 00:03:52.502
the roots that give rise to our hair
actually remain alive.

00:03:52.502 --> 00:03:53.965
Using this knowledge,

00:03:53.965 --> 00:03:57.342
scientists have developed drugs
that shorten the resting phase,

00:03:57.342 --> 00:04:00.105
and force follicles into anagen.
