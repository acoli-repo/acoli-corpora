Secondly, the structures 
that drive hair growth

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:02.076
are called hair follicles,

00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:06.572
a network of complex organs
that forms before we're born,

00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:10.260
and grows hair in an everlasting cycle.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.483
This cycle has three main phases.

00:01:12.483 --> 00:01:15.728
The first is anagen, the growth phase,

00:01:15.728 --> 00:01:20.741
which up to 90% of your hair follicles
are experiencing right now,

00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:24.980
causing them to push up hair
at a rate of one centimeter per month.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.573
Anagen can last for two to seven years,
depending on your genes.

00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:31.371
After this productive period,
