Scientists have long pondered,

00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:35.322
"Why do some people lose their hair,
and how can we bring it back?"

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:41.643
The full-headed among us have about
100,000 to 150,000 hairs on our scalps,

00:00:41.643 --> 00:00:45.566
and scientists have discovered two things
about this dense thicket.

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:50.194
Firstly, the sprouting hair we see
is mostly made up of keratin,

00:00:50.194 --> 00:00:54.745
the protein leftover from dead cells
that are forced upwards

00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:57.319
as new cells grow beneath them.

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:00.119
Secondly, the structures 
that drive hair growth
