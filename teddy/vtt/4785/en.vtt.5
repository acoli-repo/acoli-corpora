00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:31.594
and in people with this condition,

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:36.983
follicles become incredibly sensitive
to the effects of dihydrotestosterone,

00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:40.014
a hormonal product 
made from testosterone.

00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:45.052
DHT causes shrinkage 
in these overly sensitive follicles,

00:02:45.052 --> 00:02:47.750
making hair shorter and wispier.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.804
But loss isn't sudden.

00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:54.042
It happens gradually, along a metric
known as the Norwood Scale,

00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:57.287
which describes the severity of hair loss.

00:02:57.287 --> 00:02:59.758
First, hair recedes along the temples,

00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:04.574
then hair on the crown begins to thin
in a circular pattern.
