00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, these are

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the Dark Ages.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And the Dark Ages are the time between

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when you put away the LEGO

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for the last time as a kid,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Started out with my then four-year-old:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
"Oh, should buy the kid some LEGO.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That stuff's cool."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Walked into the LEGO store.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Bought him this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's totally appropriate for a four-year-old.
