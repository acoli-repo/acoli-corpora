00:01:55.167 --> 00:02:00.333
But lately, executive function has become
a huge self-improvement buzzword.

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:04.393
People think you can improve it
through brain-training iPhone apps

00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:05.851
and computer games,

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.125
or by practicing it in a specific way,
like playing chess.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.309
And researchers are trying
to train it in the lab

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.268
in the hopes of improving it
and other things related to it,

00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:17.583
like intelligence.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:20.809
Well, I'm here to tell you

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:24.768
that this way of thinking
about executive function is all wrong.

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:28.351
Brain training won't improve
executive function in a broad sense

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:31.601
because it involves
exercising it in a narrow way,
