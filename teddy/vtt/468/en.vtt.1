00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:30.708
a lot of something
called executive function.

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:36.768
Executive function is our amazing ability
to consciously control our thoughts,

00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:38.601
emotions and actions

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:40.643
in order to achieve goals ...

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:42.250
like learning how to drive.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.018
It's what we use when we need
to break away from habit,

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:48.542
inhibit our impulses and plan ahead.

00:00:49.708 --> 00:00:52.500
But we can see it most clearly
when things go wrong.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.643
Like, have you ever accidentally
poured orange juice on your cereal?

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:58.726
(Laughter)

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.643
