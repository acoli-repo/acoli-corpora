00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:01.684
And what I found was that kids
who believed that their group waited

00:07:01.708 --> 00:07:05.125
tended to prefer other kids
who liked to wait for things.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:10.083
So learning what their group did
made them value waiting more.

00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.726
And not only that,

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.059
these kids likely used executive function

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:18.143
to generate strategies
to help themselves wait,

00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:21.643
like sitting on their hands
or turning away from the marshmallow

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:24.768
or singing a song to distract themselves.

00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:26.417
(Laughter)

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.059
So what this all shows
is just how much context matters.
