Well, so with this result
I still didn't know

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.750
if they were just copying their group
or if it was something deeper than that.

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:37.018
So I brought in some more kids,

00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:42.059
and after the marshmallow test,
I showed them pictures of pairs of kids,

00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:45.768
and I told them, "One of these kids
likes to have things right away,

00:06:45.792 --> 00:06:47.768
like cookies and stickers.

00:06:47.792 --> 00:06:49.309

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:51.809
so that they can have
more of these things."

00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:53.101
And then I asked them,

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:55.268
"Which one of these two kids
do you like more

00:06:55.292 --> 00:06:57.083
and who would you want to play with?"

00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:01.684
And what I found was that kids
who believed that their group waited
