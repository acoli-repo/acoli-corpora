00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.643
Or, ever start scrolling on Facebook

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.809
and suddenly realize
you've missed a meeting?

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.143
(Laughter)

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:05.809
Or maybe this one's more familiar:

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:08.518
Ever plan to stop at the store
on the way home from work

00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:11.393
and then drive all the way home
instead on autopilot?

00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:13.601
(Laughter)

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:16.018
These things happen to everyone.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.976
And we usually call it absentmindedness,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.309
but what's really happening

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:22.458
is we're experiencing a lapse
in executive function.

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:28.018
So we use executive function
every day in all aspects of our lives.

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:29.476
And over the past 30 years,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.268
researchers have found
that it predicts all kinds of good things
