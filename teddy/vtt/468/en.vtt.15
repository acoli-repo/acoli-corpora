00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.059
So what this all shows
is just how much context matters.

00:07:32.083 --> 00:07:35.643
It's not that these kids
had good executive function or bad,

00:07:35.667 --> 00:07:38.667
it's that the context
helped them use it better.

00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:43.542
So what does this mean
for you and for your kids?

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.143
Well, let's say that you want
to learn Spanish.

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:48.893
You could try changing your context

00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:52.851
and surrounding yourself
with other people who also want to learn,

00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:55.893
and even better if these are people
that you really like.

00:07:55.917 --> 00:07:59.333
That way you'll be more motivated
to use executive function.
