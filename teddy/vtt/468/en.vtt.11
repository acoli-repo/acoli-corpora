00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:32.684
but the key question is:
How long can they wait?

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:33.809
(Laughter)

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:37.833
Now, I added a twist
to look at the effects of context.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.726
I told each kid that they were in a group,

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.393
like the green group,

00:05:43.417 --> 00:05:46.559
and I even gave them
a green T-shirt to wear.

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:50.684
And I said, "Your group
waited for two marshmallows,

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:53.059
and this other group, the orange group,

00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:54.351
did not."

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:55.851
Or I said the opposite:

00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:57.934
"Your group didn't wait
for two marshmallows

00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.018
and this other group did."
