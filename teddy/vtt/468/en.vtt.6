00:02:58.083 --> 00:03:00.309
to measure executive function
in young children

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:02.917
called the "dimensional change card sort."

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.434
In this task, kids have to sort
cards in one way --

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:08.976
like by shape --

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.768
over and over until they build up a habit.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:13.976
And then they're asked to switch

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.851
and sort the same cards in another way,

00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:18.208
like by color.

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:22.309
Now, really young kids struggle with this.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:25.934
Three- and four-year-olds will usually
keep sorting the cards in the old way

00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.333
no matter how many times you remind
them of what they should be doing.
