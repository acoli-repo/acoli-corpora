00:00:00.708 --> 00:00:03.559
So I have a confession to make.

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:05.875
I only recently learned how to drive.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.292
And it was really hard.

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:12.184
Now, this wasn't an older brain thing.

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:15.476
Do you remember what it was like
when you first learned how to drive?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.458
When every decision you made
was so conscious and deliberate?

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:22.667
I'd come home from my lessons
completely wiped out mentally.

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:26.893
Now, as a cognitive scientist
I know that this is because I was using

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:30.708
a lot of something
called executive function.
