Now let me give you an example
from my research.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.393
I recently brought in a bunch of kids
to do the classic marshmallow test,

00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:08.601
which is a measure
of delay of gratification

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:11.750
that also likely requires
a lot of executive function.

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.559
So you may have heard about this test,

00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:16.601
but basically, kids are given a choice.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:18.934
They can have one marshmallow right away,

00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.351
or if they can wait for me
to go to the other room

00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:22.893
and get more marshmallows,

00:05:22.917 --> 00:05:24.708
they can have two instead.

00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:29.434
Now, most kids really want
that second marshmallow,

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:32.684
but the key question is:
How long can they wait?
