00:03:58.542 --> 00:04:00.351
(Laughter)

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:02.643
Stars go here, trucks go here.

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:03.917
Here's a star.

00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:07.559
(Laughter)

00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:09.476
SB: So it's really compelling,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.601
and it's really obvious when she fails
to use her executive function.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:14.893
But here's the thing:

00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:17.642
we could train her on this task
and others like it

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:19.684
and eventually she'd improve,

00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:20.976
but does that mean

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.268
that she would've improved
her executive function outside of the lab?

00:04:24.292 --> 00:04:27.726
No, because in the real world,
she'll need to use executive function

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.226
to do a lot more than switching
between shape and color.
