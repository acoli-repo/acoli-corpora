What's in the box?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Whatever it is must be pretty important,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
because I've traveled with it, moved it,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
from apartment to apartment to apartment.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
(Laughter)

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
(Applause)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Sound familiar?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Did you know that we Americans

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
have about three times the amount of space

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we did 50 years ago?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Three times.
