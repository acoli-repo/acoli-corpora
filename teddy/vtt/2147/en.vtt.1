♫ Friends and lovers and lonely sunbathers ♫

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
♫ Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January ♫

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
♫ I brought the iced tea; ♫

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
♫ Did you bring the bug spray? ♫

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
♫ The flies are the size of your head ♫

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
♫ Next to the palm tree, ♫

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
♫ Did you see the 'gators ♫
