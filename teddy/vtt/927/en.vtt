00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let me begin with four words

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that will provide the context for this week,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
four words that will come to define

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
this century.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here they are:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The Earth is full.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's full of us, it's full of our stuff,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
full of our waste, full of our demands.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Yes, we are a brilliant and creative species,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but we've created a little too much stuff --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so much that our economy is now bigger

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
than its host, our planet.
