00:00:01.396 --> 00:00:05.716
Anyone who knows me
knows that I love to talk.

00:00:05.756 --> 00:00:07.916
I'm a chatterbox, just ask anyone.

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:12.196
I like to think that I'm pretty good
at building rapport with my clients.

00:00:12.556 --> 00:00:15.596
And having spent just under a decade
working as a lawyer,

00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:18.636
I tell you, this is one skill
that really came in handy.

00:00:19.196 --> 00:00:22.196
Now, I remember this one
interstate client in particular.

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:24.556
We got on like a house on fire.

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:28.516
We spent months corresponding over email
and chatting over the phone.

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:33.116
And then the day finally came
when we would meet face to face.
