In the 1930s, American industrialist 
Henry Ford had one overwhelming obsession:

00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:14.218
soybeans.

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.222
He extracted their oil to make enamel 
for painting his cars.

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:21.350
He crushed them into powder
to make plastic parts.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.438
And he encouraged American farmers 
to grow as much of the plant as possible.

00:00:25.438 --> 00:00:28.024
But he wasn’t just feeding soy 
to machines.

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:31.903
At the Chicago World’s Fair,
he hosted a soy-centric feast.
