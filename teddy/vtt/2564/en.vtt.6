00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.000
did so just one year before my birth.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.696
As I journeyed along my path,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.576
I encountered the best and worst
of life at an intersection:

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.416
the tremendous opportunity to self-define,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.976
the collision of expectation
and experience,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.736
the exhilaration
of victorious breakthroughs

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.456
and, sometimes,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.520
the explosive pain of regeneration.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.096
I began my college experience
just after my family had fallen apart.
