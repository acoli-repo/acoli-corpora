Beyond the physical
landscape of our planet,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.496
some of the most famous celestial images
are of intersections.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.896
Stars are born at the messy
intersection of gas and dust,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.416
instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.776
Stars die by this same intersection,
this time flung outward

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.176
in a violent collision of smaller atoms,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.920
intersecting and efficiently fusing
into altogether new and heavier things.
