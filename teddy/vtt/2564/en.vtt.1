00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.375
Some of the great intersections
of the world come to mind,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.616
like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.096
or Times Square in New York City,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.056
both bustling with the excitement
of a seemingly endless stream of people.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.576
Other intersections,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.456
like the Edmund Pettus Bridge
in Selma, Alabama,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.176
or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court
in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.136
because of the tremendous energy
at the intersection of human beings,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.096
ideologies and the ongoing
struggle for justice.
