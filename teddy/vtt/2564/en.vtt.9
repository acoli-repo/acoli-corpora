00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.376
I remember thinking

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.096
I was looking directly back
at the little girl

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.936
who first dared to dream this dream.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.896
I immediately wrote to the Society

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.816
and requested my personal
copy of the poster,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.216
which to this day

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.096
I described to them in the email
my educational path,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.016
and my desire to find myself again
in pursuit of the PhD.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.776
They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt
University Bridge Program,
