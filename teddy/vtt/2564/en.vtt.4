00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.656
I am both black and a woman.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.016
Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.536
this robust combination of knowing
results in a shining example

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.056
of the explosive fusion of identities.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.176
I am also an astrophysicist.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.256
I study blazars, supermassive,
hyperactive black holes

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.936
that sit at the centers
of massive galaxies

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.816
and shoot out jets
nearby those black holes

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.576
at speeds approaching the speed of light

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.240
in a process we are still trying
to completely understand.
