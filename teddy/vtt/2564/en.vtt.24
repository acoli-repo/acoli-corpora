00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.776
on the most pressing issues of our time:

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.976
things like educational inequities,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.976
police brutality, HIV/AIDS,
climate change, genetic editing,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.376
artificial intelligence
and Mars exploration.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.696
This is to say nothing of the things
we haven't even thought of yet.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.216
Women of color in STEM
occupy some of the toughest

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.016
and most exciting sociotechnological

Thus, we are uniquely positioned

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.816
to contribute to
and drive these conversations
