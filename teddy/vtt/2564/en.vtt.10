00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.776
They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt
University Bridge Program,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.576
itself an intersection
of the master's and PhD degrees

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.280
at two institutions.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.056
After two years out of school,
they accepted me into the program,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.496
and I found myself again
on the path to the PhD.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.976
After receiving my master's at Fisk,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.336
I went on to Yale to complete my PhD.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.496
Once I was physically occupying
the space that would ultimately give way

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.496
to my childhood aspirations,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.696
I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD.
