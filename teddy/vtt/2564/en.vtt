Great things happen at intersections.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.016
In fact, I would argue
that some of the most interesting things

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.816
of the human experience
occur at the intersections,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.496
in the liminal space,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.576
where by liminal
I mean the space in-between.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.296
There's freedom in that in-between,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.096
freedom to create from the indefiniteness
of not-quite-here, not-quite-there,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.336
a new self-definition.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.375
Some of the great intersections
of the world come to mind,
