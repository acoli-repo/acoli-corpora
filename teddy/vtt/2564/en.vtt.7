00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.096
I began my college experience
just after my family had fallen apart.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.736
Our financial situation disintegrated

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.176
just after my father's
departure from our lives.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.096
This thrust my mother, my sister and I

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.096
out of the relative comfort
of middle-class life

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.496
and into the almost constant struggle
to make ends meet.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.336
Thus, I was one of roughly
60 percent of women of color

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.216
who find finances to be a major barrier
to their educational goals.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.856
Thankfully, Norfolk State University
provided me with full funding,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.816
and I was able to achieve
my bachelor's in physics.
