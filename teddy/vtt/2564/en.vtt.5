in a process we are still trying
to completely understand.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.696
I have dreamed
of becoming an astrophysicist

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.176
since I was 12 years old.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.576
I had no idea that at that time,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.296
according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive
of African-American women in physics,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.656
only 18 black women in the United States
had ever earned a PhD

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.656
in a physics-related discipline,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.336
and that the first black woman to graduate
with a PhD in an astronomy-related field

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.000
did so just one year before my birth.
