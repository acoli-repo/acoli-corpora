such that its true richness
cannot be appreciated

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.736
without considering
the liminal space between disciplines.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.536
Science, the pursuit
of understanding the physical world

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.656
by way of chemistry, physics, biology,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.456
cannot be accomplished
in the absence of mathematics.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.536
Engineering requires the application
of basic science and math

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.576
to the lived experience.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.296
Technology sits firmly
on the foundation of math,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.656
engineering and science.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.696
Math itself serves
the critical role of Rosetta Stone,
