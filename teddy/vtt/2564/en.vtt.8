00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.816
and I was able to achieve
my bachelor's in physics.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.856
After graduation, and despite knowing
that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.056
I fell through the cracks.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.176
It was a poster that saved my dream,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.976
and some really incredible
people and programs.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.616
The American Physical Society
had this beautiful poster

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.336
encouraging students of color
to become physicists.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.856
It was striking to me
because it featured a young black girl,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.656
probably around 12 years old,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.720
looking studiously
at some physics equations.
