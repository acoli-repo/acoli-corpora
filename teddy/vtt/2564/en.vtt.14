or just people of color face.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.576

women of color in STEM,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.496
who are inexorably, unapologetically

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.320
living as the inseparable
sum of identities.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.576

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.856
such that its true richness
cannot be appreciated
