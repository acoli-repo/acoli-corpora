00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.096
who finds herself resting
at the blessed intersection

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.135
of race and gender,

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.120
that you can be anything you want to be.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.655
My personal hope is
that you'll become an astrophysicist,

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.736
but beyond that, anything you want.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.816
Do not think for one minute

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.096
that because you are who you are,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.656
you cannot be
who you imagine yourself to be.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.136
Hold fast to those dreams

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.840
and let them carry you
into a world you can't even imagine.
