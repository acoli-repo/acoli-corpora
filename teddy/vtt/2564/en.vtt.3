We can all think of intersections
that have special meaning to us.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.576
To be intersectional, then,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.400
is to occupy a position
at an intersection.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.976
I've lived the entirety of my life
in the in-between,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.256
in the liminal space
between dreams and reality,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.576
race and gender,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.616
poverty and plenty,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.696
science and society.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.656
I am both black and a woman.
