00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:30.445
on both sides.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.338
But starting with a theoretical
formulation of a problem

00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:38.859
can unleash numerous opportunities
for testing hypotheses

00:06:38.883 --> 00:06:42.122
and simulating scenarios
and therapeutic interventions,

00:06:42.146 --> 00:06:44.216
all in a completely safe way.

00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:50.152
It can identify gaps in knowledge
and logical inconsistencies

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:53.015
and can help guide us
as to where we should keep looking

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:54.934
and where there may be a dead end.

00:06:55.632 --> 00:06:56.879
In other words:

00:06:56.903 --> 00:07:00.397
mathematical modeling
can help us answer questions
