00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:31.121
identifying which one or ones
are causing the discrepancy.

00:05:31.637 --> 00:05:34.993
And then we can fill this newly
identified gap in knowledge

00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:37.732
using both experimental
and theoretical approaches.

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.520
Of course, any ecosystem
is extremely complex,

00:05:41.544 --> 00:05:45.387
and trying to describe all the moving
parts is not only very difficult,

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:47.073
but also not very informative.

00:05:47.518 --> 00:05:49.584
There's also the issue of timescales,

00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:53.276
because some processes take place
on a scale of seconds, some minutes,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.248
some days, months and years.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:58.471
It may not always be possible
to separate those out experimentally.

00:05:59.143 --> 00:06:02.527
And some things happen
so quickly or so slowly
