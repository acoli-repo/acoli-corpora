00:05:59.143 --> 00:06:02.527
And some things happen
so quickly or so slowly

00:06:02.551 --> 00:06:05.271
that you may physically
never be able to measure them.

00:06:05.295 --> 00:06:07.583
But as mathematicians,

00:06:07.607 --> 00:06:13.252
we have the power to zoom in
on any subsystem in any timescale

00:06:13.276 --> 00:06:15.400
and simulate effects of interventions

00:06:15.424 --> 00:06:18.125
that take place in any timescale.

00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:22.876
Of course, this isn't the work
of a modeler alone.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.189
It has to happen in close
collaboration with biologists.

00:06:26.213 --> 00:06:29.217
And it does demand
some capacity of translation

00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:30.445
on both sides.
