00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:01.792
I am a translator.

00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:05.705
I translate from biology into mathematics

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:06.879
and vice versa.

00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:09.378
I write mathematical models

00:00:09.402 --> 00:00:12.249
which, in my case, are systems
of differential equations,

00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:14.220
to describe biological mechanisms,

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:15.402
such as cell growth.

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:17.970
Essentially, it works like this.

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:21.042
First, I identify the key elements

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.843
that I believe may be driving
behavior over time

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:25.406
of a particular mechanism.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.121
Then, I formulate assumptions

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:31.031
about how these elements
interact with each other
