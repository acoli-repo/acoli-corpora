00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:31.031
about how these elements
interact with each other

00:00:31.055 --> 00:00:32.392
and with their environment.

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:34.688
It may look something like this.

00:00:34.712 --> 00:00:38.029
Then, I translate
these assumptions into equations,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.434
which may look something like this.

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:43.324
Finally, I analyze my equations

00:00:43.348 --> 00:00:46.449
and translate the results back
into the language of biology.

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:50.576
A key aspect of mathematical modeling

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.508
is that we, as modelers,
do not think about what things are;

00:00:54.532 --> 00:00:56.387
we think about what they do.

00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:58.900
We think about relationships
between individuals,

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.810
whether they be cells, animals or people,
