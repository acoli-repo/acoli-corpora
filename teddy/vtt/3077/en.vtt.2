00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.810
whether they be cells, animals or people,

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:04.882
and how they interact with each other
and with their environment.

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:06.979
Let me give you an example.

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:11.522
What do foxes and immune cells
have in common?

00:01:12.793 --> 00:01:14.252
They're both predators,

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:17.467
except foxes feed on rabbits,

00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:20.821
and immune cells feed on invaders,
such as cancer cells.

00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:23.618
But from a mathematical point of view,

00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:27.798
a qualitatively same system
of predator-prey type equations

00:01:27.822 --> 00:01:31.067
will describe interactions
between foxes and rabbits
