00:03:58.345 --> 00:04:00.241
and to reduce its cost,

00:04:00.265 --> 00:04:02.782
the real intent, of course,
is to save lives.

00:04:03.278 --> 00:04:05.049
And that's what I try to do

00:04:05.073 --> 00:04:07.820
through mathematical modeling
applied to biology,

00:04:07.844 --> 00:04:10.315
and in particular,
to the development of drugs.

00:04:10.895 --> 00:04:14.951
It's a field that until relatively
recently has remained somewhat marginal,

00:04:14.975 --> 00:04:16.427
but it has matured.

00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:19.600
And there are now very well-developed
mathematical methods,

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:21.523
a lot of preprogrammed tools,

00:04:21.547 --> 00:04:23.043
including free ones,

00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:27.114
and an ever-increasing amount
of computational power available to us.

00:04:28.718 --> 00:04:32.117
The power and beauty
of mathematical modeling
