00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:01.758
you can think about cancer itself
as an ecosystem,

00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:06.069
where heterogeneous populations of cells
compete and cooperate

00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:08.110
for space and nutrients,

00:03:08.134 --> 00:03:10.806
interact with predators --
the immune system --

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.071
migrate -- metastases --

00:03:13.095 --> 00:03:15.562
all within the ecosystem
of the human body.

00:03:16.221 --> 00:03:20.090
And what do we know about most
ecosystems from conservation biology?

00:03:20.643 --> 00:03:23.495
That one of the best ways
to extinguish species

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.471
is not to target them directly

00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:27.934
but to target their environment.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.950
And so, once we have identified
the key components
