00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:02.296
If our predictions match our observations,

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.347
great! -- we got it right,
so we can make further predictions

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.931
by changing this or that
aspect of the model.

00:05:08.733 --> 00:05:12.433
If, however, our predictions
do not match our observations,

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:15.042
that means that some
of our assumptions are wrong,

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:17.499
and so our understanding
of the key mechanisms

00:05:17.523 --> 00:05:18.962
of underlying biology

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:20.256
is still incomplete.

00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:23.191
Luckily, since this is a model,

00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:25.104
we control all the assumptions.

00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:27.268
So we can go through them, one by one,

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:31.121
identifying which one or ones
are causing the discrepancy.
