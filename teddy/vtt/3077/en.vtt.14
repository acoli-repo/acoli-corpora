00:06:56.903 --> 00:07:00.397
mathematical modeling
can help us answer questions

00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:02.809
that directly affect people's health --

00:07:03.942 --> 00:07:06.646
that affect each
person's health, actually --

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.346
because mathematical modeling will be key

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.204
to propelling personalized medicine.

00:07:12.112 --> 00:07:15.179
And it all comes down
to asking the right question

00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:17.786
and translating it
to the right equation ...

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.820
and back.

00:07:20.533 --> 00:07:21.684
Thank you.
