00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.464
to stealing the predator's food.

00:02:01.352 --> 00:02:03.914
This can have some very
interesting implications.

00:02:03.938 --> 00:02:08.760
For example, despite enormous successes
in the field of immunotherapy,

00:02:08.784 --> 00:02:11.245
there still remains
somewhat limited efficacy

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.811
when it comes solid tumors.

00:02:13.423 --> 00:02:15.982
But if you think about it ecologically,

00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:18.096
both cancer and immune cells --

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.720
the prey and the predator --

00:02:19.744 --> 00:02:22.775
require nutrients
such as glucose to survive.

00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:28.147
If cancer cells outcompete
the immune cells for shared nutrients

00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:29.964
in the tumor microenvironment,

00:02:29.988 --> 00:02:33.402
then the immune cells will physically
not be able to do their job.
