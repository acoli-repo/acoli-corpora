00:02:29.988 --> 00:02:33.402
then the immune cells will physically
not be able to do their job.

00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:37.159
This predator-prey-shared
resource type model

00:02:37.183 --> 00:02:39.480
is something I've worked on
in my own research.

00:02:39.504 --> 00:02:42.228
And it was recently shown experimentally

00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:46.306
that restoring the metabolic balance
in the tumor microenvironment --

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.861
that is, making sure
immune cells get their food --

00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:55.130
can give them, the predators, back
their edge in fighting cancer, the prey.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.779
This means that if you abstract a bit,

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:01.758
you can think about cancer itself
as an ecosystem,
