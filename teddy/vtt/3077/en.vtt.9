The power and beauty
of mathematical modeling

00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:34.782
lies in the fact
that it makes you formalize,

00:04:34.806 --> 00:04:36.893
in a very rigorous way,

00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:38.382
what we think we know.

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:40.348
We make assumptions,

00:04:40.372 --> 00:04:41.940
translate them into equations,

00:04:41.964 --> 00:04:43.275
run simulations,

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:45.072
all to answer the question:

00:04:45.096 --> 00:04:47.342
In a world where my assumptions are true,

00:04:47.366 --> 00:04:48.936
what do I expect to see?

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.976
It's a pretty simple conceptual framework.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.226
It's all about asking the right questions.

00:04:54.603 --> 00:04:58.698
But it can unleash numerous opportunities
for testing biological hypotheses.

00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:02.296
If our predictions match our observations,
