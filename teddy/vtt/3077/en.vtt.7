00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.950
And so, once we have identified
the key components

00:03:31.974 --> 00:03:33.618
of the tumor environment,

00:03:33.642 --> 00:03:35.590
we can propose hypotheses

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:38.908
and simulate scenarios
and therapeutic interventions

00:03:38.932 --> 00:03:42.357
all in a completely safe
and affordable way

00:03:42.381 --> 00:03:45.750
and target different components
of the microenvironment

00:03:45.774 --> 00:03:49.770
in such a way as to kill the cancer
without harming the host,

00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:51.364
such as me or you.

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:56.031
And so while the immediate
goal of my research

00:03:56.055 --> 00:03:58.321
is to advance research and innovation

00:03:58.345 --> 00:04:00.241
and to reduce its cost,
