00:01:27.822 --> 00:01:31.067
will describe interactions
between foxes and rabbits

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.865
and cancer and immune cells.

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.317
Predator-prey type systems
have been studied extensively

00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:37.610
in scientific literature,

00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:40.012
describing interactions
of two populations,

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:42.811
where survival of one depends
on consuming the other.

00:01:43.485 --> 00:01:46.105
And these same equations
provide a framework

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:48.440
for understanding
cancer-immune interactions,

00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:50.305
where cancer is the prey,

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.701
and the immune system is the predator.

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:56.757
And the prey employs all sorts of tricks
to prevent the predator from killing it,

00:01:56.781 --> 00:01:58.601
ranging from camouflaging itself

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.464
to stealing the predator's food.
