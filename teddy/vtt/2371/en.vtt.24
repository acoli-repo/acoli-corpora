00:11:57.831 --> 00:12:00.623
means that the challenge for new power is:

00:12:00.623 --> 00:12:03.162
how do you use institutional power

00:12:03.162 --> 00:12:05.233
without being institutionalized?


00:12:05.233 --> 00:12:07.866
One the other end of the spectra is Uber.

00:12:07.866 --> 00:12:09.250
Uber is an amazing,

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.303
highly scalable new power model.

00:12:11.303 --> 00:12:13.329
That network is getting denser and denser

00:12:13.329 --> 00:12:14.589
by the day.

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:16.748
But what's really interesting 
about Uber is

00:12:16.748 --> 00:12:20.489
it hasn't really adopted new power values.

00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:24.561
This is a real quote from 
the Uber CEO recently:

00:12:24.561 --> 00:12:29.009
He says, "Once we get rid of the dude 
in the car" — he means drivers —

00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:32.901
"Uber will be cheaper."
