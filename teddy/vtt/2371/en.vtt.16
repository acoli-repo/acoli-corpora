00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:02.323
like Lending Tree or Prosper,

00:08:02.323 --> 00:08:04.607
then you've figured out that
you don't need the bank,

00:08:04.607 --> 00:08:06.544
and who wants the bank, right?

00:08:06.544 --> 00:08:08.982
And so, that experience tends 
to embolden you

00:08:08.982 --> 00:08:11.919
it tends to make you want
more participation

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:14.264
across more aspects of your life.

00:08:14.264 --> 00:08:15.809
And what this gives rise to is

00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:17.380
a set of values.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.690
We talked about the models

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.284
that new power has engendered —

00:08:20.284 --> 00:08:22.116
the Airbnbs, the Kickstarters.

00:08:22.116 --> 00:08:23.645
What about the values?

00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:25.315
And this is an early sketch

00:08:25.315 --> 00:08:27.878
at what new power values look like.

00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:31.009
New power values prize
transparency above all else.
