00:03:28.664 --> 00:03:30.588
were meeting on the eve of the war,

00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:32.972
and I thought if I could 
flood them with faxes,

00:03:32.972 --> 00:03:34.050
we'll stop the war.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.243
Well, unsurprisingly,

00:03:36.243 --> 00:03:39.834
that campaign was wholly unsuccessful.

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:41.488
There are lots of reasons for that,

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:43.973
but there's no doubt that 
one sputtering fax machine

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.300
in Geneva was a little bit
of a bandwidth constraint

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.142
in terms of the ability to 
get a message to lots of people.

00:03:50.142 --> 00:03:54.172
And so, I went on to 
discover some better tools.

00:03:54.172 --> 00:03:56.814
I cofounded Avaaz, which uses the 
Internet to mobilize people

00:03:56.814 --> 00:03:59.412
and now has almost 
40 million members,

00:03:59.412 --> 00:04:01.972
and I now run Purpose, which 
is a home for these kinds of
