00:12:59.872 --> 00:13:01.166
And the challenge for Uber —

00:13:01.166 --> 00:13:03.093
this isn't an easy situation for them —

00:13:03.093 --> 00:13:06.389
is that they are locked into
a broader superstrcuture

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:08.074
that is really old power.

00:13:08.074 --> 00:13:11.082
They've raised more than a billion 
dollars in the capital markets.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.610
Those markets expect a financial return,

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.527
and they way you get a financial return

00:13:15.527 --> 00:13:17.924
is by squeezing and squeezing

00:13:17.924 --> 00:13:20.169
your users and your drivers

00:13:20.169 --> 00:13:21.464
for more and more value

00:13:21.464 --> 00:13:23.931
and giving that value to your investors.

00:13:23.931 --> 00:13:27.534
So the big question about the future 
of new power, in my view, is:

00:13:27.534 --> 00:13:30.093
Will that old power just emerge?
