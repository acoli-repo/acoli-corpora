WEBVTT

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:31.034
won more than 25 percent of the vote

00:05:31.034 --> 00:05:33.455
in recent Italian elections.

00:05:33.455 --> 00:05:34.817
This is Airbnb,

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:36.566
which in just a few years

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:38.728
has radically disrupted the hotel industry

00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:41.646
without owning a single
square foot of real estate.

00:05:41.646 --> 00:05:43.001
This is Kickstarter,

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:45.898
which we know has raised over a billion dollars

00:05:45.898 --> 00:05:48.319
from more than five million people.

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:50.249
Now, we're familiar with all of these models.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.450
But what's striking is the commonalities,

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.576
the structural features of 
these new models

00:05:55.576 --> 00:05:57.725
and how they differ from old power.

00:05:57.725 --> 00:05:59.394
Let's look a little bit at this.

00:05:59.394 --> 00:06:02.552
Old power is held like a currency.
