00:09:58.262 --> 00:10:00.951
still pursue a successful 
old power strategy.

00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:03.921
But one can argue that there's 
real vulnerabilites in that model.

00:10:03.921 --> 00:10:05.945
I think another interesting comparison

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:08.122
is that of the Obama campaign

00:10:08.122 --> 00:10:11.238
versus the Obama presidency.

00:10:11.238 --> 00:10:18.700
(Applause)

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.447
Now, I like President Obama,

00:10:20.447 --> 00:10:24.403
but he ran with new 
power at his back, right?

00:10:24.403 --> 00:10:26.230
And he said to people,


00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.203
we are the ones we've
been waiting for.

00:10:28.203 --> 00:10:29.654
And he used crowdfunding

00:10:29.654 --> 00:10:30.865
to power a campaign.
