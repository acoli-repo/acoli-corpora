00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:34.033
to make a national point of 
everyday corruption in India.

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.470
It's a really striking story.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.680
So this is me when I was 12 years old.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.392
I hope you see the resemblance.

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:42.317
And I was also an activist,

00:02:42.317 --> 00:02:44.557
and I have been an activist all my life.

00:02:44.557 --> 00:02:45.887
I had this really funny childhood

00:02:45.887 --> 00:02:47.910
where I traipsed around the world

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.704
meeting world leaders and 
Noble prize winners,

00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:52.990
talking about Third World debt,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.279
as it was then called,

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.813
and demilitarization.

00:02:55.813 --> 00:03:00.045
I was a very, very serious child.
