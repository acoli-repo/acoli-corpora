00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.438
Okay, that's pretty respectable.

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:02.375
But then he decides,

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.495
"Let me tweak my tactics a little bit."

00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:08.970
He says, "Why don't you leave
me a missed call?"

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.039
Now, for those of you who have
lived in the global South,

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.531
you'll know that missed calls

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:17.374
are a really critical part
of global mobile culture.

00:01:17.374 --> 00:01:18.488
I see people nodding.

00:01:18.488 --> 00:01:20.596
People leave missed calls all the time:

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:22.542
If you're running late for a meeting

00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:24.848
and you just want to let them
know that you're on the way,

00:01:24.848 --> 00:01:26.571
you leave them a missed call.

00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:28.497
If you're dating someone and 
you just want to say "I miss you"

00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:29.883
you leave them a missed call.

00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:32.427
So a note for a dating tip here,
