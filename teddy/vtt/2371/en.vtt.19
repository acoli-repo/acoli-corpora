00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:30.858
So the first is Apple.

00:09:30.858 --> 00:09:33.393
In this framework, we actually
described Apple

00:09:33.393 --> 00:09:35.515
as an old power company.

00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:37.169
That's because the ideology,

00:09:37.169 --> 00:09:39.457
the governing ideology of Apple

00:09:39.457 --> 00:09:42.331
is the ideology of the perfectionist

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.355
product designer in Cupertino.

00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:48.427
It's absolutely about that beautiful, 
perfect thing descending upon us

00:09:48.427 --> 00:09:49.778
in perfection.

00:09:49.778 --> 00:09:52.401
And it does not value, as a 
company, transparency.

00:09:52.401 --> 00:09:54.064
In fact, it's very secretive.

00:09:54.064 --> 00:09:56.890
Now, Apple is one of the most
succesful companies in the world.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.262
So this shows that you can


00:09:58.262 --> 00:10:00.951
still pursue a successful 
old power strategy.
