00:04:59.657 --> 00:05:01.779
in many sectors of our society.

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.656
So I want to introduce you to
this framework:

00:05:03.656 --> 00:05:05.876
Old power, meet new power.

00:05:05.876 --> 00:05:09.307
And I want to talk to you about
what new power is today.

00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:11.271
New power is the deployment

00:05:11.271 --> 00:05:14.460
of mass participation 
and peer coordination —

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.102
these are the two key elements —

00:05:16.102 --> 00:05:18.599
to create change and shift outcomes.

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.687
And we see new power all around us.

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:22.971
This is Beppe Grillo

00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:25.116
he was a populist Italian blogger

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:28.536
who, with a minimal political apparatus
and only some online tools,

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:31.034
won more than 25 percent of the vote
