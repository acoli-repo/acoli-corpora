00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:31.009
New power values prize
transparency above all else.

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:33.231
It's almost a religious 
belief in transparency,

00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:35.495
a belief that if you shine 
a light on something,

00:08:35.495 --> 00:08:36.926
it will be better.

00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:39.676
And remember that in the 20th 
century, this was not at all true.

00:08:39.676 --> 00:08:42.643
People thought that gentlemen
should sit behind closed doors

00:08:42.643 --> 00:08:44.925
and make comfortable agreements.

00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:48.330
New power values of informal,
networked governance.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.974
New power folks would never 
have invented the U.N. today,

00:08:50.974 --> 00:08:52.807
for better or worse.

00:08:52.807 --> 00:08:54.522
New power values participation,

00:08:54.522 --> 00:08:57.317
and new power is all about do-it-yourself.

00:08:57.317 --> 00:08:58.806
In fact, what's interesting 
about new power

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:02.519
is that it eschews some of 
the professionalization
