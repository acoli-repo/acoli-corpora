00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:30.653
And so, it's not at all clear

00:07:30.653 --> 00:07:32.743
that new power will be 
the inevitable victor.

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:35.686
That said, keep one thing in mind:


00:07:35.686 --> 00:07:38.575
We're at the beginning of a
very steep curve.

00:07:38.575 --> 00:07:40.216
So you think about some of 
these new power models, right?

00:07:40.216 --> 00:07:42.328
These were just like someone's

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.874
garage idea a few years ago,

00:07:44.874 --> 00:07:48.010
and now they're disrupting 
entire industries.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.679
And so, what's interesting
about new power,

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.695
is the way it feeds
on itself.

00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:54.719
Once you have an experience of new power,

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:56.909
you tend to expect and 
want more of it.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.789
So let's say you've used a
peer-to-peer lending platform

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:02.323
like Lending Tree or Prosper,
