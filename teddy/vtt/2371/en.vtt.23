Is new power kind of just 
riding the wave to glory?

00:11:32.273 --> 00:11:33.753
I would argue no.

00:11:33.753 --> 00:11:35.709
I would argue that there
are some very real challenges

00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:37.401
to new power in this nascent phase.

00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:40.903
Let's stick with the Occupy Wall Street
example for a moment.

00:11:40.903 --> 00:11:43.893
Occupy was this incredible example 
of new power,

00:11:43.893 --> 00:11:45.736

00:11:45.736 --> 00:11:48.267
And yet, it failed to consolidate.

00:11:48.267 --> 00:11:50.164
So the energy that it created

00:11:50.164 --> 00:11:51.605
was great for the meme phase,

00:11:51.605 --> 00:11:54.406
but they were so committed to participation,

00:11:54.406 --> 00:11:56.040
that they never got anything done.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.831
And in fact that model

00:11:57.831 --> 00:12:00.623
means that the challenge for new power is:
