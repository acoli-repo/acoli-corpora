WEBVTT

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:02.519
is that it eschews some of 
the professionalization

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:03.994
and specialization that was

00:09:03.994 --> 00:09:06.384
all the rage in the 20th century.

00:09:06.384 --> 00:09:08.194
So what's interesting about these

00:09:08.194 --> 00:09:10.160
new power values and these
new power models

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.455
is what they mean for organizations.

00:09:12.455 --> 00:09:14.963
So we've spent a bit of time thinking,

00:09:14.963 --> 00:09:17.229
how can we plot organizations

00:09:17.229 --> 00:09:19.493
on a two-by-two where, essentially,

00:09:19.493 --> 00:09:21.549
we look at new power values

00:09:21.549 --> 00:09:22.813
and new power models

00:09:22.813 --> 00:09:24.614
and see where different people sit?

00:09:24.614 --> 00:09:26.503
We started with a U.S. analysis,

00:09:26.503 --> 00:09:28.879
and let me show you 
some interesting findings.

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:30.858
So the first is Apple.
