00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:00.123
sometimes distorts outcomes

00:07:00.123 --> 00:07:01.198
and there are some things,

00:07:01.198 --> 00:07:03.297
like things, for example, 
in the medical profession

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:06.293
that we want new power 
to get nowhere near.

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:09.296
And thirdly, new power is not
the inevitable victor.

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:10.875
In fact, unsurprisingly,

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:13.864
as many of these new power
models get to scale,

00:07:13.864 --> 00:07:16.334
what you see is this massive pushback

00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:18.083
from the forces of old power.

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:20.292
Just look at this really 
interesting epic struggle

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:24.675
going on right now between 
Edward Snowden and the NSA.

00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:27.059
You'll note that only one of 
the two people on this slide

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:29.238
is currently in exile.

00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:30.653
And so, it's not at all clear
