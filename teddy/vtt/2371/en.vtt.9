00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:31.228
in the world.

00:04:31.228 --> 00:04:33.145
You ask any activist how 
to understand the world,

00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:35.619
and they'll say,
"Look at where the power is,

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:38.077
who has it, how it's shifting."

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:41.079
And I think we all sense that 
something big is happening.

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:43.523
So Henry Timms and I —

00:04:43.523 --> 00:04:45.371
Henry's a fellow movement builder —

00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:47.273
got talking one day and 
we started to think,

00:04:47.273 --> 00:04:49.274
how can we make sense of this new world?

00:04:49.274 --> 00:04:50.463
How can we describe it and give

00:04:50.463 --> 00:04:52.906
it a framework that makes it more useful?

00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:54.136
Because we realized that many

00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:56.950
of the lessons that we were
discovering in movements

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.657
actually applied all over the world

00:04:59.657 --> 00:05:01.779
in many sectors of our society.
