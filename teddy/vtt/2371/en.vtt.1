00:00:29.103 --> 00:00:31.025
he was using all of the traditional tactics

00:00:31.025 --> 00:00:33.241
that a good Gandhian organizer would use.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.297
So he was on a hunger strike,

00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:37.822
and Hazare realized through his hunger

00:00:37.822 --> 00:00:39.599
that actually maybe this time,

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:41.345
in the 21st century,

00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:42.834
a hunger strike wouldn't be enough.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:47.126
So he started playing around 
with mobile activism.

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:49.013
So the first thing he did 
is he said to people,

00:00:49.013 --> 00:00:51.084
"Okay, why don't you send me

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.845
a text message if you support

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:54.585
my campaign against corruption?"

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:56.854
So he does this, he 
gives people a short code,

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:59.470
and about 80,000 people do it.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.438
Okay, that's pretty respectable.
