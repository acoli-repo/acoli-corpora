00:03:59.412 --> 00:04:01.972
and I now run Purpose, which 
is a home for these kinds of

00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:04.268
technology-powered movements.

00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:06.088
So what's the moral of this story?

00:04:06.088 --> 00:04:07.596
Is the moral of this story,


00:04:07.596 --> 00:04:12.705
you know what, the fax is kind of
eclipsed by the mobile phone?

00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:14.935
This is another story of 
tech-determinism?

00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:18.125
Well, I would argue that there's 
actually more to it than that.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.798
I'd argue that in the last 20 years,

00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:23.036
something more fundamental has changed


00:04:23.036 --> 00:04:24.741
than just new tech.

00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:27.561
I would argue that there has
been a fundamental shift

00:04:27.561 --> 00:04:29.709
in the balance of power

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:31.228
in the world.
