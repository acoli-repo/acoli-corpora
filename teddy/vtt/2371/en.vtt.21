00:10:29.654 --> 00:10:30.865
to power a campaign.

00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:32.266
But when he got into office,

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:35.458
he governed like more or less 
all the other presidents did.

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:37.822
And this is a really interesting trend,

00:10:37.822 --> 00:10:39.820
is when new power gets powerful,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.391
what happens?


00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.155
So this is a framework you 
should look at

00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:44.647
and think about where your
own organization

00:10:44.647 --> 00:10:45.611
sits on it.

00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:47.184
And think about where it
should be 


00:10:47.184 --> 00:10:48.732
in five or 10 years.

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:51.197
So what do you do if you're old power?

00:10:51.197 --> 00:10:54.162
Well, if you're there 
thinking, in old power,

00:10:54.162 --> 00:10:56.062
this won't happen to us.

00:10:56.062 --> 00:11:01.229
Then just look at the Wikipedia
entry for Encyclopædia Britannica.
