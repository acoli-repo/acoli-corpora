00:02:55.813 --> 00:03:00.045
I was a very, very serious child.
(Laughter)

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:01.950
And back then,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.384
in the early '90s,

00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:07.214
I had a very cutting-edge
tech tool of my own:

00:03:07.214 --> 00:03:09.466
the fax.

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:11.644
And the fax was the 
tool of my activism.

00:03:11.644 --> 00:03:13.202
And at that time, it was the best way

00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:15.097

00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:19.981
I'll give you one example of a fax
campaign that I ran.

00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:22.077
It was the eve of the Gulf War

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:25.628
and I organized a global campaign 
to flood the hotel,

00:03:25.628 --> 00:03:27.109
the Intercontinental in Geneva,

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.664
where James Baker and Tariq Aziz

00:03:28.664 --> 00:03:30.588
were meeting on the eve of the war,
