So a note for a dating tip here,

00:01:32.427 --> 00:01:33.552
in some cultures,

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:34.834
if you want to please your lover,

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:39.335
you call them and hang up.
(Laughter)

00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:42.690
So why do people leave missed calls?

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.140
Well, the reason of course is that

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.898
they're trying to avoid charges

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:50.264
associated with making calls
and sending texts.

00:01:50.264 --> 00:01:54.320
So when Hazare asked people 
to leave him a missed call,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.997
let's have a little guess how 
many people actually did this?

00:01:59.997 --> 00:02:03.415
Thirty-five million.
