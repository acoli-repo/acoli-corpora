I assure you that having a 
social media strategy

00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:34.756
can enable you to do just as much download

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:37.618
as you used to do when you had the radio.

00:06:37.618 --> 00:06:41.146
Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,

00:06:41.146 --> 00:06:42.888
I assure you that his Facebook page

00:06:42.888 --> 00:06:47.015
has not embraced the power
of participation.

00:06:47.015 --> 00:06:50.413
New power is not inherently positive.

00:06:50.413 --> 00:06:52.702
In fact, this isn't an normative
argument that we're making,

00:06:52.702 --> 00:06:54.514
there are many good things 
about new power,

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:56.331
but it can produce bad outcomes.

00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:58.336
More participation, more peer coordination,

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:00.123
sometimes distorts outcomes
