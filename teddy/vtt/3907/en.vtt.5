00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:32.518
It then feeds back an answer to the user

00:02:32.542 --> 00:02:34.309
by means of bone conduction,

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:37.976
audio conducted through the skull
into the user's inner ear,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.268
that the user hears,

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:42.393
overlaid on top of the user's
natural hearing of the environment,

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:43.667
without blocking it.

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:50.351
The combination of all these parts,
the input, the output and the AI,

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:54.184
gives a net subjective experience
of an interface inside your head

00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:57.333
that you could talk to
in likeness to talking to yourself.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.726
Just to be very clear, the device
does not record or read your thoughts.
