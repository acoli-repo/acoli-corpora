Ever since computers were invented,

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:07.309
we've been trying to make them
smarter and more powerful.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.101
From the abacus, to room-sized machines,

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.976
to desktops, to computers in our pockets.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.434
And are now designing
artificial intelligence to automate tasks

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:18.292
that would require human intelligence.

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:21.476
If you look at the history of computing,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.726
we've always treated computers
as external devices

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.083
that compute and act on our behalf.

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:34.059
What I want to do is I want to weave
computing, AI and internet as part of us.
