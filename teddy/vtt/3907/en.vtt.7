00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.684
What I'm going to do is,
I'm going to ask Eric a question.

00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:33.809
And he's going to search
for that information

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:37.726
without vocalizing, without typing,
without moving his fingers,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.018
without moving his mouth.

00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:41.934
Simply by internally asking that question.

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.143
The AI will then figure out the answer
and feed it back to Eric,

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:46.792
through audio, through the device.

00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:51.018
While you see a laptop
in front of him, he's not using it.

00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:53.393
Everything lives on the device.

00:03:53.417 --> 00:03:57.208
All he needs is that sticker device
to interface with the AI and the internet.

00:03:59.458 --> 00:04:03.417
So, Eric, what's the weather
in Vancouver like, right now?
