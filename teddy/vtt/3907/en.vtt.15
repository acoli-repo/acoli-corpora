Tell us, is this reading your thoughts,

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:32.934
will it in five years,

00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.875
is there a weaponized version of this,
what does it look like?

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:40.101
AK: So our first design principle,
before we started working on this,

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:43.643
was to not render ethics
as an afterthought.

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:47.101
So we wanted to bake ethics
right into the design.

00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:48.393
We flipped the design.

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:50.476
Instead of reading
from the brain directly,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.726
we're reading from
the voluntary nervous system

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.941
that you deliberately have to engage
to communicate with the device,

00:07:55.965 --> 00:07:59.169
while still bringing the benefits
of a thinking or a thought device.

00:07:59.183 --> 00:08:00.809
The best of both worlds in a way.
