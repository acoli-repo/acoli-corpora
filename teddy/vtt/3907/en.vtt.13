and with their families.

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:34.583
My hope is to be able to help them
express their thoughts and ideas.

00:06:36.875 --> 00:06:39.101
I believe computing, AI and the internet

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:42.851
would disappear into us
as extensions of our cognition,

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:46.476
instead of being external
entities or adversaries,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.809
amplifying human ingenuity,

00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:52.708
giving us unimaginable abilities
and unlocking our true potential.

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:57.667
And perhaps even freeing us
to becoming better at being human.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.768
Thank you so much.
