00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.833
Could this whole be better
than the sum of its parts?

00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:04.976
We have a device
that could make that possible.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.643
It's called AlterEgo,
and it's a wearable device

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.684
that gives you the experience
of a conversational AI

00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:12.309
that lives inside your head,

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.917
that you could talk to in likeness
to talking to yourself internally.

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.518
We have a new prototype
that we're showing here,

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:22.542
for the first time at TED,
and here's how it works.

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:25.559
Normally, when we speak,

00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:28.393
the brain sends neurosignals
through the nerves

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:30.559
to your internal speech systems,
