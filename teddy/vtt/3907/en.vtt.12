I'm going to show you a short clip of Doug
using our system for the first time.

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:12.042

AK: What you just saw there

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:19.309
was Doug communicating or speaking
in real time for the first time

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:21.167
since he lost the ability to speak.

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:23.684
There are millions of people

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:27.101
who might be able to communicate
in real time like Doug,

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:30.125
with other people, with their friends
and with their families.
