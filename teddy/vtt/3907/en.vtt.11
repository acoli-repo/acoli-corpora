00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:30.643
where he types in individual letters
using his head movements.

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:33.583
And it takes several minutes
to communicate a single sentence.

00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:36.434
So we went to Doug and asked him

00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:40.792
what were the first words
he'd like to use or say, using our system.

00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:45.143
Perhaps a greeting, like,
"Hello, how are you?"

00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:47.375
Or indicate that he needed
help with something.

00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:51.559
What Doug said that he wanted
to use our system for

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:55.226
is to reboot the old system he had,
because that old system kept on crashing.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.000
(Laughter)

00:05:58.083 --> 00:05:59.792
We never could have predicted that.
