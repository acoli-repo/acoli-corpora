There are millions of people
around the world

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:05.309
who struggle with using natural speech.

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:08.643
People with conditions such as ALS,
or Lou Gehrig's disease,

00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:10.351
stroke and oral cancer,

00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:12.083
amongst many other conditions.

00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:17.542
For them, communicating is
a painstakingly slow and tiring process.

00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:20.268
This is Doug.

00:05:20.292 --> 00:05:22.601
Doug was diagnosed with ALS
about 12 years ago

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:24.542
and has since lost the ability to speak.

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:27.268
Today, he uses an on-screen keyboard

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:30.643
where he types in individual letters
using his head movements.
