00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.768
When that happens,

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:05.184
the brain sends extremely weak signals
to these internal speech systems.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.934
AlterEgo has sensors,

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:11.184
embedded in a thin plastic,
flexible and transparent device

00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:13.417
that sits on your neck
just like a sticker.

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:18.184
These sensors pick up
on these internal signals

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:20.101
sourced deep within the mouth cavity,

00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:21.833
right from the surface of the skin.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.768
An AI program running in the background

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:29.101
then tries to figure out
what the user's trying to say.

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:32.518
It then feeds back an answer to the user
