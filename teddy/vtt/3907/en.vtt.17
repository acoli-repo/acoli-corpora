00:08:27.917 --> 00:08:30.518
So we have a sticker version
that conforms to the skin,

00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:31.809
that looks like the skin,

00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:34.101
but we're trying to make
an even smaller version

00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:35.417
that would sit right here.

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:38.433
SA: OK.

00:08:38.457 --> 00:08:41.433
I feel like if anyone has any questions
they want to ask Arnav,

00:08:41.457 --> 00:08:42.726
he'll be here all week.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.183
OK, thank you so much, Arnav.

00:08:44.207 --> 00:08:45.583
AK: Thanks, Shoham.
