Shoham Arad: Come over here.

00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:12.333
OK.

00:07:13.917 --> 00:07:17.434
I want to ask you a couple of questions,
they're going to clear the stage.

00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:20.976
I feel like this is amazing,
it's innovative,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.476
it's creepy, it's terrifying.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.559
Can you tell us what I think ...

00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:29.309
I think there are some
uncomfortable feelings around this.

00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:31.643
Tell us, is this reading your thoughts,
