00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:31.381
the fate of humanity may depend
on what the superintelligence does.

00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:33.508
Think about it:

00:07:33.508 --> 00:07:38.552
Machine intelligence is the last invention
that humanity will ever need to make.

00:07:38.552 --> 00:07:41.525
Machines will then be better 
at inventing than we are,

00:07:41.525 --> 00:07:44.065
and they'll be doing so 
on digital timescales.

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:48.966
What this means is basically
a telescoping of the future.

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:52.524
Think of all the crazy technologies 
that you could have imagined

00:07:52.524 --> 00:07:55.322
maybe humans could have developed
in the fullness of time:

00:07:55.322 --> 00:07:58.580
cures for aging, space colonization,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.311
self-replicating nanobots or uploading
of minds into computers,
