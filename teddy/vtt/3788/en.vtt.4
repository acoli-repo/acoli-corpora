00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:03.379
because there have only
been 250,000 generations

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:05.111
since our last common ancestor.

00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:08.960
We know that complicated mechanisms
take a long time to evolve.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.499
So a bunch of relatively minor changes

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.566
take us from Kanzi to Witten,

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:20.109
from broken-off tree branches
to intercontinental ballistic missiles.

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.774
So this then seems pretty obvious
that everything we've achieved,

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:26.152
and everything we care about,

00:02:26.152 --> 00:02:31.380
depends crucially on some relatively minor
changes that made the human mind.
