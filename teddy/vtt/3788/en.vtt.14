00:06:59.225 --> 00:07:02.247
It's likely, rather, to swoosh right by.

00:07:02.247 --> 00:07:04.231
Now this has profound implications,

00:07:04.231 --> 00:07:08.093
particularly when it comes 
to questions of power.

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:09.992
For example, chimpanzees are strong --

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:15.214
pound for pound, a chimpanzee is about
twice as strong as a fit human male.

00:07:15.214 --> 00:07:19.828
And yet, the fate of Kanzi 
and his pals depends a lot more

00:07:19.828 --> 00:07:23.968
on what we humans do than on
what the chimpanzees do themselves.

00:07:25.228 --> 00:07:27.542
Once there is superintelligence,

00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:31.381
the fate of humanity may depend
on what the superintelligence does.
