00:06:29.647 --> 00:06:33.491
maybe eventually we get to
mouse-level artificial intelligence,

00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:35.921
something that can navigate 
cluttered environments

00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:37.908
as well as a mouse can.

00:06:37.908 --> 00:06:42.221
And then, after many, many more years
of really hard work, lots of investment,

00:06:42.221 --> 00:06:46.860
maybe eventually we get to
chimpanzee-level artificial intelligence.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.070
And then, after even more years 
of really, really hard work,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.983
we get to village idiot 
artificial intelligence.

00:06:52.983 --> 00:06:56.255
And a few moments later, 
we are beyond Ed Witten.

00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:59.225
The train doesn't stop
at Humanville Station.

00:06:59.225 --> 00:07:02.247
It's likely, rather, to swoosh right by.
