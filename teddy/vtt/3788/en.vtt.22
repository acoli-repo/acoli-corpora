and give it misconceived 
or poorly specified goals.

00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:09.300
Now you might say, if a computer starts
sticking electrodes into people's faces,

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.565
we'd just shut it off.

00:11:12.555 --> 00:11:17.895
A, this is not necessarily so easy to do
if we've grown dependent on the system --

00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:20.627
like, where is the off switch 
to the Internet?

00:11:20.627 --> 00:11:25.747
B, why haven't the chimpanzees
flicked the off switch to humanity,

00:11:25.747 --> 00:11:27.298
or the Neanderthals?

00:11:27.298 --> 00:11:29.964
They certainly had reasons.

00:11:29.964 --> 00:11:32.759
We have an off switch, 
for example, right here.
