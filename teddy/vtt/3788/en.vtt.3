00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:32.134
But I like to think back further 
to the ultimate cause.

00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:36.880
Look at these two highly
distinguished gentlemen:

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.480
We have Kanzi --

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.123
he's mastered 200 lexical
tokens, an incredible feat.

00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:46.817
And Ed Witten unleashed the second
superstring revolution.

00:01:46.817 --> 00:01:49.141
If we look under the hood, 
this is what we find:

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:50.711
basically the same thing.

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:52.524
One is a little larger,

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:55.282
it maybe also has a few tricks
in the exact way it's wired.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:59.094
These invisible differences cannot
be too complicated, however,

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:03.379
because there have only
been 250,000 generations
