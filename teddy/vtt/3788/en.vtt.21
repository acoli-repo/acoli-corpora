you better make sure 
that your definition of x

00:10:31.776 --> 00:10:34.245
incorporates everything you care about.

00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:39.219
This is a lesson that's also taught
in many a myth.

00:10:39.219 --> 00:10:44.517
King Midas wishes that everything
he touches be turned into gold.

00:10:44.517 --> 00:10:47.378
He touches his daughter, 
she turns into gold.

00:10:47.378 --> 00:10:49.931
He touches his food, it turns into gold.

00:10:49.931 --> 00:10:52.520
This could become practically relevant,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.590
not just as a metaphor for greed,

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.485
but as an illustration of what happens

00:10:56.485 --> 00:10:59.322
if you create a powerful
optimization process

00:10:59.322 --> 00:11:04.111
and give it misconceived 
or poorly specified goals.
