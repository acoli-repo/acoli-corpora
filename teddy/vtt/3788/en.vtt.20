00:09:56.934 --> 00:10:01.105
it realizes that the most effective way 
to get the solution to this problem

00:10:01.105 --> 00:10:04.035
is by transforming the planet
into a giant computer,

00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:06.281
so as to increase its thinking capacity.

00:10:06.281 --> 00:10:09.045
And notice that this gives the A.I.s
an instrumental reason

00:10:09.045 --> 00:10:11.561
to do things to us that we
might not approve of.

00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:13.496
Human beings in this model are threats,

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:16.417
we could prevent the mathematical
problem from being solved.

00:10:17.207 --> 00:10:20.701
Of course, perceivably things won't 
go wrong in these particular ways;

00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:22.454
these are cartoon examples.

00:10:22.454 --> 00:10:24.393
But the general point here is important:

00:10:24.393 --> 00:10:27.266
if you create a really powerful
optimization process

00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:29.500
to maximize for objective x,

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.776
you better make sure 
that your definition of x
