00:02:59.086 --> 00:03:00.751
You would have human programmers

00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:03.886
that would painstakingly 
handcraft knowledge items.

00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:05.972
You build up these expert systems,

00:03:05.972 --> 00:03:08.296
and they were kind of useful 
for some purposes,

00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:10.977
but they were very brittle,
you couldn't scale them.

00:03:10.977 --> 00:03:14.410
Basically, you got out only
what you put in.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.407
But since then,

00:03:15.407 --> 00:03:18.874
a paradigm shift has taken place
in the field of artificial intelligence.

00:03:18.874 --> 00:03:21.644
Today, the action is really 
around machine learning.

00:03:22.394 --> 00:03:27.781
So rather than handcrafting knowledge
representations and features,

00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:34.065
we create algorithms that learn,
often from raw perceptual data.
