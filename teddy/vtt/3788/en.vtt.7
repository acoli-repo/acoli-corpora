00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:34.065
we create algorithms that learn,
often from raw perceptual data.

00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:39.063
Basically the same thing
that the human infant does.

00:03:39.063 --> 00:03:43.270
The result is A.I. that is not
limited to one domain --

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.901
the same system can learn to translate 
between any pairs of languages,

00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:53.338
or learn to play any computer game
on the Atari console.

00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:55.117
Now of course,

00:03:55.117 --> 00:03:59.116
A.I. is still nowhere near having
the same powerful, cross-domain

00:03:59.116 --> 00:04:02.335
ability to learn and plan
as a human being has.
