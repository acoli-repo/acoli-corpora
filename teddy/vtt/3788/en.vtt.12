00:05:58.406 --> 00:06:02.363
Now most people, when they think
about what is smart and what is dumb,

00:06:02.363 --> 00:06:05.386
I think have in mind a picture
roughly like this.

00:06:05.386 --> 00:06:07.984
So at one end we have the village idiot,

00:06:07.984 --> 00:06:10.467
and then far over at the other side

00:06:10.467 --> 00:06:15.223
we have Ed Witten, or Albert Einstein,
or whoever your favorite guru is.

00:06:15.223 --> 00:06:19.057
But I think that from the point of view
of artificial intelligence,

00:06:19.057 --> 00:06:22.738
the true picture is actually
probably more like this:

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:26.636
AI starts out at this point here,
at zero intelligence,

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.647
and then, after many, many 
years of really hard work,

00:06:29.647 --> 00:06:33.491
maybe eventually we get to
mouse-level artificial intelligence,
