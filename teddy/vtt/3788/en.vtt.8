00:03:59.116 --> 00:04:02.335
ability to learn and plan
as a human being has.

00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:04.461
The cortex still has some 
algorithmic tricks

00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:06.816
that we don't yet know
how to match in machines.

00:04:07.886 --> 00:04:09.785
So the question is,

00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:13.285
how far are we from being able
to match those tricks?

00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:15.328
A couple of years ago,

00:04:15.328 --> 00:04:18.216
we did a survey of some of the world's 
leading A.I. experts,

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:21.440
to see what they think,
and one of the questions we asked was,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.793
"By which year do you think
there is a 50 percent probability

00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:28.275
that we will have achieved 
human-level machine intelligence?"

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:32.968
We defined human-level here 
as the ability to perform
