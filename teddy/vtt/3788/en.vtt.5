depends crucially on some relatively minor
changes that made the human mind.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.312
And the corollary, of course,
is that any further changes

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:39.789
that could significantly change
the substrate of thinking

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.991
could have potentially 
enormous consequences.

00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:47.226
Some of my colleagues 
think we're on the verge

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:51.134
of something that could cause
a profound change in that substrate,

00:02:51.134 --> 00:02:54.347
and that is machine superintelligence.

00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:59.086
Artificial intelligence used to be
about putting commands in a box.

00:02:59.086 --> 00:03:00.751
You would have human programmers
