I see no way around 
this difficult problem.

00:13:32.557 --> 00:13:36.391
Now, I'm actually fairly optimistic
that this problem can be solved.

00:13:36.391 --> 00:13:40.294
We wouldn't have to write down 
a long list of everything we care about,

00:13:40.294 --> 00:13:43.937
or worse yet, spell it out 
in some computer language

00:13:43.937 --> 00:13:45.391
like C++ or Python,

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:48.158
that would be a task beyond hopeless.

00:13:48.158 --> 00:13:52.455
Instead, we would create an A.I.
that uses its intelligence

00:13:52.455 --> 00:13:55.226
to learn what we value,

00:13:55.226 --> 00:14:00.506
and its motivation system is constructed
in such a way that it is motivated
