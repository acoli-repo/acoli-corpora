00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.311
self-replicating nanobots or uploading
of minds into computers,

00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:04.470
all kinds of science fiction-y stuff

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.207
that's nevertheless consistent 
with the laws of physics.

00:08:07.207 --> 00:08:11.419
All of this superintelligence could 
develop, and possibly quite rapidly.

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:16.007
Now, a superintelligence with such 
technological maturity

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:18.186
would be extremely powerful,

00:08:18.186 --> 00:08:22.732
and at least in some scenarios,
it would be able to get what it wants.

00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:28.393
We would then have a future that would
be shaped by the preferences of this A.I.

00:08:29.855 --> 00:08:33.604
Now a good question is,
what are those preferences?
