00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:31.309
But if we think about it,

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.602
we are actually recently arrived
guests on this planet,

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:36.684
the human species.

00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:41.430
Think about if Earth
was created one year ago,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.978
the human species, then, 
would be 10 minutes old.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.146
The industrial era started
two seconds ago.

00:00:49.276 --> 00:00:54.501
Another way to look at this is to think of
world GDP over the last 10,000 years,

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:57.530
I've actually taken the trouble
to plot this for you in a graph.


00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.304
It looks like this.

00:00:59.304 --> 00:01:00.667
