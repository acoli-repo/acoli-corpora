00:14:27.653 --> 00:14:31.183
if we are to have a controlled detonation.

00:14:31.183 --> 00:14:33.801
The values that the A.I. has
need to match ours,

00:14:33.801 --> 00:14:35.561
not just in the familiar context,

00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:37.999
like where we can easily check
how the A.I. behaves,

00:14:37.999 --> 00:14:41.233
but also in all novel contexts
that the A.I. might encounter

00:14:41.233 --> 00:14:42.790
in the indefinite future.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.527
And there are also some esoteric issues
that would need to be solved, sorted out:

00:14:47.527 --> 00:14:49.616
the exact details of its decision theory,

00:14:49.616 --> 00:14:52.480
how to deal with logical
uncertainty and so forth.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.432
So the technical problems that need
to be solved to make this work

00:14:56.432 --> 00:14:57.545
look quite difficult --

00:14:57.545 --> 00:15:00.925
not as difficult as making 
a superintelligent A.I.,
