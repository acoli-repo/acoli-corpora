00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:31.115
Suppose we give an A.I. the goal 
to make humans smile.

00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:34.097
When the A.I. is weak, it performs useful
or amusing actions

00:09:34.097 --> 00:09:36.614
that cause its user to smile.

00:09:36.614 --> 00:09:39.031
When the A.I. becomes superintelligent,

00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:42.554
it realizes that there is a more
effective way to achieve this goal:

00:09:42.554 --> 00:09:44.476
take control of the world

00:09:44.476 --> 00:09:47.638
and stick electrodes into the facial
muscles of humans

00:09:47.638 --> 00:09:50.579
to cause constant, beaming grins.

00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:51.614
Another example,

00:09:51.614 --> 00:09:54.997
suppose we give A.I. the goal to solve
a difficult mathematical problem.

00:09:54.997 --> 00:09:56.934
When the A.I. becomes superintelligent,

00:09:56.934 --> 00:10:01.105
it realizes that the most effective way 
to get the solution to this problem
