00:13:55.226 --> 00:14:00.506
and its motivation system is constructed
in such a way that it is motivated

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:05.738
to pursue our values or to perform actions
that it predicts we would approve of.

00:14:05.738 --> 00:14:09.152
We would thus leverage 
its intelligence as much as possible

00:14:09.152 --> 00:14:11.897
to solve the problem of value-loading.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:14.239
This can happen,

00:14:14.239 --> 00:14:17.835
and the outcome could be 
very good for humanity.

00:14:17.835 --> 00:14:21.792
But it doesn't happen automatically.

00:14:21.792 --> 00:14:24.790
The initial conditions 
for the intelligence explosion

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.653
might need to be set up 
in just the right way

00:14:27.653 --> 00:14:31.183
if we are to have a controlled detonation.
