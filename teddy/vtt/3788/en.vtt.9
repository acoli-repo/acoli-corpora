00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:32.968
We defined human-level here 
as the ability to perform

00:04:32.968 --> 00:04:35.839
almost any job at least as well
as an adult human,

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:39.844
so real human-level, not just
within some limited domain.

00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:43.494
And the median answer was 2040 or 2050,

00:04:43.494 --> 00:04:46.300
depending on precisely which 
group of experts we asked.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.339
Now, it could happen much,
much later, or sooner,

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:52.279
the truth is nobody really knows.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.671
What we do know is that the ultimate 
limit to information processing

00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:02.542
in a machine substrate lies far outside 
the limits in biological tissue.
