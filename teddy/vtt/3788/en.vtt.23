00:11:29.964 --> 00:11:32.759
We have an off switch, 
for example, right here.

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:34.313
(Choking)

00:11:34.313 --> 00:11:37.238
The reason is that we are 
an intelligent adversary;

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.966
we can anticipate threats 
and plan around them.

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:42.470
But so could a superintelligent agent,

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.724
and it would be much better 
at that than we are.

00:11:45.724 --> 00:11:52.911
The point is, we should not be confident
that we have this under control here.

00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:56.358
And we could try to make our job
a little bit easier by, say,

00:11:56.358 --> 00:11:57.948
putting the A.I. in a box,

00:11:57.948 --> 00:11:59.744
like a secure software environment,

00:11:59.744 --> 00:12:02.766
a virtual reality simulation
from which it cannot escape.
