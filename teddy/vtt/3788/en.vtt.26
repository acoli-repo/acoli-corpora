00:12:58.744 --> 00:13:00.142
and when we implement it,

00:13:00.142 --> 00:13:04.539
it has some surreptitious side effect
that the A.I. had planned.

00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:08.002
The point here is that we should 
not be confident in our ability

00:13:08.002 --> 00:13:11.810
to keep a superintelligent genie
locked up in its bottle forever.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.064
Sooner or later, it will out.

00:13:15.034 --> 00:13:18.137
I believe that the answer here
is to figure out

00:13:18.137 --> 00:13:23.161
how to create superintelligent A.I.
such that even if -- when -- it escapes,

00:13:23.161 --> 00:13:26.438
it is still safe because it is
fundamentally on our side

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:28.337
because it shares our values.

00:13:28.337 --> 00:13:31.547
I see no way around 
this difficult problem.
