00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:02.542
in a machine substrate lies far outside 
the limits in biological tissue.

00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:05.619
This comes down to physics.

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:10.337
A biological neuron fires, maybe, 
at 200 hertz, 200 times a second.

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:13.931
But even a present-day transistor
operates at the Gigahertz.

00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:19.228
Neurons propagate slowly in axons,
100 meters per second, tops.

00:05:19.228 --> 00:05:22.339
But in computers, signals can travel
at the speed of light.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:24.948
There are also size limitations,

00:05:24.948 --> 00:05:27.975
like a human brain has 
to fit inside a cranium,

00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:32.736
but a computer can be the size
of a warehouse or larger.
