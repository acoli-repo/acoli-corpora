00:11:59.744 --> 00:12:02.766
a virtual reality simulation
from which it cannot escape.

00:12:02.766 --> 00:12:06.912
But how confident can we be that
the A.I. couldn't find a bug.

00:12:06.912 --> 00:12:10.081
Given that merely human hackers
find bugs all the time,

00:12:10.081 --> 00:12:13.117
I'd say, probably not very confident.

00:12:14.237 --> 00:12:18.785
So we disconnect the ethernet cable
to create an air gap,

00:12:18.785 --> 00:12:21.453
but again, like merely human hackers

00:12:21.453 --> 00:12:24.834
routinely transgress air gaps
using social engineering.

00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:26.093
Right now, as I speak,

00:12:26.093 --> 00:12:28.482
I'm sure there is some employee
out there somewhere

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:31.828
who has been talked into handing out 
her account details
