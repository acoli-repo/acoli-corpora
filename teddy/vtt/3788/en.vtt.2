00:00:59.304 --> 00:01:00.667
(Laughter)

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.818
It's a curious shape
for a normal condition.

00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:04.516
I sure wouldn't want to sit on it.

00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:07.067
(Laughter)

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:11.841
Let's ask ourselves, what is the cause
of this current anomaly?

00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.393
Some people would say it's technology.

00:01:14.393 --> 00:01:19.061
Now it's true, technology has accumulated
through human history,

00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:23.713
and right now, technology
advances extremely rapidly --

00:01:23.713 --> 00:01:25.278
that is the proximate cause,

00:01:25.278 --> 00:01:27.843
that's why we are currently 
so very productive.

00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:32.134
But I like to think back further 
to the ultimate cause.
