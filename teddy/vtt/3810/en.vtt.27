00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:30.975
and it's just starting on this issue.

00:13:30.975 --> 00:13:34.253
There is such an opportunity right now.

00:13:34.253 --> 00:13:36.282
And the TED community

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:39.647
of creative and innovative thinkers and doers

00:13:39.647 --> 00:13:41.544
across all of society

00:13:41.544 --> 00:13:44.803
could make the crucial difference.

00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:48.637
You really can make this change happen.

00:13:48.637 --> 00:13:50.439
Now, a simple starting point

00:13:50.439 --> 00:13:51.905
is the address behind me

00:13:51.905 --> 00:13:54.264
for a Facebook page that you can join now

00:13:54.264 --> 00:13:57.010
to support the campaign and spread the word.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.434
It's going to be a springboard

00:13:58.434 --> 00:14:00.395
for our global campaigning.
