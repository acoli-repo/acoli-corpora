00:12:57.463 --> 00:13:01.931
Imagine what a game changer that would be.

00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:04.434
So how are we going to do this?

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:05.880
Well, there is only one way.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.131
Together, we have to change the law globally

00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:11.072
to create public registries

00:13:11.072 --> 00:13:13.927
which list the true owners of companies

00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:15.963
and can be accessed by all

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:18.092
with no loopholes.

00:13:18.092 --> 00:13:21.824
And yes, this is ambitious,

00:13:21.824 --> 00:13:24.215
but there is momentum on this issue,

00:13:24.215 --> 00:13:26.259
and over the years I have seen

00:13:26.259 --> 00:13:28.591
the sheer power of momentum,

00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:30.975
and it's just starting on this issue.
