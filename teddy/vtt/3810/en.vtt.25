so that they can no longer be used anonymously

00:12:30.522 --> 00:12:33.152
against the public good.

00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:35.818
Together let's ignite world opinion,

00:12:35.818 --> 00:12:37.295
change the law,

00:12:37.295 --> 00:12:42.175
and launch a new era of openness in business.

00:12:42.175 --> 00:12:43.807
So what might this look like?

00:12:43.807 --> 00:12:46.376
Well, imagine if you could go online

00:12:46.376 --> 00:12:49.493

Imagine if this data were open and free,

00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:53.976

00:12:53.976 --> 00:12:55.775
for citizens and businesses

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.463
and law enforcement alike.

00:12:57.463 --> 00:13:01.931
Imagine what a game changer that would be.
