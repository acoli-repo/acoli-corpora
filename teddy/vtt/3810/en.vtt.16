00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:02.745
and remember, it's all legal,
routine business practice.

00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:04.384
So, here's one,

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:07.311
but there are plenty of others to choose from.

00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:08.942
And having made your choice,

00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:11.448
you then pick what type of company you want

00:08:11.448 --> 00:08:14.564
and then fill in a contact, name and address.

00:08:14.564 --> 00:08:15.748
But don't worry,

00:08:15.748 --> 00:08:17.307
it doesn't have to be your name.

00:08:17.307 --> 00:08:18.789
It can be your lawyer's

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:20.688
or your service provider's,

00:08:20.688 --> 00:08:24.523
and it's not for the public record anyway.

00:08:24.523 --> 00:08:27.080
And then you add the owner of the company.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.019
Now this is the key part,

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:30.899
and again it doesn't have to be you,
