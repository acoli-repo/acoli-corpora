WEBVTT

00:13:58.434 --> 00:14:00.395
for our global campaigning.

00:14:00.395 --> 00:14:01.870
And the techies among you,

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.243
you could really help us create a prototype

00:14:05.243 --> 00:14:06.963
public registry

00:14:06.963 --> 00:14:11.839
to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:14.350
Campaign groups from around the world

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:19.210
have come together to work on this issue.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.490
The U.K. government is already on board;

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.892
it supports these public registries.

00:14:24.892 --> 00:14:26.790
And just last week,

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.498
the European Parliament came on board

00:14:29.498 --> 00:14:34.564
with a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries.
