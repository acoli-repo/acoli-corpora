the actual human beings responsible

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:35.604
sometimes for really terrible crimes.

00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:40.646

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:44.176
Well, I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:47.127
and when my parents taught my twin brother and I

00:00:54.238 --> 00:00:57.376
during my stroppy teenage years when, predictably,

00:00:57.376 --> 00:00:59.994
I questioned their authority a lot.

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:01.589
And a lot of my school teachers
