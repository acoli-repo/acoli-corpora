00:03:56.626 --> 00:04:00.815
a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests.

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:03.898
Or political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia,

00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:07.093
which has led to the destruction 
of much of its forests.

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:11.234
Well, that uses anonymous companies too.

00:04:11.234 --> 00:04:13.523
We secretly filmed some of the family

00:04:13.523 --> 00:04:16.320
of the former chief minister and a lawyer

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.592
as they told our undercover investigator

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:21.344
exactly how these dubious deals are done

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.420
using such companies.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.193
And the awful thing is,

00:04:26.193 --> 00:04:29.499
there are so many other examples out there

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:33.503
from all walks of life.
