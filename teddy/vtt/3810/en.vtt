00:00:00.144 --> 00:00:01.464
I've come here today

00:00:01.464 --> 00:00:04.151
to talk to you about a problem.

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:07.678
It's a very simple yet devastating problem,

00:00:07.678 --> 00:00:09.623
one that spans the globe

00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:12.536
and is affecting all of us.

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:14.621
The problem is

00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:17.346
anonymous companies.

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:19.436
It sounds like a really dry and technical thing,

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:20.492
doesn't it?

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:22.994
But anonymous companies are making it difficult

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:25.546
and sometimes impossible

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.395
to find out

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:30.394
the actual human beings responsible
