00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:02.447
And we're doing this because 
so many of the countries

00:03:02.447 --> 00:03:04.323

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.939
and most dispossessed people on the planet.

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.433
And much of this injustice

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.087
is made possible

00:03:17.087 --> 00:03:20.819
by currently accepted business practices.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.036

like in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
