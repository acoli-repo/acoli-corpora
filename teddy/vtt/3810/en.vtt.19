00:09:28.956 --> 00:09:31.056
companies owned by companies.

00:09:31.056 --> 00:09:32.436
You can have hundreds of layers

00:09:32.436 --> 00:09:34.524
with hundreds of companies spread across

00:09:34.524 --> 00:09:37.181
lots of different countries,

00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:38.511
like a giant web,

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.700
each layer adds anonymity.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.930
Each layer makes it more difficult

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.619
for law enforcement and others

00:09:44.619 --> 00:09:48.002
to find out who the real owner is.

00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:52.092
But whose interests is this all serving?

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.218
It might be in the interests of the company

00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:55.984
or a particular individual,

00:09:55.984 --> 00:09:58.372
but what about all of us, the public?

00:09:58.372 --> 00:10:01.141
There hasn't even been a global conversation yet
