00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.952
like in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:03:31.952 --> 00:03:34.704
where we exposed how secretive deals

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:36.337
involving anonymous companies

00:03:36.337 --> 00:03:38.522
had deprived the citizens

00:03:38.522 --> 00:03:42.487
of one of the poorest countries on the planet

00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:44.363
of well over a billion dollars.

00:03:44.363 --> 00:03:49.894
That's twice the country's health 
and education budget combined.

00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:51.215
Or in Liberia,

00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:54.063
where an international predatory logging company

00:03:54.063 --> 00:03:56.626
used front companies as it attempted to grab

00:03:56.626 --> 00:04:00.815
a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests.
