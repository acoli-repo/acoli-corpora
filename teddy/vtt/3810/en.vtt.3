00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:30.006
And so it was

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.490
in my twenties, a long time ago,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.571
that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London

00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:38.360
I was sitting with Simon Taylor

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.368
and Patrick Alley

00:01:40.368 --> 00:01:42.233
and we were busy stuffing envelopes

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:45.283
for a mail out in the office of the campaign group

00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:47.538
where we worked at the time.

00:01:47.538 --> 00:01:51.623
And as usual, we were talking 
about the world's problems.

00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:53.437
And in particular, we were talking about

00:01:53.437 --> 00:01:56.357
the civil war in Cambodia.

00:01:56.357 --> 00:02:00.588
And we had talked about that 
many, many times before.
