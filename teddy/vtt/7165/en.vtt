[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:09.121
In Kenya, buses are commonly
known as "matatus."

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:12.079
They're everywhere --
and I mean everywhere.

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:15.954
And they form a very crucial part
of Kenyans' urban life.

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:18.788
They're fun, colorfully painted buses

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.829
with graffiti that depicts
what is going on in Kenya

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.038
and the world at large.

00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:27.329
They're informal and affordable ways
for Kenyans to get around

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.162
and are used by the vast majority
as the main mode of transportation.
