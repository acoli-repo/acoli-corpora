shopper who wants it,

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:02.004
and not the retailer?

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.101
What if, instead of a return,

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:11.728
they could do what I call a "green turn"?

00:04:12.783 --> 00:04:16.750
Consumers could use an app
to take pictures of the item

00:04:16.774 --> 00:04:19.930
and verify the condition
while returning it.

00:04:19.954 --> 00:04:25.069
Artificial intelligence systems could then
sort these clothes by condition --

00:04:25.093 --> 00:04:27.377
mint condition or slightly used --

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:30.035
and direct it to the next
appropriate person.
