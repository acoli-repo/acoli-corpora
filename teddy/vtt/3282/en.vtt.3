00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.222
So I came home and researched.

00:01:32.818 --> 00:01:36.431
And I learned that every year,

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:42.553
four billion pounds of returned clothing
ends up in the landfill.

00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:49.872
That's like every resident in the US
did a load of laundry last night

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:51.946
and decided to throw it
in the trash today.

00:01:53.278 --> 00:01:55.442
I was horrified.

00:01:56.363 --> 00:01:58.560
I'm like, "Of all people,

00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:00.767
I should be able to help prevent this."
