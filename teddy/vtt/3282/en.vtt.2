You see, I'm a global solutions
director for top-tier retail,

00:01:04.268 --> 00:01:07.539
and we were in a meeting
with one of my largest customers,

00:01:07.563 --> 00:01:10.076
discussing how to streamline costs.

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:13.735
One of their biggest concerns
was managing returns.

00:01:14.218 --> 00:01:17.462
Just this past holiday season alone,

00:01:17.486 --> 00:01:22.775
they had 7.5 million pieces
of clothing returned to them.

00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:26.301
I could not stop thinking about it.

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.751
What happens to all
these returned clothes?

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.222
So I came home and researched.
