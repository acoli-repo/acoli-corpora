Who would have thought
my innocent shopping behavior

00:03:30.707 --> 00:03:32.836
would be hurting not only me,

00:03:33.693 --> 00:03:35.301
but our planet as well?

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.964
And as I thought about what to do,

00:03:38.988 --> 00:03:40.290
I kept thinking:

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:45.731
Why does the item have to be returned
to the retailer in the first place?

00:03:46.454 --> 00:03:49.233
What if there was another way,

00:03:49.972 --> 00:03:52.529
a win-win for everyone?

00:03:53.348 --> 00:03:57.418
What if when a person
is trying to return something,

00:03:57.442 --> 00:04:00.598
it could go to the next
shopper who wants it,
