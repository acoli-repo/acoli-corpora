Retailers are scrambling
to recover their losses.

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:06.856
They try to place that returned item
online to be sold again,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.042
or they'll sell it to a discount partner

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:10.320
or a liquidator.

00:03:10.818 --> 00:03:14.537
Basically, if companies cannot find
a place for this item

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.734
quickly and economically,

00:03:16.758 --> 00:03:18.881
its place becomes the trash.

00:03:20.413 --> 00:03:25.017
Suddenly, I felt very guilty
for being that shopper,

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:27.240
somebody who contributes to this.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.683
Who would have thought
my innocent shopping behavior
