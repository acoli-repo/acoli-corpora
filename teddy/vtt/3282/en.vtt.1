00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.627
because I did not know
what I really wanted.

00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:36.823
So I overordered, I tried things on,
and then I sent what didn't work back.

00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:42.300
Once my daughter was watching me
return some of those packages back,

00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:44.625
and she said, "Mom,
I think you have a problem."

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.040
(Laughter)

00:00:46.698 --> 00:00:47.866
I didn't think so.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.488
I mean, it's free shipping
and free returns, right?

00:00:50.512 --> 00:00:51.737
(Laughter)

00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:54.416
I didn't even think twice about it,

00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:59.815
until I heard a statistic
at work that shocked me.
