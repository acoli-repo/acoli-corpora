If you were a jackrabbit hopping 
through the desert,

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:13.217
you’d be glad to stumble— 
well, maybe not stumble—

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:17.889
across a cactus: the succulent flesh 
of these plants is a water source

00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:19.724
for many desert animals.

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.103
Native to the Americas and known 
for their spines and succulent stems,

00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:29.567
cacti of all shapes and sizes have evolved
to not just survive, but thrive,

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:32.987
in some of the harshest desert climates 
on Earth.
