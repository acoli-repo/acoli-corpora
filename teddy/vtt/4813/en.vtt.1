00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:30.796
But in reality, living to this age 
or beyond

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:34.169
is a feat that very few,
maybe even no humans,

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:36.179
are likely to accomplish.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.631
Human bodies just aren't built
for extreme aging.

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.692
Our capacity is set at about 90 years.

00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:46.352
But what does aging really mean

00:00:46.352 --> 00:00:50.132
and how does it counteract
the body's efforts to stay alive?

00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:53.162
We know intuitively what it means to age.

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:55.725
For some, it means growing up,

00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:58.858
while for others, it's growing old.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:04.199
Yet finding a strict scientific definition
of aging is a challenge.
