00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:04.199
Yet finding a strict scientific definition
of aging is a challenge.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.358
What we can say is that aging
occurs when intrinsic processes

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:11.898
and interactions with the environment,
like sunlight,

00:01:11.898 --> 00:01:15.663
and toxins in the air, water, 
and our diets,

00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:17.754
cause changes in the structure

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:20.982
and function of the body's 
molecules and cells.

00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:23.724
Those changes in turn drive their decline,

00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:27.544
and subsequently, the failure
of the whole organism.

00:01:27.544 --> 00:01:31.439
The exact mechanisms of aging
are poorly understood.
