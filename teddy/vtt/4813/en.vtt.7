00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:30.474
a process that halts the cell cycle
in times of risk,

00:03:30.474 --> 00:03:33.385
like when cancer cells are proliferating.

00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:36.620
But the response 
also kicks in more as we age,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.568
halting cell growth and cutting short
their ability to replicate.

00:03:40.568 --> 00:03:44.475
Aging also involves stem cells
that reside in many tissues

00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:49.382
and have the property of dividing
without limits to replenish other cells.

00:03:49.382 --> 00:03:52.750
As we get older, 
stem cells decrease in number

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.217
and tend to lose 
their regenerative potential,

00:03:55.217 --> 00:03:59.728
affecting tissue renewal and maintenance
of our organs original functions.

00:03:59.728 --> 00:04:04.098
Other changes revolve around cells' 
ability to function properly.
