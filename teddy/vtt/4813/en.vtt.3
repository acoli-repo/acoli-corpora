The exact mechanisms of aging
are poorly understood.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.923
But recently, scientists have identified
nine physiological traits,

00:01:35.923 --> 00:01:38.254
ranging from genetic changes

00:01:38.254 --> 00:01:41.361
to alterations in 
a cell's regenerative ability

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:44.221
that play a central role.

00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:48.629
Firstly, as the years pass, our bodies
accumulate genetic damage

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:51.127
in the form of DNA lesions.

00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:54.259
These occur naturally when the body's
DNA replicates,

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.174
but also in non-dividing cells.

00:01:57.174 --> 00:02:02.098
Organelles called mitochondria
are especially prone to this damage.
