Ultimately, does longer life
as we know it come down to diet,

00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:33.400
exercise,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.405
medicine,

00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:35.965
or something else?

00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:39.094
Will future technologies,
like cell-repairing nanobots,

00:04:39.094 --> 00:04:40.587
or gene therapy,

00:04:40.587 --> 00:04:43.311
artificially extend our years?

00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:46.405
And do we want to live longer
than we already do?

00:04:46.405 --> 00:04:50.375
Starting with 122 years as inspiration,

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:53.434
there's no telling where our curiosity
might take us.
