00:02:58.415 --> 00:03:00.212
the very stuff of life,

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:02.400
declines as we age.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.093
The DNA in our cells is packaged
within chromosomes,

00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:11.932
each of which has two protective regions
at the extremities called telomeres.

00:03:11.932 --> 00:03:14.931
Those shorten every time cells replicate.

00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:17.462
When telomeres become too short,

00:03:17.462 --> 00:03:20.123
cells stop replicating and die,

00:03:20.123 --> 00:03:23.185
slowing the body's ability
to renew itself.

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:26.935
With age, 
cells increasingly grow senescent, too,

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:30.474
a process that halts the cell cycle
in times of risk,
