also known as epigenetic alterations,

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.288
that affect the body's tissues and cells.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:38.683
Genes silenced or expressed
only at low levels in newborns

00:02:38.683 --> 00:02:41.812
become prominent in older people,

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:44.534
leading to the development
of degenerative diseases,

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:48.119
like Alzheimer's, which accelerate aging.

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:52.592
Even if we could avoid all these harmful
genetic alterations,

00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:55.404
not even our own cells could save us.

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:58.415
The fact remains 
that cellular regeneration,

00:02:58.415 --> 00:03:00.212
the very stuff of life,
