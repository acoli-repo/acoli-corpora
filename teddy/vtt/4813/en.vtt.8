00:03:59.728 --> 00:04:04.098
Other changes revolve around cells' 
ability to function properly.

00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:08.498
As they age, they stop being able to do
quality control on proteins,

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:12.851
causing the accumulation of damaged
and potentially toxic nutrients,

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:17.555
leading to excessive metabolic activity
that could be fatal for them.

00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:20.597
Intercellular communication also slows,

00:04:20.597 --> 00:04:24.009
ultimately undermining 
the body's functional ability.

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.105
There's a lot we don't yet 
understand about aging.

00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:32.193
Ultimately, does longer life
as we know it come down to diet,
