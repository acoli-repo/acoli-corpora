In 1997, a French woman named 
Jeanne Calment

00:00:10.548 --> 00:00:16.981
passed away after 122 years
and 164 days on this Earth,

00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:20.354
making her the oldest known 
person in history.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.170
Her age was so astounding

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.733
that a millionaire pledged $1 million
to anyone who could break her record.

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:30.796
But in reality, living to this age 
or beyond
