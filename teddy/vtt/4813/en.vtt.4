00:01:57.174 --> 00:02:02.098
Organelles called mitochondria
are especially prone to this damage.

00:02:02.098 --> 00:02:06.002
Mitochondria produce 
adenosine triphosphate,

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:07.603
or ATP,

00:02:07.603 --> 00:02:11.196
the main energy source for
all cellular processes,

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:14.662
plus mitochondria regulate
many different cell activities

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:18.721
and play an important role
in programmed cell death.

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:21.120
If mitochondrial function declines,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.869
then cells and, later on, whole organs,
deteriorate, too.

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:29.902
Other changes are known to occur
in the expression patterns of genes,

00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:32.370
also known as epigenetic alterations,
