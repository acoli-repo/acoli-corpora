00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:02.714
people down on the ground
trying to comfort the seizure victim,

00:04:02.738 --> 00:04:04.658
trying to whisper something into his ear

00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:08.640
or in some way help,
even though they couldn't.

00:04:08.664 --> 00:04:11.348
And I had a lot of people
come out of that piece saying,

00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:14.096
"Oh my God, I was so frustrated.
I couldn't help the guy,"

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.841
and take that back into their lives.

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:18.865
So after this piece was made,

00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:24.007
the dean of the cinema school at USC,
the University of Southern California,

00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:28.238
brought in the head of the World
Economic Forum to try "Hunger,"

00:04:28.262 --> 00:04:29.603
and he took off the goggles,

00:04:29.627 --> 00:04:32.667
and he commissioned
a piece about Syria on the spot.
