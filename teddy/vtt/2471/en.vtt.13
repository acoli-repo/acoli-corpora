"A real feeling as if you were
in the middle of something

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:33.471
that you normally see on the TV news."

00:06:34.463 --> 00:06:37.939
So, it works, right? This stuff works.

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:42.092
And it doesn't really matter
where you're from or what age you are --

00:06:42.116 --> 00:06:44.319
it's really evocative.

00:06:44.343 --> 00:06:48.295
Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying
that when you're in a piece

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.199
you forget that you're here.

00:06:51.223 --> 00:06:54.398
But it turns out we can feel
like we're in two places at once.

00:06:54.422 --> 00:06:57.572
We can have what I call
this duality of presence,

00:06:57.596 --> 00:07:02.453
and I think that's what allows me
to tap into these feelings of empathy.
