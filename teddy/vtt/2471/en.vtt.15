00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:30.920
about figuring out the provenance
and where did this stuff come from

00:07:30.944 --> 00:07:32.252
and is it authentic?

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:33.633
Let me give you an example.

00:07:33.657 --> 00:07:36.594
With this Trayvon Martin case,
this is a guy, a kid,

00:07:36.618 --> 00:07:40.721
who was 17 years old and he bought
soda and a candy at a store,

00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:44.221
and on his way home he was tracked
by a neighborhood watchman

00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:47.110
named George Zimmerman
who ended up shooting and killing him.

00:07:47.657 --> 00:07:48.809
To make that piece,

00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:52.435
we got the architectural drawings
of the entire complex,

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:57.228
and we rebuilt the entire scene
inside and out, based on those drawings.

00:07:57.252 --> 00:07:58.547
All of the action

00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:03.490
is informed by the real 911
recorded calls to the police.
