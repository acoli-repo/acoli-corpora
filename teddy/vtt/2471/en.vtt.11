(Girl singing)

00:05:36.037 --> 00:05:38.815
(Explosion)

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:43.076
[Project Syria]

00:05:43.988 --> 00:05:45.985
[A virtual reality experience]

00:05:46.653 --> 00:05:48.721
NP: We were then invited to take the piece

00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:50.799
to the Victoria and Albert
Museum in London.

00:05:50.823 --> 00:05:52.180
And it wasn't advertised.

00:05:52.204 --> 00:05:54.528
And we were put in this tapestry room.

00:05:54.552 --> 00:05:55.894
There was no press about it,

00:05:55.918 --> 00:05:59.655
so anybody who happened to walk
into the museum to visit it that day

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:01.442
would see us with these crazy lights.
