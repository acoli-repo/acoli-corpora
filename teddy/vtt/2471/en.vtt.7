So that piece ended up
going to Sundance in 2012,

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:34.554

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:56.190
And this kind of reaction ended up being
the kind of reaction we saw

00:03:56.214 --> 00:03:58.984
over and over and over:

00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:02.714
people down on the ground
trying to comfort the seizure victim,
