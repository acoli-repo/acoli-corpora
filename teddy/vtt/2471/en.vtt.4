As soon as I heard that audio,

00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:03.496
I knew that this would be
the kind of evocative piece

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.624
that could really describe
what was going on at food banks.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.906
So here's the real line.
You can see how long it was, right?

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.557
And again, as I said, we didn't
have very much funding,

00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:17.331
so I had to reproduce it
with virtual humans that were donated,

00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:21.481
and people begged and borrowed favors
to help me create the models

00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:23.664
and make things as accurate as we could.

00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:26.297
And then we tried to convey
what happened that day

00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:29.115
with as much as accuracy as is possible.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.878
