00:02:59.023 --> 00:03:01.872
Voice: We need an ambulance.

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.198
Nonny de la Peña: So the man on the right,

00:03:04.222 --> 00:03:06.094
for him, he's walking around the body.

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:08.815
For him, he's in the room with that body.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.172
Like, that guy is at his feet.

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:13.808
And even though,
through his peripheral vision,

00:03:13.832 --> 00:03:15.903
he can see that he's in this lab space,

00:03:15.927 --> 00:03:20.140
he should be able to see
that he's not actually on the street,

00:03:20.164 --> 00:03:23.060
but he feels like he's there
with those people.

00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:25.094
He's very cautious not to step on this guy

00:03:25.118 --> 00:03:26.784
who isn't really there, right?

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:30.609
So that piece ended up
going to Sundance in 2012,
