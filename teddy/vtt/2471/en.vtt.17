What is different is the sense
of being on scene,

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:34.435
whether you're watching
a guy collapse from hunger

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:36.944
or feeling like you're
in the middle of a bomb scene.

00:08:36.968 --> 00:08:41.916
And this is kind of what has driven me
forward with these pieces,

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.663
and thinking about how to make them.

00:08:43.687 --> 00:08:47.882
We're trying to make this, obviously,
beyond the headset, more available.

00:08:47.906 --> 00:08:50.833
We're creating mobile pieces
like the Trayvon Martin piece.

00:08:50.857 --> 00:08:54.406
And these things have had impact.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.002
I've had Americans tell me
that they've donated,

00:08:57.026 --> 00:09:01.420
direct deductions from their bank account,
money to go to Syrian children refugees.
