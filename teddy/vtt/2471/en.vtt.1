00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:32.910
So the deal is that with VR,
virtual reality,

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.934
I can put you on scene

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.759
in the middle of the story.

00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:41.632
By putting on these goggles
that track wherever you look,

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:44.584
you get this whole-body sensation,

00:00:44.608 --> 00:00:46.815
like you're actually, like, there.

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:50.611
So five years ago was about when
I really began to push the envelope

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:53.885
with using virtual reality
and journalism together.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.457
And I wanted to do a piece about hunger.

00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:59.640
Families in America are going hungry,
food banks are overwhelmed,

00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:01.719
and they're often running out of food.
