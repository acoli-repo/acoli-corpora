00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.096
just like you see this bird, an eagle,
gracefully coordinating its wings,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.416
its eyes and feet
to grab prey out of the water,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.336
our robot can go fishing, too.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.856
(Laughter)

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.936
In this case, this is a Philly cheesesteak
hoagie that it's grabbing out of thin air.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.360
(Laughter)

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.976
So you can see this robot
going at about three meters per second,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.136
which is faster than walking speed,
coordinating its arms, its claws

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.280
and its flight with split-second timing
to achieve this maneuver.
