00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.696
So this video illustrates the basic idea.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.016
You have four robots --

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.280
one of the robots has actually been
hijacked by a human operator, literally.

00:07:07.217 --> 00:07:09.456
But because the robots
interact with each other,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.136
they sense their neighbors,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.456
they essentially follow.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.840
And here there's a single person
able to lead this network of followers.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.056
So again, it's not because all the robots
know where they're supposed to go.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.400
It's because they're just reacting
to the positions of their neighbors.
