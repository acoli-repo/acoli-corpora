00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.936
In my lab, we build
autonomous aerial robots

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.840
like the one you see flying here.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.416
Unlike the commercially available drones
that you can buy today,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.080
this robot doesn't have any GPS on board.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.376
So without GPS,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.680
it's hard for robots like this
to determine their position.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.976
This robot uses onboard sensors,
cameras and laser scanners,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.696
to scan the environment.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.776
It detects features from the environment,
