00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.376
is that these robots have onboard sensors
that end up being very expensive --

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.840
a laser scanner, a camera
and the processors.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.320
That drives up the cost of this robot.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.096
So we asked ourselves a question:

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.896
what consumer product
can you buy in an electronics store

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.200
that is inexpensive, that's lightweight,
that has sensing onboard and computation?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.736
And we invented the flying phone.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.696
(Laughter)

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.896
So this robot uses a Samsung Galaxy
smartphone that you can buy off the shelf,
