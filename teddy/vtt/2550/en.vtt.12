00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.376
And if you plot a histogram
of the number of Band-Aids we've ordered

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.976
in the past, that sort of tailed off now.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.960
Because these robots are really safe.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.216
The small size has some disadvantages,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.320
and nature has found a number of ways
to compensate for these disadvantages.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.960
The basic idea is they aggregate
to form large groups, or swarms.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.296
So, similarly, in our lab,
we try to create artificial robot swarms.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.701
And this is quite challenging

00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:29.045
because now you have to think
about networks of robots.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.656
And within each robot,
