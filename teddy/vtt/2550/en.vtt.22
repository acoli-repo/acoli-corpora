00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.056
By doing this, you tell the farmer
how many fruits she has in every tree

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.336
and allow her to estimate
the yield in the orchard,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.200
optimizing the production
chain downstream.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.256
The second thing we can do

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.776
is take models of plants, construct
three-dimensional reconstructions,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.336
and from that estimate the canopy size,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.136
and then correlate the canopy size
to the amount of leaf area on every plant.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.336
And this is called the leaf area index.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.296
So if you know this leaf area index,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.776
you essentially have a measure of how much
photosynthesis is possible in every plant,
