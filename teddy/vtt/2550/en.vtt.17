00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.176
mathematical descriptions
of the shape they need to execute.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.696
And these shapes can be varying
as a function of time,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.216
and you'll see these robots
start from a circular formation,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.496
change into a rectangular formation,
stretch into a straight line,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.895
back into an ellipse.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:46.536
And they do this with the same
kind of split-second coordination

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.840
that you see in natural swarms, in nature.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.216
So why work with swarms?

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.360
Let me tell you about two applications
that we are very interested in.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.536
The first one has to do with agriculture,
