00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.656
And within each robot,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.296
you have to think about the interplay
of sensing, communication, computation --

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.280
and this network then becomes
quite difficult to control and manage.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.456
So from nature we take away
three organizing principles

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.640
that essentially allow us
to develop our algorithms.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.176
The first idea is that robots
need to be aware of their neighbors.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.640
They need to be able to sense
and communicate with their neighbors.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.696
So this video illustrates the basic idea.
