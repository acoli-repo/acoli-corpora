00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.280
and its flight with split-second timing
to achieve this maneuver.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.336
In another experiment,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.016
I want to show you
how the robot adapts its flight

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.416
to control its suspended payload,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.240
whose length is actually larger
than the width of the window.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.376
So in order to accomplish this,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.096
it actually has to pitch
and adjust the altitude

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.440
and swing the payload through.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.216
But of course we want
to make these even smaller,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.256
and we're inspired
in particular by honeybees.
