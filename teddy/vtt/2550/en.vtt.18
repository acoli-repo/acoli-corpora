00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.536
The first one has to do with agriculture,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.920
which is probably the biggest problem
that we're facing worldwide.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.016
As you well know,

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.560
one in every seven persons
in this earth is malnourished.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.400
Most of the land that we can cultivate
has already been cultivated.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.176
And the efficiency of most systems
in the world is improving,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.720
but our production system
efficiency is actually declining.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.296
And that's mostly because of water
shortage, crop diseases, climate change

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.840
and a couple of other things.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.840
So what can robots do?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.816
Well, we adopt an approach that's
called Precision Farming in the community.
