In addition to building
these small robots,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.560
we also experiment with aggressive
behaviors, like you see here.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.216
So this robot is now traveling
at two to three meters per second,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.736
pitching and rolling aggressively
as it changes direction.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.016
The main point is we can have
smaller robots that can go faster

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.000
and then travel in these
very unstructured environments.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.176
And in this next video,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.096
just like you see this bird, an eagle,
gracefully coordinating its wings,
