00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.376
and no matter how many robots
you introduce into the formation,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.976
or how many robots you pull out,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.136
each robot is simply
reacting to its neighbor.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.136
It's aware of the fact that it needs
to form the circular shape,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.936
but collaborating with its neighbors

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.680
it forms the shape
without central coordination.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.936
Now if you put these ideas together,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.856
the third idea is that we
essentially give these robots

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.176
mathematical descriptions
of the shape they need to execute.
