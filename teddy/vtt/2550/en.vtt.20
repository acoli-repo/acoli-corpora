00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.680
the inputs in this case being water,
fertilizer and pesticide.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.256
Here you'll see robots
traveling through an apple orchard,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.536
and in a minute you'll see
two of its companions

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.370
doing the same thing on the left side.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.456
And what they're doing is essentially
building a map of the orchard.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.296
Within the map is a map
of every plant in this orchard.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.976
(Robot buzzing)

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.896
Let's see what those maps look like.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.216
In the next video, you'll see the cameras
that are being used on this robot.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.480
On the top-left is essentially
a standard color camera.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.936
On the left-center is an infrared camera.
