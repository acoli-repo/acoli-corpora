00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.416
So here you'll see, on the top right,
what the robot sees with the camera.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.656
And on the main screen --

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.136
and of course this is sped up
by a factor of four --

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.827
on the main screen you'll see
the map that it's building.

00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:14.136
So this is a high-resolution map
of the corridor around our laboratory.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.496
And in a minute
you'll see it enter our lab,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.376
which is recognizable
by the clutter that you see.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.416
(Laughter)

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.447
But the main point I want to convey to you

00:01:22.472 --> 00:01:26.056
is that these robots are capable
of building high-resolution maps

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.576
at five centimeters resolution,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.776
allowing somebody who is outside the lab,
or outside the building
