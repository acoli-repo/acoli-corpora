00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.096
This is probably the first planned mid-air
collision, at one-twentieth normal speed.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.978
These are going at a relative speed
of two meters per second,

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:39.482
and this illustrates the basic principle.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.176
The two-gram carbon fiber cage around it
prevents the propellers from entangling,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.496
but essentially the collision is absorbed
and the robot responds to the collisions.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.080
And so small also means safe.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.416
In my lab, as we developed these robots,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.060
we start off with these big robots

00:05:57.084 --> 00:05:59.896
and then now we're down
to these small robots.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.376
And if you plot a histogram
