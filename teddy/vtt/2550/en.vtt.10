00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.656
along with lower inertia,
you're resistant to collisions.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.400
And that makes you more robust.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.456
So just like these honeybees,
we build small robots.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.856
And this particular one
is only 25 grams in weight.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.040
It consumes only six watts of power.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.976
And it can travel
up to six meters per second.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.336
So if I normalize that to its size,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.000
it's like a Boeing 787 traveling
ten times the speed of sound.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.096
(Laughter)

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.040
And I want to show you an example.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.096
This is probably the first planned mid-air
collision, at one-twentieth normal speed.
