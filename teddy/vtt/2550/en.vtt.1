00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.776
It detects features from the environment,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.536
and it determines where it is
relative to those features,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.696
using a method of triangulation.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.176
And then it can assemble
all these features into a map,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.936
like you see behind me.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.896
And this map then allows the robot
to understand where the obstacles are

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.640
and navigate in a collision-free manner.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.256
What I want to show you next

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.496
is a set of experiments
we did inside our laboratory,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.000
where this robot was able
to go for longer distances.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.416
So here you'll see, on the top right,
what the robot sees with the camera.
