Well, we adopt an approach that's
called Precision Farming in the community.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.216
And the basic idea is that we fly
aerial robots through orchards,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.360
and then we build
precision models of individual plants.

00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:44.496
So just like personalized medicine,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.336
while you might imagine wanting
to treat every patient individually,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.056
what we'd like to do is build
models of individual plants

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.216
and then tell the farmer
what kind of inputs every plant needs --

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.680
the inputs in this case being water,
fertilizer and pesticide.
