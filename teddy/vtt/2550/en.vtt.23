00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.776
you essentially have a measure of how much
photosynthesis is possible in every plant,

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.680
which again tells you
how healthy each plant is.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.736
By combining visual
and infrared information,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.056
we can also compute indices such as NDVI.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.896
And in this particular case,
you can essentially see

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.936
there are some crops that are
not doing as well as other crops.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.016
This is easily discernible from imagery,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.256
not just visual imagery but combining

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.056
both visual imagery and infrared imagery.
