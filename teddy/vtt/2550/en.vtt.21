00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.936
On the left-center is an infrared camera.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.736
And on the bottom-left
is a thermal camera.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.096
And on the main panel, you're seeing
a three-dimensional reconstruction

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:46.240
of every tree in the orchard
as the sensors fly right past the trees.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.680
Armed with information like this,
we can do several things.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.456
The first and possibly the most important
thing we can do is very simple:

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.920
count the number of fruits on every tree.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.056
By doing this, you tell the farmer
how many fruits she has in every tree
