00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.776
allowing somebody who is outside the lab,
or outside the building

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.016
to deploy these
without actually going inside,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.800
and trying to infer
what happens inside the building.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.640
Now there's one problem
with robots like this.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.800
The first problem is it's pretty big.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.800
Because it's big, it's heavy.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.680
And these robots consume
about 100 watts per pound.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.640
And this makes for
a very short mission life.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.456
The second problem

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.376
is that these robots have onboard sensors
that end up being very expensive --
