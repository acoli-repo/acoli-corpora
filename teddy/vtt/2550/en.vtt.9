00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.256
and we're inspired
in particular by honeybees.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.536
So if you look at honeybees,
and this is a slowed down video,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.280
they're so small,
the inertia is so lightweight --

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.136
(Laughter)

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.696
that they don't care --
they bounce off my hand, for example.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.880
This is a little robot
that mimics the honeybee behavior.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.816
And smaller is better,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.376
because along with the small size
you get lower inertia.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.936
Along with lower inertia --

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.816
(Robot buzzing, laughter)

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.656
along with lower inertia,
you're resistant to collisions.
