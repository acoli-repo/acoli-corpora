00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.583
Coming out of the bright Texas sunshine,

00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:07.462
my eyes squinted under
the harsh fluorescent lights.

00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:12.425
There were gray rubber bucket seats
bolted to the ground,

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:14.260
white vinyl tiles,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.553
cinder block walls.

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:21.851
We walked through the metal detector
and gave our IDs to the guard,

00:00:21.893 --> 00:00:24.729
and we put our cell phones in lockers.

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.149
Another guard came
and escorted us down a hallway

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:30.318
into a small courtroom.
