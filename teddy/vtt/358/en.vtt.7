Math controls intuition
and tames creativity.

00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:35.937
Almost everyone
who hasn't heard this before

00:03:35.937 --> 00:03:38.647
is surprised when they hear
that if you take

00:03:38.647 --> 00:03:43.187
a 0.1 millimeter thick sheet of paper,
the size we normally use,

00:03:43.187 --> 00:03:46.505
and, if it were big enough,
fold it 50 times,

00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:52.205
its thickness would extend almost
the distance from the Earth to the sun.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.201
Your intuition tells you it's impossible.

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:57.622
Do the math and you'll see it's right.

00:03:57.622 --> 00:04:00.135
That's what math is for.
