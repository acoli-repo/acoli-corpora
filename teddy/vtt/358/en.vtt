00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.120
Imagine you're in a bar, or a club,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.130
and you start talking, and after a while,
the question comes up,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.000
"So, what do you do for work?"

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:14.950
And since you think
your job is interesting,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.230
you say, "I'm a mathematician."
(Laughter)

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.080
And inevitably, during that conversation

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.750
one of these two phrases come up:

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.195
A) "I was terrible at math,
but it wasn't my fault.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.613
It's because the teacher
was awful." (Laughter)
