00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:32.366
All that makes science, science
is the rigor of math.

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:37.242
And that rigor factors in
because its results are eternal.

00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:39.757
You probably said or were told
at some point

00:04:39.757 --> 00:04:42.708
that diamonds are forever, right?

00:04:44.178 --> 00:04:46.392
That depends on
your definition of forever!

00:04:46.392 --> 00:04:48.883
A theorem -- that really is forever.

00:04:48.883 --> 00:04:50.134
(Laughter)

00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:53.486
The Pythagorean theorem is still true

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:56.601
even though Pythagoras is dead,
I assure you it's true. (Laughter)

00:04:56.601 --> 00:04:57.946
Even if the world collapsed

00:04:57.946 --> 00:05:00.391
the Pythagorean theorem
would still be true.
