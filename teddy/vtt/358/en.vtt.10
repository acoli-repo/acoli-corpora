00:04:57.946 --> 00:05:00.391
the Pythagorean theorem
would still be true.

00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:04.452
Wherever any two triangle sides
and a good hypotenuse get together

00:05:04.452 --> 00:05:05.673
(Laughter)

00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:08.534
the Pythagorean theorem goes all out.
It works like crazy.

00:05:08.534 --> 00:05:11.355
(Applause)

00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:19.407
Well, we mathematicians devote ourselves
to come up with theorems.

00:05:19.407 --> 00:05:21.143
Eternal truths.

00:05:21.143 --> 00:05:23.909
But it isn't always easy to know
the difference between

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.815
an eternal truth, or theorem,
and a mere conjecture.

00:05:26.815 --> 00:05:29.829
You need proof.

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.596
For example,
