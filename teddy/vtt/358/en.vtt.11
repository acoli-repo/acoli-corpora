00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.596
For example,

00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:36.423
let's say I have a big,
enormous, infinite field.

00:05:36.423 --> 00:05:40.132
I want to cover it with equal pieces,
without leaving any gaps.

00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:42.256
I could use squares, right?

00:05:42.256 --> 00:05:46.222
I could use triangles.
Not circles, those leave little gaps.

00:05:46.777 --> 00:05:49.134
Which is the best shape to use?

00:05:49.134 --> 00:05:53.687
One that covers the same surface,
but has a smaller border.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:58.396
In the year 300, Pappus of Alexandria
said the best is to use hexagons,

00:05:58.396 --> 00:06:00.243
just like bees do.
