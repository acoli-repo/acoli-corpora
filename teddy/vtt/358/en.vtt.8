00:03:57.622 --> 00:04:00.135
That's what math is for.

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:03.917
It's true that science, all types
of science, only makes sense

00:04:03.917 --> 00:04:07.288
because it makes us better understand
this beautiful world we live in.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:08.669
And in doing that,

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.179
it helps us avoid the pitfalls
of this painful world we live in.

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.657
There are sciences that help us
in this way quite directly.

00:04:15.657 --> 00:04:17.413
Oncological science, for example.

00:04:17.413 --> 00:04:20.904
And there are others we look at from afar,
with envy sometimes,

00:04:20.904 --> 00:04:23.464
but knowing that we are
what supports them.

00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:26.213
All the basic sciences
support them,

00:04:26.213 --> 00:04:28.649
including math.

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:32.366
All that makes science, science
is the rigor of math.
