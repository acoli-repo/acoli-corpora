00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.183
But remember I told you

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:33.726
I belong to that strange 0.8 percent
claiming something else?

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:36.929
So, go ahead, ask me what math is for.

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.858
Audience: What is math for?

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:44.673
Eduardo Sáenz de Cabezón: Okay,
76.34 percent of you asked the question,

00:02:44.673 --> 00:02:47.600
23.41 percent didn't say anything,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.827
and the 0.8 percent --

00:02:48.827 --> 00:02:51.675
I'm not sure what those guys are doing.

00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:55.175
Well, to my dear 76.31 percent --

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:59.815
it's true that math doesn't need
to serve a purpose,

00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:02.685
it's true that it's
a beautiful structure, a logical one,
