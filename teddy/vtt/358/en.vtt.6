00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:02.685
it's true that it's
a beautiful structure, a logical one,

00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:05.537
probably one
of the greatest collective efforts

00:03:05.537 --> 00:03:07.633
ever achieved in human history.

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:09.732
But it's also true that there,

00:03:09.732 --> 00:03:14.331
where scientists and technicians
are looking for mathematical theories

00:03:14.331 --> 00:03:16.641
that allow them to advance,

00:03:16.641 --> 00:03:20.438
they're within the structure of math,
which permeates everything.

00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:23.585
It's true that we have to go
somewhat deeper,

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:25.308
to see what's behind science.

00:03:25.308 --> 00:03:28.858
Science operates on intuition, creativity.

00:03:29.348 --> 00:03:32.772
Math controls intuition
and tames creativity.
