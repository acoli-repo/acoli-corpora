00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:31.123
And that became a theorem,
the honeycomb theorem,

00:06:31.123 --> 00:06:33.183
that will be true forever and ever,

00:06:33.183 --> 00:06:36.224
for longer than any diamond
you may have. (Laughter)

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.033
But what happens if we go
to three dimensions?

00:06:39.033 --> 00:06:42.944
If I want to fill the space
with equal pieces,

00:06:43.464 --> 00:06:44.805
without leaving any gaps,

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:46.638
I can use cubes, right?

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:49.994
Not spheres, those leave little gaps.
(Laughter)

00:06:49.994 --> 00:06:52.957
What is the best shape to use?

00:06:52.957 --> 00:06:57.017
Lord Kelvin, of the famous
Kelvin degrees and all,

00:06:57.607 --> 00:07:03.121
said that the best was to use
a truncated octahedron
