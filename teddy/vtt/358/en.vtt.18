00:08:58.837 --> 00:09:02.567
So, if you want to tell someone

00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:06.823
that you will love them forever

00:09:06.823 --> 00:09:08.890
you can give them a diamond.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.421
But if you want to tell them
that you'll love them forever and ever,

00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:14.172
give them a theorem!

00:09:14.172 --> 00:09:15.263
(Laughter)

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.853
But hang on a minute!

00:09:18.783 --> 00:09:20.183
You'll have to prove it,

00:09:20.183 --> 00:09:22.466
so your love doesn't remain

00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:24.299
a conjecture.

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:27.543
(Applause)
