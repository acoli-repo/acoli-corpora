00:00:55.924 --> 00:01:00.124
So when mathematicians are asked
what math is for,

00:01:00.124 --> 00:01:02.404
they tend to fall into two groups:

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:07.739
54.51 percent of mathematicians
will assume an attacking position,

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:13.559
and 44.77 percent of mathematicians
will take a defensive position.

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:17.068
There's a strange 0.8 percent,
among which I include myself.

00:01:17.068 --> 00:01:19.155
Who are the ones that attack?

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:21.902
The attacking ones are mathematicians
who would tell you

00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:23.849
this question makes no sense,

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:26.597
because mathematics
have a meaning all their own --

00:01:26.597 --> 00:01:29.144
a beautiful edifice with its own logic --

00:01:29.144 --> 00:01:31.011
and that there's no point
