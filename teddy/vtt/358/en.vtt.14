00:06:57.607 --> 00:07:03.121
said that the best was to use
a truncated octahedron

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.507
which, as you all know --

00:07:07.507 --> 00:07:09.035
(Laughter) --

00:07:09.035 --> 00:07:10.814
is this thing here!

00:07:10.814 --> 00:07:13.753
(Applause)

00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:17.225
Come on.

00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:20.862
Who doesn't have a truncated
octahedron at home? (Laughter)

00:07:20.862 --> 00:07:22.089
Even a plastic one.

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:24.846
"Honey, get the truncated octahedron,
we're having guests."

00:07:24.846 --> 00:07:26.240
Everybody has one!
(Laughter)

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.614
But Kelvin didn't prove it.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:32.655
It remained a conjecture --
Kelvin's conjecture.
