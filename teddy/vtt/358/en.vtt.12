just like bees do.

00:06:00.243 --> 00:06:01.990
But he didn't prove it.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.688
The guy said, "Hexagons, great!
Let's go with hexagons!"

00:06:04.688 --> 00:06:07.656
He didn't prove it,
it remained a conjecture.

00:06:07.656 --> 00:06:09.334
"Hexagons!"

00:06:09.334 --> 00:06:12.964
And the world, as you know,
split into Pappists and anti-Pappists,

00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:18.253
until 1700 years later

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:23.707
when in 1999, Thomas Hales proved

00:06:23.707 --> 00:06:28.641
that Pappus and the bees were right --
the best shape to use was the hexagon.

00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:31.123
And that became a theorem,
the honeycomb theorem,
