In 1962, with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring,"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I think for people like me in the world of the making of things,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the canary in the mine wasn't singing.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And so the question that we might not have birds

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And the question was, were the birds singing?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be.
