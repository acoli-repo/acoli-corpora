00:08:29.382 --> 00:08:31.601
is about the best system
in the world for this,

00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:36.718
even compared to native
human understanding.

00:08:36.718 --> 00:08:39.682
This is a system that we
put together at my company

00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:41.728
which shows putting
all this stuff together.

00:08:41.728 --> 00:08:44.189
These are pictures which
have no text attached,

00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:46.541
and as I'm typing in here sentences,

00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:49.510
in real time it's understanding
these pictures

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.189
and figuring out what they're about

00:08:51.189 --> 00:08:54.352
and finding pictures that are similar
to the text that I'm writing.

00:08:54.352 --> 00:08:57.108
So you can see, it's actually
understanding my sentences

00:08:57.108 --> 00:08:59.332
and actually understanding these pictures.

00:08:59.332 --> 00:09:01.891
I know that you've seen
something like this on Google,
