00:10:59.668 --> 00:11:04.168
the computer system actually discovered
that the cells around the cancer

00:11:04.168 --> 00:11:07.508
are as important as
the cancer cells themselves

00:11:07.508 --> 00:11:09.260
in making a diagnosis.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.621
This is the opposite of what pathologists
had been taught for decades.

00:11:14.621 --> 00:11:17.913
In each of those two cases,
they were systems developed

00:11:17.913 --> 00:11:21.534
by a combination of medical experts
and machine learning experts,

00:11:21.534 --> 00:11:24.275
but as of last year,
we're now beyond that too.

00:11:24.275 --> 00:11:27.824
This is an example of
identifying cancerous areas

00:11:27.824 --> 00:11:30.354
of human tissue under a microscope.
