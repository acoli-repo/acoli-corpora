In 1956, he wanted to get this computer

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:34.548
to be able to beat him at checkers.

00:00:34.548 --> 00:00:36.588
How can you write a program,

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:40.394
lay out in excruciating detail,
how to be better than you at checkers?

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:42.116
So he came up with an idea:

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:45.840
he had the computer play
against itself thousands of times

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.364
and learn how to play checkers.

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:51.544
And indeed it worked,
and in fact, by 1962,

00:00:51.544 --> 00:00:55.561
this computer had beaten
the Connecticut state champion.

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:58.534
So Arthur Samuel was
the father of machine learning,

00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:00.251
and I have a great debt to him,
