00:02:28.488 --> 00:02:31.075
We don't know how to write
those programs by hand,

00:02:31.075 --> 00:02:34.072
but with machine learning,
this is now possible.

00:02:34.072 --> 00:02:36.680
And in fact, this car has driven 
over a million miles

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.186
without any accidents on regular roads.

00:02:40.196 --> 00:02:44.110
So we now know that computers can learn,

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.010
and computers can learn to do things

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.848
that we actually sometimes
don't know how to do ourselves,

00:02:48.848 --> 00:02:51.733
or maybe can do them better than us.

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:55.928
One of the most amazing examples
I've seen of machine learning

00:02:55.928 --> 00:02:58.320
happened on a project that I ran at Kaggle

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.911
where a team run by a guy
called Geoffrey Hinton
