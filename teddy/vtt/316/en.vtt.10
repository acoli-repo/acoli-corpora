(Applause)

00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:04.744
Jeremy Howard: Well, that was at
a machine learning conference in China.

00:05:04.744 --> 00:05:07.114
It's not often, actually,
at academic conferences

00:05:07.114 --> 00:05:09.011
that you do hear spontaneous applause,

00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:12.687
although of course sometimes
at TEDx conferences, feel free.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:15.482
Everything you saw there
was happening with deep learning.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.007
(Applause) Thank you.

00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:19.289
The transcription in English
was deep learning.

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.701
The translation to Chinese and the text
in the top right, deep learning,

00:05:22.701 --> 00:05:26.008
and the construction of the voice
was deep learning as well.

00:05:26.008 --> 00:05:29.242
So deep learning is
this extraordinary thing.

00:05:29.242 --> 00:05:32.341
It's a single algorithm that
can seem to do almost anything,
