00:09:59.196 --> 00:10:03.264
In tests, humans prefer
the computer-generated caption

00:10:03.264 --> 00:10:04.791
one out of four times.

00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:06.855
Now this system is now only two weeks old,

00:10:06.855 --> 00:10:08.701
so probably within the next year,

00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:11.502
the computer algorithm will be
well past human performance

00:10:11.502 --> 00:10:13.364
at the rate things are going.

00:10:13.364 --> 00:10:16.413
So computers can also write.

00:10:16.413 --> 00:10:19.888
So we put all this together and it leads
to very exciting opportunities.

00:10:19.888 --> 00:10:21.380
For example, in medicine,

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.905
a team in Boston announced
that they had discovered

00:10:23.905 --> 00:10:26.854
dozens of new clinically relevant features

00:10:26.854 --> 00:10:31.120
of tumors which help doctors
make a prognosis of a cancer.
