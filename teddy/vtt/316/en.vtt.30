00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:03.395
In this case, even after we let the
computer try to rotate this for a while,

00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:06.744
we still find that the left sides
and the right sides pictures

00:15:06.744 --> 00:15:08.222
are all mixed up together.

00:15:08.222 --> 00:15:10.362
So we can again give
the computer some hints,

00:15:10.362 --> 00:15:13.338
and we say, okay, try and find
a projection that separates out

00:15:13.338 --> 00:15:15.945
the left sides and the right sides
as much as possible

00:15:15.945 --> 00:15:18.067
using this deep learning algorithm.

00:15:18.067 --> 00:15:21.009
And giving it that hint --
ah, okay, it's been successful.

00:15:21.009 --> 00:15:23.891
It's managed to find a way
of thinking about these objects

00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:26.271
that's separated out these together.

00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:28.709
So you get the idea here.

00:15:28.709 --> 00:15:36.906
This is a case not where the human
is being replaced by a computer,
