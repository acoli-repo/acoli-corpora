00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:32.818
looking to try to figure out 
from one and a half million images

00:06:32.818 --> 00:06:34.256
what they're pictures of.

00:06:34.256 --> 00:06:37.789
As of 2014, we're now down
to a six percent error rate

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:39.242
in image recognition.

00:06:39.242 --> 00:06:41.268
This is better than people, again.

00:06:41.268 --> 00:06:45.037
So machines really are doing
an extraordinarily good job of this,

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:47.306
and it is now being used in industry.

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:50.348
For example, Google announced last year

00:06:50.348 --> 00:06:54.933
that they had mapped every single
location in France in two hours,

00:06:54.933 --> 00:06:58.380
and the way they did it was
that they fed street view images

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.699
into a deep learning algorithm
to recognize and read street numbers.
