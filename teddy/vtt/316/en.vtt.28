00:13:57.266 --> 00:14:02.292
or a radiologist indicating
potentially troublesome nodules.

00:14:02.292 --> 00:14:04.851
And sometimes it can be
difficult for the algorithm.

00:14:04.851 --> 00:14:06.815
In this case, it got kind of confused.

00:14:06.815 --> 00:14:09.365
The fronts and the backs
of the cars are all mixed up.

00:14:09.365 --> 00:14:11.437
So here we have to be a bit more careful,

00:14:11.437 --> 00:14:14.669
manually selecting these fronts
as opposed to the backs,

00:14:14.669 --> 00:14:20.175
then telling the computer
that this is a type of group

00:14:20.175 --> 00:14:21.523
that we're interested in.

00:14:21.523 --> 00:14:24.200
So we do that for a while,
we skip over a little bit,

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.446
and then we train the
machine learning algorithm

00:14:26.446 --> 00:14:28.420
based on these couple of hundred things,

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.445
and we hope that it's gotten a lot better.
