00:10:26.854 --> 00:10:31.120
of tumors which help doctors
make a prognosis of a cancer.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.516
Very similarly, in Stanford,

00:10:34.516 --> 00:10:38.179
a group there announced that,
looking at tissues under magnification,

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.560
they've developed 
a machine learning-based system

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.142
which in fact is better
than human pathologists

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:47.519
at predicting survival rates
for cancer sufferers.

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:50.764
In both of these cases, not only
were the predictions more accurate,

00:10:50.764 --> 00:10:53.266
but they generated new insightful science.

00:10:53.276 --> 00:10:54.781
In the radiology case,

00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:57.876
they were new clinical indicators
that humans can understand.

00:10:57.876 --> 00:10:59.668
In this pathology case,

00:10:59.668 --> 00:11:04.168
the computer system actually discovered
that the cells around the cancer
