00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:01.195
and this is because it's using
the power of machine learning.

00:02:01.195 --> 00:02:04.152
These are algorithms that have
learned how to do this from data

00:02:04.152 --> 00:02:07.399
rather than being programmed by hand.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.877
This is also how IBM was successful

00:02:09.877 --> 00:02:13.739
in getting Watson to beat
the two world champions at "Jeopardy,"

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.964
answering incredibly subtle
and complex questions like this one.

00:02:16.964 --> 00:02:19.799
["The ancient 'Lion of Nimrud' went missing
from this city's national museum in 2003 
(along with a lot of other stuff)"]

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.034
This is also why we are now able
to see the first self-driving cars.

00:02:23.034 --> 00:02:25.856
If you want to be able to tell
the difference between, say,

00:02:25.856 --> 00:02:28.488
a tree and a pedestrian,
well, that's pretty important.

00:02:28.488 --> 00:02:31.075
We don't know how to write
those programs by hand,
