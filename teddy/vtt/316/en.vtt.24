00:11:56.921 --> 00:12:00.148
So myself, as somebody with
no previous background in medicine,

00:12:00.148 --> 00:12:03.875
I seem to be entirely well qualified
to start a new medical company,

00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:06.021
which I did.

00:12:06.021 --> 00:12:07.761
I was kind of terrified of doing it,

00:12:07.761 --> 00:12:10.650
but the theory seemed to suggest
that it ought to be possible

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:16.142
to do very useful medicine
using just these data analytic techniques.

00:12:16.142 --> 00:12:18.622
And thankfully, the feedback
has been fantastic,

00:12:18.622 --> 00:12:20.978
not just from the media
but from the medical community,

00:12:20.978 --> 00:12:23.322
who have been very supportive.

00:12:23.322 --> 00:12:27.471
The theory is that we can take
the middle part of the medical process

00:12:27.471 --> 00:12:30.364
and turn that into data analysis
as much as possible,
