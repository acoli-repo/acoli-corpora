00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.445
and we hope that it's gotten a lot better.

00:14:30.445 --> 00:14:33.518
You can see, it's now started to fade
some of these pictures out,

00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:38.226
showing us that it already is recognizing
how to understand some of these itself.

00:14:38.226 --> 00:14:41.128
We can then use this concept
of similar images,

00:14:41.128 --> 00:14:43.222
and using similar images, you can now see,

00:14:43.222 --> 00:14:47.241
the computer at this point is able to
entirely find just the fronts of cars.

00:14:47.241 --> 00:14:50.189
So at this point, the human
can tell the computer,

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:52.482
okay, yes, you've done
a good job of that.

00:14:53.652 --> 00:14:55.837
Sometimes, of course, even at this point

00:14:55.837 --> 00:14:59.511
it's still difficult
to separate out groups.

00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:03.395
In this case, even after we let the
computer try to rotate this for a while,
