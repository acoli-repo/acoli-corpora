00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:00.251
and I have a great debt to him,

00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:03.014
because I am a machine
learning practitioner.

00:01:03.014 --> 00:01:04.479
I was the president of Kaggle,

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.867
a community of over 200,000
machine learning practictioners.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.925
Kaggle puts up competitions

00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:13.633
to try and get them to solve
previously unsolved problems,

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:17.470
and it's been successful 
hundreds of times.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.940
So from this vantage point,
I was able to find out

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.890
a lot about what machine learning
can do in the past, can do today,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.252
and what it could do in the future.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:30.675
Perhaps the first big success of 
machine learning commercially was Google.
