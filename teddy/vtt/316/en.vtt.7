00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.412
in The New York Times in a front page
article a few weeks later.

00:03:31.412 --> 00:03:34.147
This is Geoffrey Hinton
here on the left-hand side.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:38.488
Deep learning is an algorithm
inspired by how the human brain works,

00:03:38.488 --> 00:03:40.300
and as a result it's an algorithm

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.141
which has no theoretical limitations
on what it can do.

00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:46.964
The more data you give it and the more
computation time you give it,

00:03:46.964 --> 00:03:48.276
the better it gets.

00:03:48.276 --> 00:03:50.615
The New York Times also
showed in this article

00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:52.857
another extraordinary
result of deep learning

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:55.569
which I'm going to show you now.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.510
It shows that computers 
can listen and understand.
