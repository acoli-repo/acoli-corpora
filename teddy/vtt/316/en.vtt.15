00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:30.877
similar directions of the faces,

00:07:30.877 --> 00:07:32.665
even some with their tongue out.

00:07:32.665 --> 00:07:35.695
This is not clearly looking
at the text of a web page.

00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:37.107
All I uploaded was an image.

00:07:37.107 --> 00:07:41.128
So we now have computers which
really understand what they see

00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:42.752
and can therefore search databases

00:07:42.752 --> 00:07:46.306
of hundreds of millions
of images in real time.

00:07:46.306 --> 00:07:49.536
So what does it mean
now that computers can see?

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:51.553
Well, it's not just 
that computers can see.

00:07:51.553 --> 00:07:53.622
In fact, deep learning
has done more than that.

00:07:53.622 --> 00:07:56.570
Complex, nuanced sentences like this one

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.394
are now understandable
with deep learning algorithms.

00:07:59.394 --> 00:08:00.697
As you can see here,
