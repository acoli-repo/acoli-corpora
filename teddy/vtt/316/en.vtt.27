00:13:29.577 --> 00:13:33.009
so you can see here the computer
rotating this through that space,

00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:35.001
trying to find new areas of structure.

00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:36.782
And when it does so successfully,

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:40.786
the human who is driving it can then
point out the areas that are interesting.

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:43.208
So here, the computer has
successfully found areas,

00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:45.770
for example, angles.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.376
So as we go through this process,

00:13:47.376 --> 00:13:49.716
we're gradually telling
the computer more and more

00:13:49.716 --> 00:13:52.144
about the kinds of structures
we're looking for.

00:13:52.144 --> 00:13:53.916
You can imagine in a diagnostic test

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:57.266
this would be a pathologist identifying
areas of pathosis, for example,

00:13:57.266 --> 00:14:02.292
or a radiologist indicating
potentially troublesome nodules.
