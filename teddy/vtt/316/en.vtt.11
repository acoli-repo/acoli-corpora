00:05:29.242 --> 00:05:32.341
It's a single algorithm that
can seem to do almost anything,

00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:35.452
and I discovered that a year earlier,
it had also learned to see.

00:05:35.452 --> 00:05:37.628
In this obscure competition from Germany

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:40.225
called the German Traffic Sign 
Recognition Benchmark,

00:05:40.225 --> 00:05:43.618
deep learning had learned
to recognize traffic signs like this one.

00:05:43.618 --> 00:05:45.712
Not only could it
recognize the traffic signs

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.470
better than any other algorithm,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.189
the leaderboard actually showed
it was better than people,

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:52.041
about twice as good as people.

00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:54.037
So by 2011, we had the first example

00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:57.442
of computers that can see
better than people.

00:05:57.442 --> 00:05:59.491
Since that time, a lot has happened.

00:05:59.491 --> 00:06:03.005
In 2012, Google announced that
they had a deep learning algorithm
