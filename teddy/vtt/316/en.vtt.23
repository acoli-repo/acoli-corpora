00:11:27.824 --> 00:11:30.354
of human tissue under a microscope.

00:11:30.354 --> 00:11:34.967
The system being shown here
can identify those areas more accurately,

00:11:34.967 --> 00:11:37.742
or about as accurately,
as human pathologists,

00:11:37.742 --> 00:11:41.134
but was built entirely with deep learning
using no medical expertise

00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:43.660
by people who have
no background in the field.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.285
Similarly, here, this neuron segmentation.

00:11:47.285 --> 00:11:50.953
We can now segment neurons
about as accurately as humans can,

00:11:50.953 --> 00:11:53.670
but this system was developed
with deep learning

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.921
using people with no previous 
background in medicine.

00:11:56.921 --> 00:12:00.148
So myself, as somebody with
no previous background in medicine,
