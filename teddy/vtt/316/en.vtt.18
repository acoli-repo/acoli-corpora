I know that you've seen
something like this on Google,

00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:04.666
where you can type in things
and it will show you pictures,

00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:08.090
but actually what it's doing is it's
searching the webpage for the text.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.091
This is very different from actually
understanding the images.

00:09:11.091 --> 00:09:13.843
This is something that computers
have only been able to do

00:09:13.843 --> 00:09:17.091
for the first time in the last few months.

00:09:17.091 --> 00:09:21.182
So we can see now that computers
can not only see but they can also read,

00:09:21.182 --> 00:09:24.947
and, of course, we've shown that they
can understand what they hear.

00:09:24.947 --> 00:09:28.389
Perhaps not surprising now that
I'm going to tell you they can write.

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:33.172
Here is some text that I generated
using a deep learning algorithm yesterday.
