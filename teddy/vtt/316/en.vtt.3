00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:30.675
Perhaps the first big success of 
machine learning commercially was Google.

00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:33.784
Google showed that it is
possible to find information

00:01:33.784 --> 00:01:35.536
by using a computer algorithm,

00:01:35.536 --> 00:01:38.437
and this algorithm is based
on machine learning.

00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:42.323
Since that time, there have been many
commercial successes of machine learning.

00:01:42.323 --> 00:01:44.160
Companies like Amazon and Netflix

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.876
use machine learning to suggest
products that you might like to buy,

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:49.896
movies that you might like to watch.

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:51.703
Sometimes, it's almost creepy.

00:01:51.703 --> 00:01:53.657
Companies like LinkedIn and Facebook

00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:56.251
sometimes will tell you about
who your friends might be

00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:58.228
and you have no idea how it did it,

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:01.195
and this is because it's using
the power of machine learning.
