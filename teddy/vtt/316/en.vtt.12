In 2012, Google announced that
they had a deep learning algorithm

00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:04.420
watch YouTube videos

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.857
and crunched the data
on 16,000 computers for a month,

00:06:07.857 --> 00:06:12.218
and the computer independently learned
about concepts such as people and cats

00:06:12.218 --> 00:06:14.027
just by watching the videos.

00:06:14.027 --> 00:06:16.379
This is much like the way
that humans learn.

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:19.119
Humans don't learn
by being told what they see,

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:22.450
but by learning for themselves
what these things are.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.819
Also in 2012, Geoffrey Hinton,
who we saw earlier,

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.677
won the very popular ImageNet competition,

00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:32.818
looking to try to figure out 
from one and a half million images
