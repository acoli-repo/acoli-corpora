00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.911
where a team run by a guy
called Geoffrey Hinton

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:03.463
from the University of Toronto

00:03:03.463 --> 00:03:06.140
won a competition for
automatic drug discovery.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.987
Now, what was extraordinary here
is not just that they beat

00:03:08.987 --> 00:03:13.000
all of the algorithms developed by Merck
or the international academic community,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.061
but nobody on the team had any background
in chemistry or biology or life sciences,

00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:20.230
and they did it in two weeks.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.611
How did they do this?

00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:25.342
They used an extraordinary algorithm
called deep learning.

00:03:25.342 --> 00:03:28.291
So important was this that in fact
the success was covered

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.412
in The New York Times in a front page
article a few weeks later.
