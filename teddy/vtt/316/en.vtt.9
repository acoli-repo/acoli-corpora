the standard text-to-speech system
so that it would sound like me.

00:04:36.364 --> 00:04:38.904
Again, the result's not perfect.

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:41.552
There are in fact quite a few errors.

00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:44.036
(In Chinese)

00:04:44.036 --> 00:04:47.403
(Applause)

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:53.022
There's much work to be done in this area.

00:04:53.022 --> 00:04:56.667
(In Chinese)

00:04:56.667 --> 00:05:00.100
(Applause)
