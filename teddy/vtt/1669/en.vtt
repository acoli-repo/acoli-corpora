00:00:00.944 --> 00:00:03.566
So, people want a lot of things out of life,

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:07.461
but I think, more than anything else, they want happiness.

00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:10.789
Aristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.061
towards which all other things aim.

00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:19.581
According to this view, the reason we want a big house

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:22.214
or a nice car

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:24.294
or a good job

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:26.742
isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.

00:00:26.742 --> 00:00:29.260
It's that we expect them to bring us

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.717
happiness.
