agriculture over a century, agriculture in about

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
1900 would have been recognizable to somebody

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows look

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
different. The machines were tractors or stuff

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
instead of mules, but the farmer would have

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
understood: this is what the guy's doing, this is

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
why he's doing it, this is where he's going. What

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
really started to change in agriculture is when

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
you started moving from this brute force

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
engineering and chemistry into biology, and that's

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
where you get your productivity increases. And as

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
you do that stuff, here's what happens to
