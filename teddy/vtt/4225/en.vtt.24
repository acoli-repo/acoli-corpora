biological principles to avoid brute force?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Think of it in the following terms. Think of it as

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
beginning to program stuff for specific purposes.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
genes as a software. And in the measure that you

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
begin to think of life as code that is

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
interchangeable, that can become energy, that can

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
become food, that can become fiber, that can

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
become human beings, that can become a whole

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
series of things, then you've got to shift your

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
approach as to how you're going to structure and

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
deal and think about energy in a very different
