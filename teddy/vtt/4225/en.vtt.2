00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
makes a difference.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
stuff where you want it, as opposed to where the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
rivers flood. You start getting this organic

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
agriculture; you start putting machinery onto this

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
stuff. Machinery, with a whole bunch of water,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
leads to very large-scale agriculture.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You put together machines and water, and you get

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
landscapes that look like this. And then you get

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
sales that look like this. It's brute force. So
