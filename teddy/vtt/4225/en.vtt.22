many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
understand the transition that occurred in

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
agriculture, from brute force into biological

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
force. And in the measure that you can do that,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
you can clean some stuff, and you can clean it

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
pretty quickly.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
We already have some indicators of productivity on

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
this stuff. OK, if you put steam into coal fields

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
or petroleum fields that have been running for

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
decades, you can get a really substantial

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
increase, like an eight-fold increase, in your

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
output. This is just the beginning stages of this
