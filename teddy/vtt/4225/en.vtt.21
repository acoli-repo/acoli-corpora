00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
may turn out that biological processes in coalmines

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
have the same process. If that is true, then

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
process that coal in a biological fashion as you

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
did in agriculture.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
importing corn into Iowa because you've built so

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to
