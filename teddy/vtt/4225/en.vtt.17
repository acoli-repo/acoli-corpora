mines, but not in others.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Any place you see a differential, there're some

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
interesting questions. There's some questions as

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
to what you should be doing with this stuff. But

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
exactly the same technology.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Here's your brute force approach. Once you get

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
through your brute force approach, then you just

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
the single largest source of carbon emissions,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
which are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
not the best use of bioenergy.
