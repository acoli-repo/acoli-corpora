hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
bioenergy works in a different way. And we've got

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
part of these solar panels.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
over west Texas, the types of wells that you're

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
of Kansas and those irrigated plots.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
This is how you farm oil. And as you think of

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started
