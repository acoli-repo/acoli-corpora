00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
output. This is just the beginning stages of this

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
stuff.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And as you think of biomaterials, this guy -- who

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
did part of the sequencing of the human genome,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
who just doubled the databases of genes and

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
proteins known on earth by sailing around the

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
world -- has been thinking about how you structure

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
this. And there's a series of smart people

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
thinking about this. And they've been putting

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
together companies like Synthetic Genomics, like,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
trying to do is to think of, how do you apply

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
biological principles to avoid brute force?
