00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
you do that stuff, here's what happens to

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
productivity.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Basically, you go from 250 hours to produce 100

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
bushels, to 40, to 15, to five. Agricultural labor

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
productivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
whereas the rest of the economy increased about

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
2.5 times. This is an absolutely massive increase

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
in how much is produced per person.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
The effect of this, of course, is it's not just

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.
