this. Although, again, I stress: we don't know.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
as you think of coal, this is what burned wheat

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And of course, coalmines are very dangerous

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
places because in some of these coalmines, you

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
get gas. When that gas blows up, people die. So

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
you're producing a biogas out of coal in some

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
mines, but not in others.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Any place you see a differential, there're some
