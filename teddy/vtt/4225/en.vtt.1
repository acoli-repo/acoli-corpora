do microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on how

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that, you really have to look first at agriculture.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So we've been planting stuff for 11,000 years. And

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests,

you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.

You're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation
