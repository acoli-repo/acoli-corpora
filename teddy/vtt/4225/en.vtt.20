be concentrated plant life, the reason why you may

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
get a differential in gas output between one mine

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and another one may not blow up -- may be because

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
This is a well-known phenomenon. (Laughter) You

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
may turn out that biological processes in coalmines

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
have the same process. If that is true, then
