00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
discussing what to do about a system that we don't

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
understand. We don't even know what oil is. We

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
don't know where oil comes from. I mean,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
literally, it's still a source of debate what

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
this black river of stuff is and where it comes

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
from. The best assumption, and one of the best

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
out of this stuff, that these things absorb

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
sunlight, rot under pressure for millions of

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
years, and you get these black rivers.
