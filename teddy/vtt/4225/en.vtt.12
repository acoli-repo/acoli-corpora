Now, the interesting thing about that thesis -- if

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and all hydrocarbons, turned out to be

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
concentrated sunlight. And if you think of

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
bioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
taking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
concentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
you get these rainbows.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And as you're looking at this system, if

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then
