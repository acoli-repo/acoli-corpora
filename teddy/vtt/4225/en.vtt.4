00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And it's all brute force. And that's the way we've

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
been approaching energy. So the lesson in

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
agriculture is that you can actually change the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
system that's based on brute force as you start

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
merging that system and learning that system and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
actually applying biology. And you move from a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
discipline of engineering, you move from a

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
discipline of chemistry, into a discipline of

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
biology. And probably one of the most important

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
human beings on the planet is this guy behind me.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he
