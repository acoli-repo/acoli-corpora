00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
trucks in the world are working here, and then

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
separate it, which only works at today's oil

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
prices.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
stuff. It is probably plants, except that these

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
have been burned and crushed under pressure.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So you take something like this, you burn it, you

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
put it under pressure, and likely as not, you get

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
this. Although, again, I stress: we don't know.
