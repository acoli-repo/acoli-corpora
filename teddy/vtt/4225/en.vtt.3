00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
sales that look like this. It's brute force. So

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
what you've been doing in agriculture is you start

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
out with something that's a reasonably natural

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
system. You start taming that natural system. You

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
put a lot of force behind that natural system. You

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
(Laughter) -- behind that natural system, and you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
end up with systems that look like this.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And it's all brute force. And that's the way we've
