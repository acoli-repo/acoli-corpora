00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
people who don't realize that China and India,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
instead of having huge amounts of starving people,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
are exporting grains.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And the irony of this particular system is the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
place where he did the research, which was Mexico,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
didn't adopt this technology, ignored this

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
technology, talked about why this technology

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
should be thought about, but not really applied.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And Mexico remains one of the largest grain

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
importers on the planet because it doesn't apply

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
fact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
where there aren't statues of this man all over
