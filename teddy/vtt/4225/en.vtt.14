This is how you farm oil. And as you think of

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
with this brute force approach. And then what did

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
we learn? Then we learned we had to go bigger. And

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
then what'd we learn? Then we have to go even

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
bigger. And we are getting really destructive as

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
we're going out and farming this bioenergy.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
trucks in the world are working here, and then

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is
