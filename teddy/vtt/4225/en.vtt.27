00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
naked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
system out of one cell, insert it into a different

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
cell, and have that cell boot up as a separate

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
species. That's one month old. You will see stuff

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
in the next month that will be just as important

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
as this stuff.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And as you think about this stuff and what the

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
implications of this are, we're going to start not

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
just converting ethanol from corn with very high

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
subsidies. We're going to start thinking about

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
biology entering energy. It is very expensive to
