00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
which are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
not the best use of bioenergy.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
As you think of what are the alternatives to this

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
system -- it's important to find alternatives

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
its petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling in

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
its coal reserves, nor is China. There are huge

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
coal reserves that are sitting out there, and

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
we've got to start thinking of them as biological

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
energy, because if we keep treating them as

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
chemical energy, or engineering energy, we're

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
going to be in deep doo-doo.
