00:00:01.076 --> 00:00:03.396
In the time it took me to walk on stage

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.236
around 10 seconds,

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:08.436
more than 10,000 metric tons
of climate-warming gases

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:11.716
have been pumped into the atmosphere
from human actions.

00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:15.436
To provide some context
on just how much that is,

00:00:15.436 --> 00:00:19.396
That is the weight equivalent
of 170,000 of me

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.796
emitted in gas in 10 seconds.

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:27.956
Ninety-nine percent of this pollution
is carbon dioxide, CO2,

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:30.356
and we know we need to reduce it.
