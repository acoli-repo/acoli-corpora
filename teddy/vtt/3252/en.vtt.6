Emma Ketteringham,
a family court attorney,

00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.085
says that if you live
in a poor neighborhood,

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.928
then you better be a perfect parent.

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.865
She says that we place unfair,
often unreachable standards

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.762
on parents who are raising their kids
with very little money.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.810
And their neighborhood and ethnicity

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:19.508
impact whether or not
their kids are removed.

00:03:21.783 --> 00:03:24.651
In the two years I spent
on the front lines of child welfare,

00:03:24.675 --> 00:03:26.268
I made high-stakes decisions.

00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:29.815
And I saw firsthand
how my personal values impacted my work.
