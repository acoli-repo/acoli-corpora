00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.478
Blind removals seem to be
bringing us closer

00:06:33.502 --> 00:06:37.545
to solving the problem of implicit bias
in foster-care decisions.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.814
My next step is figuring out

00:06:40.838 --> 00:06:43.799
how to use artificial intelligence
and machine learning

00:06:43.823 --> 00:06:45.831
to bring this project to scale

00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:48.140
and make it more accessible
to other states.

00:06:48.514 --> 00:06:51.047
I know we can transform child welfare.

00:06:51.522 --> 00:06:53.688
We can hold organizations accountable

00:06:53.712 --> 00:06:56.855
to developing the social consciousness
of their employees.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:58.982
We can hold ourselves accountable

00:06:59.006 --> 00:07:02.548
to making sure our decisions
are driven by ethics and safety.
