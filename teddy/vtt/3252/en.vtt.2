The children are deemed unsafe
and removed from the home,

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:03.505
and placed in state custody
for a specified period of time.

00:01:04.657 --> 00:01:07.874
Or the children remain with their family

00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:11.623
and the child welfare system
provides help and support.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.842
When I was a Child
Protective Services worker,

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.450
I saw things like this all the time.

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:20.607
Some far better, some far worse.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.998
I asked you to imagine
yourself in that home,

00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:26.435
because I wonder what crossed your mind.

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.259
What guides your decisions?

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.809
What's going to impact
your opinion of that family?
