00:02:29.162 --> 00:02:31.677
found that kids
who went through foster care

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:34.908
had more behavioral problems
and internalized issues

00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:39.382
than kids who remain with their families
while receiving help and support.

00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:43.381
The scenario I mentioned earlier
is not uncommon.

00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:45.738
A single mother,
living in low-income housing

00:02:45.762 --> 00:02:47.296
with her four children.

00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:50.304
And the rats make it
almost impossible to keep food,

00:02:50.328 --> 00:02:52.595
let alone fresh food in the home.

00:02:53.792 --> 00:02:57.148
Does that mother deserve
to have her children taken from her?

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:01.187
