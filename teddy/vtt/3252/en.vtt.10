When they present to the committee,

00:05:04.753 --> 00:05:08.702

00:05:08.726 --> 00:05:10.659
all identifiable information.

00:05:11.297 --> 00:05:17.053
They focus on what happened,
family strength, relevant history

00:05:17.077 --> 00:05:19.791
and the parents' ability
to protect the child.

00:05:20.815 --> 00:05:24.188
With that information,

00:05:24.212 --> 00:05:26.679
never knowing the race of the family.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.680
Blind removals have made
