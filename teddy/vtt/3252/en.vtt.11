Blind removals have made
a drastic impact in that community.

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:36.695
In 2011, 57 percent of the kids
going into foster care were black.

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:41.735
But after five years of blind removals,
that is down to 21 percent.

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:49.127

00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:52.277
Here's what we learned
from talking to some of the case workers.

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:55.884
"When a family has a history
with the department,

00:05:55.908 --> 00:05:58.559
many of us hold that history against them,

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:01.130
even if they're trying
to do things differently."
