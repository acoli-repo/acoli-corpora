00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.809
What's going to impact
your opinion of that family?

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.005
What race, ethnicity,
did you think the family was?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.085
I want you to realize
that if those children were white,

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.086
it is more likely that their family
stays together after that visit.

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:48.839
Research done at
the University of Pennsylvania

00:01:48.863 --> 00:01:53.672
found that white families, on average,
have access to more help and more support

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:55.314
from the child welfare system.

00:01:55.632 --> 00:02:00.452
And their cases are less likely
to go through a full investigation.
