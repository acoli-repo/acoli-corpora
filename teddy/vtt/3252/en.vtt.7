00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:35.029
Now, as social work faculty
at Florida State University,

00:03:35.053 --> 00:03:36.204
I lead an institute

00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:40.021
that curates the most innovative
and effective child welfare research.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:45.216
And research tells us that there are
twice as many black kids in foster care,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.137
twenty-eight percent,

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:50.914
than there are in the general
population, 14 percent.

00:03:51.673 --> 00:03:53.736
And although there are
several reasons why,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.998
I want to discuss one reason today:

00:03:56.022 --> 00:03:57.172
implicit bias.

00:03:58.815 --> 00:04:00.387
Let's start with "implicit."
