00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:31.333
But data revealed that Nassau County,

00:04:31.357 --> 00:04:33.000
a community in New York,

00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:36.500
had managed to decrease
the number of black kids being removed.

00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:42.052
And in 2016, I went
into that community with my team

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:43.893
and led a research study,

00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:47.301
discovering the use
of blind removal meetings.

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.287
This is how it works.

00:04:50.014 --> 00:04:52.855
A case worker responds
to a report of child abuse.

00:04:53.196 --> 00:04:54.585
They go out to the home,

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:56.672
but before the children are removed,

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:59.093
the case worker
must come back to the office

00:04:59.117 --> 00:05:00.823
and present what they found.
