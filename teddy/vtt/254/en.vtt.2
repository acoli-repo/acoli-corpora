00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.399
"Oh humankind, we have created you

and made you people and tribe,
so you may know each other."

00:01:09.862 --> 00:01:13.179
It was a universal call for peace,
tolerance, and acceptance

00:01:13.203 --> 00:01:17.172

I was amazed to see how the local
community reacted to the painting,

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:25.760
and how it made them proud to see
the minaret getting so much attention

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:28.489
from international press
all around the world.

00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:31.514
For the imam, it was not
just the painting;
