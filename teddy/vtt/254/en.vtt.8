00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.986
and someone gave his wall to be painted.

00:04:02.016 --> 00:04:04.373
And when he saw I was painting in Arabic,

00:04:04.397 --> 00:04:08.421
he got so mad -- actually, hysterical --
and he asked for the wall to be erased.

00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:10.412
I was mad and disappointed.

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:14.313
But a week later, the organizer
of the event asked me to come back,

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:18.055
and he told me that there was a wall
right in front of this guy's house.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.231
So, this guy --

00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:21.474
(Laughter)

00:04:21.498 --> 00:04:23.523
like, was forced to see it every day.

00:04:23.547 --> 00:04:26.531
At the beginning, I was going
to write, "[In Arabic],"

00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:28.546
which means, "In your face," but --

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.913
(Laughter)
