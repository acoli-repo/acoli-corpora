00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:31.786
the local community of Philippi

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.857
offered me the only
concrete wall of the slum.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.254
It was a school, and I wrote on it

00:03:37.278 --> 00:03:38.746
a quote from Nelson Mandela,

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.433
saying, "[in Arabic],"

00:03:41.457 --> 00:03:44.140
which means, "It seems
impossible until it's done."

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.074
Then this guy came to me and said,
"Man, why you don't write in English?"

00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:52.193
and I replied to him, "I would consider
your concern legit if you asked me

00:03:52.217 --> 00:03:53.801
why I didn't write in Zulu."

00:03:54.912 --> 00:03:57.056
In Paris, once, there was this event,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.986
and someone gave his wall to be painted.
