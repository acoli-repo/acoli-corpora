(Laughter)

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.596
I decided to be smarter
and I wrote, "[In Arabic],"

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.254
which means, "Open your heart."

00:04:37.095 --> 00:04:40.171
I'm really proud of my culture,

00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:45.710
and I'm trying to be an ambassador
of it through my artwork.

00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:50.670
And I hope that I can break
the stereotypes we all know,

00:04:50.694 --> 00:04:52.468
with the beauty of Arabic script.

00:04:53.207 --> 00:04:58.655
Today, I don't write the translation
of the message anymore on the wall.

00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:02.825
I don't want the poetry
of the calligraphy to be broken,
