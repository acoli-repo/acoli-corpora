00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:31.431
and then when you get the meaning,


00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:33.435
you feel connected to it.

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:35.782
I always make sure to write messages

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:38.177
that are relevant to the place
where I'm painting,

00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:41.282
but messages that have
a universal dimension,

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:44.048
so anybody around the world
can connect to it.

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.026
I was born and raised in France, in Paris,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.995
and I started learning how to write
and read Arabic when I was 18.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.060
Today I only write messages in Arabic.

00:02:55.084 --> 00:02:58.281
One of the reasons
this is so important to me,

00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:02.121
is because of all the reaction that
I've experienced all around the world.
