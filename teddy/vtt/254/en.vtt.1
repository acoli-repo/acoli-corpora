00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:30.218
When I met the imam for the first time,
and I told him what I wanted to do,

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:32.686
he was like, "Thank God you finally came,"

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.517
and he told me that for years
he was waiting for somebody

00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:36.834
to do something on it.

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:41.508
The most amazing thing about this imam
is that he didn't ask me anything --

00:00:41.532 --> 00:00:44.942
neither a sketch,
or what I was going to write.

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:48.832
In every work that I create,
I write messages

00:00:48.856 --> 00:00:52.979
with my style of calligraffiti --
a mix of calligraphy and graffiti.

00:00:53.622 --> 00:00:55.494
I use quotes or poetry.

00:00:56.153 --> 00:00:58.860
For the minaret, I thought that
the most relevant message

00:00:58.884 --> 00:01:01.500
to be put on a mosque
should come from the Quran,
