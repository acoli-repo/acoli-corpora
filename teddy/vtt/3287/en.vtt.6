00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.733
You want to know
what's even more alarming?

00:03:00.757 --> 00:03:04.755
Lack of legislation and laws
to adequately protect victims

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.339
and punish perpetrators.

00:03:06.363 --> 00:03:08.736
There's only one federal bill pending;

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.877
it's called the ENOUGH Act,
by Senator Kamala Harris.

00:03:12.712 --> 00:03:15.417
It would criminalize revenge porn.

00:03:15.441 --> 00:03:17.616
But that could take years to pass.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.670
So what are we left with in the meantime?

00:03:19.694 --> 00:03:21.624
Flimsy civil misdemeanors.

00:03:21.648 --> 00:03:28.132
Currently, only 40 states and DC
have some laws in place for revenge porn.

00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:32.037
And those penalties vary --
we're talking $500 fines.
