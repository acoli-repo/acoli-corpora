00:08:59.315 --> 00:09:01.649
and we're working to film
an upcoming documentary

00:09:01.673 --> 00:09:04.139
to give voice and dignity to victims.

00:09:04.871 --> 00:09:08.538
If you are a victim or you know
someone who is, know this:

00:09:09.101 --> 00:09:12.625
in order to be empowered,
you have to take care of yourself,

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:14.355
and you have to love yourself.

00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:17.117
You have to turn your anger into action,

00:09:17.141 --> 00:09:18.704
your pain into power

00:09:18.728 --> 00:09:23.168
and your setback into a setup
for what's next for your life.

00:09:24.309 --> 00:09:28.047
This is a process, and it's a journey
of self-discovery

00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:30.373
that might include forgiveness.
