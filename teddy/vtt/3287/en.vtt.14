Our cyber civil rights are at stake.

00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:07.203
Here in the United States,
we need to have clear, tough enforcement;

00:07:07.227 --> 00:07:12.083
we need to demand the accountability
and responsiveness from online companies;

00:07:12.107 --> 00:07:16.773
we need to promote social responsibilities
for posting, sharing and texting;

00:07:16.797 --> 00:07:20.916
and we need to restore dignity to victims.

00:07:21.506 --> 00:07:23.202
And what about victims

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.672
who neither have the time,
money or resources to wage war,

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:31.677
who are left disempowered,
mislabeled and broken?
