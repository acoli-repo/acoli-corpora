And I've also learned that my case
is making history --

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.855
it is the first international case
under this new crime.

00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:46.249
Wow, finally some justice.

00:06:46.273 --> 00:06:48.352

00:06:58.506 --> 00:07:02.307
Our cyber civil rights are at stake.
