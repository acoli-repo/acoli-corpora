00:08:29.286 --> 00:08:31.785
and my story and my voice.

00:08:32.633 --> 00:08:36.030
And to get started, I asked myself
this one simple question:

00:08:36.054 --> 00:08:38.154
Who do I need to become now?

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:42.895
That question, in the face of everything
that I was challenged with,

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.172
transformed my life and had me thinking
about all kinds of possibilities.

00:08:47.196 --> 00:08:50.458
I now own my story, I speak my truth,

00:08:50.482 --> 00:08:53.085
and I'm narrating
a new chapter in my life.

00:08:53.109 --> 00:08:56.327
It's called "50 Shades of Silence."

00:08:56.712 --> 00:08:59.291
It's a global social justice project,

00:08:59.315 --> 00:09:01.649
and we're working to film
an upcoming documentary
