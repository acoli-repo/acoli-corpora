00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.400
this was how they got around
the slave owners' ban on drumming,

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:35.077
improvising complex rhythms

00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:37.976
just like ancestors did
with drums in Haiti

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.648
or in the Yoruba communities
of West Africa.

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:47.921
It was about keeping
cultural traditions alive

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:50.278
and retaining a sense of inner freedom

00:01:50.302 --> 00:01:51.555
under captivity.

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:57.492
It was the same subversive spirit
that created this dance:

00:01:58.191 --> 00:01:59.361
the Cakewalk,

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:03.161
a dance that parodied the mannerisms
of Southern high society --
