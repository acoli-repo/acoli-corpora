00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:30.927
Because of that,

00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:32.343
social dances bubble up,

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:33.534
they change

00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:35.333
and they spread like wildfire.

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.678
They are as old as our remembered history.

00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:43.733
In African-American social dances,

00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:45.505
we see over 200 years

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:50.143
of how African and African-American
traditions influenced our history.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.841
The present always contains the past.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.877
And the past shapes who we are

00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:59.493
and who we will be.
