00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:01.860
(Clapping)

00:01:03.304 --> 00:01:06.451
The Juba dance was born
from enslaved Africans' experience

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:07.823
on the plantation.

00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:09.497
Brought to the Americas,

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:11.756
stripped of a common spoken language,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.052
this dance was a way for enslaved Africans
to remember where they're from.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.593
It may have looked something like this.

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:25.723
Slapping thighs,

00:01:25.747 --> 00:01:26.981
shuffling feet

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:28.805
and patting hands:

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.400
this was how they got around
the slave owners' ban on drumming,
