00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:03.161
a dance that parodied the mannerisms
of Southern high society --

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:06.387
a way for the enslaved
to throw shade at the masters.

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:08.800
The crazy thing about this dance

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:11.761
is that the Cakewalk
was performed for the masters,

00:02:11.785 --> 00:02:14.616
who never suspected
they were being made fun of.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.197
Now you might recognize this one.

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:20.975
1920s --

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.454
the Charleston.

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:29.466
The Charleston was all about
improvisation and musicality,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.505
making its way into Lindy Hop,
