00:02:57.273 --> 00:03:00.931
Now, social dance is about
community and connection;

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:02.309
if you knew the steps,

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:04.267
it meant you belonged to a group.

00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:06.855
But what if it becomes a worldwide craze?

00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:08.925
Enter the Twist.

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:13.256
It's no surprise that the Twist
can be traced back to the 19th century,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.177
brought to America from the Congo

00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:16.408
during slavery.

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:18.085
But in the late '50s,

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.183
right before the Civil Rights Movement,

00:03:20.207 --> 00:03:23.938
the Twist is popularized
by Chubby Checker and Dick Clark.

00:03:23.962 --> 00:03:26.533
Suddenly, everybody's doing the Twist:

00:03:26.557 --> 00:03:27.750
white teenagers,

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.361
kids in Latin America,

00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:32.092
making its way into songs and movies.
