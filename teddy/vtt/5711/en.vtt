A few years back,

00:00:02.777 --> 00:00:05.866
my friend's dad asked me to show him
my mom's house on the map.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.753
I knew we didn't have
Street View in Zimbabwe yet,

00:00:08.777 --> 00:00:10.106
but I looked anyway,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.250
and of course, we couldn't find it.

00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:15.472
When you look at most mapping platforms,

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:17.866
you will find that parts
of the African continent

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.528
are largely missing.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.220
And I've wondered:

00:00:21.244 --> 00:00:22.564
Is it the people?

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.058
Is it the technology?

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:25.331
Or is it the terrain?

00:00:25.897 --> 00:00:28.222
For nearly a billion people
on the continent,

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:30.067
it's an accepted reality
