00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:34.293
I can find out the origins
of certain clichés, certain stereotypes.

00:02:34.317 --> 00:02:38.161
I can tell you who came up with it,
where and when and in which book.

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:39.815
But there's one thing I cannot do:

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:46.266
I cannot get into the internal,
subjective mental universe of someone

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.496
and change their mind.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.130
And I think this is where and why,
over the last few years,

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:56.868
I'm increasingly drawn
to things like psychology

00:02:56.892 --> 00:02:58.528
and cognitive behavioral therapy;

00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:03.098
because in these fields,
scholars look at the persistence of ideas.
