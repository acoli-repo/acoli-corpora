even though historians know
the realities of the violence

00:01:33.698 --> 00:01:34.894
and the oppression

00:01:34.918 --> 00:01:38.184

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:42.301
So let's imagine that I build
a time machine for myself.

00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:43.420
(Makes beeping noises)

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:45.905
I build a time machine,

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.756
I send myself back to the 1860s,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.290

00:01:52.848 --> 00:01:56.212
OK, I go back a hundred years
before I was born.

00:01:56.236 --> 00:02:00.565
Now, if I were to find myself
in the context of colonial Southeast Asia
