00:08:59.716 --> 00:09:05.781
because we need to understand
that the way things are today

00:09:05.805 --> 00:09:09.334
are not determined by some fixed,

00:09:10.293 --> 00:09:12.401
iron historical railway track,

00:09:12.425 --> 00:09:14.832
but rather there are many other histories,

00:09:14.856 --> 00:09:19.368
many other ideas that were forgotten,
marginalized, erased along the line.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.594
Historians like me, our job
is to uncover all this, discover all this,

00:09:23.618 --> 00:09:28.497
but we need to engage this,
we need to engage with society as a whole.

00:09:29.088 --> 00:09:33.760
So to go back to that time machine
example I gave earlier.
