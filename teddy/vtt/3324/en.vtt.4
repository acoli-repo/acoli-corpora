00:01:56.236 --> 00:02:00.565
Now, if I were to find myself
in the context of colonial Southeast Asia

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:02.054
in the 19th century,

00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:04.560
I would not be a professor.

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:06.911
Historians know this.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.633
And yet, despite that,

00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:15.135
there's still some quarters that somehow
want to hold on to this idea

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.481
that that past was not as murky,

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.873
that there was a romanticized side to it.

00:02:21.897 --> 00:02:23.934
Now, here is where I, as a historian,

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.604
I encounter the limits of history,

00:02:26.628 --> 00:02:28.905
because I can trace ideas.

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:34.293
I can find out the origins
of certain clichés, certain stereotypes.
