00:04:00.446 --> 00:04:02.506
Very simple example:

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.015
we live in Southeast Asia,

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.199
which is very popular with tourists
from all over the world.

00:04:07.223 --> 00:04:09.743
And I don't think that's
a bad thing, by the way.

00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:13.070
I think it's good
that tourists come to Southeast Asia,

00:04:13.094 --> 00:04:15.886
because it's part and parcel
of broadening your worldview

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.770
and meeting cultures, etc, etc.

00:04:17.794 --> 00:04:22.527
But look at how we represent ourselves

00:04:22.551 --> 00:04:25.848
through the tourist campaigns,
the tourist ads that we produce.

00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:30.111
There will be the obligatory coconut tree,
banana tree, orangutan.
