the roots of these ideas,

00:07:35.551 --> 00:07:37.454
tracing the genesis of ideas

and then putting it in some journal

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.410
to be read by maybe
three other historians.

00:07:41.434 --> 00:07:42.831

unprecedented changes in our history,

00:07:56.197 --> 00:07:57.935
partly because of globalization,

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:01.524
world politics,
geopolitical contestations,
