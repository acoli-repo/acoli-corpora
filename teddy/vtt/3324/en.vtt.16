00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:01.524
world politics,
geopolitical contestations,

00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:02.996
the impact of technology,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.806
the Fourth Industrial Revolution ...

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.200
Our world as we know it
is going to change.

00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:11.144
But for us to adapt to this change,

00:08:11.168 --> 00:08:13.028
for us to be ready for that change,

00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:15.706
we need to think out of the box,

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.168
and we can't fall back,
we can't fall back, we can't fall back

00:08:19.192 --> 00:08:26.177
on the same set of clichéd,
tired, staid old stereotypes.

00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:27.807
We need to think out,

00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:30.605
and that's why historians,
we can't work alone now.
