00:11:29.657 --> 00:11:30.828
You, me, all of us,

00:11:30.852 --> 00:11:32.768
we carry history in us.

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:35.542
It's in the language we use.
It's in the fiction we write.

00:11:35.566 --> 00:11:37.437
It's in the movies we choose to watch.

00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:40.902
It's in the images that we conjure
when we think of who and what we are.

00:11:40.926 --> 00:11:42.262
We are historical beings.

00:11:42.866 --> 00:11:44.990
We carry history with us,

00:11:45.014 --> 00:11:47.312
and history carries us along.

00:11:47.884 --> 00:11:50.788
But while we are determined by history,

00:11:50.812 --> 00:11:53.296
it is my personal belief

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.548
that we need not be trapped by history,

00:11:56.572 --> 00:11:59.760
and we need not be the victims of history.
