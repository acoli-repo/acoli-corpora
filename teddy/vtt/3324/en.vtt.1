00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.504
that shape our viewpoint,

00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:33.839
the way we in Asia, in Southeast Asia,

00:00:33.863 --> 00:00:36.787
look at ourselves
and understand ourselves.

00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:42.891
Now, there's one thing
that I cannot explain

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:44.071
as a historian,

00:00:44.095 --> 00:00:47.663
and this has been puzzling me
for a long time,

00:00:47.687 --> 00:00:54.687
and this is how and why
certain ideas, certain viewpoints

00:00:54.711 --> 00:00:57.999
do not seem to ever go away.

00:00:58.711 --> 00:00:59.975
And I don't know why.
