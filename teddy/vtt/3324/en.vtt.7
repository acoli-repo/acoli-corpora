00:03:28.112 --> 00:03:30.511
we fall back, we fall back, we fall back

00:03:30.535 --> 00:03:32.413
on a finite pool,

00:03:32.437 --> 00:03:36.431
a small pool of basic ideas
that don't get challenged.

00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:40.842
Look at how we, particularly us
in Southeast Asia,

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:44.725
represent ourselves to ourselves
and to the world.

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:46.261
Look at how often,

00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:50.474
when we talk about ourselves,
my viewpoint, my identity, our identity,

00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:53.664
invariably, we fall back, we fall back,
we fall back, we fall back

00:03:53.688 --> 00:03:55.514
on the same set of ideas,

00:03:55.538 --> 00:03:59.776
all of which have histories of their own.
