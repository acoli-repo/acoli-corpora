00:06:28.337 --> 00:06:30.917
in interrogating ourselves
and asking ourselves,

00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:33.336
how did I have this view of the world?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.528
How did I come to have
this view of nature?

00:06:35.552 --> 00:06:38.351
How did I come to have
this view of the countryside?

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:41.569
How do I have this idea of Asia as exotic?

00:06:41.593 --> 00:06:44.049
And we, Southeast Asians in particular,

00:06:44.073 --> 00:06:48.361
love to self-exoticize ourselves.

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:54.340
We've turned Southeast Asian identity
into a kind of cosplay

00:06:54.364 --> 00:06:58.155
where you can literally
go to the supermarket, go to the mall

00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:02.256
and buy your do-it-yourself
exotic Southeast Asian costume kit.
