00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:04.104
we need to zoom down 
to the level of our individual cells.

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:05.902
Inside each of these cells,

00:02:05.902 --> 00:02:09.078
chemical reactions 
are constantly occurring,

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:12.746
powered by the glucose and oxygen
that our bodies convert

00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:17.079
into the energy-carrying molecule
known as ATP.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.802
Cells use this energy
for everything from repair

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:20.738
to growth

00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:22.437
to reproduction.

00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:25.858
Not only does it take a lot of energy 
to make the necessary molecules,

00:02:25.858 --> 00:02:29.943
but it takes even more 
to get them where they need to be.
