00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:30.757
See, if the cells are frozen, 
there's very little molecular movement,

00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:33.471
and diffusion practically stops.

00:04:33.471 --> 00:04:38.191
Even if all of a person's cellular 
processes had already broken down,

00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:42.358
this could still conceivably be reversed 
by a swarm of nanobots,

00:04:42.358 --> 00:04:45.125
moving all the molecules 
back to their proper positions,

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:49.364
and injecting all of the cells 
with ATP at the same time,

00:04:49.364 --> 00:04:53.283
presumably causing the body 
to simply pick up where it left off.

00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:56.325
So if we think of life 
not as some magical spark,

00:04:56.325 --> 00:05:00.941
but a state of incredibly complex,
self-perpetuating organization,
