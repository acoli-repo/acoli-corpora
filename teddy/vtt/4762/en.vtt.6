00:02:55.943 --> 00:03:00.078
The breaking down of these arrangements 
when the entire cell succumbs to entropy

00:03:00.078 --> 00:03:03.398
is what eventually results in death.

00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:07.129
This is the reason organisms 
can't be simply sparked back to life

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.936
once they've already died.

00:03:08.936 --> 00:03:11.321
We can pump air into someone's lungs,

00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.655
but it won't do much good

00:03:12.655 --> 00:03:15.986
if the many other processes
involved in the respiratory cycle

00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:18.260
are no longer functioning.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.064
Similarly, the electric shock
from a defibrillator

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:23.800
doesn't jump-start an inanimate heart,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.195
but resynchronizes the muscle cells 
in an abnormally beating heart

00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:30.660
so they regain their normal rhythm.
