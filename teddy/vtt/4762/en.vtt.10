00:04:56.325 --> 00:05:00.941
but a state of incredibly complex,
self-perpetuating organization,

00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:04.468
death is just 
the process of increasing entropy

00:05:04.468 --> 00:05:06.945
that destroys this fragile balance.

00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:09.541
And the point at which 
someone is completely dead

00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:12.111
turns out not to be a fixed constant,

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:14.652
but simply a matter 
of how much of this entropy

00:05:14.652 --> 00:05:17.540
we're currently capable of reversing.
