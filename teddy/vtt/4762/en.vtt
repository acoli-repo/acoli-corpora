00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.942
For as far back
as we can trace our existence,

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:14.692
humans have been fascinated 
with death and resurrection.

00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:18.648
Nearly every religion in the world 
has some interpretation of them,

00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:20.113
and from our earliest myths

00:00:20.113 --> 00:00:25.512
to the latest cinematic blockbusters,
the dead keep coming back.

00:00:25.512 --> 00:00:27.950
But is resurrection really possible?

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.602
And what is the actual difference between 
a living creature and a dead body, anyway?
