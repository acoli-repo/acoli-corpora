00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.779
And in 1907, Dr. Duncan McDougall 
even claimed that the soul had mass,

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:37.789
weighing patients immediately
before and after death in an attempt to prove it.

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.601
Though his experiments were discredited,
much like the rest of vitalism,

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:45.236
traces of his theory 
still come up in popular culture.

00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:48.478
But where do all these discredited 
theories leave us?

00:01:48.478 --> 00:01:50.955
What we now know is 
that life is not contained

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:53.683
in some magical substance or spark,

00:01:53.683 --> 00:01:58.139
but within the ongoing 
biological processes themselves.

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:59.874
And to understand these processes,

00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:04.104
we need to zoom down 
to the level of our individual cells.
