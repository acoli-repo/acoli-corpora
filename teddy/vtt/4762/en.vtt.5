00:02:29.943 --> 00:02:32.101
The universal phenomenon of entropy

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:36.142
means that molecules will tend 
towards diffusing randomly,

00:02:36.142 --> 00:02:40.275
moving from areas 
of high concentration to low concentration,

00:02:40.275 --> 00:02:43.933
or even breaking apart 
into smaller molecules and atoms.

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:47.433
So cells must constantly keep 
entropy in check

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.707
by using energy to maintain 
their molecules

00:02:49.707 --> 00:02:51.831
in the very complicated formations

00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:55.943
necessary for biological functions
to occur.

00:02:55.943 --> 00:03:00.078
The breaking down of these arrangements 
when the entire cell succumbs to entropy
