00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:30.660
so they regain their normal rhythm.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.701
This can prevent a person from dying, 
but it won't raise a dead body,

00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:37.439
or a monster sewn together 
from dead bodies.

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.970
So it would seem 
that all our various medical miracles

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.273
can delay or prevent death
but not reverse it.

00:03:45.273 --> 00:03:47.387
But that's not as simple as it sounds

00:03:47.387 --> 00:03:50.893
because constant advancements 
in technology and medicine

00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:53.567
have resulted in diagnoses such as coma,

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.544
describing potentially 
reversible conditions,

00:03:56.544 --> 00:04:01.369
under which people would have previously 
been considered dead.
