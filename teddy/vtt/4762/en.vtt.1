00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.602
And what is the actual difference between 
a living creature and a dead body, anyway?

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:37.905
To understand what death is, 
we need to understand what life is.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.371
One ancient theory 
was an idea called vitalism,

00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:43.817
which claimed 
that living things were unique

00:00:43.817 --> 00:00:47.440
because they were filled 
with a special substance, or energy,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.100
that was the essence of life.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.544
Whether it was called qi,

00:00:51.544 --> 00:00:52.469
lifeblood,

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.788
or humors,

00:00:53.788 --> 00:00:57.325
the belief in such an essence 
was common throughout the world,

00:00:57.325 --> 00:00:59.856
and still persists 
in the stories of creatures

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:03.237
who can somehow drain life from others,
