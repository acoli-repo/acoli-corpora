00:03:56.544 --> 00:04:01.369
under which people would have previously 
been considered dead.

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:05.953
In the future, the point of no return 
may be pushed even further.

00:04:05.953 --> 00:04:08.665
Some animals are known 
to extend their lifespans

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.985
or survive extreme conditions

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:13.619
by slowing down their biological processes

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.797
to the point where 
they are virtually paused.

00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:20.111
And research into cryonics 
hopes to achieve the same

00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:23.517
by freezing dying people 
and reviving them later

00:04:23.517 --> 00:04:26.491
when newer technology 
is able to help them.

00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:30.757
See, if the cells are frozen, 
there's very little molecular movement,
