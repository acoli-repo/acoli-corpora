Roy Gould: Less than a year from now,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which marks the 400th anniversary

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In a few months, the world is also going to celebrate

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which I think is going to have as profound an impact

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's called the WorldWide Telescope,
