00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:30.964
Therefore, if hedonism 
is your philosophy of choice,

00:01:30.964 --> 00:01:33.979
plugging in would be a no-brainer.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.766
But what if there's more to life
than just pleasure?

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.047
That's what Nozick believed
he was demonstrating

00:01:39.047 --> 00:01:42.194
through his Experience Machine 
thought experiment.

00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:45.117
Despite the machine's promise
of maximum net pleasure,

00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:47.591
he still found reason not to plug in,

00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:51.857
as do many other experimenters
who consider the proposition.

00:01:51.857 --> 00:01:56.670
But what could possibly dissuade us from
choosing a future of ultimate pleasure?

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.156
Consider this scenario.

00:01:58.156 --> 00:02:01.073
Betsy and Xander are in a loving,
committed relationship.
