00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:00.943
with greater intrinsic value
than pleasure.

00:03:00.943 --> 00:03:04.807
Truth, knowledge, authentic connection
with other human beings.

00:03:04.807 --> 00:03:07.666
These are all things 
that might make the list.

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:09.066
By never learning the truth,

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:13.209
Betsy is essentially living life
in her own personal Experience Machine,

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.028
a world of happiness 
that's not based in reality.

00:03:17.028 --> 00:03:19.341
This love triangle is an extreme example,

00:03:19.341 --> 00:03:23.646
but it mirrors many of the decisions
we make in day to day life.

00:03:23.646 --> 00:03:26.570
So whether you're making a choice
for Betsy or for yourself,

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.098
why might you feel reality
should be a factor?
