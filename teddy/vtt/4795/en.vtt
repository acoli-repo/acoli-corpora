That's the question philosopher 
Robert Nozick posed

00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:24.115
through a thought experiment
he called the Experience Machine.

00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:26.295
The experiment asks us 
to consider a world

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:30.376
in which scientists have developed 
a machine that would simulate real life
