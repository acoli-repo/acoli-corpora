00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:30.376
in which scientists have developed 
a machine that would simulate real life

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:35.610
while guaranteeing experiences
of only pleasure and never pain.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.540
The catch?

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.012
You have to permanently
leave reality behind,

00:00:39.012 --> 00:00:40.845
but you'll hardly know the difference.

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:44.246
Your experiences will be 
indistinguishable from reality.

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:45.758
Life's natural ups and downs

00:00:45.758 --> 00:00:49.835
will just be replaced 
with an endless series of ups.

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:51.401
Sounds great, right?

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:56.097
It may seem like a tempting offer,
but perhaps it's not as ideal as it sounds.

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:59.882
The experiment was actually designed
to refute a philosophical notion

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:01.580
called hedonism.
