00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.098
why might you feel reality
should be a factor?

00:03:30.098 --> 00:03:33.115
Is there inherent value 
in real experiences,

00:03:33.115 --> 00:03:35.518
whether pleasurable or painful?

00:03:35.518 --> 00:03:37.388
Do you yourself have more value

00:03:37.388 --> 00:03:41.852
when you're experiencing 
real life's pleasures and pains?

00:03:41.852 --> 00:03:44.358
Nozick's experiment may not provide
all the answers,

00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:48.572
but it forces us to consider whether
real life, though imperfect,

00:03:48.572 --> 00:03:52.895
holds some intrinsic value 
beyond the pleasure of plugging in.
