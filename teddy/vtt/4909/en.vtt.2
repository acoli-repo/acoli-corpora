00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:02.814
but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns.

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:04.814
The magical setting of the woods at night

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:09.374
disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results.

00:01:09.374 --> 00:01:13.733
Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time,

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:17.813
taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down

00:01:17.813 --> 00:01:20.694
in a world where no mortal is in control.

00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:23.024
The play opens with young Hermia

00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:27.344
raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens,

00:01:27.344 --> 00:01:31.023
who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander.
