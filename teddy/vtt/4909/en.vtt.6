when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him,

00:03:01.284 --> 00:03:05.484
she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures

00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:08.964
and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet:

00:03:08.964 --> 00:03:11.314
“pluck the wings from painted butterflies/

00:03:11.314 --> 00:03:14.264
To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes.

00:03:14.264 --> 00:03:18.004

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:28.283
and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell.

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:31.953
The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,”
