00:04:06.738 --> 00:04:09.048
That you have but slumbered here

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.758
While these visions did appear. 


00:04:11.758 --> 00:04:13.058
And in so doing,

00:04:13.058 --> 00:04:17.698
he evokes the effect of entering into the 
magical world of great theatre

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.359
that plays with the boundary between 
illusion and reality –

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.359
and dramatizes the possibility 
that life is but a dream.
