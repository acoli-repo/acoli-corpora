00:00:07.104 --> 00:00:08.674

By the light of the moon,

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.174
a group of youths sneak into the woods,

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:13.614
where they take mind-altering substances,

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:15.204
switch it up romantically,


00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:18.494
and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension.

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:22.074
"A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic –

00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:26.954
and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page.

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:29.334
First performed in the 1590's,

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:32.424
this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works,
