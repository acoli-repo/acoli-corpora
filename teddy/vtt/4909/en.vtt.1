00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:32.424
this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works,

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:35.884
filled with trickery, madness and magic.

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:37.784
Set over the course of one night,

00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:40.454
Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace.

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:44.414
The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution,

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:48.804
where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart.

00:00:48.804 --> 00:00:52.714
Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession

00:00:52.714 --> 00:00:56.144
and question authority with a comic twist.

00:00:56.144 --> 00:00:58.384
The action is set in Ancient Greece,

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:02.814
but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns.
