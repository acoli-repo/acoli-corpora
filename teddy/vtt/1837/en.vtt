00:00:01.014 --> 00:00:02.230
You may be wondering

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.064
why a marine biologist from Oceana

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:05.904
would come here today to talk to you

00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:07.140
about world hunger.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.291
I'm here today because

00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:12.526
saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire.

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:14.670
It's more than a thing we're doing

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.468
because we want to create jobs for fishermen

00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:18.552
or preserve fishermen's jobs.

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:21.900
It's more than an economic pursuit.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.512
Saving the oceans can feed the world.

00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:26.338
Let me show you how.

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:28.140
As you know, there are already

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.766
more than a billion hungry people on this planet.
