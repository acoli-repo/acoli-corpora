00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.463
when these things take place
in a fraction of a second.

00:02:30.487 --> 00:02:32.018
Why do it? For things like this:

00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:34.189
Gene from Alabama drives out there

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:37.285
with this rocket he's built
with X-ray sensors, video cameras,

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.600
festooned with electronics.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:40.345
He succeeds getting to 100,000 feet,

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.049
leaving the atmosphere,
seeing a thin blue line of space.

00:02:43.073 --> 00:02:46.465
It is this breathtaking image --
success, of course -- that motivates us

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.276
and motivates kids to follow
and understand rocket science,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.404
understand the importance
of physics and math

00:02:51.428 --> 00:02:53.763
and, in many ways,
to have that awe at exploration

00:02:53.787 --> 00:02:55.321
of the frontiers of the unknown.

00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:56.496
Thank you.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.768
