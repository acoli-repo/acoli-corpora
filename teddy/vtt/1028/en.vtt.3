(Laughter)

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.056
To take this shot, I did what I often do,
which is go way beyond the pads,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.680
where none of the spectators are.

00:01:35.704 --> 00:01:38.284
And if we can run the video,
I'll show you what it took

00:01:38.308 --> 00:01:39.655
to get this DreamWorks shot.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.336
(Video) Voices: Woo-hoo! Yeah. Nice.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.246
Steve Jurvetson: They realize the computer
failed, they're yelling "Deploy!"

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.421
(Video) Man: Oh, shit.

00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:50.074
SJ: This is when they realize
everything's gone haywire.

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:51.719
(Video) Man: It's going ballistic.

00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:52.894
SJ: I'll just be quiet.

00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:54.069
(Video) Woman: No!

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:56.093
Come on, come on, come on.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.762
SJ: And that's me over there,
taking photos the whole way.
