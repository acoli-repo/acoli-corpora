00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.762
SJ: And that's me over there,
taking photos the whole way.

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:05.142
Things often go wrong.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.439
Some people watch this
because of a NASCAR-like fascination

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:10.098
with things bumping and grinding.

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:12.839
Burning the parachute as it fell.
That was last weekend.

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:15.593
This guy went up, went supersonic,
ripped the fin can off.

00:02:15.617 --> 00:02:16.768
The art sale in the sky.

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:18.371
A burning metal hunk coming back.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.213
These things dropped
down from above all through the weekend

00:02:21.237 --> 00:02:23.027
of rocket launch after rocket launch.

00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:24.945
It's a cadence you can't quite imagine.

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.845
I try to capture the mishaps;
it's a challenge in photography

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.463
when these things take place
in a fraction of a second.
