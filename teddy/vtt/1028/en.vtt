00:00:00.531 --> 00:00:02.135
By day, I'm a venture capitalist.

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.706
On weekends, I love rockets.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.479
I love photography, I love rockets.

00:00:05.503 --> 00:00:07.661
I'm going to talk
about a hobby that can scale

00:00:07.685 --> 00:00:09.793
and show you photos
I've taken over the years

00:00:09.817 --> 00:00:12.922
with kids like these, that hopefully
will grow up to love rocketry

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.444
and eventually become
a Richard Branson or Diamandis.

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:18.477
My son designed a rocket
that became stable, a golf ball rocket.

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:20.754
I thought it was quite
an interesting experiment

00:00:20.778 --> 00:00:22.520
in the principles of rocket science.

00:00:22.544 --> 00:00:24.270
And it flies straight as an arrow.

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:25.647
Baking soda and vinegar.

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:26.981
Night shots are beautiful,

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.532
piercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way.
