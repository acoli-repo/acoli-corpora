00:00:59.588 --> 00:01:01.589
They use solid propellant most frequently.

00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:02.952
It's a strange kind of love.

00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:06.184
RocketMavericks.com with my photos,
if you want to learn about this,

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:07.544
participate, be a spectator.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.545
We had to call it Rocket Mavericks.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.443
This one was great, went to 100,000 feet
-- but didn't quite.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:15.744
Actually, it went 11 feet into solid clay
and became a bunker-buster.

00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:17.192
It had to be dug out.

00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:20.968
Rockets often spiral out of control
if you put too much propellant in them.

00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:22.151
Here was a drag race.

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:24.415
At night you can see
what happened in a second;

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.211
in daytime, we call them land sharks.

00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:29.522
Sometimes they just explode
before your eyes or come down supersonic.

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:30.555
