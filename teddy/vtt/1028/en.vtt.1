00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.532
piercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way.

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:32.755
2-stage rockets
with video cameras on them,

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:36.557
onboard computers logging their flights,
rocket gliders that fly back to Earth.

00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:38.824
I use RockSim to simulate
flights before they go

00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:40.523
to see if they'll break supersonic,

00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:43.368
then fly them with onboard computers
to verify performance.

00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:46.069
To launch the big stuff,
you go to the middle of nowhere:

00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:48.428
Black Rock Desert,
where dangerous things happen.

00:00:48.452 --> 00:00:50.191
The boys and the rockets get bigger.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:52.826
They use motors
used on cruise-missile boosters.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.579
They rumble the belly and leave
even photographers in awe,

00:00:55.603 --> 00:00:56.754
watching the spectacle.

00:00:56.778 --> 00:00:59.564
These rockets use
experimental motors like nitrous oxide.

00:00:59.588 --> 00:01:01.589
They use solid propellant most frequently.
