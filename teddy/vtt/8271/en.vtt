00:00:00.956 --> 00:00:06.436
So we know forests play an essential role
in regulating the Earth's climate.

00:00:06.436 --> 00:00:08.796
However, most of what we know
about those forests

00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:11.956
is actually based on things
we can measure aboveground.

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:16.396
So historically, ecologists like myself
would come to this place,

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:19.076
and we’d count the number
of tree stems we’d find.

00:00:19.076 --> 00:00:21.156
We’d identify which species they are,

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:26.036
and today we’d probably remotely sense
features of this forest canopy from space.

00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:28.436
And all of this absolutely makes sense.

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:31.916
Aboveground is where
photosynthesis happens.
