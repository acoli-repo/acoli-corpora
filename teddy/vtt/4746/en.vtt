00:00:07.143 --> 00:00:10.660
In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged

00:00:10.684 --> 00:00:12.636
the Greek city of Potidaea,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.943
the tide retreated
much farther than usual,

00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:17.528
leaving a convenient invasion route.

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:19.552
But this wasn't a stroke of luck.

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:21.101
Before they had crossed halfway,

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:24.951
the water returned in a wave higher
than anyone had ever seen,

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.766
drowning the attackers.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.010
The Potiidaeans believed
they had been saved

00:00:29.034 --> 00:00:30.709
by the wrath of Poseidon.
