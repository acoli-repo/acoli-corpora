00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.524
For normal ocean waves,
it comes from wind.

00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:05.814
Because this only affects the surface,
the waves are limited in size and speed.

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:09.225
But tsunamis are caused by energy
originating underwater,

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:10.809
from a volcanic eruption,

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:12.477
a submarine landslide,

00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:15.396
or most commonly,
an earthquake on the ocean floor

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.768
caused when the tectonic plates
of the Earth's surface slip,

00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:21.963
releasing a massive amount
of energy into the water.

00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:24.128
This energy travels up to the surface,

00:01:24.152 --> 00:01:27.930
displacing water and raising it above
the normal sea level,

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.753
but gravity pulls it back down,

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.686
which makes the energy ripple
outwards horizontally.
