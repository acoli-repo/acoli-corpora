causing a nuclear disaster

00:03:00.882 --> 00:03:03.430
in addition to claiming over 18,000 lives.

00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:08.545
Many scientists and policy makers
are instead focusing on early detection,

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.730
monitoring underwater pressure
and seismic activity,

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:14.093
and establishing global
communication networks

00:03:14.117 --> 00:03:15.713
for quickly distributing alerts.

00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:18.445
When nature is too powerful to stop,

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.105
the safest course
is to get out of its way.
