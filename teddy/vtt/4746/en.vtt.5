00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:31.144
to be caught in its path.

00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:33.889
The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami

00:02:33.913 --> 00:02:36.572
was one of the deadliest
natural disasters in history,

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:40.236
killing over 200,000 people
throughout South Asia.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.622
So how can we protect ourselves
against this destructive force of nature?

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:46.355
People in some areas have attempted

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.397
to stop tsunamis
with sea walls, flood gates,

00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:51.169
and channels to divert the water.

00:02:51.193 --> 00:02:52.861
But these are not always effective.

00:02:52.885 --> 00:02:56.494
In 2011, a tsunami
surpassed the flood wall

00:02:56.518 --> 00:02:58.728
protecting Japan's Fukushima Power Plant,

00:02:58.752 --> 00:03:00.858
causing a nuclear disaster
