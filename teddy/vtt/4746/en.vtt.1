00:00:29.034 --> 00:00:30.709
by the wrath of Poseidon.

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.240
But what really saved them

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:35.795
was likely the same phenomenon
that has destroyed countless others:

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:36.915
a tsunami.

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:39.787
Although tsunamis are commonly
known as tidal waves,

00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:42.452
they're actually unrelated
to the tidal activity caused

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:45.597
by the gravitational forces
of the Sun and Moon.

00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:49.239
In many ways, tsunamis are just
larger versions of regular waves.

00:00:49.263 --> 00:00:51.137
They have a trough and a crest,

00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:53.275
and consist not of moving water,

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.422
but the movement of energy through water.

00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:58.709
The difference is
in where this energy comes from.

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.524
For normal ocean waves,
it comes from wind.
