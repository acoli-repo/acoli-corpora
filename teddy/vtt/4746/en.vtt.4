00:01:58.114 --> 00:02:01.607
The word tsunami,
Japanese for "harbor wave,"

00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:04.678
comes from the fact that it only seems
to appear near the coast.

00:02:04.702 --> 00:02:07.858
If the trough of a tsunami
reaches shore first,

00:02:07.882 --> 00:02:09.930
the water will withdraw
farther than normal

00:02:09.954 --> 00:02:11.120
before the wave hits,

00:02:11.144 --> 00:02:13.161
which can be misleadingly dangerous.

00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:16.208
A tsunami will not only drown
people near the coast,

00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:19.554
but level buildings and trees
for a mile inland or more,

00:02:19.578 --> 00:02:21.933
especially in low-lying areas.

00:02:21.957 --> 00:02:24.939
As if that weren't enough,
the water then retreats,

00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:26.979
dragging with it the newly created debris,

00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:29.713
and anything, or anyone,
unfortunate enough

00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:31.144
to be caught in its path.
