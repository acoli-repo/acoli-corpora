00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.686
which makes the energy ripple
outwards horizontally.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.761
Thus, the tsunami is born,

00:01:34.785 --> 00:01:37.376
moving at over 500 miles per hour.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.967
When it's far from shore,
a tsunami can be barely detectable

00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:43.649
since it moves through
the entire depth of the water.

00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:47.510
But when it reaches shallow water,
something called wave shoaling occurs.

00:01:47.534 --> 00:01:49.764
Because there is less water
to move through,

00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:53.158
this still massive amount
of energy is compressed.

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:55.091
The wave's speed slows down,

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.090
while its height rises
to as much as 100 feet.

00:01:58.114 --> 00:02:01.607
The word tsunami,
Japanese for "harbor wave,"
