00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:31.847
Your scale is tipped a little bit.

00:06:32.323 --> 00:06:34.062
Now let's look at your DNA.

00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:38.088
We've all inherited our genes
from our moms and our dads.

00:06:38.112 --> 00:06:42.190
Some of these genes will increase our risk
and some will decrease it.

00:06:42.214 --> 00:06:44.403
If you're like Alice in "Still Alice,"

00:06:44.427 --> 00:06:48.978
you've inherited a rare genetic mutation
that cranks out amyloid beta,

00:06:49.002 --> 00:06:52.555
and this alone will tip
your scale arm to the ground.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:56.745
But for most of us, the genes we inherit
will only tip the arm a bit.

00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:01.584
For example, APOE4 is a gene variant
that increases amyloid,
