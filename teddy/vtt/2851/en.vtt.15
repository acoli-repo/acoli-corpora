00:07:29.384 --> 00:07:30.600
throughout our brains,

00:07:30.624 --> 00:07:34.196
clearing away metabolic waste
that accumulated in our synapses

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.121
while we were awake.

00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:38.951
Deep sleep is like
a power cleanse for the brain.

00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:42.832
But what happens if you shortchange
yourself on sleep?

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.953
Many scientists believe

00:07:44.977 --> 00:07:49.227
that poor sleep hygiene might actually
be a predictor of Alzheimer's.

00:07:49.613 --> 00:07:54.539
A single night of sleep deprivation
leads to an increase in amyloid beta.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.836
And amyloid accumulation
has been shown to disrupt sleep,

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.347
which in turn causes
more amyloid to accumulate.
