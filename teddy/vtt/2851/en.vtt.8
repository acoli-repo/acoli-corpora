00:03:57.141 --> 00:04:00.664
the glitches in memory,
language and cognition are different.

00:04:00.688 --> 00:04:03.588
Instead of eventually finding
your keys in your coat pocket

00:04:03.612 --> 00:04:05.614
or on the table by the door,

00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:08.352
you find them in the refrigerator,

00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:10.342
or you find them and you think,

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:11.899
"What are these for?"

00:04:12.843 --> 00:04:18.051
So what happens when amyloid plaques
accumulate to this tipping point?

00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:21.394
Our microglia janitor cells
become hyper-activated,

00:04:21.418 --> 00:04:25.552
releasing chemicals that cause
inflammation and cellular damage.

00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:28.171
We think they might actually
start clearing away

00:04:28.195 --> 00:04:29.899
the synapses themselves.
