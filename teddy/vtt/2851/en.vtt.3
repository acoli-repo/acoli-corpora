Here's a picture
of two neurons connecting.

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:34.120
The point of connection,
this space circled in red,

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:35.783
is called the synapse.

00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:38.999
The synapse is where
neurotransmitters are released.

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:43.291
This is where signals are transmitted,
where communication happens.

00:01:43.315 --> 00:01:48.421
This is where we think,
feel, see, hear, desire ...

00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:50.094
and remember.

00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:53.016
And the synapse
is where Alzheimer's happens.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.002
Let's zoom in on the synapse

00:01:55.026 --> 00:01:58.113
and look at a cartoon representation
of what's going on.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.086
During the business
of communicating information,
