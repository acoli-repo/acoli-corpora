00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.658
There's one more thing you can do
to protect yourself

00:09:31.682 --> 00:09:34.268
from experiencing
the symptoms of Alzheimer's,

00:09:34.292 --> 00:09:38.783
even if you have the full-blown disease
pathology ablaze in your brain.

00:09:38.807 --> 00:09:42.714
It has to do with neural plasticity
and cognitive reserve.

00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:45.638
Remember, the experience
of having Alzheimer's

00:09:45.662 --> 00:09:48.868
is ultimately a result of losing synapses.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:52.716
The average brain has
over a hundred trillion synapses,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.453
which is fantastic;
we've got a lot to work with.

00:09:55.477 --> 00:09:57.146
And this isn't a static number.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.568
We gain and lose synapses all the time,

00:09:59.592 --> 00:10:02.395
through a process
called neural plasticity.
