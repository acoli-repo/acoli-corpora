In some of these brains, scientists
discovered something surprising.

00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:36.368
Despite the presence of plaques
and tangles and brain shrinkage --

00:10:36.392 --> 00:10:39.261

the nuns who had belonged
to these brains showed no signs

00:10:42.988 --> 00:10:45.555

more functional synapses.

00:10:56.107 --> 00:10:58.681
People who have more years
of formal education,

00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:00.940
who have a high degree of literacy,
