00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:03.581
because at this point,
you are blissfully unaware.

00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:07.894
You're not showing any impairments
in memory, language, or cognition ...

00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:09.069
yet.

00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:14.008
We think it takes at least 15 to 20 years
of amyloid plaque accumulation

00:03:14.032 --> 00:03:16.413
before it reaches a tipping point,

00:03:16.437 --> 00:03:18.672
then triggering a molecular cascade

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:21.363
that causes the clinical
symptoms of the disease.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.771
Prior to the tipping point,

00:03:23.795 --> 00:03:27.379
your lapses in memory
might include things like,

00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:29.728
"Why did I come in this room?"

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:31.980
or "Oh ... what's his name?"
