For example, APOE4 is a gene variant
that increases amyloid,

00:07:01.608 --> 00:07:04.876
but you can inherit a copy of APOE4
from mom and dad

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.291
and still never get Alzheimer's,

00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:09.428
which means that for most of us,

00:07:09.452 --> 00:07:13.292
our DNA alone does not determine
whether we get Alzheimer's.

00:07:13.984 --> 00:07:15.458
So what does?

00:07:15.482 --> 00:07:19.274
We can't do anything about getting older
or the genes we've inherited.

00:07:19.298 --> 00:07:22.295
So far, we haven't changed
our brain's destiny.

00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:24.609
What about sleep?

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:29.360
In slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells
rinse cerebral spinal fluid

00:07:29.384 --> 00:07:30.600
throughout our brains,
