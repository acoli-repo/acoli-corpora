00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:31.716
Too much is released,
or not enough is cleared away,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.074
and the synapse begins
to pile up with amyloid beta.

00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:37.317
And when this happens, it binds to itself,

00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:40.630
forming sticky aggregates
called amyloid plaques.

00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:44.535
How many people here
are 40 years old or older?

00:02:45.184 --> 00:02:47.704
You're afraid to admit it now.

00:02:47.728 --> 00:02:49.954
This initial step into the disease,

00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:53.062
this presence of amyloid
plaques accumulating,

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:55.680
can already be found in your brains.

00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:59.741
The only way we could be sure of this
would be through a PET scan,

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:03.581
because at this point,
you are blissfully unaware.
