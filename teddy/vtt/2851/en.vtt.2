00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.534
Despite decades of research, we still
have no disease-modifying treatment

00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:02.865
and no cure.

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.790
So if we're lucky enough
to live long enough,

00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:08.922
Alzheimer's appears to be
our brain's destiny.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.249
But maybe it doesn't have to be.

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:14.950
What if I told you we could
change these statistics,

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:17.664
literally change our brain's destiny,

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:21.217
without relying on a cure
or advancements in medicine?

00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:24.508
Let's begin by looking at
what we currently understand

00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:26.889
about the neuroscience of Alzheimer's.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.739
Here's a picture
of two neurons connecting.
