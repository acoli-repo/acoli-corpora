00:09:59.592 --> 00:10:02.395
through a process
called neural plasticity.

00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:04.491
Every time we learn something new,

00:10:04.515 --> 00:10:08.642
we are creating and strengthening
new neural connections,

00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:10.283
new synapses.

00:10:10.988 --> 00:10:12.563
In the Nun Study,

00:10:12.587 --> 00:10:17.480
678 nuns, all over the age of 75
when the study began,

00:10:17.504 --> 00:10:19.813
were followed for more than two decades.

00:10:19.837 --> 00:10:23.297
They were regularly given
physical checkups and cognitive tests,

00:10:23.321 --> 00:10:27.369
and when they died, their brains
were all donated for autopsy.

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:31.768
In some of these brains, scientists
discovered something surprising.
