00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:34.846
A crucial neural transport protein
called "tau" becomes hyperphosphorylated

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.454
and twists itself
into something called "tangles,"

00:04:37.478 --> 00:04:40.513
which choke off the neurons
from the inside.

00:04:40.537 --> 00:04:44.371
By mid-stage Alzheimer's,
we have massive inflammation and tangles

00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:46.342
and all-out war at the synapse

00:04:46.366 --> 00:04:47.619
and cell death.

00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:51.326
So if you were a scientist
trying to cure this disease,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.347
at what point would you ideally
want to intervene?

00:04:55.134 --> 00:04:59.038
Many scientists are betting big
on the simplest solution:

00:04:59.062 --> 00:05:02.896
keep amyloid plaques
from reaching that tipping point,
