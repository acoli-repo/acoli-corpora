00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.347
which in turn causes
more amyloid to accumulate.

00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.847
And so now we have
this positive feedback loop

00:08:03.871 --> 00:08:06.744
that's going to accelerate
the tipping of that scale.

00:08:07.306 --> 00:08:08.729
What else?

00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:10.379
Cardiovascular health.

00:08:11.043 --> 00:08:14.788
High blood pressure, diabetes,
obesity, smoking, high cholesterol,

00:08:14.812 --> 00:08:18.948
have all been shown to increase our risk
of developing Alzheimer's.

00:08:18.972 --> 00:08:20.863
Some autopsy studies have shown

00:08:20.887 --> 00:08:23.559
that as many as 80 percent
of people with Alzheimer's

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:26.345
also had cardiovascular disease.

00:08:26.369 --> 00:08:31.374
Aerobic exercise has been shown
in many studies to decrease amyloid beta
