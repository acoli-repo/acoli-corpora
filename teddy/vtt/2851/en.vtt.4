During the business
of communicating information,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.108
in addition to releasing neurotransmitters
like glutamate into the synapse,

00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:09.593
neurons also release a small peptide
called amyloid beta.

00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:15.601
Normally, amyloid beta is cleared away
metabolized by microglia,

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:17.778
the janitor cells of our brains.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:22.264
While the molecular causes
of Alzheimer's are still debated,

00:02:22.288 --> 00:02:25.542
most neuroscientists believe
that the disease begins

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:28.396
when amyloid beta begins to accumulate.

00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:31.716
Too much is released,
or not enough is cleared away,
