00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.386
But what if you had learned more about me?

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.499
Let's say you learned
four things about me.

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:04.368
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's,

00:12:04.392 --> 00:12:07.387
and three of those synapses
are damaged or destroyed.

00:12:08.077 --> 00:12:10.538
You still have a way
to detour the wreckage.

00:12:10.562 --> 00:12:12.581
You can still remember my name.

00:12:13.283 --> 00:12:17.209
So we can be resilient
to the presence of Alzheimer's pathology

00:12:17.233 --> 00:12:20.336
through the recruitment
of yet-undamaged pathways.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.139
And we create these pathways,
this cognitive reserve,

00:12:24.163 --> 00:12:25.863
by learning new things.

00:12:26.455 --> 00:12:30.976
Ideally, we want these new things
to be as rich in meaning as possible,
