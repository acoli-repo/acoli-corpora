00:08:59.183 --> 00:09:00.686
you love bacon;

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.933
and you don't run unless
someone's chasing you.

00:09:02.957 --> 00:09:04.258
(Laughter)

00:09:04.282 --> 00:09:07.894
Let's imagine that your amyloid plaques
have reached that tipping point.

00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:09.966

00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:13.261
setting fire to the forest,

00:09:13.285 --> 00:09:16.383
causing inflammation, tangles,
and cell death.

00:09:17.137 --> 00:09:19.796
You should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.136
You should be having trouble
finding words and keys

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.306
and remembering what I said
at the beginning of this talk.

00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:28.631
But you might not be.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.658
There's one more thing you can do
to protect yourself
