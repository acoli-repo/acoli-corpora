00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:05.531
How many people here would like to live
to be at least 80 years old?

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.547
Yeah.

00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:10.366
I think we all have
this hopeful expectation

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.350
of living into old age.

00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:14.914
Let's project out into the future,

00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:16.498
to your future "you's,"

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:19.375
and let's imagine that we're all 85.

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:21.912
Now, everyone look at two people.

00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:26.683
One of you probably has
Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:30.789
