00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:31.980
or "Oh ... what's his name?"

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.823
or "Where did I put my keys?"

00:03:35.553 --> 00:03:38.109
Now, before you all
start freaking out again,

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:43.531
because I know half of you did at least
one of those in the last 24 hours --

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:46.792
these are all normal kinds of forgetting.

00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:49.129
In fact, I would argue that these examples

00:03:49.153 --> 00:03:51.130
might not even involve your memory,

00:03:51.154 --> 00:03:54.046
because you didn't pay attention
to where you put your keys

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.415
in the first place.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.117
After the tipping point,

00:03:57.141 --> 00:04:00.664
the glitches in memory,
language and cognition are different.
