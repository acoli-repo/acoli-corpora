keep amyloid plaques
from reaching that tipping point,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.948
which means that drug discovery is largely
focused on developing a compound

00:05:06.972 --> 00:05:12.320
that will prevent, eliminate, or reduce
amyloid plaque accumulation.

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:18.048
So the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be
a preventative medicine.

00:05:18.072 --> 00:05:21.501
We're going to have to take this pill
before we reach that tipping point,

00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:23.777
before the cascade is triggered,

00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:26.829
before we start leaving
our keys in the refrigerator.

00:05:27.381 --> 00:05:31.054
We think this is why, to date,
these kinds of drugs have failed
