00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is a sculpture I made,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which is a way of, kind of, freeing a form

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
into an object that has different degrees of freedom.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So, it can balance on a point.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is a bronze ball,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
an aluminum arm here,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then this wooden disk.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And the wooden disk was really thought about

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
as something that you'd want to hold on to,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and that would glide easily through your hands.
