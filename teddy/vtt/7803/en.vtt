There's a shocking statistic
I want to share with you.

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:10.381
Latin America is home to only
eight percent of the worldâ€™s population

00:00:10.423 --> 00:00:13.593
but one third of its homicides.

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:19.015
This is especially extreme
in the Northern Triangle countries

00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:23.019
of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador,

00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:25.438
where I'm from and where I live.

00:00:26.064 --> 00:00:30.443
Just imagine the impact that this kind
of unrelenting violence can have
