still does correspond to a measurable
physical event in the brain,

00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:05.557
not unknowable qualia beyond
physical explanation.

00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:07.637
But there still isn't a definitive answer

00:04:07.637 --> 00:04:11.037
to the question of whether Mary would
learn anything new

00:04:11.037 --> 00:04:12.866
when she sees the apple.

00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:15.976
Could it be that there are fundamental
limits to what we can know

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:18.917
about something we can't experience?

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:21.948
And would this mean there are certain
aspects of the universe

00:04:21.948 --> 00:04:25.338
that lie permanently beyond
our comprehension?

00:04:25.338 --> 00:04:30.676
Or will science and philosophy allow
us to overcome our mind's limitations?
