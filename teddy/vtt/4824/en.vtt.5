about the structure and function
of someone else's brain,

00:02:32.724 --> 00:02:37.794
but still not understand
what it feels like to be that person.

00:02:37.794 --> 00:02:42.407
These ineffable experiences 
have properties called qualia,

00:02:42.407 --> 00:02:47.665
subjective qualities that you can't 
accurately describe or measure.

00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:50.469
Qualia are unique to the person
experiencing them,

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:51.714
like having an itch,

00:02:51.714 --> 00:02:52.934
being in love,

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:54.734
or feeling bored.

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:58.737
Physical facts can't completely explain
mental states like this.
