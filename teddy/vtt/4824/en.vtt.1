00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.221
and knows everything ever discovered
about its physics and biology.

00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:33.421
She knows how different 
wavelengths of light

00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:36.842
stimulate three types of cone cells
in the retina,

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.601
and she knows how electrical signals

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:42.821
travel down the optic nerve 
into the brain.

00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:45.232
There, they create patterns 
of neural activity

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:50.851
that correspond to the millions
of colors most humans can distinguish.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.192
Now imagine that one day,

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:54.802
Mary's black and white screen
malfunctions

00:00:54.802 --> 00:00:57.580
and an apple appears in color.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.691
For the first time,

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:03.502
she can experience something
that she's known about for years.
