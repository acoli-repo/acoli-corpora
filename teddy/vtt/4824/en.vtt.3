00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:31.713
can't be completely described 
by physical facts.

00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:33.492
The Mary's room thought experiment

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:37.492
describes what philosophers call
the knowledge argument,

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:40.041
that there are non-physical properties
and knowledge

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:44.852
which can only be discovered
through conscious experience.

00:01:44.852 --> 00:01:48.024
The knowledge argument contradicts
the theory of physicalism,

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:50.603
which says that everything, 
including mental states,

00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:53.684
has a physical explanation.

00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:55.813
To most people hearing Mary's story,

00:01:55.813 --> 00:01:59.483
it seems intuitively obvious 
that actually seeing color

00:01:59.483 --> 00:02:03.063
will be totally different 
than learning about it.
