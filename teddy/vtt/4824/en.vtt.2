she can experience something
that she's known about for years.

00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:05.211
Does she learn anything new?

00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:10.342
Is there anything about perceiving color
that wasn't captured in all her knowledge?

00:01:10.342 --> 00:01:13.491
Philosopher Frank Jackson proposed
this thought experiment,

00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:17.069
called Mary's room, in 1982.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.312
He argued that if Mary already knew
all the physical facts about color vision,

00:01:21.312 --> 00:01:24.722
and experiencing color still teaches
her something new,

00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:27.462
then mental states, like color perception,

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:31.713
can't be completely described 
by physical facts.
