Imagine a brilliant neuroscientist
named Mary.

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:13.830
Mary lives in a black and white room,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.220
she only reads black and white books,

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.580
and her screens only display 
black and white.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.160
But even though she has never seen color,
Mary is an expert in color vision

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.221
and knows everything ever discovered
about its physics and biology.
