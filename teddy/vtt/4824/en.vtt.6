00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:02.185
Philosophers interested
in artificial intelligence

00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:03.985
have used the knowledge argument

00:03:03.985 --> 00:03:06.715
to theorize that recreating 
a physical state

00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:11.375
won't necessarily recreate
a corresponding mental state.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:12.656
In other words,

00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:16.304
building a computer which mimicked 
the function of every single neuron

00:03:16.304 --> 00:03:17.716
of the human brain

00:03:17.716 --> 00:03:22.665
won't necessarily create a conscious
computerized brain.

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:26.927
Not all philosophers agree that
the Mary's room experiment is useful.

00:03:26.927 --> 00:03:29.836
Some argue that her extensive knowledge
of color vision

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:32.636
would have allowed her to create
the same mental state
