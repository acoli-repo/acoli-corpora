00:02:06.057 --> 00:02:09.303
that transcends its physical description.

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:12.822
The knowledge argument isn't just

00:02:12.822 --> 00:02:18.395
Mary's room uses color vision
to represent conscious experience.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.713
If physical science can't entirely

then maybe it can't entirely explain
other conscious experiences either.

00:02:26.844 --> 00:02:29.304
For instance, we could know every

00:02:29.304 --> 00:02:32.724
about the structure and function
of someone else's brain,
