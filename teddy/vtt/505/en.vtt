00:00:01.026 --> 00:00:02.523
When I was a child,

00:00:02.547 --> 00:00:03.706
every other Friday,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.672
I would leave my mother
and stepfather's home --

00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:11.345
an Indian and British, atheist, Buddhist,

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:17.023
agnostic, vegetarian, new age-y sometimes,

00:00:17.047 --> 00:00:18.339
Democratic household.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.812
And I would go 1.4 miles
to my father and stepmother's home

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:27.420
and enter a white, Evangelical Christian,

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:30.297
conservative, Republican,
