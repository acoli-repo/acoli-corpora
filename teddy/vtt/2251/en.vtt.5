There are many reasons for this crisis,

00:02:35.014 --> 00:02:38.418

00:02:38.442 --> 00:02:42.109
that America tries to export
to the rest of the world.

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:45.689
The original intention
behind the patent system

00:02:45.713 --> 00:02:48.240
was to motivate people to invent

00:02:48.264 --> 00:02:51.852
by rewarding them
with a time-limited monopoly.

00:02:51.876 --> 00:02:56.177
But today, that intention
has been distorted beyond recognition.

00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:59.884
Corporations have teams
of lawyers and lobbyists

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:05.192
whose sole job is to extend
patent protection as long as possible.
