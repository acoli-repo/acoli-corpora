00:06:55.099 --> 00:07:00.123
would resurrect and evolve
this simple, yet elegant proposition.

00:07:00.147 --> 00:07:01.543
That to get a patent,

00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:04.813
you have to invent something
substantially better

00:07:04.837 --> 00:07:06.892
than what's already out there.

00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:09.241
This shouldn't be controversial.

00:07:09.265 --> 00:07:10.662
As a society,

00:07:10.686 --> 00:07:14.918
we reserve the big rewards
for the big ideas.

00:07:14.942 --> 00:07:19.109
We don't give Michelin stars
to chefs who just tweak a recipe --

00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:23.555
we give them to chefs who change
how we think about food.

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:26.602
And yet, we hand out patents
worth billions of dollars

00:07:26.626 --> 00:07:28.499
for minor changes.

00:07:28.523 --> 00:07:30.323
It's time to raise the bar.
