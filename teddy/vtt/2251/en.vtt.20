Imagine if Americans
had the right to go to court, too.

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:08.870
And lastly, we need stronger oversight.

00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:15.477
We need an independent unit
that can serve as a public advocate,

00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:18.969
regularly monitoring the activities
of the Patent Office

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:20.949
and reporting to Congress.

00:10:21.592 --> 00:10:23.585
If a unit like this had existed,

00:10:23.609 --> 00:10:28.243
it would have caught, for example,
the Silicon Valley company Theranos

00:10:28.267 --> 00:10:32.022
before it got so many patents
for blood testing
