00:00:57.224 --> 00:01:01.565
In my family, we have a special love
for my father's inventions.

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.950
And in particular, we have
a reverence for his patents.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:09.459
We have framed patents
on the wall in our house.

00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:14.547
And there's a recognition in our family
that everything I've been able to do --

00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:17.936
college, law school,
health justice work --

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.285
all of it is because America
enabled my father

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:24.661
to fulfill his potential as an inventor.

00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:29.919
