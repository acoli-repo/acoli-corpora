00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:32.753
in an effort to curb rising drug costs,

00:06:32.777 --> 00:06:35.738
a congressman from Tennessee
proposed an idea.

00:06:36.211 --> 00:06:37.528
He said,

00:06:37.552 --> 00:06:39.156
"If you want to tweak a drug,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.576
and you want to get another patent on it,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.768
the modified version has to be
significantly better, therapeutically,

00:06:45.792 --> 00:06:46.942
for patients."

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.037
Because of intense lobbying,

00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:51.528
this idea never saw the light of day.

00:06:52.464 --> 00:06:55.075
But a reimagined patent system

00:06:55.099 --> 00:07:00.123
would resurrect and evolve
this simple, yet elegant proposition.
