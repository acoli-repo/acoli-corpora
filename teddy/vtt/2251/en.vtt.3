Last year, I met the director
of the US Patent Office

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.257
for the first time,

00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:38.956
and I sent my family a selfie
from that office in Virginia.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.981
(Laughter)

00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:41.900
I got so many emojis back,

00:01:41.924 --> 00:01:44.325
you would have thought I had met Beyoncé.

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:45.647
(Laughter)

00:01:46.187 --> 00:01:47.347
But truth be told,

00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:49.752
I was actually there
to talk about a problem --

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:54.831
how our outdated patent system
is fueling the high cost of medicines

00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:56.632
and costing lives.

00:01:57.315 --> 00:02:01.672
Today, over two billion people
live without access to medicines.
