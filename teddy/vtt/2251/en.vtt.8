00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.529
recently conducted an investigation
into the 12 best-selling drugs in America.

00:04:02.553 --> 00:04:04.664
We found that, on average,

00:04:04.688 --> 00:04:09.759
there are 125 patents
filed on each medicine.

00:04:10.204 --> 00:04:13.395
Often for things we've known
how to do for decades,

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.278
like putting two pills into one.

00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:19.966

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.626
the longer they hold on to their monopoly.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.951
And with no one to compete with,

00:04:24.975 --> 00:04:27.292
they can set prices at whim.

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:29.308
And because these are medicines

00:04:29.332 --> 00:04:31.419
and not designer watches,
