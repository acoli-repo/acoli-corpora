00:01:57.315 --> 00:02:01.672
Today, over two billion people
live without access to medicines.

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:03.656
And against this global crisis,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.926
drug prices are skyrocketing,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.331
including in wealthier countries.

00:02:08.355 --> 00:02:13.176
Thirty-four million Americans
have lost a family member or a friend

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.057
in the last five years,

00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:17.382
not because the treatment didn't exist,

00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:19.663
but because they couldn't afford it.

00:02:20.287 --> 00:02:24.224
Rising drug costs are pushing
families into homelessness,

00:02:24.248 --> 00:02:26.581
seniors into bankruptcy

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:30.938
and parents to crowdfunding treatment
for their critically ill children.
