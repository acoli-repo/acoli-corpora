00:07:28.523 --> 00:07:30.323
It's time to raise the bar.

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:33.077
Second,

00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:37.514
we need to change the financial incentives
of the Patent Office.

00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:40.093
Right now, the revenue
of the Patent Office

00:07:40.117 --> 00:07:44.013
is directly linked to the number
of patents that it grants.

00:07:45.292 --> 00:07:50.879
That's like private prisons
getting paid more to hold more people --

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:54.680
it naturally leads to more incarceration,

00:07:54.704 --> 00:07:56.101
not less.

00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:58.696
The same is true for patents.
