00:10:28.267 --> 00:10:32.022
before it got so many patents
for blood testing

00:10:32.046 --> 00:10:35.569
and landed an evaluation
of nine billion dollars,

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:36.847
when in reality,

00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:39.271
there was no invention there at all.

00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:44.585
This kind of accountability
is going to become increasingly urgent.

00:10:44.609 --> 00:10:46.870
In the age of 23andMe,

00:10:46.894 --> 00:10:49.008
important questions are being asked

00:10:49.032 --> 00:10:52.291
about whether companies
can patent and sell

00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:55.980
our genetic information
and our patient data.

00:10:56.004 --> 00:10:58.678
We need to be part of those conversations

00:10:58.702 --> 00:11:00.281
before it's too late.
