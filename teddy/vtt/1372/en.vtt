00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Any guesses? 1816.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And what I can say is, in 2016,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
There's a whole lot better technology coming,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and that's part of the change in medicine.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What has changed our society

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
has been wireless devices.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But the future are digital medical wireless devices, OK?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So, let me give you some examples of this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to kind of make this much more concrete.
