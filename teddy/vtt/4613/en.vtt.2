and it will become a video
that people can access all over the world

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:05.631
on computers, mobile devices,

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:06.885
televisions.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.851
I weight about 190 pounds.

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:15.754
How much will the video weigh?

00:01:18.413 --> 00:01:19.976
Asking questions like that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.770
is what I do every week
on my channel Vsauce.

00:01:23.238 --> 00:01:24.405

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.868
I have been asking really fun questions,

00:01:26.892 --> 00:01:28.238
mind-boggling questions,

00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:31.257
and approaching them
as sincerely as I can,
