00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:01.552
that information is temporarily stored

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:03.091
using electrons.

00:04:03.505 --> 00:04:08.922
And the number of electrons on your device
won't actually increase or decrease.

00:04:08.946 --> 00:04:11.945
But it takes energy
to store them in one place,

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.506
and, thanks to our friend Albert Einstein,

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.795
we know that energy and mass are related.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.363
Okay, so here's the thing:

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:20.339
let's say you're watching a YouTube video

00:04:20.363 --> 00:04:23.085
at a really nice resolution, 720p.

00:04:23.109 --> 00:04:25.003
Assuming a typical bit rate,

00:04:25.027 --> 00:04:30.166
we can figure that a minute
of YouTube video
