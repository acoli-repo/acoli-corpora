00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:31.001
you have this captive
audience that you can,

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:33.627
with the goal in mind
of answering the question,

00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:36.505
accidentally teach a lot of things to.

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.019
So, let's take a look
at some of my videos.

00:02:39.043 --> 00:02:40.367
Here are eight of them.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.055
But down here in the lower-right corner,

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.281
"What Color is a Mirror?"

00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:46.697
When people see that,

00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:49.150
it's very difficult not to click,
because you think,

00:02:49.174 --> 00:02:50.475
"Come on, are you serious?

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.194
How could you possibly
answer that question?"

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:58.011
Well, so far, 7.6 million
people have watched

00:02:58.035 --> 00:03:00.885
this five-minute video
about what color a mirror is.
