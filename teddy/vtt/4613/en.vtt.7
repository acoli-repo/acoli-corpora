green.

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:33.940
You can demonstrate this
by putting two mirrors next to each other,

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:36.114
facing so they reflect
back and forth forever.

00:03:36.138 --> 00:03:39.110
Look down that infinite reflection,
and it will get dimmer,

00:03:39.134 --> 00:03:42.844
because some light is lost
or absorbed every time,

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:46.000
but it will also become greener,

00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:47.806
because green light,

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.859
that is light of a wavelength
that we perceive as green,

00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:53.669
is best reflected by most mirrors.

00:03:54.245 --> 00:03:56.363
Okay, so, how much does a video weigh?

00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:59.393
Well, when you stream
a video onto your computer,

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:01.552
that information is temporarily stored
