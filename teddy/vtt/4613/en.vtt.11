00:05:28.798 --> 00:05:30.711
and it was hard to get more books

00:05:30.735 --> 00:05:33.044
because books are heavy,
you need space for them

00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:35.965
and moving books around is tougher
than what we can do today.

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:37.440
With numbers that small,

00:05:37.464 --> 00:05:39.936
I can fit thousands of books

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.031
on my own little personal
electronic reader.

00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:45.210
I can stream hours and hours

00:05:45.234 --> 00:05:47.256
and days and days of YouTube video

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.021
without my computer
ever getting measurably heavier.

00:05:52.123 --> 00:05:54.307
And as information becomes that light,

00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:55.903
it becomes a lot more democratic,

00:05:55.927 --> 00:05:58.133
meaning that more teachers

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:03.508
and presenters and creators
and viewers than ever before
