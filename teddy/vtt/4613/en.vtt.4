I've found that asking a strange question
is a great way to get people in,

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.905
not just people, but fans.

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.549
And fans are different
than just viewers or an audience,

00:02:06.573 --> 00:02:08.901
because fans want to come back.

00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:11.482
They subscribe to you on YouTube

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.602
and they want to watch
everything you've made

00:02:13.626 --> 00:02:15.769
and everything you plan
to make in the future

00:02:15.793 --> 00:02:18.240
because we are curious people

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:23.642
and sparking curiosity is great bait.

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:25.905
It's a great way to catch a human.

00:02:26.503 --> 00:02:27.837
And once you've caught them,

00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:31.001
you have this captive
audience that you can,
