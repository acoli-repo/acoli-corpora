WEBVTT

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:32.251
is a brilliant way to build
fans and an audience

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:33.337
and get in viewers.

00:06:33.361 --> 00:06:36.617
It's even a great way
for brands and companies

00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:38.046
to build trust.

00:06:38.828 --> 00:06:43.188
So, calculating the weight of a video

00:06:43.212 --> 00:06:45.199
is kind of a funny question,

00:06:45.223 --> 00:06:51.945
but I cannot wait to see
what we ask and answer next.

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:53.863
As always, thanks for watching.

00:06:53.887 --> 00:06:54.887
