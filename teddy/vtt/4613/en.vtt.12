00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:03.508
and presenters and creators
and viewers than ever before

00:06:03.532 --> 00:06:04.643
can be involved.

00:06:06.638 --> 00:06:07.738
Right now, on YouTube,

00:06:07.762 --> 00:06:10.481
there is an explosion
of content like this happening.

00:06:10.505 --> 00:06:13.269
The three Vsauce channels
are down there in the corner.

00:06:13.293 --> 00:06:15.509
But everyone else,
all together, collectively,

00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:18.199
their views dwarf what I can do alone

00:06:18.223 --> 00:06:20.128
or with the people that I work with,

00:06:20.152 --> 00:06:22.299
and that is really, really exciting.

00:06:22.323 --> 00:06:25.096
It turns out that tapping
into people's curiosity

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.285
and responsibly answering their questions

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:32.251
is a brilliant way to build
fans and an audience
