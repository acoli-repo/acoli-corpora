00:02:58.035 --> 00:03:00.885
this five-minute video
about what color a mirror is.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.909
And in that episode, I answer the question

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:07.139
and I get a chance to explain
what would normally be kind of dry topics:

00:03:07.163 --> 00:03:08.171
optics,

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:10.211
diffuse versus specular reflection,

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:12.634
how light works,
how light works on the retina,

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:14.420
and even the etymology of color terms

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.258
like white and black.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.100
Okay, spoiler alert:

00:03:19.124 --> 00:03:21.425
mirrors are not clear,

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.316
they are not silvery,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.931
like they're often illustrated.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:26.385
Mirrors, technically speaking,

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.434
are just a tiny, tiny, little bit ...

00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:30.707
green.
