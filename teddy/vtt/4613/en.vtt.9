00:04:25.027 --> 00:04:30.166
we can figure that a minute
of YouTube video

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.484
is going to need to involve
about 10 million electrons on your device.

00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:41.173
Plugging all those electrons
and the energy it takes to hold them

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.354
in the correct place
for you to see the video,

00:04:43.378 --> 00:04:44.486
into that formula,

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.431
we can figure out
that one minute of YouTube video

00:04:47.455 --> 00:04:50.770
increases the mass of your computer

00:04:50.794 --> 00:04:54.558
by about 10 to the negative 19th grams.

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:57.180
Written out, it looks like this.

00:04:57.787 --> 00:04:58.788
(Whistle)

00:04:58.812 --> 00:04:59.884
That's like nothing.
