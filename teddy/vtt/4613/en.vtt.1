Using the Live Strong
Organization's online database

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.110
of weight loss resources,

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:36.412
you can calculate

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.558
that by the time I'm done
with this speech,

00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:40.472
those of you who are standing

00:00:40.496 --> 00:00:44.889
will have burned 7.5 more calories

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:47.450
than those of you who are bean-bagging it.

00:00:47.474 --> 00:00:48.537
(Laughter)

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.876
Okay, here's a question,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.630
speaking of weight loss,
specifically weight,

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:54.804
this speech is live.

00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:56.686
I'm actually here in front of you guys,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.907
we're all here together.

00:00:57.931 --> 00:00:59.781
But this speech is being recorded

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:03.671
and it will become a video
that people can access all over the world
