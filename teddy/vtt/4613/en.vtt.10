You could call that nothing,
and you wouldn't really get in trouble,

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:07.489
because the best scales
we've ever invented

00:05:07.513 --> 00:05:10.552
that we could try to use
to actually to detect that change

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:13.352
are only accurate to 10
to the negative 9th grams.

00:05:13.852 --> 00:05:15.012
So, we can't measure it,

00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:17.852
but we can, like we just did,
calculate it.

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:20.271
And that's really cool
because when I was a kid,

00:05:20.295 --> 00:05:25.334
my school had two shelves
of science books.

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:26.469
That was really cool,

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:28.774
but I read all of them
within, like, two grades,

00:05:28.798 --> 00:05:30.711
and it was hard to get more books
