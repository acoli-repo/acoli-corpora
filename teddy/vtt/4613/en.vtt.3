00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:31.257
and approaching them
as sincerely as I can,

00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:34.423
celebrating scientific
concepts and scientists.

00:01:34.447 --> 00:01:36.377
And I research and write

00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.453
and produce and host

00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:38.719
and edit and upload

00:01:38.743 --> 00:01:40.792
and run the social media all by myself,

00:01:40.816 --> 00:01:42.635
but it's not lonely,

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.889
because Vsauce has
more than 2 million subscribers,

00:01:45.913 --> 00:01:50.032
and every month, my videos are seen
by more than 20 million people.

00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:52.016
Yeah.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.217
(Applause)

00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.680
It's very exciting.

00:01:55.704 --> 00:02:01.730
I've found that asking a strange question
is a great way to get people in,
