00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.392
We know they have their own vernacular,

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:01.585
their own jargon.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.107
But what most interested me was
that definition right in the center there:

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:09.717
"the system of communication used
by a particular community or country."

00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:12.744
And I'm not interested
in altering this definition.

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:16.033
I'm interested in applying it
to everything we do,

00:01:16.057 --> 00:01:19.452
because I believe that we speak
far more languages than we realize.

00:01:19.476 --> 00:01:21.572
And for the rest of our time together,

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:23.754
I'm going to attempt
to speak in one language

00:01:23.778 --> 00:01:27.241
that is native to every single
human being in this room.

00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:29.033
But that changes things a little bit,

00:01:29.057 --> 00:01:32.435
because then it's no longer
a presentation.
