00:13:58.476 --> 00:14:00.533
And I challenge you, when you see someone,

00:14:00.557 --> 00:14:01.808
to ask yourself:

00:14:03.407 --> 00:14:05.480
What languages do we share?

00:14:05.504 --> 00:14:07.404
And if you don't come up with anything,

00:14:07.428 --> 00:14:09.852
ask yourself: What languages
could we share?

00:14:09.876 --> 00:14:12.055
And if you still don't
come up with anything,

00:14:12.817 --> 00:14:15.175
ask yourself: What languages can I learn?

00:14:16.315 --> 00:14:19.107
And now matter how inconsequential

00:14:19.131 --> 00:14:23.679
or insignificant that conversation
seems at the moment,

00:14:23.703 --> 00:14:26.250
I promise you it will
serve you in the future.

00:14:27.238 --> 00:14:29.347
My name is Poet Ali. Thank you.

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:36.077
