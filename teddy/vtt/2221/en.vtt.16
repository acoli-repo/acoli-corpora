00:07:58.198 --> 00:08:01.986
Did my cheeks have a big
"Pinch me" sign that I didn't see?

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.260
And if you're squirming
or you're laughing or you stood up,

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:06.688
or you're beginning to stand,

00:08:06.712 --> 00:08:09.174
you're speaking the language
that I endearingly call

00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:11.116
"the language of growing up a fat kid."

00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:16.293
And any body-image issue
is a dialect of that language.

00:08:16.977 --> 00:08:18.343
I want you to stay standing.

00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:21.613
Again, if I'm speaking your language,
please go ahead and stand.

00:08:22.648 --> 00:08:24.558
Imagine two bills in my hand.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.501
One is the phone bill,

00:08:27.525 --> 00:08:29.284
and one is the electric bill.
