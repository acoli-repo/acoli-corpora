Poet Ali: Hi.
Audience: Hi.

00:00:02.804 --> 00:00:06.156
PA: I want to ask you guys a question.
How many languages do you speak?

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.821
This is not a rhetorical question.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.317
I actually want you to think of a number.

00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:11.960
For some of you, it's pretty easy.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.695
Inside your head, you're like, "It's one.
You're speaking it, buddy. I'm done."

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.350
Others of you maybe are wondering

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.201
if the language an ex-boyfriend
or ex-girlfriend taught you,

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:21.928
where you learned all the cusswords,

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:23.757
if it counts -- go ahead and count it.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.288
When I asked myself the question,
I came up with four,

00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:28.265
arguably five, if I've been drinking.

00:00:29.343 --> 00:00:30.451
(Laughter)
