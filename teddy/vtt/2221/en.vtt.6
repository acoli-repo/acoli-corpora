00:02:57.673 --> 00:03:01.256
our little walk of languages here.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.388
(In Farsi: I'd like to translate
the idea of "taarof.")

00:03:04.412 --> 00:03:06.317
I said in Farsi, "I'd like to translate

00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:08.957

If two gentlemen
were walking by each other,

00:03:22.357 --> 00:03:24.679
it'd be very common 
for the first one to say,

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.286
(In Farsi: I am indebted to you),

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.029
which means, "I am indebted to you."

00:03:28.343 --> 00:03:30.202
The other gentlemen would respond back,
