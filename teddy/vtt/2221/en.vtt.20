00:09:58.777 --> 00:10:00.183
you're supposed to win.

00:10:00.207 --> 00:10:01.502
And we weren't winning.

00:10:02.657 --> 00:10:04.049
For any of you that stood up,

00:10:04.073 --> 00:10:06.469
you know very well that
I'm speaking the language

00:10:06.493 --> 00:10:09.099
of watching a loved one battle cancer.

00:10:09.123 --> 00:10:13.180
(Applause)

00:10:14.445 --> 00:10:18.417
Any terminal illness
is a derivative of that language.

00:10:19.655 --> 00:10:21.616
I'm going to speak one last language.

00:10:27.843 --> 00:10:29.236
Oh -- no, no, I'm listening.
