I don't know about you, but sometimes
when I approach a dressing room,

00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:34.984
my sweat glands start
activating on their own,

00:07:35.008 --> 00:07:37.516
because I know the garment is not
going to look on me

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.123
like it did on that mannequin.

00:07:39.147 --> 00:07:40.299
Or how about this?

00:07:40.323 --> 00:07:43.367
When I would go to family functions
or family gatherings,

00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:45.393
every time I wanted a second plate --

00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:47.507
and I usually did --

00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:48.535
(Laughter)

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:52.255
it was a whole exercise
in cost-benefit analysis,

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:54.047
my relatives looking at me like,

00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:58.174
"I don't know. Do you really need that?
Looks like you're doing OK there, bud."

00:07:58.198 --> 00:08:01.986
Did my cheeks have a big
"Pinch me" sign that I didn't see?
