you probably know what it's like
to feel left out.

00:11:32.382 --> 00:11:35.333

00:11:35.357 --> 00:11:38.211
(Applause)

00:11:38.235 --> 00:11:43.320

when everybody's a part of something,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.926
and you're not.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.043
You know what it's like
being the minority.

00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:51.356
And now that I'm speaking your language,

00:11:51.356 --> 00:11:52.782

00:11:52.782 --> 00:11:54.642
since we're speaking the same language.

00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:57.186
Because I believe that language
of being the minority

00:11:57.186 --> 00:12:00.564
is one of the most important languages
you can ever speak in your life,
