00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.477
And the other thing is,

00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:04.455
sometimes we think language is about
understanding the meaning of a word,

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.575
but I believe language is about
making a word meaningful for yourself.

00:04:09.194 --> 00:04:12.048
If I were to flash this series
of words on the screen,

00:04:12.072 --> 00:04:15.139
some of you, you'd know exactly
what it is right away.

00:04:15.163 --> 00:04:17.545
Others of you, you might
struggle a little bit.

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.055
And I could probably draw
a pretty clear-cut line

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.514
right around the age
of 35 and older, 35 and younger.

00:04:24.538 --> 00:04:26.637
And for those of us that are in the know,

00:04:26.661 --> 00:04:29.435
we know that's text-speak,
or SMS language.

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:33.268
It's a series of characters meant
to convey the most amount of meaning
