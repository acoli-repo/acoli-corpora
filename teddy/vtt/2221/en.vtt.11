00:05:29.384 --> 00:05:31.181
In that moment, if you laughed,

00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:34.400
you spoke another language
that needs no explanation: laughter.

00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:37.020
It's one of the most common
languages in the world.

00:05:37.044 --> 00:05:40.622
We don't have to explain it to each other,
it's just something we all feel,

00:05:40.646 --> 00:05:44.322
and that's why things like laughter
and things like music are so prevalent,

00:05:44.346 --> 00:05:47.515
because they seem to somehow
transcend explanation

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.964
and convey a profound amount of meaning.

00:05:51.014 --> 00:05:53.706
Every language we learn is a portal

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.361
by which we can access another language.

00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:59.314
The more you know, the more you can speak.

00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:01.292
And it's something common that we all do.
