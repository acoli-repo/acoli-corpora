if they've shared something you've shared,
you don't need to explain it much.

00:06:31.867 --> 00:06:34.607
Or that's why, when you're sharing
a story and you finish,

00:06:34.607 --> 00:06:37.045
and the people you're talking to
don't quite get it,

00:06:37.045 --> 00:06:38.607
the first thing we all say is,

00:06:39.147 --> 00:06:41.259
"Guess you had to be there."

00:06:41.295 --> 00:06:45.096
I guess you had to be here this week
to know what this is about.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.412
It's kind of hard to explain, isn't it?

00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:50.377
And for the sake of our research,
I'm going to close by asking

00:06:50.401 --> 00:06:53.515
that you participate one more time
in this language of experience.

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.569
I'm going to filter
through some languages,

00:06:55.593 --> 00:06:57.636
and if I'm speaking your language,

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.466
I'm going to ask that you just stand
and you stay standing.
