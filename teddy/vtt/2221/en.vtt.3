00:01:29.057 --> 00:01:32.435
because then it's no longer
a presentation.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.438
It becomes a conversation,

00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:35.882
and in any conversation,

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:38.371
there must be some sort of interaction.

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:40.652
And for any interaction to happen,

00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:44.673
there has to be a degree
of willingness on both parties.

00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:48.852
And I think if we just are willing,
we will see the magic that can happen

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:50.713
with just a little bit of willingness.

00:01:50.737 --> 00:01:55.774
So I've chosen a relatively low-risk
common denominator

00:01:55.798 --> 00:01:58.540
that can kind of gauge
if we're all willing.

00:01:58.564 --> 00:02:00.863
If you're happy and you know it,
clap your hands.
