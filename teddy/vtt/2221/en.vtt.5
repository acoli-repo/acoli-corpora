00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.773
I simply asked the Spanish-speaking
audience to stand up,

00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:35.813
look at a person that was sitting
close to them and laugh.

00:02:35.837 --> 00:02:38.514
And I know that wasn't nice,
and I'm sorry,

00:02:38.538 --> 00:02:40.141
but in that moment,

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:43.042
some of us felt something.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:45.349
You see, we're often aware
of what language does

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.034
when we speak somebody's language,

00:02:47.058 --> 00:02:49.203
what it does to connect,
what it does to bind.

00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:52.437
But we often forget what it does
when you can't speak that language,

00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:55.165
what it does to isolate,
what it does to exclude.

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:57.649
And I want us to hold on
as we journey through

00:02:57.673 --> 00:03:01.256
our little walk of languages here.
