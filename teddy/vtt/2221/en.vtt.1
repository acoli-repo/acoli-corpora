00:00:29.343 --> 00:00:30.451
(Laughter)

00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:33.329
(In Italian: With a little bit of wine 
I can speak Italian.)

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.091
(Applause)

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:36.524
Cheers!

00:00:36.548 --> 00:00:39.911
But on closer examination,
I came up with 83 -- 83 languages,

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:41.922
and I got tired and I stopped counting.

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:45.546
And it forced me to revisit
this definition that we have of language.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.777
The first entry said,

00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:49.679
"The method of human communication,
either spoken or written,

00:00:49.703 --> 00:00:53.327
consisting of the use of words
in a structured or conventional way."

00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:56.424
The definition at the bottom refers
to specialized fields,

00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:58.506
like medicine, science, tech.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.392
We know they have their own vernacular,
