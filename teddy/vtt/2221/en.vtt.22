00:10:59.953 --> 00:11:04.717
you speak the language that I like to call
"the language of disconnection."

00:11:05.987 --> 00:11:08.814
It's been called
the language of connection,

00:11:08.838 --> 00:11:11.301
but I like to call it
the language of disconnection.

00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:13.998
I don't mean disconnection,
I mean disconnection,

00:11:14.022 --> 00:11:15.305
human disconnection,

00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:17.800
disconnected from each other,

00:11:17.824 --> 00:11:20.322
from where we are, from our own thoughts,

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.438
so we can occupy another space.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.497
If you're not standing,

00:11:28.901 --> 00:11:31.295
you probably know what it's like
to feel left out.
