00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:01.292
And it's something common that we all do.

00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:04.174
We take any new concept,
and we filter it through

00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:08.040
an already existing access
of reality within us.

00:06:08.064 --> 00:06:10.273
And that's why languages are so important,

00:06:10.297 --> 00:06:12.957
because they give us access to new worlds,

00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:14.259
not just people.

00:06:14.283 --> 00:06:18.487
It's not just about seeing or hearing,
it's about feeling, experiencing, sharing.

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.710
And despite these languages
that we've covered,

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.348
I really don't think we've covered

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:23.966
one of the most profound
languages,

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:25.927
and that's the language of experience.

00:06:26.157 --> 00:06:28.204
That's why when you're
talking with someone,

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:31.847
if they've shared something you've shared,
you don't need to explain it much.
