Eeny, meeny, miny, mo,
pay one off, let the other one go,

00:08:33.938 --> 00:08:38.185
which means, "I might not have enough
to pay both at the current moment."

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.739
You've got to be resourceful.
You've got to figure it out.

00:08:41.763 --> 00:08:45.535
And if you're standing, you know
the language of barely making ends meet,

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:47.131
of financial struggle.

00:08:47.806 --> 00:08:51.137
And if you've been lucky enough
to speak that language,

00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:55.463
you understand that there is
no motivator of greatness like deficiency.

00:08:55.487 --> 00:09:00.053
Not having resources,
not having looks, not having finances
