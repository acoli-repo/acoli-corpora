00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.881
Cosmologists have plenty of ideas
about how this happened.

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:35.589
But we can also probe
the origins of the universe

00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:40.662
by recreating the hot, dense conditions
that existed at the beginning of time

00:01:40.686 --> 00:01:42.071
in the laboratory.

00:01:42.718 --> 00:01:45.451
This is done by particle physicists.

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:47.986
Over the past century,

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.161
particle physicists have been studying

00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:53.198
matter and forces
at higher and higher energies.

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:55.583
Firstly with cosmic rays,

00:01:55.607 --> 00:01:57.838
and then with particle accelerators,

00:01:57.862 --> 00:02:01.966
machines that smash together
subatomic particles at great energies.
