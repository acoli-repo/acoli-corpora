00:01:57.862 --> 00:02:01.966
machines that smash together
subatomic particles at great energies.

00:02:02.408 --> 00:02:04.510
The greater the energy of the accelerator,

00:02:04.534 --> 00:02:07.735
the further back in time
they can effectively peek.

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:10.851
Today, things are largely
made up of atoms,

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:13.354
but hundreds of seconds
after the Big Bang,

00:02:13.378 --> 00:02:17.314
it was too hot for electrons to join
atomic nuclei to make atoms.

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:22.348
Instead, the universe consisted
of a swirling sea of subatomic matter.

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:24.901
A few seconds after the Big Bang,

00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:26.185
it was hotter still,

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.104
hot enough to overpower the forces

00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:30.804
that usually hold protons
and neutrons together
