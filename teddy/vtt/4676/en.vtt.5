00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:30.804
that usually hold protons
and neutrons together

00:02:30.828 --> 00:02:32.093
in atomic nuclei.

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:35.608
Further back, microseconds
after the Big Bang,

00:02:35.632 --> 00:02:37.038
and the protons and neutrons

00:02:37.062 --> 00:02:39.794
were only just beginning
to form from quarks,

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:41.788
one of the fundamental building blocks

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:44.480
of the standard model of particle physics.

00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:46.002
Further back still,

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:49.238
and the energy was too great
even for the quarks to stick together.

00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:53.032
Physicists hope that by going
to even greater energies,

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:57.563
they can see back to a time
when all the forces were one and the same,

00:02:57.587 --> 00:02:59.016
which would make understanding

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.271
the origins of the universe a lot easier.
