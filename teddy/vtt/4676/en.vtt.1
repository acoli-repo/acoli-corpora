00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.109
but on the whole,
scholars agree that its existence

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.208
is probably a good thing.

00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:38.607
Such a good thing that
an entire field of scientific endeavor

00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:40.052
is devoted to its study.

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:43.253
This is known as cosmology.

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:46.214
Cosmologists look
at what's out there in space

00:00:46.238 --> 00:00:50.263
and piece together the tale
of how our universe evolved:

00:00:50.287 --> 00:00:51.524
what it's doing now,

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:53.179
what it's going to be doing,

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:55.730
and how it all began in the first place.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:01:00.323
It was Edwin Hubble who first noticed
that our universe is expanding,
