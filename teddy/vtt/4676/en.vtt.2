It was Edwin Hubble who first noticed
that our universe is expanding,

00:01:00.347 --> 00:01:04.464
by noting that galaxies seem to be flying
further and further apart.

00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:07.224
This implied that everything
should have started

00:01:07.248 --> 00:01:08.868
with the monumental explosion

00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:10.462
of an infinitely hot,

00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:12.071
infinitely small point.

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:15.369
This idea was jokingly
referred to at the time

00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:17.304
as the "Big Bang,"

00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:18.842
but as the evidence piled up,

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:22.705
the notion and the name actually stuck.

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.394
We know that after the Big Bang,

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:25.688
the universe cooled down

00:01:25.712 --> 00:01:28.647
to form the stars and galaxies
that we see today.

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.881
Cosmologists have plenty of ideas
about how this happened.
