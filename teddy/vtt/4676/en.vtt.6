To do that, they'll not only need
to build bigger colliders,

00:03:05.094 --> 00:03:07.488
but also work hard
to combine our knowledge

00:03:07.512 --> 00:03:09.169
of the very, very big

00:03:09.193 --> 00:03:11.618
with the very, very small

00:03:11.642 --> 00:03:14.238
and share these fascinating
insights with each other

00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:16.083
and with, well, you.

00:03:16.707 --> 00:03:18.579
And that's how it should be!

00:03:18.603 --> 00:03:22.234
Because, after all,
when it comes to our universe,

00:03:22.258 --> 00:03:24.350
we're all in this one together.
