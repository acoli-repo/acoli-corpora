00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.996
by repositioning your weight.

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:33.106
Above you is the wave’s crest,

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:37.326
where the water particles are undergoing
their greatest acceleration.

00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:41.155
That forces them to move faster 
than the underlying wave,

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:45.225
so they shoot ahead before falling under
gravity’s influence.

00:02:45.225 --> 00:02:49.181
This forms the waves’ characteristic
curls, or jets,

00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:51.201
as they break along the shore.

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:55.451
Sometimes, the curl might completely 
enclose part of the wave,

00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:59.441
forming a moving tube of water 
known as the barrel.

00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:03.491
Because of irregularities in the seafloor 
and the swell itself,
