00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:31.735
in certain locations like Nazare, Portugal
or Mavericks, California

00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:35.884
refract the incoming wave energy 
into a single spot,

00:03:35.884 --> 00:03:40.074
creating massive waves 
sought by surfers worldwide.

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:43.502
And some of these waves travel 
for more than a week,

00:03:43.502 --> 00:03:48.572
with swells originating more than 10,000 
kilometers away from shore.

00:03:48.572 --> 00:03:50.925
Waves surfed in sunny California

00:03:50.925 --> 00:03:55.495
may have originated in the stormy 
seas near New Zealand.

00:03:55.495 --> 00:03:59.365
So while you may not be thinking about 
weather patterns in the South Pacific,

00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:02.595
tectonic geology, or fluid mechanics,
