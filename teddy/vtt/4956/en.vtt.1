00:00:27.743 --> 00:00:31.323
equal to the weight of the 
displaced water pushes up,

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:34.223
counteracting you and your board’s weight.

00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:38.113
This lets you stay afloat while 
you wait to paddle for a wave.

00:00:38.113 --> 00:00:40.333
And what exactly are you waiting for?

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.293
The perfect wave, of course.

00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:49.383
Like other waves in physics, ocean waves
represent a transfer of energy.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:54.283
Wind blowing across the ocean accelerates 
water particles near the surface,

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:58.111
leading to the growth of ripples 
that become waves.

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:02.651
These deviations from the flat surface 
are acted upon by gravity,
