00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:01.224
Your board forms an angle with the water,

00:02:01.224 --> 00:02:05.024
and this creates a dynamic pressure 
on the bottom of it,

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.764
forcing you and your board 
out of the water,

00:02:07.764 --> 00:02:09.944
to skim along the surface.

00:02:09.944 --> 00:02:11.144
At the same time,

00:02:11.144 --> 00:02:15.144
your increased forward momentum 
makes you more stable,

00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:19.144
allowing you to stand up 
and surf along the wave.

00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:20.574
Now you’ve caught the wave,

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:24.814
and are riding along its front 
face parallel to the shoreline.

00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:29.115
Fins on the surfboard allow you to alter 
your speed and direction

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.996
by repositioning your weight.
