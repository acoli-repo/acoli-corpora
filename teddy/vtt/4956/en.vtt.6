00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:03.491
Because of irregularities in the seafloor 
and the swell itself,

00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:09.641
few barrels last as long as the legendary 
27-second ride off the coast of Namibia.

00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:11.971
But many who manage to get barreled

00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:15.981
have said they feel time 
passing differently inside,

00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:20.320
making it one of the most magical 
experiences a surfer can have.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.065
Of course,

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:23.655
not all beaches are created equal.

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:27.255
Offshore underwater canyons or rock
formations

00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:31.735
in certain locations like Nazare, Portugal
or Mavericks, California
