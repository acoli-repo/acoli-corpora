00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:02.651
These deviations from the flat surface 
are acted upon by gravity,

00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:08.446
which tries to restore the surface 
to its original flat state.

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:10.692
As the waves then move through the water,

00:01:10.692 --> 00:01:16.022
particles push and pull on their neighbors
through the wave induced pressure,

00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:22.152
and this motion propagates energy through 
the water in unison with the wave motion.

00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:23.714
The motion of these particles

00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:27.474
is much more limited than the 
overall motion of the waves.

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:28.514
Near the shore,

00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:32.254
the shallower seafloor constrains 
the motion of the waves
