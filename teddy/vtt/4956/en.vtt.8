tectonic geology, or fluid mechanics,

00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:08.015
the art of catching the perfect wave 
relies on all these things and more.

00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:10.791
And the waves we surf, created by wind,

00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:15.641
are just one visible part of the 
continuous oscillation of energy

00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:19.610
that has shaped our universe 
since its very beginning.
