00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:32.254
the shallower seafloor constrains 
the motion of the waves

00:01:32.254 --> 00:01:35.774
to occur in a more limited region 
than out at sea,

00:01:35.774 --> 00:01:38.664
concentrating the wave energy 
near the surface.

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:42.054
If the topography of the shoreline 
is even and smooth,

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:44.994
this will refract the waves 
to become more

00:01:44.994 --> 00:01:48.054
parallel to the shore as they approach.

00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:50.334
This is the crucial moment.

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:51.744
As the wave gets near,

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:55.524
you quickly pivot your board 
in the same direction as the wave

00:01:55.524 --> 00:01:58.474
and paddle to match its speed.

00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:01.224
Your board forms an angle with the water,
