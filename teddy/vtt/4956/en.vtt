Whether or not you realize it,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.560
as a surfer you’re a master 
of complicated physics.

00:00:15.563 --> 00:00:17.273
The science of surfing begins


00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:21.033
as soon as you and your board 
first hit the water.

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:25.663
The board’s size and light construction 
help it displace a lot of water.

00:00:25.663 --> 00:00:27.743
In turn, a buoyant force

00:00:27.743 --> 00:00:31.323
equal to the weight of the 
displaced water pushes up,
