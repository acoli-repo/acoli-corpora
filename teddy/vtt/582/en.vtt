00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:03.858
So this is the first time
I've told this story in public,

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:05.793
the personal aspects of it.

00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:12.133
Yogi Berra was a world-famous
baseball player who said,

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:14.479
"If you come to a fork
in the road, take it."

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.568
Researchers had been,
for more than a century,

00:00:18.592 --> 00:00:21.334
studying the immune system
as a way to fight cancer,

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:25.942
and cancer vaccines have,
unfortunately, been disappointing.

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.776
They've only worked in cancers
caused by viruses,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.017
like cervical cancer or liver cancer.
