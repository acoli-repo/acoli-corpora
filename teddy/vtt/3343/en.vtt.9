00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.976
but I felt to be one step ahead
of everyone for employment,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.216
I needed to have
an advanced university degree,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.656
so I went ahead and got that.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.576
Now I'm ready for my interview.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.456
Remember your first interview?
What am I going to wear?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.696
What questions?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.520
And don't forget that firm handshake.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.776
I was right there with you.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.816
So 24 hours before my interview,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.376
a friend of mine
who I've known all my life

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.696
called and said, "Michele,
the building you're going in has steps."

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.896
And she knew I couldn't climb steps.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.776
So suddenly, my focus changed.
