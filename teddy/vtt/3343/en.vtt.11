00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.296
airports, hallways, parking lots,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.520
loading docks.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.096
And so I have to be very careful.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.056
I have to anticipate and be flexible

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.400
and move as quickly as I can sometimes.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.696
So I got the job,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.776
and in my current role
I travel quite a bit.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.680
And travel is a challenge
for all of us these days.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.616
And so you probably get to the airport,
run through security, get to the gate.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.320
Did I get my aisle seat or my window seat?
Did I get my upgrade?
