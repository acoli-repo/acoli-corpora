I do not believe you can
walk in someone else's shoes,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.696
and because of that, we must adopt
a new way of giving of ourselves.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.616
Simply stated, I will never know
what it's like to be you

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.456
and you will never know
what it's like to be me.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.256
I cannot face your fears
or chase your dreams,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.136
and you can't do that for me,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.680
but we can be supportive of each other.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.976
Instead of trying to walk
in each other's shoes,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.240
we must adopt a new way
of giving of ourselves.
