00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.296
I learned at an early age

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.176
that I did have to do some things
different than most people,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.656
but I also learned there were things
I was on equal footing with,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.816
and one of those was the classroom.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.800
Heh, heh, heh. I was equal.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.896
As a matter of fact,
I excelled in the classroom.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.495
This was vitally important,
I discovered as I grew older

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.816
and realized I wasn't going to be able
to do a physical job.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.680
I needed an education.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.176
So I went on and got a university degree,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.976
but I felt to be one step ahead
of everyone for employment,
