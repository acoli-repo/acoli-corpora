00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.320
Did I get my aisle seat or my window seat?
Did I get my upgrade?

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.376
Me, first of all,
I don't run through anything.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.576
(Laughter)

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.656

and I can drive it down
to the door of the plane."

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.016
