00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.136
Our perspective changed
for both of us that day.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.576
And once I got on the flight,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.536
he patted me on the back
and wished me well,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.776
and I thanked him so much.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.256
And again, I think he's going
to remember that experience more

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.840
than when I first came in,
and there was a bit of hesitation.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.856
And as you notice, I get a lot of help.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.816
I would not be where I am today

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.176
if it was not for my family,
my friends, my colleagues

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.896
and the many strangers

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.200
that help me every single day of my life.
