Short, white, blond woman in a chair.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.880
That doesn't probably happen every day.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.936
So I go up, and with my gift of gab,
I start to talk to the agent.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.376
So friendly, and I ask
about their culture and so forth,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.216
and I notice there wasn't a jet bridge.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.176
So I had to kind of say,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.256
"Not only do you have to lift my chair,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.520
I could use some help
getting up the steps."

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.776
So we got to spend about an hour together
while we waited for the flight,

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.656
and it was the most magnificent hour.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.136
Our perspective changed
for both of us that day.
