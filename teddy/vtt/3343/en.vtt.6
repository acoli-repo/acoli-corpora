You can't tell if someone's dealing
with a mental illness,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.256
or they're struggling
with their gender identity,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.816
they're caring for an aging parent,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.576
they're having financial difficulty.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.520
You can't see that kind of stuff.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.376
So while you can see

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.216
one of my challenges is my size,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.576
seeing does not mean you understand

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.416
what it's truly to be me on a daily basis,
or what I go through.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.896
And so I'm here to debunk a myth.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.056
I do not believe you can
walk in someone else's shoes,
