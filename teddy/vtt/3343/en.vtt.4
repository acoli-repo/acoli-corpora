00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.176
And at the end of the morning,
before I went home,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.136
the teacher had us in a circle,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.856
and I actually found myself
outside of the circle.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.216
I couldn't look at anybody.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.880
I could not understand what just happened.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.936
And over the next few years,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.056
I hated to go out in public.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.976
I felt every stare, every giggle,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.656
every pointed finger,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.096
not the finger,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.056
but every pointed finger,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.336
and I hated it.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.280
I would hide behind my parents' legs
like nobody could see me.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.576
And as a child,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.936
you can't understand
another child's curiosity,
