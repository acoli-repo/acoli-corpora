It's a really vital
and interconnected system,

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:05.043
and some people could see
how they were a part of it,

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:08.982
and so they acted
as habitat fragment gardeners.

00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:11.386
They planted native plants in their yards,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.737
and they even were tending
to the land in corporate parks

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.223
and in public canyons.

00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:19.133
In my research, I could
actually see the impact

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.847
that even one passionate
gardener could make.

00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:24.174
And then, repeated across the region,

00:03:24.198 --> 00:03:29.034
their habitat fragments were adding up
to make a more resilient ecosystem --

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:32.263
not a perfect system, not by a long shot,
