00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.558
we're filling gaps,

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:03.733
strengthening the systems
that we're all a part of.

00:09:04.182 --> 00:09:07.427
We have to work on
the big institutions too, of course.

00:09:07.451 --> 00:09:09.025
It's just that they're so slow,

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.836
and we're living in the midst
of rapid change.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.366
It's a defining feature of our time.

00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:17.712
So maybe in some cases our small actions

00:09:17.736 --> 00:09:20.494
can be Band-Aids
until the big guys catch up.

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:24.185
But without us, what are they going
to be catching up to?

00:09:25.342 --> 00:09:28.201
Am I still scared about the world?

00:09:28.225 --> 00:09:30.485
Yes. (Laughs)
