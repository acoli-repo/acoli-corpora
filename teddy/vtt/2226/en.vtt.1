like every ecosystem on Earth

00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:33.742

would keep me up at night.

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:44.896
And then outside of work,

our huge social structures

00:00:47.272 --> 00:00:51.109

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.226

So I felt like the world was just trapped
in this huge self-amplifying system
