WEBVTT

00:05:28.867 --> 00:05:31.368
So we set out to create
a distributed network

00:05:31.392 --> 00:05:33.561
of museum habitat fragments.

00:05:34.295 --> 00:05:36.745
Working from a donated shipping container

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:39.945
with the volunteer help of our friends

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.868
and dozens of very generous scientists

00:05:41.892 --> 00:05:43.706
from all across the globe,

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.464
we built our first prototype:

00:05:46.488 --> 00:05:48.440
the Smallest Mollusk Museum.

00:05:48.464 --> 00:05:50.183
(Laughter)

00:05:50.207 --> 00:05:54.207
Mollusks are these tentacled,
slimy shape-shifters

00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:57.427
like oysters and octopuses
and the giant squid,

00:05:57.451 --> 00:06:00.793
and if you've ever seen
an alien in a movie,
