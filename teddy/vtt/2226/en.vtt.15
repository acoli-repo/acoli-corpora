00:07:28.318 --> 00:07:33.156
we became the Bronx's first
and only science museum.

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:37.207
Yeah, that's really weird. (Laughs)

00:07:37.231 --> 00:07:38.324
(Laughter)

00:07:38.348 --> 00:07:40.143
And really quickly,

00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:42.924
families started coming by with their kids

00:07:42.948 --> 00:07:45.748
and schools started arranging field trips,

00:07:45.772 --> 00:07:50.280
all to this tiny museum in the front lobby
of the public hospital.

00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:51.851
(Laughter)

00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:53.765
And the museum became so popular

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:57.794
that we started hiring local students
to be museum docents,

00:07:57.818 --> 00:08:01.888
so they could lead tours and activities
for all the talented kids.
