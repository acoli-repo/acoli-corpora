00:05:57.451 --> 00:06:00.793
and if you've ever seen
an alien in a movie,

00:06:00.817 --> 00:06:03.499
then I'll bet you
it was inspired by a mollusk.

00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:06.152
Their slimy sci-fi vibes

00:06:06.176 --> 00:06:09.541
make them really fun tour guides
for a biology museum,

00:06:09.565 --> 00:06:12.400
and they can teach us
about the systems that we all share,

00:06:12.424 --> 00:06:14.032
with a wake-up call.

00:06:14.467 --> 00:06:18.596
Of all the animal extinctions
documented since the 1500s,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.765
more than 40 percent have been
our friends, the mollusks.

00:06:24.302 --> 00:06:26.958
So we tested this museum across the city

00:06:26.982 --> 00:06:29.561
to see if it resonated
with all kinds of visitors,

00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:30.845
and it did.
