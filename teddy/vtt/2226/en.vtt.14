00:06:59.203 --> 00:07:02.035
into habitat fragments
for social learning.

00:07:02.553 --> 00:07:06.874
And, fittingly, we named
our fleet of museums "MICRO."

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:10.536
Even though each
habitat fragment is small,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.878
it provides the essentials.

00:07:11.902 --> 00:07:15.226
It draws people in
so that they can explore

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.702
and learn together in a social way.

00:07:17.726 --> 00:07:19.972
And then, distributed
across the landscape,

00:07:19.996 --> 00:07:21.822
we're able to invite people everywhere

00:07:21.846 --> 00:07:24.097
into conversations around science.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.294
When we partnered with
a public hospital in the South Bronx,

00:07:28.318 --> 00:07:33.156
we became the Bronx's first
and only science museum.
