00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:01.272
And in a neighborhood

00:04:01.296 --> 00:04:04.951
with some of the lowest high school
graduation rates in the city,

00:04:04.975 --> 00:04:08.260
this waiting room felt like
a social habitat fragment

00:04:08.284 --> 00:04:09.943
just waiting to happen.

00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:14.371
So, we did some research to see
what kinds of resources could we add

00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:15.831
to spaces like this one

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.719
that would make an impact.

00:04:17.743 --> 00:04:20.385
And we settled on museums.

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.866
Museums are the most trusted source
of public information,

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.400
more than the media
and more than the government,

00:04:27.424 --> 00:04:30.517
but they also cluster
in wealthier neighborhoods.
