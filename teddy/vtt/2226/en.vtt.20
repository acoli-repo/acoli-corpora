00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:01.574
and the ways that they interact
determine everything.

00:10:02.225 --> 00:10:04.966
Step two: look for the resource gaps,

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.790
because that's where you
can make the biggest difference.

00:10:08.437 --> 00:10:13.395
And do some research to understand
how your ideas are going to interact

00:10:13.419 --> 00:10:15.774
with the systems that are
already on the ground.

00:10:16.327 --> 00:10:19.764
Step three: find the other
habitat fragments.

00:10:19.788 --> 00:10:23.272
Find out how they can support you
and how you can support them,

00:10:23.296 --> 00:10:25.617
because we're building a network together.

00:10:26.387 --> 00:10:30.255
And step four: transform your fragment.
