00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.810
to see how they were doing in the midst
of their own environmental crisis

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:33.366
in Southern California.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.940
And from the macro view,
I saw 22-lane freeways,

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:39.811
endless suburban sprawl

00:01:39.835 --> 00:01:43.325
and water being diverted
from parched rivers

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.871
to grow lawns in the desert.

00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:48.980
It was pretty grim.

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:51.465
But on the ground,

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:54.690
there were actually some small
opportunities for optimism,

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.511
these tiny patches of resources

00:01:56.535 --> 00:01:58.762
known as "habitat fragments."

00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:03.853
If the right kinds of plants were growing
along the edges of a Costco parking lot,
