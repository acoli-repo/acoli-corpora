WEBVTT

00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:30.845
and it did.

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:33.958
People really liked learning from it.

00:06:33.982 --> 00:06:37.788
So we built a fleet
of tiny science museums,

00:06:37.812 --> 00:06:41.801
each one small enough to fit
into preexisting locations

00:06:41.825 --> 00:06:44.969
with information dense enough
that they could still pack a punch.

00:06:44.993 --> 00:06:47.291
And they're modular,
so they can be distributed

00:06:47.315 --> 00:06:49.779
at a scale that can reach everyone.

00:06:49.803 --> 00:06:52.228
And then we partnered with libraries

00:06:52.252 --> 00:06:54.508
and community centers and transit hubs

00:06:54.532 --> 00:06:56.316
and the public hospitals

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.179
so that we could transform
their in-between spaces

00:06:59.203 --> 00:07:02.035
into habitat fragments
for social learning.
