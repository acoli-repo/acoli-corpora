00:04:56.706 --> 00:05:00.909
almost 90 percent of visitors
to art museums are white,

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:04.438
and even at the Smithsonian's
network of free museums,

00:05:04.462 --> 00:05:07.860
almost half of their adult visitors
have graduate degrees,

00:05:07.884 --> 00:05:11.515
which, like, 10 percent
of the broader population has.

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.287
So it became clear to us

00:05:13.311 --> 00:05:19.253
that even though museums are these amazing
educational and social resources,

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.243
they're not reaching everyone.

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:24.931
And a lot of museums are aware of this,
and they're trying to change it,

00:05:24.955 --> 00:05:28.843
but there's all these structural hurdles
that are slowing them down.

00:05:28.867 --> 00:05:31.368
So we set out to create
a distributed network
