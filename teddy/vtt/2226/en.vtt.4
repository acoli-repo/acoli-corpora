00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:03.853
If the right kinds of plants were growing
along the edges of a Costco parking lot,

00:02:03.877 --> 00:02:05.731
and if in the neighborhoods nearby

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:08.050
there were native plants
in people's gardens,

00:02:08.074 --> 00:02:12.194
and in the canyons that were too steep
for people to put their suburbs in,

00:02:12.218 --> 00:02:14.747
there were native plants
instead of grasses

00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:17.117
then all of these in-between spaces

00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:21.823
would actually add up to create
a network of habitat fragments.

00:02:21.847 --> 00:02:26.572
And this network meant that the bees
could traverse through the concrete desert

00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:29.488
feeding from and pollinating
the native plants.
