00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.316
So I felt like the world was just trapped
in this huge self-amplifying system

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.213
that was just spiraling
towards destruction.

00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:06.732
And of course I wanted
to do something about this,

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:10.319
and I felt so small and utterly powerless.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.165
But I started to feel a little differently
as my perspective shifted

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.349
from the macro towards the micro.

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:20.947
It began with bumblebees.

00:01:21.463 --> 00:01:24.509
I was using satellite imagery
and field research

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:28.226
to study these amazing, cute pollinators

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.810
to see how they were doing in the midst
of their own environmental crisis
