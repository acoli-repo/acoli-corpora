[How to Deal with Difficult Feelings]

00:00:07.063 --> 00:00:10.097
[What's the difference
between shame and guilt?]

00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:16.197
These are emotions
that we often use interchangeably,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.230
but it turns out they're quite different.

00:00:18.263 --> 00:00:21.763
So when people feel shame,
they feel bad about themselves:

00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:25.230
"I'm a bad person for having done this."

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.597
When people feel guilt, they feel bad
not about the self,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.663
but about a specific behavior:
"I did a bad thing."
