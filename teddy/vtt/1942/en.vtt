Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it's something we just kind of learned for this,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?
