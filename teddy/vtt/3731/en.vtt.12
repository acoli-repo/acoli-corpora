Some, they will have been able to prevent,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.554
but others, it will have been
beyond their control.

00:06:04.252 --> 00:06:07.897
Does that make their contribution
futile and meaningless?

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:11.880
Actually, it's offensive
even to suggest that.

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:14.707
What they are doing is caring
for their fellow human beings

00:06:14.731 --> 00:06:17.458
at their moment of greatest vulnerability.

00:06:17.482 --> 00:06:19.996
And that work has huge meaning,

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.879
to the point where I only
have to show you those pictures

00:06:22.903 --> 00:06:24.059
for it to become evident

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:27.730
that the courage and humanity
those people are demonstrating

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:30.862
makes their work
some of the most meaningful things
