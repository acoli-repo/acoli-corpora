00:11:26.178 --> 00:11:31.078
Those challenging, difficult,
pessimistic meetings transformed

00:11:31.102 --> 00:11:34.985
as more and more people decided
that this was our moment to dig in

00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:37.817
and determine that we would not
drop the ball on our watch,

00:11:37.841 --> 00:11:40.707
and we would deliver the outcome
that we knew was possible.

00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:43.825
More and more people transformed
themselves to that perspective

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:45.102
and began to work,

00:11:45.126 --> 00:11:48.728
and in the end, that worked its way
up into a wave of momentum

00:11:48.752 --> 00:11:50.355
that crashed over us

00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:52.593
and delivered many
of those challenging issues

00:11:52.617 --> 00:11:55.380
with a better outcome
than we could possibly have imagined.

00:11:55.404 --> 00:11:59.633
And even now, years later and with
a climate denier in the White House,

00:11:59.657 --> 00:12:03.388
much that was put in motion
in those days is still unfolding,
