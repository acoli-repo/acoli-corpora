00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:30.047
But I particularly love it
because as I looked at it,

00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:33.465
I realized that it was
a political instruction,

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.613
and that if we were going
to be successful,

00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:37.457
this was how we were going to do it.

00:02:38.112 --> 00:02:39.563
So let me explain that.

00:02:40.714 --> 00:02:44.660
What I'd been feeling in those meetings
was actually about control.

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:49.564
I had moved my life from Brooklyn
in New York to Bonn in Germany

00:02:49.588 --> 00:02:52.507
with the extremely reluctant
support of my wife.

00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:55.934
My children were now in a school
where they couldn't speak the language,

00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.720
and I thought the deal
for all this disruption to my world

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:02.355
was that I would have some degree
of control over what was going to happen.
