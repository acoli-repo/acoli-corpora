WEBVTT

00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:33.382
was a process that seemed to move
at the speed of a glacier,

00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:36.153
at the speed that a glacier
used to move at.

00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:39.421
Now, in the middle
of one of these long meetings,

00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:40.803
I was handed a note.

00:01:40.827 --> 00:01:44.269
And it was handed to me
by my friend and colleague and coauthor,

00:01:44.293 --> 00:01:45.843
Christiana Figueres.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.003
Christiana was the Executive Secretary

00:01:49.027 --> 00:01:52.185
of the UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change,

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.758
and as such, had overall responsibility

00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:58.400
for the UN reaching what would become
the Paris Agreement.

00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:00.944
I was running political strategy for her.
