00:10:25.786 --> 00:10:30.018
This coupling of a deep and determined
stubborn optimism with action,

00:10:30.042 --> 00:10:32.519
when the optimism leads
to a determined action,

We saw it when Rosa Parks
refused to get up from the bus.

00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:54.030
We saw it in Gandhi's
long salt marches to the beach.

00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:58.597
We saw it when the suffragettes said that
"Courage calls to courage everywhere."

00:10:58.621 --> 00:11:01.505
And we saw it when Kennedy said
that within 10 years,
