I never thought that I would be giving 
my TED Talk somewhere like this.

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:07.806
But, like half of humanity,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.780
I've spent the last
four weeks under lockdown

00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:14.394
due to the global pandemic
created by COVID-19.

00:00:15.113 --> 00:00:17.722
I am extremely fortunate
that during this time

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:22.035
I've been able to come here to these woods
near my home in southern England.

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:24.863
These woods have always inspired me,

00:00:24.887 --> 00:00:29.774
and as humanity now tries to think about
how we can find the inspiration

00:00:29.798 --> 00:00:32.124
to retake control of our actions
