00:08:58.026 --> 00:09:00.930

trepidation and nervousness and fear,

00:09:04.706 --> 00:09:07.052
there came a calm resolve,

an island alone,

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.373
a greatest hour,

00:09:10.397 --> 00:09:12.952
a greatest generation,

00:09:12.976 --> 00:09:15.972

That change from fear and trepidation

00:09:23.057 --> 00:09:26.479
to facing the reality, whatever
it was and however dark it was,

00:09:26.503 --> 00:09:29.794
had nothing to do with the likelihood
of winning the war.

00:09:29.818 --> 00:09:32.806
There was no news from the front
that battles were going better
