00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:02.355
was that I would have some degree
of control over what was going to happen.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.152
I felt for years that the climate crisis
is the defining challenge

00:03:06.176 --> 00:03:07.411
of our generation,

00:03:07.435 --> 00:03:11.802
and here I was, ready to play my part
and do something for humanity.

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:14.796
But I put my hands on the levers
of control that I'd been given

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.971
and pulled them,

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.147
and nothing happened.

00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:21.246
I realized the things I could control
were menial day-to-day things.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.228
"Do I ride my bike to work?"
and "Where do I have lunch?",

00:03:24.252 --> 00:03:26.510
whereas the things
that were going to determine

00:03:26.534 --> 00:03:28.403
whether we were going to be successful

00:03:28.427 --> 00:03:31.492
were issues like, "Will Russia
wreck the negotiations?"
