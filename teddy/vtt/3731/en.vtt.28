00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.476
We can all decide that we will be
hopeful beacons for humanity

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.773
even if there are dark days ahead,

00:14:03.797 --> 00:14:06.127
and we can decide
that we will be responsible,

00:14:06.151 --> 00:14:08.845
we will reduce our own emissions
by at least 50 percent

00:14:08.869 --> 00:14:10.315
in the next 10 years,

00:14:10.339 --> 00:14:14.609
and we will take action to engage
with governments and corporations

00:14:14.633 --> 00:14:17.822
to ensure they do what is necessary
coming out of the pandemic

00:14:17.846 --> 00:14:20.375
to rebuild the world that we want them to.

00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:23.779
Right now, all of these
things are possible.

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:28.342
So let's go back
to that boring meeting room

00:14:28.366 --> 00:14:30.818
where I'm looking at that note
from Christiana.
