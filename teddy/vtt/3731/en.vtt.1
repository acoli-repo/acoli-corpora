00:00:29.798 --> 00:00:32.124
to retake control of our actions

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:34.782
so that terrible things
don't come down the road

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:37.440
without us taking action to avert them,

00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:40.347
I thought this is a good place
for us to talk.

00:00:40.914 --> 00:00:44.285
And I'd like to begin
that story six years ago,

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.278
when I had first joined
the United Nations.

00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:52.281
Now, I firmly believe
that the UN is of unparalleled importance

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:53.856
in the world right now

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.457
to promote collaboration and cooperation.

00:00:57.278 --> 00:00:59.325
But what they don't tell you when you join

00:00:59.349 --> 00:01:01.873
is that this essential work is delivered
