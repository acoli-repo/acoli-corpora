00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:02.869
I'd spent many of my most
formative years as a Buddhist monk

00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:04.542
in my early 20s,

00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:08.533
but I left the monastic life,
because even then, 20 years ago,

00:04:08.557 --> 00:04:13.512
I felt that the climate crisis was already
a quickly unfolding emergency

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:15.231
and I wanted to do my part.

00:04:15.774 --> 00:04:17.786
But once I'd left
and I rejoined the world,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.539

It was the few tons of my own emissions
and that of my immediate family,

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:26.305
which political party
I voted for every few years,

00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:28.168
whether I went on a march or two.

00:04:28.192 --> 00:04:31.265
And then I looked at the issues
that would determine the outcome,
