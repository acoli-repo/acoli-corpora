but by the day-to-day satisfaction
of caring for another human being

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:08.413

With the climate crisis,
we have this huge separation.

00:07:11.363 --> 00:07:13.964
It used to be that we were

00:07:13.988 --> 00:07:17.798

Countries are going underwater.

00:07:25.285 --> 00:07:29.358
Hundreds of thousands of people are
on the move as a result of climate change.

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:32.790
But even if those impacts are no longer
separated from us by time,
