00:04:28.192 --> 00:04:31.265
And then I looked at the issues
that would determine the outcome,

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.348
and they were big
geopolitical negotiations,

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:35.563
massive infrastructure spending plans,

00:04:35.587 --> 00:04:37.115
what everybody else did.

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.379
The differential again felt so huge

00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:41.810
that I couldn't see any way
that I could bridge it.

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:43.461
I kept trying to take action,

00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:45.058
but it didn't really stick.

00:04:45.082 --> 00:04:46.399
It felt futile.

00:04:47.206 --> 00:04:50.660
Now, we know that this can be
a common experience for many people,

00:04:50.684 --> 00:04:53.204
and maybe you have had this experience.

00:04:53.228 --> 00:04:55.270
When faced with an enormous challenge

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:58.580
that we don't feel we have
any agency or control over,

00:04:58.604 --> 00:05:00.784
our mind can do
a little trick to protect us.
