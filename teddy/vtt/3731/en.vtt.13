00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:30.862
makes their work
some of the most meaningful things

00:06:30.886 --> 00:06:33.009
that can be done as human beings,

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:36.034
even though they can't
control the outcome.

00:06:37.155 --> 00:06:38.428
Now, that's interesting,

00:06:38.452 --> 00:06:40.730
because it shows us
that humans are capable

00:06:40.754 --> 00:06:42.941
of taking dedicated and sustained action,

00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:44.948
even when they can't control the outcome.

00:06:45.597 --> 00:06:47.602
But it leaves us with another challenge.

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.259
With the climate crisis,

00:06:50.283 --> 00:06:54.519
the action that we take
is separated from the impact of it,

00:06:54.543 --> 00:06:56.987
whereas what is happening
with these images

00:06:57.011 --> 00:07:02.328
is these nurses are being sustained not
by the lofty goal of changing the world
