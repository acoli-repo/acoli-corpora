00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.500
So there are lots of things
that we're still working on,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.700
but one thing I have learned


00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.937
is that bamboo will treat you well
if you use it right.

00:01:38.907 --> 00:01:40.952
It's actually a wild grass.

00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:43.924
It grows on otherwise unproductive land --

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:47.267
deep ravines, mountainsides.

00:01:47.267 --> 00:01:51.493
It lives off of rainwater,
spring water, sunlight,

00:01:51.493 --> 00:01:56.253
and of the 1,450 species of bamboo
that grow across the world,

00:01:56.253 --> 00:01:58.691
we use just seven of them.

00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:00.119
That's my dad.
