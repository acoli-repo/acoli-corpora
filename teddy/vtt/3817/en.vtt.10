Now, what we're doing,
it's not entirely new.

00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:06.220
From little huts to elaborate bridges
like this one in Java,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.330
bamboo has been in use across
the tropical regions of the world

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.232
for literally tens of thousands of years.

00:05:12.232 --> 00:05:18.290
There are islands and even continents
that were first reached by bamboo rafts.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.823
But until recently,

00:05:20.823 --> 00:05:25.444
it was almost impossible to reliably
protect bamboo from insects,

00:05:25.444 --> 00:05:29.705
and so, just about everything
that was ever built out of bamboo is gone.
