00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.797
The living room overlooks the valley
from the fourth floor.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:36.781
You enter the house by a bridge.

00:00:38.548 --> 00:00:40.405
It can get hot in the tropics,

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:44.170
so we make big curving roofs
to catch the breezes.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.498
But some rooms have tall windows
to keep the air conditioning in

00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:52.970
and the bugs out.

00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:55.233
This room we left open.

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:57.995
We made an air-conditioned, tented bed.

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:02.569
And one client wanted a TV room
in the corner of her living room.
