Unprotected bamboo weathers.

00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:36.371
Untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust.

00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:39.650
And so that's why most people,
especially in Asia,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.546
think that you couldn't be poor enough
or rural enough to actually want

00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:46.146
to live in a bamboo house.

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:47.981
And so we thought,

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.326
what will it take to change their minds,

00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:53.507
to convince people
that bamboo is worth building with,

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:56.340
much less worth aspiring to?

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.428
First, we needed safe treatment solutions.

00:05:59.428 --> 00:06:01.123
Borax is a natural salt.
