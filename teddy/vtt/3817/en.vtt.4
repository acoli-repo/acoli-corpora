00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:00.119
That's my dad.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.220
He's the one who got me
building with bamboo,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.310
and he is standing in a clump

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.327
of Dendrocalamus asper niger
that he planted just seven years ago.

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:11.369
Each year, it sends up
a new generation of shoots.

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:16.143
That shoot, we watched it grow a meter
in three days just last week,

00:02:16.143 --> 00:02:20.756
so we're talking about sustainable
timber in three years.

00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:26.638
Now, we harvest from hundreds
of family-owned clumps.

00:02:26.638 --> 00:02:29.290
Betung, as we call it, it's really long,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.956
up to 18 meters of usable length.
