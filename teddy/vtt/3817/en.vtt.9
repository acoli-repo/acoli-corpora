as well as an updated
fairy mushroom house.

00:04:34.548 --> 00:04:37.938
We're also working on
a little house for export.

00:04:37.938 --> 00:04:41.119
This is a traditional Sumbanese home
that we replicated,

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:44.346
right down to the details and textiles.

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:49.310
A restaurant
with an open-air kitchen.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.320
It looks a lot like a kitchen, right?

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.291
And a bridge that spans
22 meters across a river.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.014
Now, what we're doing,
it's not entirely new.
