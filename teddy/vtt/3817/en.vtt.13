00:06:27.105 --> 00:06:30.530
and designers and engineers,

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.683
and always remember that you are designing

00:06:33.683 --> 00:06:37.451
for curving, tapering, hollow poles.

00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:40.725
No two poles alike, no straight lines,

00:06:40.725 --> 00:06:43.128
no two-by-fours here.

00:06:43.128 --> 00:06:48.109
The tried-and-true, well-crafted formulas
and vocabulary of architecture

00:06:48.109 --> 00:06:49.427
do not apply here.

00:06:49.427 --> 00:06:51.731
We have had to invent our own rules.

00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:56.198
We ask the bamboo what it's good at,
what it wants to become,

00:06:56.198 --> 00:07:00.690
and what it says is: respect it,
design for its strengths,
