00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:06.435
And when my father
built Green School in Bali,

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:09.639
he chose bamboo for all
of the buildings on campus,

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.892
because he saw it as a promise.

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:13.796
It's a promise to the kids.

00:03:13.796 --> 00:03:17.856
It's one sustainable material
that they will not run out of.

00:03:18.547 --> 00:03:22.694
And when I first saw these structures
under construction about six years ago,

00:03:22.694 --> 00:03:26.780
I just thought, this makes perfect sense.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.893
It is growing all around us.

00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:31.283
It's strong. It's elegant.
