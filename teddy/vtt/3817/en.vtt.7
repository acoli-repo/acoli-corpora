It's strong. It's elegant.

00:03:31.283 --> 00:03:33.514
It's earthquake-resistant.

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:37.610
Why hasn't this happened sooner,
and what can we do with it next?

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.637
So along with some of
the original builders of Green School,

00:03:42.637 --> 00:03:44.613
I founded Ibuku.

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:50.271
Ibu means "mother," and ku means "mine,"
so it represents my Mother Earth,

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:55.363
and at Ibuku, we are a team
of artisans, architects and designers,

00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:59.916
and what we're doing together
is creating a new way of building.
