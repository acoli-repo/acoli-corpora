00:06:56.198 --> 00:07:00.690
and what it says is: respect it,
design for its strengths,

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.435
protect it from water,
and to make the most of its curves.

00:07:04.435 --> 00:07:06.336
So we design in real 3D,

00:07:06.336 --> 00:07:08.159
making scale structural models

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:11.258
out of the same material
that we'll later use to build the house.

00:07:11.258 --> 00:07:13.278
And bamboo model-making, it's an art,

00:07:13.278 --> 00:07:16.372
as well as some hardcore engineering.

00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:24.632
So that's the blueprint of the house.

00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:27.042
(Laughter)

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:28.951
And we bring it to site,

00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:31.691
and with tiny rulers,
we measure each pole,
