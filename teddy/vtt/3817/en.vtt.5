00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.956
up to 18 meters of usable length.

00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:33.487
Try getting that truck down the mountain.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:37.133
And it's strong: it has
the tensile strength of steel,

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:39.849
the compressive strength of concrete.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.775
Slam four tons straight down on a pole,

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:45.492
and it can take it.

00:02:45.492 --> 00:02:48.690
Because it's hollow, it's lightweight,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.410
light enough to be lifted
by just a few men,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.130
or, apparently, one woman.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.700
(Laughter) (Applause)
