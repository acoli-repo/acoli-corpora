00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.819
But if what you've got
is skilled craftsmen

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:34.490
and itsy bitsy little splits,

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.672
weave that ceiling together,

00:08:36.672 --> 00:08:39.635
stretch a canvas over it, lacquer it.

00:08:39.635 --> 00:08:42.352
How do you design durable
kitchen countertops

00:08:42.352 --> 00:08:45.904
that do justice to this curving
structure you've just built?

00:08:45.904 --> 00:08:48.737
Slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread,

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:51.106
hand-carve each to fit the other,

00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:53.427
leave the crusts on,

00:08:53.427 --> 00:08:57.677
and what we're doing,
it is almost entirely handmade.

00:08:57.677 --> 00:08:59.813
The structural connections
of our buildings

00:08:59.813 --> 00:09:04.695
are reinforced by steel joints, but we use
a lot of hand-whittled bamboo pins.
