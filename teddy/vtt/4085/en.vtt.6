You can take the most fascinating
organisms in the world,

00:03:03.577 --> 00:03:07.243
like a microbe that literally
breathes uranium,

00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:09.679
and another one that makes rocket fuel,

00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:11.259
mix them up with some ocean mud,

00:03:11.283 --> 00:03:13.480
put them underneath a microscope,

00:03:13.504 --> 00:03:15.315
and they're just little dots.

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:16.770
It's really annoying.

00:03:16.794 --> 00:03:19.285
So we can't use their looks
to tell them apart.

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.469
We have to use DNA, like a fingerprint,

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:23.214
to say who is who.

00:03:23.238 --> 00:03:25.500
And I'll teach you guys
how to do it right now.

00:03:25.524 --> 00:03:29.540
So I made up some data, and I'm going
to show you some data that are not real.

00:03:29.564 --> 00:03:31.747
This is to illustrate
what it would look like
