00:10:28.082 --> 00:10:31.081
when you think about the total amount
of time in the universe.

00:10:31.105 --> 00:10:33.916
But these are not arbitrary limits.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.831
They're dictated by one simple thing,

00:10:36.855 --> 00:10:38.914
and that thing is the Sun.

00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:42.535
Once life figured out how to harness
the energy of the Sun

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:43.721
through photosynthesis,

00:10:43.745 --> 00:10:46.664
we all had to speed up
and get on day and night cycles.

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:50.042
In that way, the Sun gave us
both a reason to be fast

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.673
and the fuel to do it.

00:10:51.697 --> 00:10:54.556
You can view most of life on Earth
like a circulatory system,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.270
and the Sun is our beating heart.

00:10:57.064 --> 00:10:59.897
But the deep subsurface
is like a circulatory system

00:10:59.921 --> 00:11:02.356
that's completely
disconnected from the Sun.
