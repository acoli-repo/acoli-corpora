00:03:29.564 --> 00:03:31.747
This is to illustrate
what it would look like

00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:35.151
if a bunch of species
were not related to each other at all.

00:03:35.722 --> 00:03:38.940
So you can see each species

00:03:38.964 --> 00:03:43.163
has a list of combinations
of A, G, C and T,

00:03:43.187 --> 00:03:44.902
which are the four sub-units of DNA,

00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:48.711
sort of randomly jumbled,
and nothing looks like anything else,

00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:51.346
and these species
are totally unrelated to each other.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.425
But this is what real DNA looks like,

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.900
from a gene that these species
happen to share.

00:03:56.477 --> 00:03:59.465
Everything lines up nearly perfectly.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.909
The chances of getting
so many of those vertical columns
