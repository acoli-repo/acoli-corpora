00:01:57.947 --> 00:02:01.312
good pristine deep subsurface samples

00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:04.149
some really without contamination
from surface microbes.

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:09.446
This drill ship is capable of drilling
thousands of meters underneath the ocean,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.966
and the mud comes up in sequential cores,
one after the other --

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.660
long, long cores that look like this.

00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:19.493
This is being carried by scientists
such as myself who go on these ships,

00:02:19.517 --> 00:02:22.517
and we process the cores on the ships
and then we send them home

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:24.640
to our home laboratories
for further study.

00:02:24.664 --> 00:02:26.141
So when John and his colleagues

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:29.720
got these first precious
deep-sea pristine samples,

00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:31.625
they put them under the microscope,
