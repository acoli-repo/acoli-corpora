To ask a microbe that lives like that
to grow in our petri dishes

00:11:30.404 --> 00:11:35.467
is to ask them to adapt to our frenetic,
Sun-centric, fast way of living,

00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:37.984
and maybe they've got
better things to do than that.

00:11:38.008 --> 00:11:39.317
(Laughter)

00:11:39.341 --> 00:11:43.618
Imagine if we could figure out
how they managed to do this.

00:11:43.642 --> 00:11:46.928
What if it involves some cool,
ultra-stable compounds

00:11:46.952 --> 00:11:49.213
that we could use
to increase the shelf life

00:11:49.237 --> 00:11:51.824
in biomedical or industrial applications?

00:11:51.848 --> 00:11:54.404
Or maybe if we figure out
the mechanism that they use

00:11:54.428 --> 00:11:57.546
to grow so extraordinarily slowly,

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.920
we could mimic it in cancer cells
and slow runaway cell division.
