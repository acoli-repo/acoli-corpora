00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.236
There's no sunlight, there's no oxygen,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.799
and perhaps worst of all,

00:01:32.823 --> 00:01:36.998
there's no fresh food deliveries
for literally millions of years.

00:01:37.022 --> 00:01:38.964
You don't have to have a PhD in biology

00:01:38.988 --> 00:01:41.623
to know that that is a bad place
to go looking for life.

00:01:41.647 --> 00:01:42.654
(Laughter)

00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:45.895
But in 2002, [Steven D'Hondt] had
convinced enough people

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.517
that he was on to something 
that he actually got an expedition

00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:53.073
on this drillship,
called the JOIDES Resolution.

00:01:53.097 --> 00:01:56.177
And he ran it along with
Bo Barker Jørgensen of Denmark.

00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:57.923
And so they were finally able to get

00:01:57.947 --> 00:02:01.312
good pristine deep subsurface samples
