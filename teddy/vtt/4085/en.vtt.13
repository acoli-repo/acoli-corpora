00:06:26.716 --> 00:06:31.428
The next step was to grow
these exotic species in a petri dish

00:06:31.452 --> 00:06:33.622
so that we could
do real experiments on them

00:06:33.646 --> 00:06:35.685
like microbiologists are supposed to do.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.651
But no matter what we fed them,

00:06:37.675 --> 00:06:39.238
they refused to grow.

00:06:39.825 --> 00:06:43.832
Even now, 15 years
and many expeditions later,

00:06:43.856 --> 00:06:49.260
no human has ever gotten a single one
of these exotic deep subsurface microbes

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:50.947
to grow in a petri dish.

00:06:50.971 --> 00:06:52.657
And it's not for lack of trying.

00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:55.161
That may sound disappointing,

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:56.908
but I actually find it exhilarating,

00:06:56.932 --> 00:07:00.503
because it means there are so many
tantalizing unknowns to work on.
