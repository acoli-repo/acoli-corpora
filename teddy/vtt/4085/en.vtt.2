00:00:57.643 --> 00:01:01.243
So in the 1980s, a scientist
named John Parkes, in the UK,

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:03.171
was similarly obsessed,

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:05.792
and he came up with a crazy idea.

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:11.474
He believed that there was a vast,
deep, and living microbial biosphere

00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:13.093
underneath all the world's oceans

00:01:13.117 --> 00:01:15.735
that extends hundreds of meters
into the seafloor,

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:16.910
which is cool,

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:20.076
but the only problem
is that nobody believed him,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.863
and the reason that nobody believed him

00:01:22.887 --> 00:01:27.067
is that ocean sediments
may be the most boring place on Earth.

00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:28.177
(Laughter)

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.236
There's no sunlight, there's no oxygen,
