00:06:56.932 --> 00:07:00.503
because it means there are so many
tantalizing unknowns to work on.

00:07:00.527 --> 00:07:04.114
Like, my colleagues and I got
what we thought was a really great idea.

00:07:04.138 --> 00:07:07.419
We were going to read their genes
like a recipe book,

00:07:07.443 --> 00:07:10.920
find out what it was they wanted to eat
and put it in their petri dishes,

00:07:10.944 --> 00:07:12.855
and then they would grow and be happy.

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:14.530
But when we looked at their genes,

00:07:14.554 --> 00:07:18.622
it turns out that what they wanted to eat
was the food we were already feeding them.

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.256
So that was a total wash.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.257
There was something else
that they wanted in their petri dishes

00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:25.097
that we were just not giving them.

00:07:26.248 --> 00:07:29.954
So by combining measurements
from many different places

00:07:29.978 --> 00:07:31.136
around the world,
