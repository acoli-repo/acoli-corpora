00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:30.321
All they have to do is exist.

00:09:30.807 --> 00:09:34.817
Maybe that thing that we were missing
in our petri dishes

00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:36.562
was not food at all.

00:09:36.586 --> 00:09:38.064
Maybe it wasn't a chemical.

00:09:38.088 --> 00:09:39.914
Maybe the thing that they really want,

00:09:39.938 --> 00:09:42.770
the nutrient that they want, is time.

00:09:44.095 --> 00:09:47.671
But time is the one thing
that I'll never be able to give them.

00:09:47.695 --> 00:09:50.909
So even if I have a cell culture
that I pass to my PhD students,

00:09:50.933 --> 00:09:53.424
who pass it to their
PhD students, and so on,

00:09:53.448 --> 00:09:56.016
we'd have to do that
for thousands of years

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.271
in order to mimic the exact conditions
of the deep subsurface,

00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:01.614
all without growing any contaminants.
