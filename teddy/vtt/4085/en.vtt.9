00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:33.394
like pine trees and Giardia,
which is that gastrointestinal disease

00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:36.425
you can get if you don't filter
your water while you're hiking.

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.363
We're also related to bacteria
like E. coli and Clostridium difficile,

00:04:41.387 --> 00:04:44.849
which is a horrible, opportunistic
pathogen that kills lots of people.

00:04:44.873 --> 00:04:49.047
But there's of course good microbes too,
like Dehalococcoides ethenogenes,

00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:51.939
which cleans up
our industrial waste for us.

00:04:51.963 --> 00:04:54.702
So if I take these DNA sequences,

00:04:54.726 --> 00:04:57.869
and then I use them, the similarities
and differences between them,

00:04:57.893 --> 00:04:59.722
to make a family tree for all of us

00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:01.611
so you can see who is closely related,
