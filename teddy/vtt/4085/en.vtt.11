00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.024
So when we got these first DNA sequences,

00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:34.248
from the first cruise, of pristine samples
from the deep subsurface,

00:05:34.272 --> 00:05:36.121
we wanted to know where they were.

00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:39.359
So the first thing that we discovered
is that they were not aliens,

00:05:39.383 --> 00:05:42.968
because we could get their DNA to line up
with everything else on Earth.

00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:46.190
But now check out where they go
on our tree of life.

00:05:47.468 --> 00:05:50.570
The first thing you'll notice
is that there's a lot of them.

00:05:50.594 --> 00:05:52.419
It wasn't just one little species

00:05:52.443 --> 00:05:54.562
that managed to live
in this horrible place.

00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:56.069
It's kind of a lot of things.

00:05:56.093 --> 00:05:58.051
And the second thing that you'll notice,

00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:02.895
hopefully, is that they're not
like anything we've ever seen before.
