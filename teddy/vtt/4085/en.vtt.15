00:07:29.978 --> 00:07:31.136
around the world,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.823
my colleagues at the University
of Southern California,

00:07:34.847 --> 00:07:36.553
Doug LaRowe and Jan Amend,

00:07:36.577 --> 00:07:41.280
were able to calculate that each one
of these deep-sea microbial cells

00:07:41.304 --> 00:07:44.670
requires only one zeptowatt of power,

00:07:44.694 --> 00:07:48.634
and before you get your phones out,
a zepto is 10 to the minus 21,

00:07:48.658 --> 00:07:50.706
because I know I would want
to look that up.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.261
Humans, on the other hand,

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:54.874
require about 100 watts of power.

00:07:54.898 --> 00:07:58.409
So 100 watts is basically
if you take a pineapple

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:04.643
and drop it from about waist height
to the ground 881,632 times a day.
