They are as different from each other

as we are from pine trees.

00:06:10.514 --> 00:06:13.695
So John Parkes was completely correct.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.847
He, and we, had discovered
a completely new and highly diverse

00:06:18.871 --> 00:06:20.841

So now we were on a roll.

00:06:26.716 --> 00:06:31.428
The next step was to grow
these exotic species in a petri dish
