00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:31.625
they put them under the microscope,

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.758
and they saw images
that looked pretty much like this,

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:38.259
which is actually taken
from a more recent expedition

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.469
by my PhD student, Joy Buongiorno.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.781
You can see the hazy stuff
in the background.

00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:45.590
That's mud. That's deep-sea ocean mud,

00:02:45.614 --> 00:02:49.601
and the bright green dots
stained with the green fluorescent dye

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:52.363
are real, living microbes.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.203
Now I've got to tell you
something really tragic about microbes.

00:02:56.227 --> 00:02:58.306
They all look the same under a microscope,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.937
I mean, to a first approximation.

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:03.553
You can take the most fascinating
organisms in the world,
