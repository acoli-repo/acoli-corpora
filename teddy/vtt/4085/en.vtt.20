00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:01.614
all without growing any contaminants.

00:10:01.638 --> 00:10:02.936
It's just not possible.

00:10:03.637 --> 00:10:06.763
But maybe in a way we already have
grown them in our petri dishes.

00:10:06.787 --> 00:10:09.597
Maybe they looked at all that food
we offered them and said,

00:10:09.621 --> 00:10:11.483
"Thanks, I'm going to speed up so much

00:10:11.507 --> 00:10:13.747
that I'm going to make
a new cell next century.

00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:14.932
Ugh.

00:10:14.956 --> 00:10:15.995
(Laughter)

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:21.128
So why is it that the rest
of biology moves so fast?

00:10:21.152 --> 00:10:23.058
Why does a cell die after a day

00:10:23.082 --> 00:10:25.593
and a human dies
after only a hundred years?

00:10:25.617 --> 00:10:28.058
These seem like really
arbitrarily short limits

00:10:28.082 --> 00:10:31.081
when you think about the total amount
of time in the universe.
