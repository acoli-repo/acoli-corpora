00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:02.067
because when you live
on such tiny energy gradients,

00:09:02.091 --> 00:09:03.786
rapid growth is impossible.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.827
If these things wanted
to colonize our throats and make us sick,

00:09:06.851 --> 00:09:09.471
they would get muscled out
by fast-growing streptococcus

00:09:09.495 --> 00:09:11.656
before they could even
initiate cell division.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.442
So that's why we never
find them in our throats.

00:09:15.537 --> 00:09:19.712
Perhaps the fact that the deep
subsurface is so boring

00:09:19.736 --> 00:09:22.226
is actually an asset to these microbes.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.338
They never get washed out by a storm.

00:09:24.362 --> 00:09:26.527
They never get overgrown by weeds.

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:30.321
All they have to do is exist.
