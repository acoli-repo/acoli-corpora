I'm an ocean microbiologist
at the University of Tennessee,

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.182
and I want to tell you guys
about some microbes

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:10.400
that are so strange and wonderful

00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:14.227
that they're challenging our assumptions
about what life is like on Earth.

00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:15.680
So I have a question.

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:18.747
Please raise your hand
if you've ever thought it would be cool

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:21.418
to go to the bottom
of the ocean in a submarine?

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:23.522
Yes.

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:25.722
Most of you, because
the oceans are so cool.

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:28.449
Alright, now -- please raise your hand

00:00:28.473 --> 00:00:32.163
if the reason you raised your hand
to go to the bottom of the ocean
