WEBVTT

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:32.398
which is a hundred times smaller
than the wavelength of visible light,

00:08:32.422 --> 00:08:34.057
once per day.

00:08:34.773 --> 00:08:37.971
That's all it takes
to make these microbes live.

00:08:38.717 --> 00:08:44.082
That's less energy than we ever thought
would be capable of supporting life,

00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:47.180
but somehow, amazingly, beautifully,

00:08:47.204 --> 00:08:48.394
it's enough.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.203
So if these deep-subsurface microbes

00:08:51.227 --> 00:08:54.779
have a very different relationship
with energy than we previously thought,

00:08:54.803 --> 00:08:56.767
then it follows that they'll have to have

00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:58.948
a different relationship
with time as well,

00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:02.067
because when you live
on such tiny energy gradients,
