00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.909
The chances of getting
so many of those vertical columns

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:06.322
where every species has a C
or every species has a T,

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:09.131
by random chance, are infinitesimal.

00:04:09.155 --> 00:04:14.068
So we know that all those species
had to have had a common ancestor.

00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:15.989
They're all relatives of each other.

00:04:16.013 --> 00:04:17.861
So now I'll tell you who they are.

00:04:18.338 --> 00:04:20.942
The top two are us and chimpanzees,

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:24.561
which y'all already knew were related,
because, I mean, obviously.

00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:26.045
(Laughter)

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.847
But we're also related to things
that we don't look like,

00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:33.394
like pine trees and Giardia,
which is that gastrointestinal disease
