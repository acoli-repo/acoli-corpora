that's completely
disconnected from the Sun.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.872
It's instead being driven
by long, slow geological rhythms.

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:13.321
There's currently no theoretical limit
on the lifespan of one single cell.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:18.600
As long as there is at least
a tiny energy gradient to exploit,

00:11:18.624 --> 00:11:20.808
theoretically, a single cell could live

00:11:20.832 --> 00:11:22.974
for hundreds of thousands
of years or more,

00:11:22.998 --> 00:11:25.442
simply by replacing
broken parts over time.

00:11:26.047 --> 00:11:30.380
To ask a microbe that lives like that
to grow in our petri dishes
