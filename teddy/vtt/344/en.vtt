00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.048
I teach chemistry.

00:00:03.048 --> 00:00:04.414
(Explosion)

00:00:04.414 --> 00:00:07.572
All right, all right.

00:00:07.572 --> 00:00:09.853
So more than just explosions,

00:00:09.853 --> 00:00:11.464
chemistry is everywhere.

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:14.104
Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out

00:00:14.104 --> 00:00:16.449
just doing this over and over?

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.654
Some people nodding yes.

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:20.982
Recently, I showed this to my students,

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:25.331
and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened.

00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:27.952
The questions and conversations that followed

00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:29.603
were fascinating.

00:00:29.603 --> 00:00:31.417
