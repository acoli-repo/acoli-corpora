00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:30.549
we can be robbing ourselves

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.483
of our greatest tool as teachers: our students' questions.

00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:39.863
For example, flipping a boring lecture from the classroom

00:01:39.863 --> 00:01:41.640
to the screen of a mobile device

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.477
might save instructional time,

00:01:43.477 --> 00:01:46.376
but if it is the focus of our students' experience,

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:49.496
it's the same dehumanizing chatter

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:51.728
just wrapped up in fancy clothing.

00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:54.003
But if instead we have the guts

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.873
to confuse our students, perplex them,

00:01:56.873 --> 00:01:59.149
and evoke real questions,

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.149
through those questions, we as teachers have information
