Rule number two: Embrace the mess.

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:08.463
We're all teachers. We know learning is ugly.

00:04:08.463 --> 00:04:11.334
And just because the scientific method is allocated

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:14.785
to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:18.240
of the one that we all skip, okay,

00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:23.359
of what we do every single day

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:26.691
at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206.

00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:30.713
And rule number three: Practice reflection.
