00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.855
But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:02.549
took her to a new level.

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.682
If you look inside that beaker,

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:06.242
you might see a candle.

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:09.251
Maddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon

00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:12.028

You know, questions and curiosity like Maddie's

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:30.549
we can be robbing ourselves
