00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:30.713
And rule number three: Practice reflection.

00:04:30.713 --> 00:04:33.057
What we do is important. It deserves our care,

00:04:33.057 --> 00:04:36.289
but it also deserves our revision.

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.067
Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms?

00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:42.063
As if what we are doing one day will save lives.

00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:43.614
Our students our worth it.

00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:46.049
And each case is different.

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:47.144
(Explosion)

00:04:47.144 --> 00:04:49.091
All right. Sorry.

00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:50.999
The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.834
out of my system before we move on.

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:55.619
So these are my daughters.

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:59.291
On the right we have little Emmalou -- Southern family.

00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:02.073
And, on the left, Riley.
