And third, through intense reflection,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.206
he gathered the information that he needed

00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:37.112
to design and revise the procedure,

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:40.633
and then, with a steady hand, he saved my life.

00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:44.309
Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom,

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:46.289
and before I went back into the classroom that fall,

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:49.547
I wrote down three rules of my own

00:03:49.547 --> 00:03:52.327
that I bring to my lesson planning still today.

00:03:52.327 --> 00:03:56.369
Rule number one: Curiosity comes first.

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:59.468
Questions can be windows to great instruction,

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:02.158
but not the other way around.
