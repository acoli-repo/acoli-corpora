You see, I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.664
and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms --

00:05:38.664 --> 00:05:41.988
to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun

00:05:41.988 --> 00:05:47.006
or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom.

00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:49.681
But if we as educators leave behind

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:52.263
this simple role as disseminators of content

00:05:52.263 --> 00:05:54.600
and embrace a new paradigm

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.644
as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry,

00:05:57.644 --> 00:05:59.869
we just might bring a little bit more meaning

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:02.584
to their school day, and spark their imagination.
