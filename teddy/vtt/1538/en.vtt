00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.032
This is a lot of ones and zeros.

00:00:03.032 --> 00:00:06.131
It's what we call binary information.

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:07.573
This is how computers talk.

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:09.502
It's how they store information.

00:00:09.502 --> 00:00:11.128
It's how computers think.

00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:12.747
It's how computers do

00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:15.129
everything it is that computers do.

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.176
I'm a cybersecurity researcher,

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:19.246
which means my job is to sit
down with this information

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:20.930
and try to make sense of it,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.683
to try to understand what all
the ones and zeroes mean.

00:00:23.683 --> 00:00:25.526
Unfortunately for me, we're not just talking

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.760
about the ones and zeros
I have on the screen here.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.443
We're not just talking about a
few pages of ones and zeros.
