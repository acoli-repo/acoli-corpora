00:00:07.795 --> 00:00:11.090
In the middle of Floridaâ€™s 
Apalachicola National Forest,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.719
a bizarre, almost magical scene 
is unraveling.

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:18.306
Sliding a metal strip over a wooden stake,

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:23.770
a master summoner is sending deep croaking
noises reverberating through the area.

00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:26.147
And, as if in a trance,

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:29.984
hundreds of earthworms 
begin emerging from the soil.
