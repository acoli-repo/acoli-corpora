I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
She's an Italian fashion designer.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
She goes to this vintage store in Paris

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with a friend of hers.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
she loves it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
She's turning it inside out.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Her friend says, "Buy it already."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
She said, "I'll buy it, but I'm also going to replicate it."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, the academics in this audience may think,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
"Well, that sounds like plagiarism."
