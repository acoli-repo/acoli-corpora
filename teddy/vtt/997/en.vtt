00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Come with me to the bottom of the world,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Antarctica,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the highest, driest, windiest,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and yes, coldest region on Earth --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
more arid than the Sahara

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and, in parts, colder than Mars.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The ice of Antarctica glows

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to kill the pain of it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
sags below sea level, beneath its weight.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Yet, the ice of Antarctica
