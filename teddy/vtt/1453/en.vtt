I'd like to speak about technology trends,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which is something that many of you follow --

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but we also follow, for related reasons.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
are something that we write about and need to know about.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But also it's part of being any monthly magazine --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We have to plan issues many months in advance;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.
