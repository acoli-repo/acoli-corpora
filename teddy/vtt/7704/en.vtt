Anna Malaika Tubbs: "The Three Mothers"

00:00:02.076 --> 00:00:05.036
is about Alberta King,
Berdis Baldwin and Louise Little,

00:00:05.076 --> 00:00:08.956
the mothers of MLK Jr.,
James Baldwin and Malcolm X.

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:10.676
And I wrote this book

00:00:10.716 --> 00:00:14.236
to not only celebrate
these three incredible life stories

00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:18.116
that we should have known
for years and years before my book,

00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:22.316
but to also think about what their stories
could symbolize for Black women,

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:24.836
Black mothers, mothers more generally,

00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:27.556
and what it could mean
to save their stories

00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:29.956
from being forgotten, from being erased,

00:00:29.956 --> 00:00:34.716
and how it changes our understanding
of where we are as a nation today,
