It's a great honor to be here with you.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The good news is

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Laughter)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but I have a box of slides.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I've learned through experience

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words,
