00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The greatest irony in global health

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is that the poorest countries

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
carry the largest disease burden.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If we resize the countries of the globe

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in proportion to the subject of interest,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we see that Sub-Saharan Africa

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We also see that this region

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There are very few doctors

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that are needed to cope
