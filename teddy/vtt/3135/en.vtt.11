00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.216
We build for Maria,

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.576
who uses poetry to heal

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.096
after her grandfather died in the van

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.360
she's living in
with the rest of her family.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.376
And so to the youth out there
experiencing homelessness,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.600
let me tell you,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.920
you have the power to build within you.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.656
You have a voice through the arts

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.496
that doesn't judge
what you've been through.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.976
So never stop fighting
to stand in your light

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.336
because even in your darkest times,
