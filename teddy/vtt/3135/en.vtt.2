00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.240
I fled for my safety.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.215
I had come to the conclusion
that homelessness was safer for me

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.440
than being at home.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.440
I was 16.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.616
During my homelessness,
I joined Atlanta's 3,300 homeless youth

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.616
in feeling uncared for,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.920
left out and invisible each night.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.216
There wasn't and still is not any place

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.616
for a homeless minor
to walk off the street

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.040
to access a bed.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.816
I realized that most people
thought of homelessness

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.096
as some kind of lazy, drug-induced
squalor and inconvenience,
