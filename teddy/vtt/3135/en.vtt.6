00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.176
It gave me so much strength
to give myself permission

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.480
to just block it all out and sing.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.216
Five years later,
I started my organization, ChopArt,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.360
which is a multidisciplinary
arts organization for homeless minors.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.536
ChopArt uses the arts
as a tool for trauma recovery

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.296
by taking what we know
about building community

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.136
and restoring dignity

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.360
and applying that to the creative process.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.176
ChopArt is headquartered
in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.016
with additional programs
in Hyderabad, India, and Accra, Ghana,
