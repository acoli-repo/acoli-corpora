00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.296
Don't you love a good nap?

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.536
(Laughter)

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.976
Just stealing away
that small block of time

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.800
to curl up on your couch
for that sweet moment of escape.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.256
It's one of my favorite things,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.856
but something I took for granted

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.800
before I began experiencing
homelessness as a teenager.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.256
The ability to take a nap is only reserved
for stability and sureness,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.496
something you can't find

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.176
when you're carrying
everything you own in your book bag

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.976
and carefully counting the amount of time
you're allowed to sit in any given place
