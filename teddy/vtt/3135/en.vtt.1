and carefully counting the amount of time
you're allowed to sit in any given place

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.600
before being asked to leave.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.016
I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.856
bouncing from house to house

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.176
with a loving, close-knit family

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.536
as we struggled to find stability

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.760
in our finances.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.376

lost herself to mania

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.136
and when that mania chose me
as its primary scapegoat

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.816
through both emotional and physical abuse,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.240
I fled for my safety.
