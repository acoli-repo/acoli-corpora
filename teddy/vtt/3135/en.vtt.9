without even allowing them to take
an extra pair of clothes on their way out.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.040
This series of events broke my heart,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.776
but Jeremy and Kelly's faith
and resolve in ChopArt

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.040
is what keeps me grounded in this work.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.496
Kelly calling Erin in her lowest moment,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.856
knowing that Erin would do
whatever she could

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.856
to make them feel loved and cared for,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.976
is proof to me that by using
the arts as the entry point,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.720
we can heal and build
our homeless youth population.
