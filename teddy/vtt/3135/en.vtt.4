00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.456
I, like thousands of other homeless youth,
disappeared into the shadows of the city

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.736
while the whole world kept spinning

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.320
as if nothing at all
had gone terribly wrong.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.600
The invisibility alone
almost completely broke my spirit.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.120
But when I had nothing else,
I had the arts,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.456
something that didn't demand

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.000
material wealth from me
in exchange for refuge.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.936
A few hours of singing, writing poetry

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.936
or saving up enough money

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.616
to disappear into another world at a play
