WEBVTT

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.640
And we continue to build.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.216
We build with Devin,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.416
who became homeless with his family

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.120
when his mom had to choose
between medical bills or the rent.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.640
He discovered his love
of painting through ChopArt.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.016
We build with Liz,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.216
who has been on the streets
most of her teenage years

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.256
but turns to music to return to herself

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.000
when her traumas feel too heavy
for her young shoulders.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.216
We build for Maria,
