00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:06.425
(Shouting, fire crackling)

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:09.526
KA: Our nations seem
to be crumbling by the day.

00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:12.942
And this should make us uncomfortable.

00:01:13.752 --> 00:01:15.910
We've all got huge problems in our cities.

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:19.068
Problems of inequity
and cruelty and violence.

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.450

And people often ask me,
what should a compassionate city be like?
