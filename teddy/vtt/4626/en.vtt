As a result of my studies,
I found a thread,

00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:08.450
that the essence of religion
was compassion.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:11.696
That every single one
of the major world religions --

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.074
Judaism, Islam, Christianity,
Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism ...

00:00:17.886 --> 00:00:22.117
they all insisted on what's often known
as the Golden Rule:

00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:25.542
never treat others as you
would not like to be treated yourself.

00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:32.913
