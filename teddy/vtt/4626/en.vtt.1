My wish was that you would get
a panel of activists

00:00:32.937 --> 00:00:38.428
and together, we would craft
a charter, a brief statement

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:42.252
reminding the world that this
is what religion is about.

But they couldn't do it alone.

So, my wish ... My wish ... I wish ...

And now, here's my wish.
