Jeremiah: Just go, count me out.

00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:36.931
MCM: Jeremiah, we're going to try harder
to get our self-regulation back, sir.

00:03:36.955 --> 00:03:39.405
Jeremiah: This is the second
reason I hate my life.

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:42.517
MCM: Jeremiah, come here,
I need you to tell me more about that.

00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:45.161
MCM: Anger or frustration,
which feeling was bringing --

00:03:45.706 --> 00:03:48.121
Anger, I can tell. Look at your hands.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.983
So, before we talk about it,
can you calm yourself down?

00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:54.165
No? it's hard to, isn't it?

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:56.402
Can you try to make your hands
look like mine?

00:03:56.752 --> 00:03:58.101
Look.

00:03:58.125 --> 00:03:59.751
Can you try to let go of that?

00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:02.601
Look at your face, I see a smile there.
