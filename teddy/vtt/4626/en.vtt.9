00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:33.604
(Many voices) Grant me the serenity
to accept the things that I cannot change,

00:04:33.628 --> 00:04:36.331
the courage to change
the things that I can

00:04:36.355 --> 00:04:39.649
and the wisdom to know
the difference, just for today.

00:04:39.673 --> 00:04:41.863
Keep coming back, it works.

00:04:42.442 --> 00:04:46.236
GF: Hotel Louisville is a great example
of how to think about a whole system

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.640
of getting a person back on track.

00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:52.958
So it's a shelter
for women and their families,

00:04:52.982 --> 00:04:54.950
but it's also an operating hotel.

00:04:54.974 --> 00:04:58.748
Cynthia Brown: Hotel Louisville
was not just a women's rehab facility,

00:04:58.772 --> 00:05:00.806
it is a workforce program.
