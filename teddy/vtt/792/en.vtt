Well, Arthur C. Clarke,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.481
a famous science fiction
writer from the 1950s,

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:09.503
said that, "We overestimate
technology in the short term,

00:00:09.527 --> 00:00:12.303
and we underestimate it in the long term."

00:00:12.327 --> 00:00:14.720
And I think that's some of the fear
that we see

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:19.302
about jobs disappearing from artificial
intelligence and robots.

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:22.136
That we're overestimating
the technology in the short term.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.347
But I am worried whether we're going to get
the technology we need in the long term.

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:33.061
Because the demographics are really going
to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing
