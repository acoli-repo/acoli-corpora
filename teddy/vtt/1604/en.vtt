00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:02.718
I study ants

00:00:02.718 --> 00:00:06.015
in the desert, in the tropical forest

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:07.543
and in my kitchen,

00:00:07.543 --> 00:00:11.563
and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live.

00:00:11.563 --> 00:00:13.239
I've recently realized that ants

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.517
are using interactions differently

00:00:15.517 --> 00:00:17.345
in different environments,

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:19.345
and that got me thinking
that we could learn from this

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:20.900
about other systems,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.488
like brains and data networks that we engineer,

00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:29.334
and even cancer.

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:31.086
So what all these systems have in common
