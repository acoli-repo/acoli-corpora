00:04:29.578 --> 00:04:32.698
I sent some people to the scene,
and there was an inconsistency.

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:37.859
And to put it politely:

00:04:37.883 --> 00:04:41.542
Usain Bolt couldn't have run
from where she said she was

00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:42.754
to the other spot.

00:04:42.778 --> 00:04:43.930
Right?

00:04:43.954 --> 00:04:46.371
So we knew that wasn't true.

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:49.022
So it still didn't mean
that he didn't do it,

00:04:49.046 --> 00:04:53.030
but we knew something was maybe fishy
about this witness.

00:04:53.634 --> 00:04:55.668
So we looked through the file,

00:04:55.692 --> 00:04:58.031
a piece of paper in the file
had a number on it.

00:04:58.055 --> 00:05:01.021
The number indicated
that this witness had a record.
