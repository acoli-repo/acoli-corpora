My team looked through the file,
and we found it,

00:02:33.407 --> 00:02:35.129
did the rest of the investigation,

00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:37.440
and figured out someone else
committed the crime.

00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:40.604
Mr. Fleming was in Disney World,

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:42.567
and he is now released.

00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:45.103
Let me give you a little bit of context.

00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:49.940
So about three years ago, I got a call
from the Brooklyn District Attorney.

00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:54.047
He asked whether I'd be interested
in designing a program

00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:56.049
called a "conviction review unit."

00:02:56.073 --> 00:02:57.354
So I said yes.

00:02:57.378 --> 00:03:02.045
A conviction review unit is essentially
a unit in a prosecutor's office
