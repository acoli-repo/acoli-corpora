00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.952
for what's called a "vacatur hearing,"

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.087
where the conviction is thrown out.

00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:36.813
I went to court; I wanted to see

00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:39.968
Mr. McCallum walk out of there.

00:06:39.992 --> 00:06:41.146
So I went to court,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.939
and the judge said something
that judges say all the time,

00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:46.172
but this took on a really special meaning.

00:06:46.693 --> 00:06:49.313
He looked up after the arguments and said,

00:06:49.337 --> 00:06:50.540
"Mr. McCallum,"

00:06:51.108 --> 00:06:52.997
he said five beautiful words:

00:06:53.594 --> 00:06:57.045
"You are free to go."

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:00.153
Can you imagine?
