00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.683
So, imagine that you take
a 19-hour, very long drive

00:00:08.022 --> 00:00:09.342
to Disney World,

00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.870
with two kids in the back seat.

00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:17.388
And 15 minutes into this 19-hour trip,

00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:21.245
the immutable laws of nature dictate

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.325
that you get the question:

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:24.713
"Are we there yet?"

00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:25.994
(Laughter)

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:30.006
So you answer this question
a hundred more times, easily,
