00:10:29.957 --> 00:10:32.932
Now, above me is a picture

00:10:32.956 --> 00:10:34.377
of David McCallum.

00:10:35.353 --> 00:10:38.233
This is the day
he was released from prison.

00:10:38.257 --> 00:10:41.314
After 30 years, he got to hug a niece

00:10:41.338 --> 00:10:44.130
he had never been able to touch before.

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.735
And I asked him then,

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:50.262
I said, "What's the first thing
you want to do?"

00:10:50.286 --> 00:10:52.665
And he said, "I just want
to walk on the sidewalk

00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:54.870
without anybody telling me where to go."

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.175
Wasn't bitter,

00:10:57.199 --> 00:10:59.105
just wanted to walk on the sidewalk.

00:10:59.835 --> 00:11:02.842
I spoke to Mr. McCallum
about two weeks ago.
