How do we know this?

Because when he was arrested,

00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:06.079

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.107

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:10.862
time-stamped receipt

00:02:10.886 --> 00:02:13.747
that showed that he was in Disney World.

00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:17.447
That receipt was put in the police file,

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:20.097

00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:23.353
and they never gave it

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:25.319
In fact, nobody even knew it was there.

00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:28.082
It just sat there for 20-some-odd years.

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:32.477
My team looked through the file,
and we found it,
