I spoke to Mr. McCallum
about two weeks ago.

00:11:03.369 --> 00:11:04.543
I went to New York.

00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:07.330
It was on the two-year anniversary

00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:08.924
of his release.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.920
And we talked,

00:11:10.944 --> 00:11:13.408
we laughed, we hugged, we cried.

00:11:14.035 --> 00:11:16.240
And he's doing quite well.

00:11:16.264 --> 00:11:20.150
And one of the things he said
when we met with him

00:11:20.174 --> 00:11:23.304
is that he now has dedicated his life

00:11:23.328 --> 00:11:24.697
and his career

00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:28.880
to ensuring that nobody else
is locked up unjustly.

00:11:29.951 --> 00:11:31.953
Justice, my friends,
