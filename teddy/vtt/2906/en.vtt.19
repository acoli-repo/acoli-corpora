00:09:30.105 --> 00:09:32.585
but eternity is in it."

00:09:33.903 --> 00:09:35.453
If I were to charge

00:09:35.477 --> 00:09:37.110
each and every one of us,

00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:40.343
I would want to say something like,

00:09:41.962 --> 00:09:43.114
"Every day,

00:09:43.868 --> 00:09:45.019
every day,

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:47.999
take just one extra minute

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.176
and do some justice.

00:09:52.932 --> 00:09:54.334
You don't have to --

00:09:54.358 --> 00:09:58.371
I mean, some people spend
their careers and their lives,

00:09:58.395 --> 00:09:59.633
like public defenders,

00:09:59.657 --> 00:10:00.897
doing justice every day.
