00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:03.115
that single-witness identification cases

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.417
are prone to error.

00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:07.176
It doesn't mean he was innocent,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.517
it just means we ought to look
a little bit closer at those cases.

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.851
So we did.

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:13.876
And the facts were relatively simple.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.982
The eyewitness said she heard a shot,

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:20.057
and she ran to the next building
and turned around and looked,

00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:21.662
and there was Mr. Logan.

00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:26.716
And he was tried and convicted
and in jail for 17-some-odd years.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.554
But it was a single-witness case,
so we took a look at it.

00:04:29.578 --> 00:04:32.698
I sent some people to the scene,
and there was an inconsistency.
