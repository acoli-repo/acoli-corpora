00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:30.587
They were arrested at 15,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.520
and their conviction was vacated
29 years later.

00:05:36.865 --> 00:05:38.659
Now this was a case,

00:05:38.683 --> 00:05:41.487
once again -- first blush,
it looked open and shut.

00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:42.783
They had confessed.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.501
But my research showed
that juvenile confessions

00:05:46.525 --> 00:05:48.014
without a parent present

00:05:48.038 --> 00:05:49.473
are prone to error.

00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:51.763
The DNA cases proved this several times.

00:05:51.787 --> 00:05:53.161
So we took a close look.

00:05:53.708 --> 00:05:55.557
We looked at the confession,

00:05:55.581 --> 00:05:56.745
and it turned out,

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:58.631
there was something in the confession

00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:00.623
that those boys could not have known.
