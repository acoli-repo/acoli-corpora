And perhaps Mr. Stuckey
would be alive today.

00:09:01.451 --> 00:09:04.832
It reminds me of one of my favorite poems.

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:09.139
It's a poem that Benjamin Elijah Mays
would always recite,

00:09:09.163 --> 00:09:10.876
and he called it "God's Minute."

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.473
And it goes something like this:

00:09:12.497 --> 00:09:14.614
"I have only just a minute,

00:09:14.638 --> 00:09:16.665
only 60 seconds in it,

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.964

00:09:18.988 --> 00:09:21.254

00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:22.832
But it's up to me to use it.

00:09:22.856 --> 00:09:26.294
I must suffer if I lose it,
give account if I abuse it.

00:09:27.175 --> 00:09:29.429
Just a tiny little minute,
