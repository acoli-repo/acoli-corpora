A conviction review unit is essentially
a unit in a prosecutor's office

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.186
where prosecutors look at their past cases

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.821
to determine whether or not
they made mistakes.

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:10.497
Over the course of the first year,

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:13.615
we found about 13 wrongful convictions,

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.174
people having been in jail for decades,

00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:17.833
and we released all of them.

00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:20.535
It was the most in New York history.

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:22.051
The program is still going on,

00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:25.342
and they're up to 21 releases now --

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:29.722
21 people who spent
significant time behind bars.
