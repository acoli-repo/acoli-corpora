00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:30.966
So.

00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:33.485
So, I'm a Harvard Law professor,

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.650
and the last several years,
I have worked on

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.824
winning the release of innocent people

00:01:41.373 --> 00:01:43.566
who've been wrongfully convicted --

00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:45.973
people like Jonathan Fleming,

00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:50.051
who spent 24 years, eight months in jail

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:53.673
for a murder that was committed
in Brooklyn, New York,

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:57.180
while he was in Disney World

00:01:57.204 --> 00:01:58.477
with his kids.

00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:00.296
How do we know this?
