00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.142
When I was a child growing up in Maine,

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.166
one of my favorite things to do

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.214
was to look for sand dollars
on the seashores of Maine,

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:10.944
because my parents told me
it would bring me luck.

00:00:10.968 --> 00:00:13.646
But you know, these shells,
they're hard to find.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.166
They're covered in sand,
they're difficult to see.

00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:20.173
However, over time,
I got used to looking for them.

00:00:20.197 --> 00:00:21.800
I started seeing shapes

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:24.546
and patterns that helped me
to collect them.

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:29.156
This grew into a passion
for finding things,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.220
a love for the past and archaeology.
