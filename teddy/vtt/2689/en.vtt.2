and that your grandchildren,
or their grandchildren,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.360
are very likely to live like this,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.400
you wouldn't think,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.776
"Interesting.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.000
I like this TED Talk."

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.720
Famine isn't fun.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.176
Death by science fiction,
on the other hand, is fun,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.176
and one of the things that worries me most
about the development of AI at this point

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.296
is that we seem unable to marshal
an appropriate emotional response

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.136
to the dangers that lie ahead.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.360
I am unable to marshal this response,
and I'm giving this talk.
