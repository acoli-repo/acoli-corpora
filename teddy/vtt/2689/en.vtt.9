00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.416
And we know that mere matter

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.056
can give rise to what is called
"general intelligence,"

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.736
an ability to think flexibly
across multiple domains,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.896
because our brains have managed it. Right?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.856
I mean, there's just atoms in here,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.376
and as long as we continue
to build systems of atoms

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.096
that display more and more
intelligent behavior,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.656
we will eventually,
unless we are interrupted,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.056
we will eventually
build general intelligence

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.376
into our machines.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.056
It's crucial to realize
that the rate of progress doesn't matter,
