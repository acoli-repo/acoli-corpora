The computer scientist Stuart Russell
has a nice analogy here.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.296
He said, imagine that we received
a message from an alien civilization,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.016
which read:

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.576
"People of Earth,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.960
we will arrive on your planet in 50 years.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.376
Get ready."

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.656
And now we're just counting down
the months until the mothership lands?

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.680
We would feel a little
more urgency than we do.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.536
Another reason we're told not to worry

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.576
is that these machines
can't help but share our values

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.216
because they will be literally
extensions of ourselves.
