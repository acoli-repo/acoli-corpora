00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.160
or anywhere near it, likely.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.536
And this really is the crucial insight.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.976
This is what makes
our situation so precarious,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.040
and this is what makes our intuitions
about risk so unreliable.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.840
Now, just consider the smartest person
who has ever lived.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.056
On almost everyone's shortlist here
is John von Neumann.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.416
I mean, the impression that von Neumann
made on the people around him,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.496
and this included the greatest
mathematicians and physicists of his time,

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.456
is fairly well-documented.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.256
If only half the stories
about him are half true,
