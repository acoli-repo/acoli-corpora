00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.736
or we need it to safeguard
everything we value.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.016
It is our most valuable resource.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.576
So we want to do this.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.936
We have problems
that we desperately need to solve.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.160
We want to cure diseases
like Alzheimer's and cancer.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.896
We want to understand economic systems.
We want to improve our climate science.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.176
So we will do this, if we can.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.486
The train is already out of the station,
and there's no brake to pull.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.336
Finally, we don't stand
on a peak of intelligence,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.160
or anywhere near it, likely.
