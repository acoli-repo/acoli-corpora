00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.216
at Stanford or MIT.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.216
Well, electronic circuits
function about a million times faster

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.496
than biochemical ones,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.656
so this machine should think
about a million times faster

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.496
than the minds that built it.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.176
So you set it running for a week,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.760
and it will perform 20,000 years
of human-level intellectual work,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.360
week after week after week.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.736
How could we even understand,
much less constrain,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.040
a mind making this sort of progress?

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.976
The other thing that's worrying, frankly,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.976
is that, imagine the best case scenario.
