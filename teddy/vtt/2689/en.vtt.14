00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.960
extends much further
than we currently conceive,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.096
and if we build machines
that are more intelligent than we are,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.416
they will very likely
explore this spectrum

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.296
in ways that we can't imagine,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.840
and exceed us in ways
that we can't imagine.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.336
And it's important to recognize that
this is true by virtue of speed alone.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.416
Right? So imagine if we just built
a superintelligent AI

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.896
that was no smarter
than your average team of researchers

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.216
at Stanford or MIT.
