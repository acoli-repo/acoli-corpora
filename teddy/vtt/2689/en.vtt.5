00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.456
Almost by definition,
this is the worst thing

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.496
that's ever happened in human history.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.816
So the only alternative,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.176
and this is what lies
behind door number two,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.336
is that we continue
to improve our intelligent machines

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.960
year after year after year.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.360
At a certain point, we will build
machines that are smarter than we are,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.696
and once we have machines
that are smarter than we are,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.696
they will begin to improve themselves.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.456
And then we risk what
the mathematician IJ Good called

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.256
an "intelligence explosion,"

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280
that the process could get away from us.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.936
Now, this is often caricatured,
as I have here,
