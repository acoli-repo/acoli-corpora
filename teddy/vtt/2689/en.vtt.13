00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.256
If only half the stories
about him are half true,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.496
there's no question

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.976
he's one of the smartest people
who has ever lived.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.520
So consider the spectrum of intelligence.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.749
Here we have John von Neumann.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.894
And then we have you and me.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.416
And then we have a chicken.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.376
(Laughter)

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.616
Sorry, a chicken.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.896
(Laughter)

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.656
There's no reason for me to make this talk
more depressing than it needs to be.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.280
(Laughter)

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:59.816
It seems overwhelmingly likely, however,
that the spectrum of intelligence

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.960
extends much further
than we currently conceive,
