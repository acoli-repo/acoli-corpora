00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.336
in my view, at this moment,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.656
are the kinds of things
that AI researchers say

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.240
when they want to be reassuring.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.456
And the most common reason
we're told not to worry is time.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.536
This is all a long way off,
don't you know.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.000
This is probably 50 or 100 years away.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.976
One researcher has said,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.576

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.880
is like worrying
about overpopulation on Mars."

00:10:22.116 --> 00:10:23.736
This is the Silicon Valley version

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.136
of "don't worry your
pretty little head about it."

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.496
(Laughter)

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.416
No one seems to notice

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.056
that referencing the time horizon
