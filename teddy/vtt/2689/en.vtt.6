00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.936
Now, this is often caricatured,
as I have here,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.176
as a fear that armies of malicious robots

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.456
will attack us.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.176
But that isn't the most likely scenario.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.056
It's not that our machines
will become spontaneously malevolent.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.696
The concern is really
that we will build machines

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.776
that are so much
more competent than we are

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.576
that the slightest divergence
between their goals and our own

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.800
could destroy us.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.040
Just think about how we relate to ants.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.256
We don't hate them.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.336
We don't go out of our way to harm them.
