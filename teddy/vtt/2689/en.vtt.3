00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.816
It's as though we stand before two doors.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.096
Behind door number one,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.416
we stop making progress
in building intelligent machines.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.456
Our computer hardware and software
just stops getting better for some reason.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.480
Now take a moment
to consider why this might happen.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.736
I mean, given how valuable
intelligence and automation are,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.280
we will continue to improve our technology
if we are at all able to.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.867
What could stop us from doing this?

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.600
A full-scale nuclear war?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.560
A global pandemic?
