00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.376
And if you haven't noticed,
50 years is not what it used to be.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.856
This is 50 years in months.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.720
This is how long we've had the iPhone.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.040
This is how long "The Simpsons"
has been on television.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.056
Fifty years is not that much time

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.240
to meet one of the greatest challenges
our species will ever face.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.656
Once again, we seem to be failing
to have an appropriate emotional response

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.376
to what we have every reason
to believe is coming.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.376
The computer scientist Stuart Russell
has a nice analogy here.
