00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.376
So we're talking about
the end of human drudgery.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.200
We're also talking about the end
of most intellectual work.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.256
So what would apes like ourselves
do in this circumstance?

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.360
Well, we'd be free to play Frisbee
and give each other massages.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.696
Add some LSD and some
questionable wardrobe choices,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.896
and the whole world
could be like Burning Man.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.560
(Laughter)

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.320
Now, that might sound pretty good,

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.656
but ask yourself what would happen

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.416
under our current economic
and political order?
