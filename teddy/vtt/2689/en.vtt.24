00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.216
because they will be literally
extensions of ourselves.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.056
They'll be grafted onto our brains,

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.440
and we'll essentially
become their limbic systems.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.536
Now take a moment to consider

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.736
that the safest
and only prudent path forward,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.096
recommended,

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.920
is to implant this technology
directly into our brains.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.976
Now, this may in fact be the safest
and only prudent path forward,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.056
but usually one's safety concerns
about a technology

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.736
have to be pretty much worked out
before you stick it inside your head.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.776
(Laughter)

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.136
The deeper problem is that
