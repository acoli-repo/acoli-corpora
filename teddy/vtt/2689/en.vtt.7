00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.336
We don't go out of our way to harm them.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.736
In fact, sometimes
we take pains not to harm them.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.776
We step over them on the sidewalk.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.936
But whenever their presence

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.456
seriously conflicts with one of our goals,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.957
let's say when constructing
a building like this one,

00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:43.941
we annihilate them without a qualm.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.416
The concern is that we will
one day build machines

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.176
that, whether they're conscious or not,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.200
could treat us with similar disregard.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.520
Now, I suspect this seems
far-fetched to many of you.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.696
I bet there are those of you who doubt
that superintelligent AI is possible,
