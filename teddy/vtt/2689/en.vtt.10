00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.056
It's crucial to realize
that the rate of progress doesn't matter,

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.256
because any progress
is enough to get us into the end zone.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.056
We don't need Moore's law to continue.
We don't need exponential progress.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.680
We just need to keep going.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.400
The second assumption
is that we will keep going.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.760
We will continue to improve
our intelligent machines.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.376
And given the value of intelligence --

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.936
I mean, intelligence is either
the source of everything we value

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.736
or we need it to safeguard
everything we value.
