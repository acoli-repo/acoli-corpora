00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.216
I'm going to talk
about a failure of intuition

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.840
that many of us suffer from.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.520
It's really a failure
to detect a certain kind of danger.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.096
I'm going to describe a scenario

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.376
that I think is both terrifying

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.160
and likely to occur,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.496
and that's not a good combination,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.056
as it turns out.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.536
And yet rather than be scared,
most of you will feel

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.640
that what I'm talking about
is kind of cool.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.176
I'm going to describe
how the gains we make

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.976
in artificial intelligence

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.776
could ultimately destroy us.
