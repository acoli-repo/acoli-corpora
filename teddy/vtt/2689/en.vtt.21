00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.056
that referencing the time horizon

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.656
is a total non sequitur.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.936
If intelligence is just a matter
of information processing,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.616
and we continue to improve our machines,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.520
we will produce
some form of superintelligence.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.976
And we have no idea
how long it will take us

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.400
to create the conditions
to do that safely.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.496
Let me say that again.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.336
We have no idea how long it will take us

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.600
to create the conditions
to do that safely.
