00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that it feels almost as if he didn't exist.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
But actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
more than about 110 bits of information per second.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
you need to process about 60 bits per second.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
That's why you can't hear more than two people.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You can't understand more than two people talking to you.
