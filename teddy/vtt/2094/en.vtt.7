00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And that hasn't changed at all.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Whereas the personal income,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But you find essentially the same results,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
namely, that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.
