the same essential description of the phenomenology

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
of the inner state of the person.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
You don't think; it goes automatically,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
called "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and very ethical, very socially responsible.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
You see that these people define success

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
as something that helps others and at the same time
