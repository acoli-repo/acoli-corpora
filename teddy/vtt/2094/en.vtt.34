00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
you have to increase the challenges.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So those two are ideal and complementary areas

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
from which flow is easy to go into.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
The other combinations of challenge and skill

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
become progressively less optimal.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Boredom begins to be very aversive

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and apathy becomes very negative:

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
you don't feel that you're doing anything,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
you don't use your skills, there's no challenge.
