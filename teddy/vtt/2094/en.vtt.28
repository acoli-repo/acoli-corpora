to blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds --

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
who enjoy their work.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And regardless of the culture,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000
regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
that seem to be there when a person is in flow.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
There's this focus that, once it becomes intense,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
leads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity:

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
you get immediate feedback.
