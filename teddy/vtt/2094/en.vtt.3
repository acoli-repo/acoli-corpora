00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.
