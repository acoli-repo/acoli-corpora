He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
His body disappears,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
his identity disappears from his consciousness,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
because he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and at the same time to feel that he exists.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So existence is temporarily suspended.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.
