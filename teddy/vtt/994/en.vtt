00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about the future,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and where we might move forward from this point.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Some of those stories are that

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
somebody is just going to sort everything out for us.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But I want to tell you a different story here today.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Like all stories, it has a beginning.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
My work, for a long time, has been involved in education,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in teaching people practical skills

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
for sustainability,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
teaching people how to take responsibility

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
for growing some of their own food,
