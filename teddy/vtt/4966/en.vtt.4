00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.680
And all these faults are subject to 
varying gravitational forces,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.531
as well as the currents of hot rocks
moving throughout Earth’s mantle.

00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:11.755
So which of these hidden variables 
should we be analyzing,

00:02:11.755 --> 00:02:15.955
and how do they fit into our 
growing prediction toolkit?

00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:19.829
Because some of these forces occur 
at largely constant rates,

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.159
the behavior of the plates 
is somewhat cyclical.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.609
Today, many of our most reliable clues 
come from long-term forecasting,

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.893
related to when and where earthquakes 
have previously occurred.
