00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.249
It’s hard enough to monitor these 
miniscule movements,

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:35.589
but the factors that turn shifts into 
seismic events are far more varied.

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:38.399
Different fault lines juxtapose 
different rocks–

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.269
some of which are stronger–or weaker–
under pressure.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:46.979
Diverse rocks also react differently to
friction and high temperatures.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.431
Some partially melt, and can release
lubricating fluids

00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:52.230
made of superheated minerals

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.420
that reduce fault line friction.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.370
But some are left dry,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.140
prone to dangerous build-ups of pressure.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.680
And all these faults are subject to 
varying gravitational forces,
