microfractures allow these gases 
to escape to the surface.

00:04:02.407 --> 00:04:07.042
These scientists think that if we built 
a vast network of radon-thoron detectors

00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:08.992
in earthquake-prone areas,

00:04:08.992 --> 00:04:11.522
it could become a promising 
warning system–

00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:14.532
potentially predicting quakes 
a week in advance.

00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:15.232
Of course,

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:17.432
none of these technologies 
would be as helpful

00:04:17.432 --> 00:04:20.572
as simply looking deep inside 
the earth itself.

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.242
With a deeper view we might be able

00:04:22.242 --> 00:04:26.852
to track and predict large-scale 
geological changes in real time,

00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:30.024
possibly saving tens of thousands 
of lives a year.
