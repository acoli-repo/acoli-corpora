In 132 CE,

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:12.145
Chinese polymath Zhang Heng

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.585
presented the Han court with 
his latest invention.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:17.675
This large vase, he claimed,

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:21.325
could tell them whenever an earthquake 
occurred in their kingdomâ€“

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:24.595
including the direction 
they should send aid.

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:26.505
The court was somewhat skeptical,

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:31.005
especially when the device triggered 
on a seemingly quiet afternoon.
