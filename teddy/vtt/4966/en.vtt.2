00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.794
Earth’s crust is made from several vast, 
jagged slabs of rock

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:03.749
called tectonic plates,

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.479
each riding on a hot, partially molten
layer of Earth’s mantle.

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.289
This causes the plates to 
spread very slowly,

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.839
at anywhere from 1 to 20 
centimeters per year.

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:17.289
But these tiny movements are powerful 
enough

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.799
to cause deep cracks in the
interacting plates.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.399
And in unstable zones,

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.219
the intensifying pressure may 
ultimately trigger an earthquake.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.249
It’s hard enough to monitor these 
miniscule movements,
