00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.920
to track and map these tiny shifts
in the earth’s crust.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.910
And today, most smartphones are 
also capable

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.670
of recording primary seismic waves.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.740
With a network of phones around the globe,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.680
scientists could potentially 
crowdsource a rich,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.945
detailed warning system that alerts 
people to incoming quakes.

00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:21.325
Unfortunately, phones might not be able
to provide the advance notice needed

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:23.355
to enact safety protocols.

00:03:23.355 --> 00:03:26.075
But such detailed readings 
would still be useful

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:29.425
for prediction tools like NASA’s 
Quakesim software,

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:32.255
which can use a rigorous blend of 
geological data
