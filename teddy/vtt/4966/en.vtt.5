00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.893
related to when and where earthquakes 
have previously occurred.

00:02:31.893 --> 00:02:33.573
At the scale of millennia,

00:02:33.573 --> 00:02:37.533
this allows us to make predictions 
about when highly active faults,

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:38.873
like the San Andreas,

00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:41.943
are overdue for a massive earthquake.

00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:44.193
But due to the many variables involved,

00:02:44.193 --> 00:02:47.783
this method can only predict 
very loose timeframes.

00:02:47.783 --> 00:02:49.693
To predict more imminent events,

00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:55.303
researchers have investigated the 
vibrations Earth elicits before a quake.

00:02:55.303 --> 00:02:57.990
Geologists have long used seismometers

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.920
to track and map these tiny shifts
in the earth’s crust.
