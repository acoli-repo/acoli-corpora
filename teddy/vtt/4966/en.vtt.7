00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:32.255
which can use a rigorous blend of 
geological data

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:34.765
to identify regions at risk.

00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:36.765
However, recent studies indicate

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:41.635
the most telling signs of a quake might be
invisible to all these sensors.

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:43.005
In 2011,

00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:46.265
just before an earthquake struck 
the east coast of Japan,

00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:50.065
nearby researchers recorded surprisingly 
high concentrations

00:03:50.065 --> 00:03:54.425
of the radioactive isotope pair: 
radon and thoron.

00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:58.167
As stress builds up in the crust right 
before an earthquake,

00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:02.407
microfractures allow these gases 
to escape to the surface.
