00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:31.005
especially when the device triggered 
on a seemingly quiet afternoon.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.054
But when messengers came 
for help days later,

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:36.614
their doubts turned to gratitude.

00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:41.114
Today, we no longer rely on pots to 
identify seismic events,

00:00:41.114 --> 00:00:46.150
but earthquakes still offer a unique
challenge to those trying to track them.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.139
So why are earthquakes so 
hard to anticipate,

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:52.039
and how could we get better 
at predicting them?

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.099
To answer that,

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:57.539
we need to understand some theories 
behind how earthquakes occur.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.794
Earth’s crust is made from several vast, 
jagged slabs of rock
