00:00:00.985 --> 00:00:02.528
I am a writer.

00:00:02.552 --> 00:00:06.288
Writing books is my profession
but it's more than that, of course.

00:00:06.312 --> 00:00:10.212
It is also my great lifelong
love and fascination.

00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:13.127
And I don't expect
that that's ever going to change.

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:18.162
But, that said, something
kind of peculiar has happened recently

00:00:18.186 --> 00:00:20.411
in my life and in my career,

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:25.178
which has caused me to have to recalibrate
my whole relationship with this work.

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:28.812
And the peculiar thing
is that I recently wrote this book,

00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:30.780
this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love"
