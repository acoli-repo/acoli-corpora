Recently I visited Beloit, Wisconsin.

00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:06.829
And I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer,

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:08.871
Roy Chapman Andrews.

00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:11.715
During his time at the American Museum of Natural History,

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:15.815
Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions,

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.550
like here in the Gobi Desert.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.958
He was quite a figure.

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.632
He was later, it's said, the basis of the Indiana Jones character.

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:24.829
And when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin,

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.962
I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.531
And I'm here to tell you,
