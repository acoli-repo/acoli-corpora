In a recent survey,

00:00:01.289 --> 00:00:04.459
a majority of respondents
picked their sense of smell

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:07.003
as the one they'd be
most willing to give up

00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:09.338
among the traditional five senses.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.340
But if you love food,

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:14.093
you should be giving your nose
much more credit.

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:17.221
Because itâ€™s actually our sense of smell

00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:21.601
that plays a huge role
in our ability to process flavor.

First, let's talk about how smell works,

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.152
from coffee to stinky trash.
