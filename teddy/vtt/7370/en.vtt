00:00:00.836 --> 00:00:03.636
The world that we live in
is not well-known.

00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:05.116
It's fragile.

00:00:05.116 --> 00:00:07.156
Itâ€™s rich in biodiversity.

00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:10.396

Geologists are beginning to call

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:26.156
going to have to
collectively come together

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:28.356
and address these challenges.

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.596
A sustainable future,
in my mind, is possible,
