00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:10.836
Steroids: they’re infamous 
for their use in sports.

00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:15.747
But they’re also found in inhalers, 
creams to treat poison ivy and eczema,

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:18.337
and shots to ease inflammation.

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:23.400
The steroids in these medicines aren’t 
the same as the ones used to build muscle.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.190
In fact, they’re all based on 
yet another steroid—

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.640
one our body produces naturally, 
and we can’t live without.
