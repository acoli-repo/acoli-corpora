00:00:00.481 --> 00:00:03.049
We live in an incredibly busy world.

00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:06.570
The pace of life is often frantic,
our minds are always busy,

00:00:06.594 --> 00:00:08.341
and we're always doing something.

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:11.487
So with that in mind,
I'd like you just to take a moment

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:16.101
to think, when did you last take
any time to do nothing?

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:19.046
Just 10 minutes, undisturbed?

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:21.601
And when I say nothing, I do mean nothing.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.221
So that's no emailing,
texting, no Internet,

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:27.021
no TV, no chatting, no eating, no reading.

00:00:28.303 --> 00:00:30.589
Not even sitting there
reminiscing about the past
