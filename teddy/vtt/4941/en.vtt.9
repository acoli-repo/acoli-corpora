00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:32.728
Skyscrapers have come a long way since 
Wright proposed his mile-high tower.

00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:35.426
What were once considered impossible ideas

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:38.076
have become architectural opportunities.

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:40.356
Today it may just be a matter of time

00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:44.356
until one building goes the extra mile.
