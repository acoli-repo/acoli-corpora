00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:08.465
In 1956,

00:00:08.465 --> 00:00:10.185
architect Frank Lloyd Wright

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.005
proposed a mile-high skyscraper.

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.845
It was going to be the world’s 
tallest building,

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:16.845
by a lot —

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:20.325
five times as high as the Eiffel Tower.

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:22.885
But many critics laughed at the architect,

00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:26.215
arguing that people would have to wait 
hours for an elevator,

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:30.575
or worse, that the tower would collapse 
under its own weight.
