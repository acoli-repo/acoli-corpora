00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.580
keeps this sizable structure standing.

00:02:32.588 --> 00:02:34.098
Besides defeating gravity,

00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:35.778
which pushes the building down,

00:02:35.778 --> 00:02:39.748
a skyscraper also needs to overcome 
the blowing wind,

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:41.923
which pushes from the side.

00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:43.343
On average days,

00:02:43.343 --> 00:02:49.263
wind can exert up to 17 pounds of force 
per square meter on a high-rise building–

00:02:49.263 --> 00:02:52.200
as heavy as a gust of bowling balls.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.710
Designing structures to be aerodynamic,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.090
like China’s sleek Shanghai Tower,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.740
can reduce that force by up to a quarter.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.460
And wind-bearing frames inside or 
outside the building
