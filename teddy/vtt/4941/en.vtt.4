WEBVTT

00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:00.673
can withstand about 8,000 tons of pressure
per square meter–

00:02:00.673 --> 00:02:05.540
the weight of over 1,200 
African elephants!

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.990
Of course, even if a building 
supports itself,

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.410
it still needs support from the ground.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.650
Without a foundation,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.650
buildings this heavy would sink, fall, 
or lean over.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.260
To prevent the roughly half a million 
ton tower from sinking,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.050
192 concrete and steel supports called 
piles were buried over 50 meters deep.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.570
The friction between the piles 
and the ground

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.580
keeps this sizable structure standing.
