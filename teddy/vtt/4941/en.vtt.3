00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:30.966
But this solution doesn’t quite translate 
to a city skyline–

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:34.746
a pyramid that tall would be roughly 
one-and-a-half miles wide,

00:01:34.746 --> 00:01:37.526
tough to squeeze into a city center.

00:01:37.526 --> 00:01:42.846
Fortunately, strong materials like 
concrete can avoid this impractical shape.

00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:47.951
And modern concrete blends are reinforced 
with steel-fibers for strength

00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:51.781
and water-reducing polymers 
to prevent cracking.

00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:56.333
The concrete in the world’s tallest tower,
Dubai’s Burj Khalifa,

00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:00.673
can withstand about 8,000 tons of pressure
per square meter–
