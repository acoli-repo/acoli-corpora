00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:30.575
or worse, that the tower would collapse 
under its own weight.

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:32.126
Most engineers agreed,

00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:34.506
and despite the publicity 
around the proposal,

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:37.756
the titanic tower was never built.

00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:38.576
But today,

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:41.956
bigger and bigger buildings are going up 
around the world.

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:46.246
Firms are even planning skyscrapers 
more than a kilometer tall,

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.516
like the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia,

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:51.806
three times the size of the Eiffel Tower.

00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:52.716
Very soon,

00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:56.376
Wright’s mile-high miracle 
may be a reality.

00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:58.256
So what exactly was stopping us

00:00:58.256 --> 00:01:01.436
from building these megastructures 
70 years ago,
