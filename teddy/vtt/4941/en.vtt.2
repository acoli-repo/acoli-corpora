00:00:58.256 --> 00:01:01.436
from building these megastructures 
70 years ago,

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:05.346
and how do we build something 
a mile high today?

00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:06.956
In any construction project,

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:11.616
each story of the structure needs to be 
able to support the stories on top of it.

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:12.726
The higher we build,

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:17.556
the higher the gravitational pressure 
from the upper stories on the lower ones.

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:20.753
This principle has long dictated 
the shape of our buildings,

00:01:20.753 --> 00:01:24.866
leading ancient architects to favor 
pyramids with wide foundations

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.146
that support lighter upper levels.

00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:30.966
But this solution doesn’t quite translate 
to a city skyline–
