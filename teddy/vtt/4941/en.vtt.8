00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:02.816
But quickly traveling through buildings 
this large is a challenge in itself.

00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:03.994
In Wright’s age,

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:08.394
the fastest elevators moved 
a mere 22 kilometers per hour.

00:04:08.394 --> 00:04:13.849
Thankfully, today’s elevators are much
faster, traveling over 70 km per hour

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.694
with future cabins potentially using 
frictionless magnetic rails

00:04:17.694 --> 00:04:19.274
for even higher speeds.

00:04:19.274 --> 00:04:23.314
And traffic management algorithms 
group riders by destination

00:04:23.314 --> 00:04:27.914
to get passengers and empty cabins 
where they need to be.

00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:32.728
Skyscrapers have come a long way since 
Wright proposed his mile-high tower.
