00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.460
And wind-bearing frames inside or 
outside the building

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.620
can absorb the remaining wind force,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.470
such as in Seoul’s Lotte Tower.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.540
But even after all these measures,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.560
you could still find yourself swaying back
and forth

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.420
more than a meter on top floors 
during a hurricane.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.260
To prevent the wind from 
rocking tower tops,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.690
many skyscrapers employ a counterweight 
weighing hundreds of tons

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.127
called a “tuned mass damper.”

00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:30.151
The Taipei 101, for instance,
