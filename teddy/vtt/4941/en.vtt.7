The Taipei 101, for instance,

00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:34.811
has suspended a giant metal orb 
above the 87th floor.

00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:36.514
When wind moves the building,

00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:38.774
this orb sways into action,

00:03:38.774 --> 00:03:41.634
absorbing the building’s kinetic energy.

00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:43.794
As its movements trail the tower’s,

00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:46.794
hydraulic cylinders between the ball 
and the building

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:49.484
convert that kinetic energy into heat,

00:03:49.484 --> 00:03:52.384
and stabilize the swaying structure.

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:54.656
With all these technologies in place,

00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:58.226
our mega-structures can stay 
standing and stable.

00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:02.816
But quickly traveling through buildings 
this large is a challenge in itself.
