00:00:01.747 --> 00:00:03.785
My talk today is about something

00:00:03.785 --> 00:00:06.118
maybe a couple of you have already heard about.

00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:08.452
It's called the Arab Spring.

00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:10.350
Anyone heard of it?

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.475
(Applause)

00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:18.220
So in 2011, power shifted,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.863
from the few to the many,

00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:24.618
from oval offices to central squares,

00:00:24.618 --> 00:00:27.611
from carefully guarded airwaves

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.298
to open-source networks.
