00:00:01.953 --> 00:00:06.359
The most astounding place I've ever been
is the Mosquitia Rain Forest in Honduras.

00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:09.840
I've done archaeological fieldwork
all over the world,

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:12.951
so I thought I knew what to expect
venturing into the jungle,

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:14.416
but I was wrong.

00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:17.053
For the first time
in my life, I might add.

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:19.386
(Laughter)

00:00:20.172 --> 00:00:22.335
First of all, it's freezing.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.668
It's 90 degrees, but you're
soaking wet from the humidity,

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:30.235
and the canopy of trees is so thick
that sunlight never reaches the surface.
