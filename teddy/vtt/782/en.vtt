00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Basically, there's a major demographic event going on.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is an economic tipping point. So the world now is a map of connectivity.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West. That's over.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The aggregate numbers are overwhelming.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying out.
