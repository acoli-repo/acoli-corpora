00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Have you ever wondered

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
why extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim-majority countries

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
over the course of the last decade?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Have you ever wondered

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
how such a situation can be turned around?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and thought, "How could we have predicted that?"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or "How could we have better prepared for that?"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Well my personal story, my personal journey,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
what brings me to the TED stage here today,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in Muslim-majority countries

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
over the course of the last decades, at least, and beyond.
