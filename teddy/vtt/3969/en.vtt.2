00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.456
My uncle started using a walker to walk,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.696
and to take a turn,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.776
he literally had to take
one step at a time, like this,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.040
and it took forever.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.416
So this person, who used to be
the center of attention

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.496
in every family gathering,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.600
was suddenly hiding behind people.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.760
He was hiding from the pitiful look
in people's eyes.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.520
And he's not the only one in the world.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.776
Every year, 60,000 people
are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.840
and this number is only rising.
