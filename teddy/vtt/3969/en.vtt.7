"Well, let me show you how I do it."

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.920
Let's take a look at what I saw.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.616
So he took really long
to reach this position,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.496
and then all this while, I'm thinking,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.456
"Oh my God, is he really going to do it?

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.376
Is he really, really going to do it
without his walker?"

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.600
And then ...

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.600
(Laughter)

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.840
And the turns, he took them so easily.
