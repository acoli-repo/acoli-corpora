00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.360
But I really needed to dig deeper
to get a new perspective.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.736
So I thought, well,
let's observe him in his daily tasks,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.120
while he's eating, while he's watching TV.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.856
And then, when I was actually
observing him walking to his dining table,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.056
it struck me, this man who finds it
so difficult to walk on flat land,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.800
how does he climb a staircase?

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.016
Because in India we do not have
a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.056
like in the developed countries.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.200
One actually has to climb the stairs.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.176
So he told me,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.200
"Well, let me show you how I do it."
