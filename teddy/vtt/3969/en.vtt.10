00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.016
I call this the staircase illusion,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.616
and actually when the staircase illusion
abruptly ended, he froze,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.656
and this is called freezing of gait.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.896
So it happens a lot,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.856
so why not have a staircase illusion
flowing through all their rooms,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.240
making them feel much more confident?

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.096
You know, technology is not always it.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.896
What we need are human-centered solutions.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.136
I could have easily
made it into a projection,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.496
or a Google Glass, or something like that.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.840
But I stuck to simple print on the floor.
