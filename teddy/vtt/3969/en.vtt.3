00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.840
and this number is only rising.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.776
As designers, we dream that our designs
solve these multifaceted problems,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.616
one solution that solves it all,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.920
but it need not always be like that.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.496
You can also target simple problems

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.440
and create small solutions for them
and eventually make a big impact.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.496
So my aim here was
to not cure Parkinson's,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.696
but to make their everyday tasks
much more simple,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.120
and then make an impact.
