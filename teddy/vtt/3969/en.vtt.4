00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.600
Well, the first thing I targeted
was tremors, right?

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.976
My uncle told me that he had stopped
drinking coffee or tea in public

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.479
just out of embarrassment,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.480
so, well, I designed the no-spill cup.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.936
It works just purely on its form.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.216
The curve on top deflects the liquid
back inside every time they have tremors,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.080
and this keeps the liquid inside
compared to a normal cup.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.720
But the key here is that it is not tagged
as a Parkinson's patient product.
