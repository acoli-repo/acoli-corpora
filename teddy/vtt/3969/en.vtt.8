00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.480
So -- shocked?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.400
Well, I was too.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.296
So this person who could not
walk on flat land

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.400
was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.375
On researching this, I realized that
it's because it's a continuous motion.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.536
There's this other man
who also suffers from the same symptoms

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.976
and uses a walker,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.096
but the moment he's put on a cycle,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.816
all his symptoms vanish,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.920
because it is a continuous motion.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.856
So the key for me was to translate
this feeling of walking on a staircase
