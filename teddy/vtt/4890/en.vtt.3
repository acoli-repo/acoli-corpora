00:01:27.613 --> 00:01:30.793
the absurd blends its hopelessness with humor.

00:01:30.793 --> 00:01:33.373
This is reflected in Beckett’s unique approach

00:01:33.373 --> 00:01:35.493
to genre in Waiting for Godot,

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:39.633
which he branded “a tragicomedy in two acts."

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:42.083
Tragically, the characters are locked in an

00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:45.203
existential conundrum: they wait in vain

00:01:45.203 --> 00:01:47.963
for an unknown figure to give them a sense of purpose,

00:01:47.963 --> 00:01:49.863
but their only sense of purpose

00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:52.583
comes from the act of waiting,

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:55.263
While they wait, they sink into boredom,

00:01:55.263 --> 00:02:00.253
express religious dread and contemplate suicide.
