00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:09.094
A shabby man named Estragon,

00:00:09.094 --> 00:00:12.924
sits near a tree at dusk and struggles to remove his boot.

00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:14.804
He’s soon joined by his friend Vladimir,

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:17.104
who reminds his anxious companion that

00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:20.564
they must wait here for someone called Godot.

00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:23.964
So begins a vexing cycle in which the two debate

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:26.484
when Godot will come, why they’re waiting,

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:29.794
and whether they’re even at the right tree.

00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:32.994
From here, Waiting for Godot only gets stranger -
