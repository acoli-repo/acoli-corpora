From here, Waiting for Godot only gets stranger -

00:00:32.994 --> 00:00:35.504
but it’s considered a play that changed

00:00:35.504 --> 00:00:37.634
the face of modern drama.

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:41.963
Written by Samuel Beckett between 1949 and 1955,

00:00:41.963 --> 00:00:45.623
it offers a simple but stirring question -

00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:49.873
what should the characters do?

00:00:49.873 --> 00:00:52.963
Estragon: Don’t let's do anything. It's safer.

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:56.663
Vladimir: Let’s wait and see what he says.

00:00:56.663 --> 00:00:57.993
Estragon: Who?

00:00:57.993 --> 00:00:59.663
Vladimir: Godot.

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:01.693
Estragon: Good idea.
