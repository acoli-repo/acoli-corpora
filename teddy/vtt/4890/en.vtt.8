their language often goes in circles as the two

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:08.405
bicker and banter, lose their train of thought,

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:11.285
and pick up right where they left off:



00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:14.335
Vladimir: We could start all over again perhaps

00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:16.475
Estragon: That should be easy

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:19.395
Vladimir: It’s the start that’s difficult

00:04:19.395 --> 00:04:21.815
Estragon: You can start from anything

00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:24.285
Vladimir: Yes, but you have to decide.

00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:28.175

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:31.245
the world onstage doesn’t always make sense.
