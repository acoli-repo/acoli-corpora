00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:01.693
Estragon: Good idea.

00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:04.223
Such cryptic dialogue and circular reasoning are

00:01:04.223 --> 00:01:07.163
key features of the Theatre of the Absurd,

00:01:07.163 --> 00:01:10.413
a movement which emerged after the Second World War

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:12.263
and found artists struggling

00:01:12.263 --> 00:01:15.183
to find meaning in devastation.

00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:19.343
The absurdists deconstructed plot, character and language

00:01:19.343 --> 00:01:21.853
to question their meaning and share

00:01:21.853 --> 00:01:25.633
their profound uncertainty on stage.

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.613
While this may sound grim,

00:01:27.613 --> 00:01:30.793
the absurd blends its hopelessness with humor.
