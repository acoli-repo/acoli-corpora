00:01:55.284 --> 00:02:00.914
The energy used to power the contraction
comes from a molecule called ATP.

00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:05.694
ATP also helps pump the ions back 
across the membrane afterward,

00:02:05.694 --> 00:02:10.207
resetting the balance of sodium 
and potassium on either side.

00:02:10.207 --> 00:02:13.987
This whole process repeats 
every time a muscle contracts.

00:02:13.987 --> 00:02:15.217
With each contraction,

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.437
energy in the form of ATP gets used up,

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:21.307
waste products like lactic 
acid are generated,

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.727
and some ions drift away from the muscle’s
cell membrane,

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:27.907
leaving a smaller and 
smaller group behind.

00:02:27.907 --> 00:02:31.867
Though muscle cells use up ATP as they 
contract repeatedly,
