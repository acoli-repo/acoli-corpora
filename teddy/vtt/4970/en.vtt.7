00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:34.363
muscle fatigue will subside as these ions
replenish throughout the muscle.

00:03:34.363 --> 00:03:36.190
The more regularly you exercise,

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.960
the longer it takes for muscle fatigue 
to set in each time.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.790
That’s because the stronger you are,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.990
the fewer times this cycle of nerve signal
from the brain

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.910
to contraction in the muscle
has to be repeated

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.830
to lift a certain amount of weight.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.080
Fewer cycles means slower ion depletion,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.380
so as your physical fitness improves,

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.100
you can exercise for longer 
at the same intensity.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.350
Many muscles grow with exercise,
