00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:30.351
but these factors alone don’t account 
for muscle fatigue.

00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:32.371
There’s another major contributor:

00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:36.671
the muscle’s ability to respond 
to signals from the brain.

00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:38.741
To understand the roots of muscle fatigue,

00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:43.461
it helps to know how a muscle contracts 
in response to a signal from a nerve.

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:47.659
These signals travel from the brain to the
muscles in a fraction of a second

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.476
via long, thin cells called motor neurons.

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:55.616
The motor neuron and the muscle cell 
are separated by a tiny gap,

00:00:55.616 --> 00:01:00.230
and the exchange of particles 
across this gap enables the contraction.
