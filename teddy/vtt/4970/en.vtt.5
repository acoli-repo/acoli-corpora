00:02:27.907 --> 00:02:31.867
Though muscle cells use up ATP as they 
contract repeatedly,

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:33.917
they are always making more,

00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:34.927
so most of the time

00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:39.877
even heavily fatigued muscles still 
have not depleted this energy source.

00:02:39.877 --> 00:02:42.587
And though many waste products are acidic,

00:02:42.587 --> 00:02:46.437
fatigued muscles still maintain pH 
within normal limits,

00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:50.337
indicating that the tissue is effectively
clearing these wastes.

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.607
But eventually, over the course of 
repeated contractions

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:59.027
there may not be sufficient concentrations
of potassium, sodium or calcium ions

00:02:59.027 --> 00:03:01.757
immediately available near 
the muscle cell membrane
