00:02:59.027 --> 00:03:01.757
immediately available near 
the muscle cell membrane

00:03:01.757 --> 00:03:04.157
to reset the system properly.

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:06.187
So even if the brain sends a signal,

00:03:06.187 --> 00:03:11.057
the muscle cell can’t generate the action
potential necessary to contract.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:14.187
Even when ions like sodium, 
potassium or calcium

00:03:14.187 --> 00:03:16.967
are depleted in or around the muscle cell,

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:19.957
these ions are plentiful 
elsewhere in the body.

00:03:19.957 --> 00:03:20.847
With a little time,

00:03:20.847 --> 00:03:23.427
they will flow back to the areas 
where they’re needed,

00:03:23.427 --> 00:03:27.517
sometimes with the help of active sodium
and potassium pumps.

00:03:27.517 --> 00:03:29.283
So if you pause and rest,

00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:34.363
muscle fatigue will subside as these ions
replenish throughout the muscle.
