The flux of these charged particles 
is a crucial step for muscle contraction:

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:38.306
the change in charge creates an electrical
signal called an action potential

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:40.346
that spreads through the muscle cell,

00:01:40.346 --> 00:01:44.416
stimulating the release of calcium
that’s stored inside it.

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:47.466
This flood of calcium causes 
the muscle to contract

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:51.774
by enabling proteins buried in the muscle 
fibers to lock together

00:01:51.774 --> 00:01:53.664
and ratchet towards each other,

00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:55.284
pulling the muscle tight.

00:01:55.284 --> 00:02:00.914
The energy used to power the contraction
comes from a molecule called ATP.
