00:00:55.616 --> 00:01:00.230
and the exchange of particles 
across this gap enables the contraction.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.780
On one side of the gap,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.020
the motor neuron contains a 
neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.264
On the other side,

00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:09.764
charged particles, or ions,

00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:11.854
line the muscle cell’s membrane:

00:01:11.854 --> 00:01:16.074
potassium on the inside, 
and sodium on the outside.

00:01:16.074 --> 00:01:18.224
In response to a signal from the brain,

00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:20.904
the motor neuron releases acetylcholine,

00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:24.714
which triggers pores on the muscle 
cell membrane to open.

00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:28.214
Sodium flows in, and potassium flows out.

00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:33.364
The flux of these charged particles 
is a crucial step for muscle contraction:
