00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.239
You're lifting weights.

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:10.099
The first time feels easy,

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.879
but each lift takes more and more effort 
until you can’t continue.

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.184
Inside your arms,

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:21.074
the muscles responsible for the lifting
have become unable to contract.

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:23.311
Why do our muscles get fatigued?

00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.991
We often blame lactic acid 
or running out of energy,

00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:30.351
but these factors alone don’t account 
for muscle fatigue.
