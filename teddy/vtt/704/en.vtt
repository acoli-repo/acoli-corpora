00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
One of the things that

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
defines a TEDster

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is you've taken your passion,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and you've turned it into stewardship.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You actually put action to the issues you care about.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But what you're going to find eventually is

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
you may need to actually get elected officials

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to help you out.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, how do you do that?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
One of the things I should probably tell you is,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and that sort of warped my framework.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, when you start to think about politicians,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you've got to realize these are strange creatures.
