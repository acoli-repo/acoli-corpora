when someone gets us a gift,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.960
we are happy but we are happier when
we don’t know why we got the gift.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.776
Once we get to know why we got the gift,
our happiness lessens.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.646
So uncertainty brings joy to life,
but we often forget this

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.960
and think of uncertainty as our enemy

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.960
and are constantly 
trying to put things in order.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.960
Like if we want admission for our children
