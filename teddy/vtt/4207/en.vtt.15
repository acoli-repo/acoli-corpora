Jokes apart, when I was in school I used
to walk around with a flag that said,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.256
“Do your best and leave the rest.”

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.296
I think this is the best
solution to face uncertainty.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.936
I will do my best, success, God willing,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.050
will follow but even if it
does not, this was my best.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.640

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:53.536
I saw him backstage, 
upstairs preparing his speech.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.896
I have seen a lot of people
prepare their speech

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.496
somebody is sweating,
someone is pacing up and down.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.656
But he was relaxed, so relaxed,
like he was rid of all anxieties.
