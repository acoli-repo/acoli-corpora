00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.920
the first who try to keep 
everything in their hands,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.920
try to have control over everything;

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.296
and the second set see what googly life
throws at them and bat accordingly.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.560
So who, according to you,
is happier between the two?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.496
OK, now let me tell you a story:

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.860
many years ago there lived 
a man who was a crybaby.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.720
He used to cry about everything.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.256
Why does this happen to me?

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.423
Why don’t I have control
on anything in life?

00:01:27.447 --> 00:01:33.656
He got tired of looking for answers to these
questions and sat down to meditate.
