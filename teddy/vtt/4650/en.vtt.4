00:01:57.093 --> 00:02:00.635
Teddy still gets all of the customers
north in Teddy territory,

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.702
but now you split the 25% of people
in between the two carts.

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:07.584
Day three of the ice cream wars,
you get to the beach early,

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:10.167
and set up right in the center
of Teddy territory,

00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:13.632
assuming you'll serve
the 75% of beachgoers to your south,

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:17.026
leaving your cousin to sell
to the 25% of customers to the north.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.520
When Teddy arrives,
he sets up just south of you

00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:22.451
stealing all of the southerly customers,

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.259
and leaving you with a small group
of people to the north.

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:29.336
Not to be outdone, you move 10 paces
south of Teddy to regain your customers.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.836
When you take a mid-day break,
Teddy shuffles 10 paces south of you,
