Why are gas stations always built
right next to other gas stations?

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.815
Why can I drive for a mile
without finding a coffee shop

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.143
and then stumble
across three on the same corner?

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:27.051
Why do grocery stores,
auto repair shops and restaurants

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:28.718
always seem to exist in groups

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:31.901
instead of being spread evenly
throughout a community?
