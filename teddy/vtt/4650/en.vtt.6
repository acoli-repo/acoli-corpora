00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:01.398
Your original strategy,

00:03:01.422 --> 00:03:04.446
where you were each a quarter mile
from the middle of the beach,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.086
didn't last, because it wasn't
a Nash Equilibrium.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.936
Either of you could move your cart
towards the other to sell more ice cream.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.246
With both of you now
in the center of the beach,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.902
you can't reposition your cart
closer to your furthest customers

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:19.212
without making your current
customers worse off.

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:22.568
However, you no longer have
a socially optimal solution,

00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:24.592
since customers at either end of the beach

00:03:24.616 --> 00:03:27.602
have to walk further than necessary
to get a sweet treat.

00:03:27.626 --> 00:03:29.570
Think about all the fast food chains,

00:03:29.594 --> 00:03:32.271
clothing boutiques,
or mobile phone kiosks at the mall.
