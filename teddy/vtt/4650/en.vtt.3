walk to the closest cart.

00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:33.751
No one walks
more than a quarter of a mile,

00:01:33.775 --> 00:01:36.653
and both vendors sell
to half of the beachgoers.

00:01:36.677 --> 00:01:40.836
Game theorists consider
this a socially optimal solution.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.352
It minimizes the maximum number
of steps any visitor must take

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:46.352
in order to reach an ice cream cart.

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:48.235

00:01:51.058 --> 00:01:54.301
You return to your location
a quarter mile south of center

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:57.069
and get the 25% of customers
to the south of you.

00:01:57.093 --> 00:02:00.635
Teddy still gets all of the customers
north in Teddy territory,
