00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.118
One day you show up at work

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:03.522
just as your cousin Teddy
is arriving at the beach

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:04.900
with his own ice cream cart.

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:06.317
In fact, he's selling

00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:08.516
exactly the same type
of ice cream as you are.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.793
You agree that you will split
the beach in half.

00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:13.634
In order to ensure that customers
don't have to walk too far

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:16.572
you set up your cart a quarter mile
south of the beach center,

00:01:16.596 --> 00:01:18.412
right in the middle of your territory.

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:20.751
Teddy sets up a quarter mile
north of the center,

00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:22.768
in the middle of Teddy territory.

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:25.935
With this agreement, everyone south
of you buys ice cream from you.

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.489
Everyone north of Teddy buys from him,
and the 50% of beachgoers in between

00:01:29.513 --> 00:01:31.172
walk to the closest cart.
