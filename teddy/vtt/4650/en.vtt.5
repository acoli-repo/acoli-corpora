00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.836
When you take a mid-day break,
Teddy shuffles 10 paces south of you,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.535
and again, steals back all the customers
to the far end of the beach.

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.134
Throughout the course of the day,

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.417
both of you continue
to periodically move south

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.836
towards the bulk of the ice cream buyers,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.860
until both of you eventually end up
at the center of the beach,

00:02:45.884 --> 00:02:49.719
back to back, each serving 50%
of the ice-cream-hungry beachgoers.

00:02:49.743 --> 00:02:51.935
At this point, you
and your competitive cousin

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.951
have reached what game theorists
call a Nash Equilibrium -

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.774
the point where neither of you
can improve your position

00:02:57.798 --> 00:02:59.937
by deviating from your current strategy.

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:01.398
Your original strategy,
