00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.879
Customers may be better served

00:03:33.903 --> 00:03:36.164
by distributing services
throughout a community,

00:03:36.188 --> 00:03:39.520
but this leaves businesses vulnerable
to aggressive competition.

00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:42.786
In the real world, customers come
from more than one direction,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.715
and businesses are free to compete
with marketing strategies,

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.501
by differentiating their product line,
and with price cuts,

00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:50.252
but at the heart of their strategy,

00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:53.621
companies like to keep their competition
as close as possible.
