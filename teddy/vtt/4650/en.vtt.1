instead of being spread evenly
throughout a community?

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:33.456
While there are several factors

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.164
that might go into deciding
where to place your business,

00:00:36.188 --> 00:00:39.796
clusters of similar companies can
be explained by a very simple story

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.292
called Hotelling's Model
of Spatial Competition.

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.217
Imagine that you sell
ice cream at the beach.

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.051
Your beach is one mile long
and you have no competition.

00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:51.269
Where would you place your cart
in order to sell the most product?

00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:52.368
In the middle.

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:55.418
The one-half-mile walk may
be too far for some people

00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:56.741
at each end of the beach,

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.770
but your cart serves
as many people as possible.

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.118
One day you show up at work
