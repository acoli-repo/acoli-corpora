00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.503
of how, today, we judge the 
success of countries:

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:05.052
what we know best as
Gross Domestic Product,

00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:07.363
GDP.

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:10.266
GDP has defined and shaped our lives

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.864
for the last 80 years.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:14.681
And today I want to talk about 


00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:18.520
a different way to measure
the success of countries,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.669
a different way to define 
and shape our lives

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:24.926
for the next 80 years.

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:26.817
But first, we have to understand

00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:30.726
how GDP came to
dominate our lives.
