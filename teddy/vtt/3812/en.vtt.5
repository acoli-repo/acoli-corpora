00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:30.110
"The welfare of a nation can, therefore,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.664
scarcely be inferred

00:02:31.664 --> 00:02:33.664
from a measurement of 
national income

00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:35.601
as defined above."

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:38.969
It's not the greatest sound 
bite in the world,

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.598
and it's dressed up in the cautious 
language of the economist.

00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:44.774
But his message was clear:

00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:46.508
GDP is a tool

00:02:46.508 --> 00:02:49.566
to help us measure
economic performance.

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:52.534
It's not a measure
of our well-being.

00:02:52.534 --> 00:02:57.351
And it shouldn't be a guide 
to all decision making.

00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:00.221
But we have ignored Kuznets' warning.
