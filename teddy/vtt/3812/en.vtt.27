GDP was not handed down from 
God on tablets of stone. (Laughter)

00:13:30.365 --> 00:13:34.360
It's a measurement tool
invented in the 20th century

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.152
to address the challenges
of the 20th century.

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.004
In the 21st century,

00:13:41.004 --> 00:13:43.456
we face new challenges:

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:46.564
aging, obesity, climate change, and so on.

00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:48.223
To face those challenges,

00:13:48.223 --> 00:13:50.243
we need new tools of measurement,

00:13:50.243 --> 00:13:53.997
new ways of valuing progress.

00:13:53.997 --> 00:13:56.395
Imagine if we could measure

00:13:56.395 --> 00:13:58.925
what nonprofits, charities,

00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:00.894
volunteers, civil society organizations
