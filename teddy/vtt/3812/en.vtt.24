00:11:57.532 --> 00:12:00.150
And that's what the Social 
Progress Index does:

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.760
It reframes the debate about development,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.820
not just about GDP alone,

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.399
but inclusive, sustainable growth

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:11.818
that brings real improvements 
in people's lives.

00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:14.394
And it's not just about countries.

00:12:14.394 --> 00:12:17.184
Earlier this year,

00:12:17.184 --> 00:12:21.751
with our friends from the Imazon 
nonprofit here in Brazil,

00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:26.408
we launched the first subnational 
Social Progress Index.

00:12:26.408 --> 00:12:28.868
We did it for the Amazon region.

00:12:28.868 --> 00:12:32.655
It's an area the size of 
Europe, 24 million people,
