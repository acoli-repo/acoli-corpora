00:10:28.173 --> 00:10:30.045
in poorer countries.

00:10:30.045 --> 00:10:32.242
But go on a bit further up the curve,

00:10:32.242 --> 00:10:34.351
and then we see it flattening out.

00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:36.603
Each extra dollar of GDP

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:39.839
is buying less and less social progress.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.513
And with more and more
of the world's population

00:10:42.513 --> 00:10:45.076
living on this part of the curve,

00:10:45.076 --> 00:10:47.300
it means GDP is becoming

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.084
less and less useful

00:10:49.084 --> 00:10:51.600
as a guide to our development.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.747
I'll show you an example of Brazil.

00:10:53.747 --> 00:10:54.970
Here's Brazil:

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.837
social progress of about 70 out of 100,

00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:00.335
GDP per capita about 
14,000 dollars a year.
