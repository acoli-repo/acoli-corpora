00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:30.816
increase your GDP,

00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:32.706
while stagnating or going backwards

00:11:32.706 --> 00:11:34.055
on social progress.

00:11:34.055 --> 00:11:35.241
We don't want Brazil

00:11:35.241 --> 00:11:36.973
to become like Russia.

00:11:36.973 --> 00:11:39.288
What you really want is for Brazil

00:11:39.288 --> 00:11:44.241
to get ever more efficient at creating 
social progress from its GDP,

00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:46.539
so it becomes more like New Zealand.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.119
And what that means is that

00:11:48.119 --> 00:11:50.776
Brazil needs to prioritize social progress

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:52.468
in its development plan

00:11:52.468 --> 00:11:54.880
and see that it's not just growth alone,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.532
it's growth with social progress.

00:11:57.532 --> 00:12:00.150
And that's what the Social 
Progress Index does:
