00:06:56.934 --> 00:07:01.140
what I've done here is put on the 
vertical axis social progress.

00:07:01.146 --> 00:07:02.481
Higher is better.

00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:04.503
And then, just for comparison,

00:07:04.503 --> 00:07:05.825
just for fun,

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:09.684
on the horizontal axis
is GDP per capita.

00:07:09.693 --> 00:07:11.583
Further to the right is more.

00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:14.737
So the country in the world

00:07:14.737 --> 00:07:18.127
with the highest social progress,

00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:21.486
the number one country on social progress

00:07:21.486 --> 00:07:24.882
is New Zealand.

00:07:24.882 --> 00:07:28.398
(Applause)

00:07:28.398 --> 00:07:31.215
Well done! Never been; must go.
