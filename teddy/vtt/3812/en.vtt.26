00:12:58.014 --> 00:13:01.250
while protecting that 
precious global asset

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.221
that is the Amazon Rainforest.

00:13:04.221 --> 00:13:06.122
And this is just the beginning,

00:13:06.122 --> 00:13:08.501
You can create a Social Progress Index

00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:13.656
for any state, region, 
city or municipality.

00:13:13.656 --> 00:13:15.729
We all know and love TEDx;

00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:17.971
this is Social Pogress-x.

00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:21.165
This is a tool for anyone to come and use.

00:13:21.165 --> 00:13:24.045
Contrary to the way we 
sometimes talk about it,

00:13:24.045 --> 00:13:30.365
GDP was not handed down from 
God on tablets of stone. (Laughter)
