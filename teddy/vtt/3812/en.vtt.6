00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:00.221
But we have ignored Kuznets' warning.

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.777
We live in a world where

00:03:01.777 --> 00:03:04.900
GDP is the benchmark of success

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.177
in a global economy.

00:03:07.177 --> 00:03:10.406
Our politicians boast when
GDP goes up.

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:11.690
Markets move

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.564
and trillions of dollars of capital

00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:14.988
move around the world

00:03:14.988 --> 00:03:16.739
based on which countries
are going up

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.580
and which countries 
are going down,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.204
all measured in GDP.

00:03:21.204 --> 00:03:22.533
Our societies have become

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:26.908
engines to create more GDP.

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:30.443
But we know that GDP is flawed.
