The Social Progress Index

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:31.502
begins by defining what it

00:05:31.502 --> 00:05:33.449
means to be a good society

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.940
based around three dimensions.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.035
The first is, does everyone have
the basic needs for survival:

00:05:41.035 --> 00:05:43.885
food, water, shelter, safety?

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.605
Secondly, does everyone have

00:05:46.605 --> 00:05:49.436
access to the building blocks 
to improve their lives:

00:05:49.436 --> 00:05:53.948
education, information, health
and sustainable environment?

00:05:53.948 --> 00:05:57.632
And then third, does every 
individual have access

00:05:57.632 --> 00:06:00.412
to a chance to pursue their goals
