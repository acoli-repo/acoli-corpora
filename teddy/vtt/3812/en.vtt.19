00:09:28.682 --> 00:09:30.364
and I'd like to step back a bit.

00:09:30.364 --> 00:09:31.818
So let me take away these countries,

00:09:31.818 --> 00:09:34.732
and then pop in the regression line.

00:09:34.732 --> 00:09:36.385
So this shows the average relationship

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:38.896
between GDP and social progress.

00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:41.138
The first thing to notice,

00:09:41.138 --> 00:09:42.993
is that there's lots of noise

00:09:42.993 --> 00:09:44.690
around the trend line.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.275
And what this shows,

00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:49.157
what this empirically demonstrates,

00:09:49.157 --> 00:09:52.192
is that GDP is not destiny.

00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:55.395
At every level of GDP per capita,

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:58.593
there are opportunities
for more social progress,

00:09:58.593 --> 00:10:00.596
risks of less.
