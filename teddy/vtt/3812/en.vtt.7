00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:30.443
But we know that GDP is flawed.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.973
It ignores the environment.

00:03:32.973 --> 00:03:36.629
It counts bombs and prisons as progress.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.871
It can't count happiness or community.

00:03:39.878 --> 00:03:44.621
And it has nothing to say 
about fairness or justice.

00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.321
Is it any surprise that our world,

00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:50.155
marching to the drumbeat of GDP,

00:03:50.155 --> 00:03:53.432
is teetering on the brink
of environmental disaster

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:56.938
and filled with anger and conflict?

00:03:56.938 --> 00:04:01.331
We need a better way
to measure our societies,
