00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:04.495

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:08.183

we have the technology

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.498
to gather and analyze data

00:05:10.498 --> 00:05:14.545
in ways that would have been
unimaginable to Kuznets.

00:05:14.545 --> 00:05:19.428
Today, I'd like to introduce you 
to the Social Progress Index.

00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:22.155

00:05:24.912 --> 00:05:28.563
It's a whole new way
of looking at the world.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.179
