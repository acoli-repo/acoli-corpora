00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:04.513
On January 4, 1934,

00:00:04.513 --> 00:00:07.529
a young man delivered a report

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.914
to the United States Congress

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:11.868
that 80 years on,

00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:16.528
still shapes the lives of
everyone in this room today,

00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:22.222
still shapes the lives of
everyone on this planet.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.102
That young man wasn't a politician,

00:00:25.102 --> 00:00:27.101
he wasn't a businessman,

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:28.438
a civil rights activist

00:00:28.438 --> 00:00:30.213
or a faith leader.
