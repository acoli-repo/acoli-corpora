00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:01.306
Beating South Africa,

00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:02.599
then Russia,

00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:03.733
then China

00:09:03.733 --> 00:09:05.307
and then India.

00:09:05.307 --> 00:09:07.672
Tucked away on the right-hand side,

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:11.025
you will see a dot of a 
country with a lot of GDP

00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:12.968
but not a huge amount 
of social progress —

00:09:12.968 --> 00:09:14.946
that's Kuwait.

00:09:14.946 --> 00:09:16.637
Just above Brazil

00:09:16.637 --> 00:09:18.956
is a social progress superpower —

00:09:18.956 --> 00:09:20.456
that's Costa Rica.

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:24.431
It's got a level of social progress the same 
as some Western European countries,

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:26.400
with a much lower GDP.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.682
Now, my slide is getting 
a little cluttered

00:09:28.682 --> 00:09:30.364
and I'd like to step back a bit.
