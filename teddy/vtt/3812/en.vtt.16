00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:00.495
Here's the United States —

00:08:00.495 --> 00:08:03.242
considerably richer than New Zealand,

00:08:03.242 --> 00:08:05.688
but with a lower level of social progress.

00:08:05.688 --> 00:08:08.340
And then here's Senegal —

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.337
it's got a higher level of 
social progress than Chad,

00:08:12.337 --> 00:08:14.286
but the same level of GDP.

00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:16.035
So what's going on? Well, look.

00:08:16.035 --> 00:08:18.536
Let me bring in the rest of 
the countries of the world,

00:08:18.536 --> 00:08:20.744
the 132 we've been able to measure,

00:08:20.744 --> 00:08:23.082
each one represented by a dot.

00:08:23.082 --> 00:08:24.581
There we go. Lots of dots.

00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:26.323
Now, obviously I can't do all of them,

00:08:26.323 --> 00:08:28.056
so a few highlights for you:

00:08:28.056 --> 00:08:32.876
The highest ranked G7 country is Canada.
