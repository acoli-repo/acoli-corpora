We need a better way
to measure our societies,

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:06.724
a measure based on the real 
things that matter to real people.

00:04:06.724 --> 00:04:08.686
Do I have enough to eat?

00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:10.762
Can I read and write?

00:04:10.762 --> 00:04:12.500
Am I safe?

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.655
Do I have rights?

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:17.784
Do I live in a society where
I'm not discriminated against?

00:04:17.784 --> 00:04:24.222
Is my future and the future of my children 
prevented from environmental destruction?

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.113
These are questions that GDP

00:04:26.113 --> 00:04:31.016
does not and cannot answer.
