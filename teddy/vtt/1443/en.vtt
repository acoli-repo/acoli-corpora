00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
How many of you had to fill out a web form

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:03.536
where you've been asked to read

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.696
a distorted sequence
of characters like this?

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.673
How many of you found it really annoying?

00:00:07.697 --> 00:00:08.796
(Laughter)

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.556
OK, outstanding. So I invented that.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.416
(Laughter)

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.296
Or I was one of the people who did it.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.856
That thing is called a CAPTCHA.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.016
And it is there to make sure
you, the entity filling out the form,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.896
are a human and not a computer program

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.496
that was written to submit
the form millions of times.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.176
The reason it works is because humans,
at least non-visually-impaired humans,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.616
have no trouble reading
these distorted characters,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.616
whereas programs can't do it as well yet.
