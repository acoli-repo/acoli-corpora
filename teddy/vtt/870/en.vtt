00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All human life,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
all life, depends on plants.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Just think for a moment.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or you live in a big city,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
everything comes back to plants in the end:

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
whether it's for the food, the medicine,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the fuel, the construction, the clothing, all the obvious things;

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that matter to us so much;

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or whether it's soil formation,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or the effect on the atmosphere,
