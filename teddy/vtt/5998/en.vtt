In 1996, a British Airways plane
flew from New York to London

00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:15.538
in a record-breaking 
two hours and 53 minutes.

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:19.163
Today, however, passengers flying 
the same route

00:00:19.163 --> 00:00:24.413
can expect to spend no less than six hours
in the airâ€” twice as long.

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:28.746
So why, in a world where everything 
seems to be getting faster,

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:31.579
have commercial flights lagged behind?
