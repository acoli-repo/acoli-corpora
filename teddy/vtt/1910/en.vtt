00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is an example of a real meteorite,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and you can see all the melting of the iron

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and just how much of it survives and melts.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
From a meteorite from space,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we’re over here with an original Sputnik.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is not a copy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The space age began 50 years ago in October,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like.
