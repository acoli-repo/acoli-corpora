00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.356
it's not the vaccine in your body
that protects you.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.756
It's your own immune system

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.916
that's developed resistance and resilience
to this bacteria that fights it off,

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.076
and you actually never get the infection,

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.156
which is very different
from, say, our treatments. Right?

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.996
In that case, you get the infection,
you're exposed to the bacteria,

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.876
you're sick, and then you take,
say, an antibiotic which cures it,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.140
and those drugs are actually working
to kill the bacteria.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.276
Or similar to as I said before,
with this palliative,

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.156
you'll take something
that will suppress the symptoms,

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.876
but it won't treat
the underlying infection,
