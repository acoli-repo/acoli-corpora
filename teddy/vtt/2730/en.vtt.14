00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.036
And it was this flexibility
in our thinking

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.996
that let us recognize
that iproniazid and imipramine

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.116
could be repurposed in this way,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.116
which led us to the serotonin hypothesis,

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.140
which we then, ironically, fixated on.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.516
This is brain signaling, serotonin,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.796
from an SSRI commercial.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.180
In case you're not clear,
this is a dramatization.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.716
And in science, we try
and remove our bias, right,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.116
by running double-blinded experiments

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.836
or being statistically agnostic
as to what our results will be.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.156
But bias creeps in more insidiously
in what we choose to study
