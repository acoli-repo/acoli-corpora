00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.036
So accidental discovery
is not uncommon in science,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.196
but it requires more
than just a happy accident.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.660
You have to be able to recognize it
for discovery to occur.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.236

But first, a bit more background.
