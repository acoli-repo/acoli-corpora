00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.596
someone had to be able to recognize

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.036
that a drug that was designed
to do one thing --

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.636
treat tuberculosis
or suppress allergies --

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.396
could be used to do
something very different --

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.620
treat depression.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.396
And this sort of repurposing
is actually quite challenging.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.356
When doctors first saw
this mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.836
they didn't really recognize
what they saw.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.716
They were so used to thinking about it

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.516
from the framework
of being a tuberculosis drug

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.596
that they actually just listed it

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.396
as a side effect, an adverse side effect.
