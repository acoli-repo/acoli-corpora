sort of akin to putting on armor.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.820
We had accidentally discovered
the first resilience-enhancing drug.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.516
And like I said, we only gave
a tiny amount of the drug,

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.116
and it lasted for weeks,

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.356
and that's not like anything
you see with antidepressants.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.700
But it is actually kind of similar
to what you see in immune vaccines.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.116
So in immune vaccines,
you'll get your shots,

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.516
and then weeks, months, years later,

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.876
when you're actually exposed to bacteria,

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.356
it's not the vaccine in your body
that protects you.
