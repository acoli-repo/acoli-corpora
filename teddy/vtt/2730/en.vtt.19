00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.836
based on whether or not they had gotten
that one injection of Calypsol

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.060
a week beforehand.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.956
And it looked kind of like this.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.116
So if you look at the far left,

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.636
if you put a mouse in a new space,

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.916
this is the box, it's very exciting,

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.076
a mouse will walk around and explore,

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.396
and you can see that pink line
is actually the measure of them walking.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.596
And we also give it
another mouse in a pencil cup

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.676
that it can decide to interact with.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.916
This is also a dramatization,
in case that's not clear.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.636
And a normal mouse will explore.
