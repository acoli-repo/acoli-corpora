moving mice from box to box
to test them,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.796
and Christine was actually sitting
on the floor with the computer in her lap

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.236
so the mice couldn't see her,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.516
and she was analyzing
the data in real time.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.916
And I remember us yelling,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.236
which you're not supposed to do
in an animal room where you're testing,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.836
because it had worked.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.236
It seemed like these mice
were protected against stress,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.316
or they were inappropriately happy,
however you want to call it.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.780
And we were really excited.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.300
And then we were really skeptical,
because it was too good to be true.
