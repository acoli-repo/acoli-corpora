00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.596
and not everyone that is exposed to stress
develops a mood disorder.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.516
And this ability to experience
stress and be resilient

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.700
and bounce back and not develop
depression or PTSD

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.756
is known as stress resilience,

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.636
and it varies between people.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.996
And we have always thought of it
as just sort of this passive property.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.556
It's the absence of susceptibility factors

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.660
and risk factors for these disorders.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.500
But what if it were active?

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.916
Maybe we could enhance it,

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.100
sort of akin to putting on armor.
