00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.140
but since then other labs
have independently confirmed this effect.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.860
So we don't know what causes depression,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.156
but we do know that stress
is the initial trigger

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.516
in 80 percent of cases,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.756
and depression and PTSD
are different diseases,

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.796
but this is something
they share in common.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.636
Right? It is traumatic stress

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.556
like active combat or natural disasters

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.036
or community violence or sexual assault

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.340
that causes post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.596
and not everyone that is exposed to stress
develops a mood disorder.
