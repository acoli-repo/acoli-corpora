00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.996
And we were just piloting.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.276
So we would give an injection to mice,

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.596
and then we'd wait a week,

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.300
and then we'd run
another experiment to save money.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.156
And one of the experiments I was running,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.836
we would stress the mice,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.076
and we used that as a model of depression.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.436
And at first it kind of just looked
like it didn't really work at all.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.980
So we could have stopped there.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.436
But I have run this model
of depression for years,

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.356
and the data just looked kind of weird.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.236
It didn't really look right to me.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.476
So I went back,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.996
and we reanalyzed it

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.836
based on whether or not they had gotten
that one injection of Calypsol
