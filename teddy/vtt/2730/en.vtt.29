00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.236
because it seems
like they might have the potential

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.076
to protect against stress

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.516
and prevent mice from developing

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.300
depression and post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.220
Also, not all antidepressants
are also paravaccines.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.916
We tried Prozac as well,

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.300
and that had no effect.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.076
So if this were to translate into humans,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.676
we might be able to protect people

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.956
who are predictably at risk

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.836
against stress-induced disorders
like depression and PTSD.
