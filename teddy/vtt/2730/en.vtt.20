00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.636
And a normal mouse will explore.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.900
It will be social.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.996
Check out what's going on.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.916
If you stress a mouse
in this depression model,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.220
which is the middle box,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.996
they aren't social, they don't explore.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.300
They mostly just kind of hide
in that back corner, behind a cup.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.116
Yet the mice that had gotten
that one injection of Calypsol,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.340
here on your right,

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.020
they were exploring, they were social.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.220
They looked like they
had never been stressed at all,

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.220
which is impossible.
