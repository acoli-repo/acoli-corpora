00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.436
and they take a really long time to work,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.996
something like four to six weeks
in a lot of patients.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.196
And that's in the patients
where they do work.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.076
There are a lot of patients
where these drugs don't work.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.476
And that means now, in 2016,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.316

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.396

but is not going to do anything
to treat that underlying disease.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.036
And it was this flexibility
in our thinking
