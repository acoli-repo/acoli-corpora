00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.116
Thankfully, since the 1950s,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.116
we've developed some other drugs
and we can actually now cure tuberculosis.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.795
And at least in the United States,
though not necessarily in other countries,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.316
we have closed our sanitoriums

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.020
and probably most of you
are not too worried about TB.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.556
But a lot of what was true
in the early 1900s

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.436
about infectious disease,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.100
we can say now
about psychiatric disorders.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.836
We are in the middle
of an epidemic of mood disorders

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.620
like depression and post-traumatic
stress disorder, or PTSD.
