00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.316
which is, I guess, why they gave
a TV show to the guy who was,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.140
like, really great at repurposing.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.540
(Laughter)

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.516
So the effects in both the case
of iproniazid and imipramine,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.916
they were so strong --

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.156
there was mania,
or people dancing in the halls.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.316
It's actually not that surprising
they were caught.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.820
But it does make you wonder
what else we've missed.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.196
So iproniazid and imipramine,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.636
they're more than just
a case study in repurposing.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.636
They have two other things in common
that are really important.
