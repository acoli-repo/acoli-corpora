00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.820
and that serotonin seemed
like a pretty good place to start.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.556
So we developed drugs
to more specifically focus on serotonin,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.236
the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, so the SSRIs,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.996
the most famous of which is Prozac.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.996
And that was 30 years ago,

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.220
and since then we have mostly
just worked on optimizing those drugs.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.956
And the SSRIs, they are better
than the drugs that came before them,

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.076
but they still have a lot of side effects,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.996
including weight gain, insomnia,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.220
suicidality --

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.436
and they take a really long time to work,
