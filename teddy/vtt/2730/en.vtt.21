00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.980
So we could have just stopped there,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.076
but Christine had also used
Calypsol before as anesthesia,

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.676
and a few years ago she had seen

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.076
that it seemed to have
some weird effects on cells

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.316
and some other behavior

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.356
that also seemed to last
long after the drug,

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.636
maybe a few weeks.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.916
So we were like, OK,

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.116
maybe this is not completely impossible,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.636
but we were really skeptical.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.196
So we did what you do in science
when you're not sure,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.420
and we ran it again.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.476
And I remember being in the animal room,

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.156
moving mice from box to box
to test them,
