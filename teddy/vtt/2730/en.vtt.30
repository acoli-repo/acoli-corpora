00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.836
against stress-induced disorders
like depression and PTSD.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.996
So that's first responders
and firefighters,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.156
refugees, prisoners and prison guards,

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.260
soldiers, you name it.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.020
And to give you a sense
of the scale of these diseases,

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.676
in 2010, the global burden of disease

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.540
was estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars,

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.596
and since they are chronic,

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.836
that cost is compounding
and is therefore expected to rise

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.100
up to six trillion dollars
in just the next 15 years.
