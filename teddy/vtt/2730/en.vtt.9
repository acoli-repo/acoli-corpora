They were so used to looking at it
from the perspective of this one disease,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.540
they could not see the larger implications
for another disease.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.076
And to be fair,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.876
Functional fixedness
is a bias that affects all of us.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.356
It's a tendency to only

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.316
which is, I guess, why they gave
a TV show to the guy who was,
