00:00:00.836 --> 00:00:03.916
Thirteen years ago, I was living
in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.836 --> 00:00:06.916
I was working
with the Department of Energy

00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:10.196
to identify breakthrough technologies
to help solve climate change.

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:13.156
And I remember one particular day,

00:00:13.156 --> 00:00:14.716
sitting in a windowless room,

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:16.796
in massive concrete buildings,

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:18.316
and talking with colleagues

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:23.676
about how this particular wind technology,
or solar, or battery technology

00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:27.036
could solve climate,
if only we had enough resources.

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:30.956
And then, I met my mentor, Maurice Kaya.
