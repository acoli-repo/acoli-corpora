It's dark days for democracy.

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:05.752
And our crisis is global.

00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:09.380
If you're like me,
you can feel it in your bones.

00:00:10.256 --> 00:00:13.134
My expertise focuses on democracy
in the United States,

00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:14.343
where I live and work.

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:18.347
And while we've long lifted up
our own system on a pedestal

00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:20.391
as an example for the world,

00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:23.936
we're one of those democracies
that's currently in a yearslong decline.

00:00:24.937 --> 00:00:28.608
So much of the conversation
in the media and among experts

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.777
is about our broken two-party system.
