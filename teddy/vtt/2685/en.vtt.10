WEBVTT

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.880
launched a new project
called "The Joy of Voting."

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.336
In four cities across the United States --

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.016
Philadelphia, Miami,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.496
Akron, Ohio, and Wichita, Kansas --

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.456
we've gathered together
artists and activists,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.216
educators, political folks,
neighbors, everyday citizens

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.976
to come together and create projects

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.560
that can foster this culture
of voting in a local way.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.296
In Miami, that means
all-night parties with hot DJs

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.654
where the only way to get in
is to show that you're registered to vote.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.176
In Akron, it means political plays
