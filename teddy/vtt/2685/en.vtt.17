00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.880
we yell and we scream at our screens,
and then we collapse, exhausted.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.296
But when politics is about us

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.096
and our neighbors
and other people in our community

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.480
coming together to create experiences
of collective voice and imagination,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.880
then we begin to remember
that this stuff matters.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.000
We begin to remember
that this is the stuff of self-government.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.080
Which brings me back to where I began.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.080
Why bother?

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.545
There's one way to answer this question.
