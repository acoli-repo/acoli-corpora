00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.640
Voting matters because it is
a self-fulfilling act of belief.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.840
It feeds the spirit of mutual interest
that makes any society thrive.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.616
When we vote, even if it is in anger,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.600
we are part of a collective,
creative leap of faith.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.360
Voting helps us generate
the very power that we wish we had.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.056
It's no accident
that democracy and theater

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.480
emerged around the same time
in ancient Athens.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.440
Both of them yank the individual
out of the enclosure of her private self.
