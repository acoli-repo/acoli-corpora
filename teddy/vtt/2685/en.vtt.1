00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.056
How else would more than half
of federal tax breaks

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.560
flow up to the wealthiest
five percent of Americans?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.600
And our choices indeed are often terrible.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.536
For many people
across the political spectrum,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.720
Exhibit A is the 2016
presidential election.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.296
But in any year, you can look
up and down the ballot

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.000
and find plenty to be uninspired about.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.976
But in spite of all this,
I still believe voting matters.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.896
And crazy as it may sound,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.160
I believe we can revive the joy of voting.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.320
Today, I want to talk
about how we can do that, and why.
