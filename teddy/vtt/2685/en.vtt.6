WEBVTT

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.696
is an electoral culture
that is about being together together,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.936
in person,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.176
in loud and passionate ways,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.456
so that instead of being
"eat your vegetables" or "do you duty,"

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.456
voting can feel more like "join the club"

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.160
or, better yet, "join the party."

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.696
Imagine if we had,
across the country right now,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.656
in local places but nationwide,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.336
a concerted effort
to revive a face-to-face set of ways

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.880
to engage and electioneer:

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.456
outdoor shows in which candidates
and their causes are mocked
