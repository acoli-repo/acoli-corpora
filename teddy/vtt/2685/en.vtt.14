00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.776
written by nine students in an ESL class,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.936
all of them Hispanic migrant workers

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.320
from nearby Hartville, Ohio.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.000
I want to read to you from this poem.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.760
It's called "The Joy of Voting."

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.016
"I would like to vote for the first time

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.080
because things are changing for Hispanics.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.136
I used to be afraid of ghosts.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.400
Now I am afraid of people.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.280
There's more violence and racism.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.400
Voting can change this.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.320
The border wall is nothing.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.000
It's just a wall.
