You might ask, well,
here in America, who has time for this?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.736
And I would tell you

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.840
that the average American
watches five hours of television a day.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.536
You might ask, who has the motivation?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.776
And I'll tell you,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.936
any citizen who wants to be seen and heard

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.256
not as a prop, not as a talking point,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.600
but as a participant, as a creator.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.080
Well, how do we make this happen?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.320
Simply by making it happen.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.776
That's why a group of colleagues and I

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.880
launched a new project
called "The Joy of Voting."
