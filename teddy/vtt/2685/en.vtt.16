WEBVTT

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.040
and it isn't just our organization's work.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.496
All across this country right now,

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.896
immigrants, young people, veterans,
people of all different backgrounds

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.416
are coming together to create
this kind of passionate, joyful activity

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.856
around elections,

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.816
in red and blue states,
in urban and rural communities,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.936
people of every political background.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.656
What they have in common is simply this:

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.200
their work is rooted in place.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.080
Because remember,
all citizenship is local.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.256
When politics becomes
just a presidential election,

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.880
we yell and we scream at our screens,
and then we collapse, exhausted.
