In Miami, we've commissioned and artist,

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.856
a young artist named Atomico,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.120
to create some vivid and vibrant images
for a new series of "I voted" stickers.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.400
But the thing is, Atomico had never voted.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.776
He wasn't even registered.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.296
So as he got to work on creating
this artwork for these stickers,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.456
he also began to get over
his sense of intimidation about politics.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.096
He got himself registered,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.416
and then he got educated
about the upcoming primary election,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.736
and on election day he was out there
not just passing out stickers,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.336
but chatting up voters
and encouraging people to vote,
