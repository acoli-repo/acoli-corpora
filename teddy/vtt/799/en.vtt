00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Something called the Danish Twin Study

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
established that only about 10 percent

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of how long the average person lives,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
optimal lifestyle of longevity

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we can come up with a de facto formula

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
for longevity.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.
