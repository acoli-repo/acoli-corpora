00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:31.284
every cancer doctor on the planet
would write a prescription for it.

00:11:32.845 --> 00:11:34.059
Why don't they?

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.914
Again, because we goofy,
long white-coat physicians

00:11:38.938 --> 00:11:42.984
are trained and of the mantra
of dealing with this,

00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:45.635
not with this.

00:11:50.697 --> 00:11:54.441
This is a space that we will
all come to at some point.

00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:58.433
But this conversation today
is not about dying,

00:11:58.457 --> 00:11:59.830
it is about living.
