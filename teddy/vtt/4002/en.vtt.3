the diagnosis, the prognosis
and options of care.

00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:35.068
Five hours into my new career,

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:37.126
I did the only thing I knew how.

00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:39.206
I walked in,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.134
sat down,

00:01:41.717 --> 00:01:43.137
took Harold's hand,

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:45.290
took his wife's hand

00:01:46.142 --> 00:01:47.419
and just breathed.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.701
He said, "It's not good

I said, "No."

00:01:52.564 --> 00:01:55.915
And so we talked
and we listened and we shared.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:58.100
And after a while I said,

00:01:58.124 --> 00:02:01.349
"Harold, what is it
that has meaning to you?
