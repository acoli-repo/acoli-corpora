00:01:58.124 --> 00:02:01.349
"Harold, what is it
that has meaning to you?

00:02:01.373 --> 00:02:03.002
What is it that you hold sacred?"

00:02:03.026 --> 00:02:04.341
And he said,

00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:05.769
"My family."

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.546
I said, "What do you want to do?"

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.737
He slapped me on the knee
and said, "I want to go fishing."

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:13.632
I said, "That, I know how to do."

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:16.600
Harold went fishing the next day.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.392
He died a week later.

00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:23.074
As I've gone through
my training in my career,

00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:24.585
I think back to Harold.

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.029
And I think that this is a conversation

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:30.966
that happens far too infrequently.
