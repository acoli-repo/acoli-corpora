00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.533
Now, palliative medicine is not
just for the elderly,

00:09:33.557 --> 00:09:36.161
it is not just for the middle-aged.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.066
It is for everyone.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.629
Meet my friend Jonathan.

00:09:41.903 --> 00:09:43.383
We have the honor and pleasure

00:09:43.407 --> 00:09:45.727
of Jonathan and his father
joining us here today.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:48.583
Jonathan is in his 20s,
and I met him several years ago.

00:09:48.607 --> 00:09:51.929
He was dealing with
metastatic testicular cancer,

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.952
spread to his brain.

00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:55.647
He had a stroke,

00:09:56.375 --> 00:09:57.923
he had brain surgery,

00:09:57.947 --> 00:09:59.959
radiation, chemotherapy.
