00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.874
I'd also like to talk to you
about palliative medicine:

00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:40.152
a paradigm of care for this population,
grounded in what they value.

00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:43.741
Patient-centric care based on their values

00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:47.342
that helps this population
live better and longer.

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.808
It's a care model that tells the truth

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:52.984
and engages one-on-one

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:54.829
and meets people where they're at.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.223
I'd like to start by telling the story
of my very first patient.
