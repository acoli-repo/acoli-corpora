00:04:57.955 --> 00:05:00.404
the more that we do to someone,

00:05:01.283 --> 00:05:03.880
it decreases the quality of their life.

00:05:05.422 --> 00:05:07.693
And it shortens it, most often.

00:05:09.896 --> 00:05:11.721
So what are we going to do about this?

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:13.148
What are we doing about this?

00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:15.073
And why is this so?

00:05:15.097 --> 00:05:17.001
The grim reality, ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.423
is that we, the health care industry --
long white-coat physicians --

00:05:20.447 --> 00:05:21.857
are stealing from you.

00:05:22.877 --> 00:05:25.068
Stealing from you the opportunity

00:05:25.974 --> 00:05:28.334
to choose how you want to live your lives

00:05:28.358 --> 00:05:30.839
in the context of whatever disease it is.
