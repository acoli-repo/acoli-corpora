00:00:01.387 --> 00:00:02.912
I am a palliative care physician

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.927
and I would like to talk to you
today about health care.

00:00:06.393 --> 00:00:10.102
I'd like to talk to you
about the health and care

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:13.764
of the most vulnerable
population in our country --

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:19.039
those people dealing with the most
complex serious health issues.

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:23.004
I'd like to talk to you
about economics as well.

00:00:23.028 --> 00:00:27.484
And the intersection of these two
should scare the hell out of you --

00:00:27.508 --> 00:00:29.279
it scares the hell out of me.
