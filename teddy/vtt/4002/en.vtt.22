00:10:57.621 --> 00:11:00.285
A study done at Harvard
by friends of mine, colleagues.

00:11:00.309 --> 00:11:01.690
End-stage lung cancer:

00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:03.832
one group with palliative care,

00:11:04.695 --> 00:11:06.377
a similar group without.

00:11:07.782 --> 00:11:11.134
The group with palliative care
reported less pain,

00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:13.118
less depression.

00:11:13.556 --> 00:11:16.463
They needed fewer hospitalizations.

00:11:16.487 --> 00:11:17.894
And, ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:22.282
they lived three to six months longer.

00:11:23.805 --> 00:11:27.246
If palliative care were a cancer drug,

00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:31.284
every cancer doctor on the planet
would write a prescription for it.
