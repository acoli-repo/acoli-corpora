It has at stake the free-market

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.483
of the United States of America.

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:38.121
Let's forget all the statistics
for a minute, forget the numbers.

00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:41.525
Let's talk about the value we get
for all these dollars we spend.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:45.415
Well, the Dartmouth Atlas,
about six years ago,

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.192
looked at every dollar
spent by Medicare --

00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:49.827
generally this population.

00:03:49.851 --> 00:03:53.787
We found that those patients who have
the highest per capita expenditures

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.425
had the highest suffering,
pain, depression.
