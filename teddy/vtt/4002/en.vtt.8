00:04:00.182 --> 00:04:02.743
And, more often than not, they die sooner.

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:05.349
How can this be?

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:07.193
We live in the United States,

00:04:07.217 --> 00:04:09.707
it has the greatest health care
system on the planet.

00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.236
We spend 10 times more on these patients

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.446
than the second-leading
country in the world.

00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:16.649
That doesn't make sense.

00:04:17.764 --> 00:04:19.123
But what we know is,

00:04:19.147 --> 00:04:22.318
out of the top 50 countries on the planet

00:04:22.342 --> 00:04:25.925
with organized health care systems,

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.047
we rank 37th.
