WEBVTT

00:12:00.289 --> 00:12:01.613
Living based on our values,

00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:03.056
what we find sacred

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.497
and how we want to write
the chapters of our lives,

00:12:05.521 --> 00:12:07.355
whether it's the last

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:08.776
or the last five.

00:12:10.258 --> 00:12:11.672
What we know,

00:12:12.277 --> 00:12:13.664
what we have proven,

00:12:14.475 --> 00:12:17.012
is that this conversation
needs to happen today --

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.005
not next week, not next year.

00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:22.859
What is at stake is our lives today

00:12:22.883 --> 00:12:24.683
and the lives of us as we get older

00:12:24.707 --> 00:12:27.247
and the lives of our children
and our grandchildren.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.183
Not just in that hospital room
