00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.223
I'd like to start by telling the story
of my very first patient.

00:01:01.247 --> 00:01:03.283
It was my first day as a physician,

00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:04.798
with the long white coat ...

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.001
I stumbled into the hospital

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.825
and right away there's a gentleman,
Harold, 68 years old,

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:11.450
came to the emergency department.

00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:13.457
He had had headaches for about six weeks

00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:15.630
that got worse and worse
and worse and worse.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.093
Evaluation revealed he had cancer
that had spread to his brain.

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:26.443
The attending physician directed me
to go share with Harold and his family

00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:31.113
the diagnosis, the prognosis
and options of care.
