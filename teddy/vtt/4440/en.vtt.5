like cause your blood to clot,

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.403
what we call "hemotoxic."

00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:36.467
Or they cause neurons in your brains
to not function normally,

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:37.951
what we call "neurotoxic."

00:02:37.975 --> 00:02:42.411
Or they have toxins that will poke holes
into the membranes of your cells,

00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:45.708
causing them to rupture
and, basically, explode,

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.439
what we call "cytotoxic."

00:02:47.463 --> 00:02:49.693
Cellular explosion, people.

Now, if that is not all powerful
and all present,

00:02:52.677 --> 00:02:53.944

00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:55.564
Now a little about me,

00:02:55.588 --> 00:02:57.999
and why I'm so obsessed with venom.

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.347
I grew up in New York City
