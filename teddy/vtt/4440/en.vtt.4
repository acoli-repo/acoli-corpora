The chemistry of the toxins
in your arsenal

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:04.030
is what's going to enable David
to conquer Goliath.

00:02:04.054 --> 00:02:07.411
And in our scenario,
David is clearly the snail.

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:10.578
Another feature of venom
that makes it so successful

00:02:10.602 --> 00:02:14.836
is that the toxins work
with the precision of a Swiss Army knife.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.059
And so these toxins,

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:19.875
they come for strongholds
that help an organism to function.

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:23.434
So they target blood, brain and membranes.

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:26.037
Whether it's snail venom or snake venom,

00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:28.537
they each have components
that can do things

00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:30.593
like cause your blood to clot,
