00:08:26.998 --> 00:08:30.086
We're in a race to harness
all of this venom goodness

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.110
before we lose the vast majority
of animals on our planet.

00:08:33.134 --> 00:08:34.840
It's a holistic process.

00:08:34.864 --> 00:08:39.426
You can't have the therapeutic treatments
without having the animals.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.085
And you can't have the animals

00:08:41.109 --> 00:08:42.856
without having their ecosystems.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.539
So for me and the snails,

00:08:44.563 --> 00:08:47.318
what it means is
we have to save the oceans.

00:08:47.342 --> 00:08:49.739
And because venomous animals
are found everywhere,

00:08:49.763 --> 00:08:51.778
we basically have to save the planet.

00:08:51.802 --> 00:08:53.548
So do it for the venomous animals,

00:08:53.572 --> 00:08:55.491
if you don't want to do it for yourself.

00:08:55.515 --> 00:08:56.682
And who knows,

00:08:56.706 --> 00:08:59.992
some day, snail venom
might just save your life.
