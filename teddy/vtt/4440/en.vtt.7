00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:30.307
It's a scientific adventure.

00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:35.587
We're boldly exploring this entity
that connects nature and humanity.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.817
Another reason
that I'm obsessed with venom

00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:39.585
is because of its duality.

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.252
When you inject the components
of a venom arsenal into an organism,

00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:45.633
it can kill or it can cure.

00:03:45.657 --> 00:03:48.299
At a molecular level,
several things can happen.

00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:51.704
You saw one thing, paralysis in the fish.

00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:54.666
Now that was happening
because the toxins in the venom

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.927
were attacking how the fish's cells
communicate with each other,

00:03:57.951 --> 00:03:59.982
preventing it from swimming away.
