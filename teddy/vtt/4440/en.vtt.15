00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:30.892
So what's the drug that you think
we found from the Gila monster?

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:35.116
A compound that is used to lower
the blood sugar in diabetic patients.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.188
Now these are three marvelous examples,

00:07:37.212 --> 00:07:39.260
but we've just scratched the surface.

00:07:39.284 --> 00:07:42.077
There's so much more venom
out there for us to study.

00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:45.673
In fact, we think that 15 percent
of all the animals on the planet

00:07:45.697 --> 00:07:46.880
are venomous.

00:07:46.904 --> 00:07:48.594
And I think this is a low estimate,

00:07:48.618 --> 00:07:51.959
given the fact that we haven't surveyed
all the animals on the planet.

00:07:51.983 --> 00:07:54.630
But nature seems to have found
something that she likes,

00:07:54.654 --> 00:07:57.853
and she's repeated it
over and over and over again,

00:07:57.877 --> 00:08:00.615
leading to the vast array of animals
that we see around us
