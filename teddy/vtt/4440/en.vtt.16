00:07:57.877 --> 00:08:00.615
leading to the vast array of animals
that we see around us

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:02.576
and all throughout the tree of life.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.156
So whether we're talking
about my fave, killer snails,

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.449
or jellyfish,

00:08:07.473 --> 00:08:10.228
or the larvae of butterflies and moths,

00:08:10.252 --> 00:08:12.863
or platypus or slow lorises,

00:08:12.887 --> 00:08:15.887
whether by sea, land or air,

00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:18.633
you're sure to encounter
a venomous creature.

00:08:18.657 --> 00:08:20.069
Remember when I told you

00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:24.188
that venom can be both
a superhero and a supervillain,

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:25.768
and you doubted me?

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:26.974
Mhm.

00:08:26.998 --> 00:08:30.086
We're in a race to harness
all of this venom goodness
