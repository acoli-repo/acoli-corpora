00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:31.550
We're using things that have
a huge cost of addiction.

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:32.743
So think of morphine

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:35.609
or think of any of your favorite
opioid out there.

00:06:35.633 --> 00:06:36.895
What the snails have done

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.332
is they've shown us a way to treat pain
without the addiction,

00:06:41.356 --> 00:06:42.506
which is huge.

00:06:43.055 --> 00:06:46.364
The next example comes
from the Brazilian pit viper.

00:06:46.388 --> 00:06:49.776
From these snakes, we've derived
a compound called captopril.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.879
Captopril is used to treat
high blood pressure,

00:06:52.903 --> 00:06:55.403
and captopril is a breakthrough drug.

00:06:55.427 --> 00:06:57.577
But not only in and of itself,

00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:00.529
but because it advanced
a whole class of drugs,
