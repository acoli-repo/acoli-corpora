00:04:58.022 --> 00:05:01.315
that seems to attack liver cancer cells,

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:05.022
and only liver cancer cells,
and none of the others that were tested.

00:05:05.046 --> 00:05:08.490
And then, when we took this compound
and we injected it into mouse models

00:05:08.514 --> 00:05:10.507
that were expressing liver cancer cells,

00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:13.766
it significantly inhibited
the growth of the tumors.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.006
We're not quite sure how this works yet,

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.895
we're still investigating the mechanism

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.673
and how we can make
this compound more effective,

00:05:20.697 --> 00:05:22.640
so you can't rush out to the pharmacy

00:05:22.664 --> 00:05:26.847
and order up a killer snail
liver-cancer therapy treatment.

00:05:26.871 --> 00:05:28.109
Not yet.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.283
Basically, what we think is happening
