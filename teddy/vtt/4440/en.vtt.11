00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.283
Basically, what we think is happening

00:05:30.307 --> 00:05:33.823
is that the compound is blocking
a specific channel,

00:05:33.847 --> 00:05:36.609
prohibiting the transmission
of a specific chemical

00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:38.846
that leads to downstream signaling

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.132
that enables the tumor to multiply
and draw blood to itself.

00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:46.133
What we're doing in studying
the components of venom

00:05:46.157 --> 00:05:48.848
to find treatments for human
diseases and disorders,

00:05:48.872 --> 00:05:50.156
is not new,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.950
it's what we call natural
products drug discovery,

00:05:52.974 --> 00:05:54.784
and it's been happening for centuries,

00:05:54.808 --> 00:05:56.990
and in cultures all over the world.

00:05:57.014 --> 00:05:59.474
Venoms are not only giving us
cool new compounds,

00:05:59.498 --> 00:06:02.284
but they're also giving us
new ways of thinking
