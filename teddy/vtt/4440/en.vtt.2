You can think of the radulas
as hypodermic needles.

00:01:02.157 --> 00:01:03.323
Now, no need to worry,

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:05.599
these snails are practicing
good needle habits,

00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:08.122
because each radula is only used once.

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:11.249
Now from your own knowledge
about venomous organisms,

00:01:11.273 --> 00:01:15.151
and the keep-you-up-at-night
fish-killing video that I just showed you,

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.944
you might think that venom
is dangerous and all bad.

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:20.865
Well, yes and no.

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:22.815
A more accurate way of thinking of venom

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:27.426
is to think of it as both
a supervillain and a superhero.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.966
In my lab, we study the evolution
of venom in these sea snails
