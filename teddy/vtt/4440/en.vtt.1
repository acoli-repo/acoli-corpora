00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:31.395
these are clearly not
your garden variety escargots.

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.482
These are assassins of the sea.

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:38.045
And their weapon of choice is venom.

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:42.332
Venom, like the venom you find
in venomous snakes and scorpions,

00:00:42.356 --> 00:00:46.935
these sea snails, they use their venom
to subdue fish, worms

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:48.240
and other snails.

00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:49.716
And the venom of these snails,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.904
it's not just one thing,

00:00:50.928 --> 00:00:54.577
it's actually a cocktail
of toxic molecules

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:59.132
that are packaged and delivered
through a false tooth called a radula.

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:02.133
You can think of the radulas
as hypodermic needles.
