00:05:59.498 --> 00:06:02.284
but they're also giving us
new ways of thinking

00:06:02.308 --> 00:06:05.185
about how we treat
human diseases and disorders.

00:06:05.521 --> 00:06:07.267
And I'll give you three examples.

00:06:07.291 --> 00:06:10.117
The first is from killer
snails, of course.

00:06:10.141 --> 00:06:14.037
And so the first drug from these snails
that is on the market

00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:16.863
is called ziconotide, or Prialt,

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:20.989
and it's used to treat chronic pain
in HIV and cancer patients.

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:23.790
Prialt is a nonaddictive pain therapy.

00:06:24.227 --> 00:06:28.185
Three magic words when you think
about how we're treating pain currently.

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:31.550
We're using things that have
a huge cost of addiction.
