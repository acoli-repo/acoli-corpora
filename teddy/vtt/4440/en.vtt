00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.159
How does a sea snail catch a fish?

00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:06.706
I mean, it's a snail, so it's slow,

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.645
and the fish is not.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.149
But yet, this happens.

00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:15.419
Hidden under the sand is a cone snail.

00:00:15.443 --> 00:00:18.230
And that orange thing you see
is kind of like a tongue.

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:20.071
We call it a proboscis.

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:24.975
It uses that to track and subdue
this unsuspecting fish.

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:28.022
In this predator-prey interaction,

00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:31.395
these are clearly not
your garden variety escargots.
