In my lab, we study the evolution
of venom in these sea snails

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.514
as a force for good.

00:01:32.538 --> 00:01:34.093
Sounds like a stretch,

00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:35.712
or maybe even snake oil,

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:36.909
but actually,

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.688
while there are snakes involved,
the product is legit.

00:01:39.712 --> 00:01:42.156
One reason the venom product
is so successful

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.337
is that it transforms a physical warfare
into a biochemical one.

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:51.535
Where usually the predator-prey
interaction is one of brute force,

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:53.736
venom takes it to a molecular scale.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.879
And it's not size that matters,

00:01:55.903 --> 00:01:58.006
but the mixture of your venom arsenal.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.561
The chemistry of the toxins
in your arsenal
