00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:03.334
Are there other things
that I would like to use venom to attack?

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.926
For sure.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.768
And one of those is cancer.

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:08.848
Cancer tumors are cells.

00:04:08.872 --> 00:04:10.031
And like all cells,

00:04:10.055 --> 00:04:13.228
they communicate with themselves
and their environment around them.

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:15.434
So we would like to find venom components

00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:19.354
that are very good at disrupting
how the tumor cells communicate.

00:04:19.378 --> 00:04:24.188
Similar to how the venom disrupted
how the fish cells communicated

00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:26.291
and the fish couldn't swim away.

00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:29.654
In my lab, we study cancer
as a channelopathy.

00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:33.405
What this means is, basically,
we're looking for venom components
