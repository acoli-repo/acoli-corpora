00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:33.405
What this means is, basically,
we're looking for venom components

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:37.231
that will target channels
that are overexpressed in tumor cells

00:04:37.255 --> 00:04:38.540
versus normal cells.

00:04:38.564 --> 00:04:41.085
The cancer that we're most
focused on right now

00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:42.442
is liver cancer.

00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:44.808
And that's because since the 1980s,

00:04:44.832 --> 00:04:47.537
the death rate of liver
cancer has doubled,

00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:49.942
and it's an emerging threat in the US.

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:52.260
In a screen in which we had cervical,

00:04:52.284 --> 00:04:55.483
neuroblastoma, prostate
and liver cancer cells,

00:04:55.507 --> 00:04:57.998
we found a compound from a terebrid snail

00:04:58.022 --> 00:05:01.315
that seems to attack liver cancer cells,
