00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.347
I grew up in New York City

00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.387
with forced access
to the Natural History Museum.

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:04.799
I say "forced access,"

00:03:04.823 --> 00:03:06.289
because I'm one of five kids,

00:03:06.313 --> 00:03:09.894
and my parents used museums
as a form of childcare.

00:03:10.253 --> 00:03:11.452
There were two rules:

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:12.737
Don't lose anybody

00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:15.087
and meet Mom and Dad
at the African elephants

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.483
at 5:30, when the museum closes.

00:03:17.507 --> 00:03:23.138
Those totally unsupervised days
running through the halls of the museum

00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:25.974
were full of adventure and exploration.

00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:28.569
And that's how I feel
when I'm studying venom.

00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:30.307
It's a scientific adventure.
