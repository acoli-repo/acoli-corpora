00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:00.529
but because it advanced
a whole class of drugs,

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.609
what we know as ACE inhibitors,

00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:06.133
which are the most commonly [prescribed]
for treating hypertension

00:07:06.157 --> 00:07:07.585
and heart failure.

00:07:07.609 --> 00:07:11.387
The last example is from the Gila monster.

00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:15.332
And this is a really exciting example
of understanding the ecology

00:07:15.356 --> 00:07:16.705
of these organisms,

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.037
and pairing it with efficient
drug discovery.

00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:21.125
And Gila monsters are binge eaters.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.537
So when they bite into a large meal,

00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:26.955
they release things in their venom
that lower blood sugar.

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:30.892
So what's the drug that you think
we found from the Gila monster?
