The vagina harbors hundreds of different
kinds of microorganisms.

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:15.803
Some tend to be especially prevalent,
like Lactobacilli.

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:20.391
These bacteria produce an acid 
that lowers the vaginaâ€™s pH,

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:25.021
limiting what can survive there and
preventing against certain infections.

00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:29.692
Candida yeasts are also usually present
in small quantities.

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:32.528
Most of the time, 
these fungi are harmless.
