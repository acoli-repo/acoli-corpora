It's not to say that governments
shouldn't keep us safe --

00:05:02.694 --> 00:05:03.845
of course they should --

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.464
but we need public oversight, transparency

00:05:06.488 --> 00:05:08.729
and accountability to the rule of law.

00:05:08.753 --> 00:05:09.905
Meanwhile,

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:13.802
extremists are literally killing off
civil society in some countries.

00:05:14.198 --> 00:05:16.732
Since 2013 in Bangladesh,

00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:21.272
over a dozen secular bloggers
and community activists

00:05:21.296 --> 00:05:24.229
have been literally
slaughtered by extremists

00:05:24.253 --> 00:05:26.597
while the government has done very little.

00:05:27.008 --> 00:05:29.955
From the city of Raqqa in Syria,

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.555
people like Ruqia Hassan and Naji Jerf
have been assassinated
