00:10:04.668 --> 00:10:06.024
All around the world,

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.827
people who are sick and tired
of fear and oppression

00:10:09.851 --> 00:10:13.301
are linking up in their communities
and across borders.

00:10:13.325 --> 00:10:17.588
We've got to do everything we can
to push our governments and companies

00:10:17.612 --> 00:10:20.548
to do a better job
of protecting their rights.

00:10:20.572 --> 00:10:22.557
We've also got to be more mindful

00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:27.426
about how our own personal, political,
consumer and business choices

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.119
affect people like these around the world.
