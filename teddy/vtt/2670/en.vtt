There's a big question
at the center of life

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:04.960
in our democracies today:

00:00:04.984 --> 00:00:08.329
How do we fight terror
without destroying democracies,

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:10.876
without trampling human rights?

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:16.189
I've spent much of my career
working with journalists,

00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:17.371
with bloggers,

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:18.709
with activists,

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.348
with human rights researchers
all around the world,

00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:23.482
and I've come to the conclusion

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:28.151
that if our democratic societies
do not double down

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:31.158
on protecting and defending human rights,
