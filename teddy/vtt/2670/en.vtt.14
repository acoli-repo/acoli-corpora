Take, for example, Iyad el-Baghdadi,

00:07:01.516 --> 00:07:04.152
an activist who makes fun
of ISIS on Twitter.

00:07:04.176 --> 00:07:05.992
He had his account deactivated,

00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:09.541
because he shares a surname
with a prominent ISIS leader.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.371
Last December,

00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:13.014
a number of women named Isis,

00:07:13.038 --> 00:07:16.490
which also happens to be
the name of an Egyptian goddess,

00:07:16.514 --> 00:07:18.397
had their accounts deactivated.

00:07:18.742 --> 00:07:20.358
And this woman,

00:07:20.382 --> 00:07:23.487
who lives in the United States
and is a computer programmer,

00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:27.237
reported on Twitter
about her deactivation on Facebook,

00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:30.954
managed to get enough media attention
to have her account reinstated.
