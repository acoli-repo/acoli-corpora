00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:30.954
managed to get enough media attention
to have her account reinstated.

00:07:30.978 --> 00:07:33.666
But that's the thing --
she had to get media attention.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.529
And journalists aren't immune.

00:07:35.553 --> 00:07:36.727
David Thomson,

00:07:36.751 --> 00:07:40.149
an expert on terrorism and reporter
for Radio France International,

00:07:40.173 --> 00:07:43.736
had reports deleted
from his Facebook account

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.549
and had his account
deactivated for several days,

00:07:46.573 --> 00:07:50.474
because they contained
pictures of ISIS flags,

00:07:50.498 --> 00:07:52.554
even though he was just reporting on ISIS,

00:07:52.578 --> 00:07:53.756
not promoting it.

00:07:54.253 --> 00:07:57.242
And then we have stories from people
like this Egyptian man,

00:07:57.266 --> 00:07:58.883
Ahmed Abdellahy,

00:07:58.907 --> 00:08:04.050
who reported recently in an event
in Washington DC
