00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
That will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So we go, "sit," on the couch; "sit," tummy-rub; "sit,"

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
look, I throw a tennis ball; "sit," say hello to that other dog.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Yes, we put "sniff butt" on queue.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
"Sit," sniff butt.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So now all of these distractions that worked against training

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
now become rewards that work for training.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.
