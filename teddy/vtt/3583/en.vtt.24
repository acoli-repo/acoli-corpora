00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
No different from the dog barking.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
The husband won't clear up his clothes,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And it then starts, and we get into this thing,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and our personal feedback -- there's two things about it.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
When you watch people interacting with animals or other people,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
especially with children, especially with parents.
