00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Dogs have interests.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
They have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the owner says, you know, "Puppy, come here, come here,"

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and the dog thinks, "Hmm, interesting.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling."
