00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's a difficult choice, right?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Rear end, owner. Rear end wins.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I mean, you lose.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You cannot compete with the environment,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
if you have an adolescent dog's brain.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So, when we train, we're always trying to take into account

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the dog's point of view.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, I'm here largely because

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that -- on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
number one, by making up rules, human rules.
