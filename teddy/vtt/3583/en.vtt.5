00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Dogs get so abused.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Dogs, horses and humans --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
these are the three species which are so abused in life.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And the reason is built into their behavior --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Like, "Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault."

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
They are just so beatable,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
stamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,
