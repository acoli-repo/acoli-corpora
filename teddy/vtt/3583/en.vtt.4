00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of a very complicated social system.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And they take this stuff seriously.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
because it prevents physical fights.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Of course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The number one is, "I have it, you don't."

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So, we get in dog training this notion of dominances,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Dogs get so abused.
