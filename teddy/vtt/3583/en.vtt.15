I bet a lot of you do, right?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It doesn't have to be.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
There's several definitions of what a punishment is,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
but one definition, the most popular, is:

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
such that it's less likely to occur in the future.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.
