00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And you go, "Oh, there's a good boy."

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You bend down, you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
he weighs, you know, 80 pounds.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Every time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, this whole dominance issue -- number one,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
what we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of a very complicated social system.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And they take this stuff seriously.
