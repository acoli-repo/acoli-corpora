I don't need food, but the average owner says,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
"Puppy, sit."

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Or they go, "Sit, sit, sit."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
like the dog has a third eye there -- it's insane.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You know, "Sit, sit."

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
No, we go, "Puppy, sit" -- boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Then we phase out the food as a lure,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and now the dog knows that "sit" means sit,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and you can actually communicate to a dog

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
in a perfectly constructed English sentence.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And I've taught her "Phoenix," "come here," "take this," "go to"
