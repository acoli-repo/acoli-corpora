I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
plus the brother-in-law, plus the child.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
but this was a dog I worked with for a while.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
so while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
When the dog would try to leave the mat,
