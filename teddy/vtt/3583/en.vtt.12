00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And I can imagine this dog, you know,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
speaking through the fence to, say, an Akita,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
saying, "Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
They're like Golden Retrievers.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
All I have to do is sit, and they do everything.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
they will throw tennis balls,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
they will cook for me and serve the food.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It's like, if I just sit, that's my command.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Then I have my own personal doorman,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter."
