hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
knee him in the chest, flip him over backwards."

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Because he grew?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This is insanity.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I ask owners, "Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?"

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And people say, "Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I said, "Let's teach him to sit."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And then we give him a reason for sitting.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Because the first stage

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
is basically teaching a dog ESL.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I could speak to you and say, "Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey."
