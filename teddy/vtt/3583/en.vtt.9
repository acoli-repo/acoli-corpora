00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And I've taught her "Phoenix," "come here," "take this," "go to"

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and the name of my son, "Jamie."

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And the dog can take a note,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and take him a little message that says,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner."

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Will it do it?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Not necessarily, no.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
As I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
why come to the owner?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.
