00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
if my son's friends leave the door open,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the dogs have to know you don't step across this line.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
This is a life-or-death thing.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
You leave this, the sanctity of your house,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and you could be hit on the street.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So some things we have to let the dog know,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
"You mustn't do this."

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And so we have to enforce, but without force.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
People here get very confused about what a punishment is.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
They think a punishment is something nasty.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I bet a lot of you do, right?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.
