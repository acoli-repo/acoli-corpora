00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
you say, "What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!"

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And I went, "Oh my God, do I do something?"

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
That child has lost everything --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
that one of the two people he can trust in this world

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And I thought, "Do I tell this jerk to quit it?"

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I thought, "Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on."

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I walked to the back of the plane,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I sat down, and a thought came to me.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
If that had been a dog, I would have laid him out.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
(Laughter)

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
If he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out.
