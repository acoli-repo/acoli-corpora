And a lot of my friends train really neat animals,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
grizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
on the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it --

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
killer whales. I love it because it wires you up.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
"Bad bear, bad bear!" Voom!

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Your head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
This is crazy.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So, where do we go from here?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
We want a better way.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Dogs deserve better.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.
