00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
why come to the owner?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
The dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
At the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
with smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
what we want him to do, and this is very easy.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We use the Premack principle.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Basically, we follow a low-frequency behavior --

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
one the dog doesn't want to do --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
by a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.
