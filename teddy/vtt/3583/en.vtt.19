But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It has to do with watching people train puppies,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
horrendous relationship skills.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I mean, my all-time classic is another "come here" one.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
You see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
because I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and their dog's over here, and they say, "Rover, come here.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Rover, come here. Rover, come here, you son of a bitch."

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
The dog says, "I don't think so."
