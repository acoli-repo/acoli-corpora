00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
number one, by making up rules, human rules.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We don't take the dog's point of view into account.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So the human says, "You're going to act this way, damn it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Then, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And then number three, now we can punish the dog

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
for breaking rules he didn't even know existed.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
you know, isn't that nice?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And you go, "Oh, there's a good boy."
