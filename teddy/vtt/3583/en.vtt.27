00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Your kids are easy to train.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
All you've got to do is to watch them,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
you ask the question, "Is it good, or is it bad?"

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
If it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
That is such a powerful training technique.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This should be taught in schools.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Relationships -- how do you negotiate?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
How on earth about raising children?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
We think how we do it -- one night in bed, we're pregnant,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
No, this is what should be taught -- the good living, the good habits,
