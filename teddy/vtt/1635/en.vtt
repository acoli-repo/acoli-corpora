Allison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Chris Anderson: No, you can't start the three minutes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000

AH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I mean I'm nervous enough as it is.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Do you know that surgery?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Electric saw, power drill, totally disgusting

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
unless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.
