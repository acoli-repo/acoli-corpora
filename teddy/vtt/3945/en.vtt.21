00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:31.317
and because of that, science has a totally
new and totally counterintuitive theory

00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:34.956
about why this absurd
Dr. Seuss-looking creature

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.512
looks the way it does.

00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:41.940
And for me, it completely upended
the way I think of the camel.

00:10:41.964 --> 00:10:46.346
It went from being
this ridiculously niche creature

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.719
suited only to this
one specific environment,

00:10:48.743 --> 00:10:54.031
to being this world traveler
that just happens to be in the Sahara,

00:10:54.055 --> 00:10:57.180
and could end up virtually anywhere.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:03.855
