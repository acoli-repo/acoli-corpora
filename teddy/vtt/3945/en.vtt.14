00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:03.088
North American camels went extinct.

00:07:03.893 --> 00:07:06.313
So, scientists knew all of that already,

00:07:06.337 --> 00:07:12.413
but it still doesn't fully explain
how Natalia found one so far north.

00:07:12.437 --> 00:07:17.111
Like, this is, temperature-wise,
the polar opposite of the Sahara.

00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:19.636
Now to be fair,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.343
three and a half million years ago,

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:25.466
it was on average 22 degrees Celsius
warmer than it is now.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.425
So it would have been boreal forest,

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:32.363
so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.
