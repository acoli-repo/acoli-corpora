00:09:56.242 --> 00:10:00.613
you start with an idea in your mind
of how the story goes.

00:10:01.196 --> 00:10:03.681
(Audio) NR: We make up stories
and we stick with it,

00:10:03.705 --> 00:10:05.427
like the camel in the desert, right?

00:10:05.451 --> 00:10:07.897
That's a great story!
It's totally adapted for that.

00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:10.150
Clearly, it always lived there.

00:10:10.174 --> 00:10:14.476

00:10:16.723 --> 00:10:20.682
that forces you to reframe
everything you thought you knew.

00:10:20.706 --> 00:10:24.484
Like, in this case, this one scientist
finds this one shard

00:10:24.508 --> 00:10:26.255
of what she thought was wood,

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:31.317
and because of that, science has a totally
new and totally counterintuitive theory
