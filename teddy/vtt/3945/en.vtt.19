00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:31.092
But I love it for a totally
different reason.

00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:34.513
For me, it's a story about us,

00:09:34.537 --> 00:09:36.505
about how we see the world

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:38.833
and about how that changes.

00:09:39.658 --> 00:09:43.030
So I was trained as a historian.

00:09:43.054 --> 00:09:47.307
And I've learned that, actually,
a lot of scientists are historians, too.

00:09:47.331 --> 00:09:48.880
They make sense of the past.

00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:54.229
They tell the history of our universe,
of our planet, of life on this planet.

00:09:54.741 --> 00:09:56.218
And as a historian,

00:09:56.242 --> 00:10:00.613
you start with an idea in your mind
of how the story goes.
