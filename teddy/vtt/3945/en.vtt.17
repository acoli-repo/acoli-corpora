WEBVTT

00:08:28.617 --> 00:08:30.991
does not contain water, it contains fat --

00:08:31.015 --> 00:08:32.594
(Laughter)

00:08:32.618 --> 00:08:36.219
was there to help the camel
get through that six-month-long winter,

00:08:36.243 --> 00:08:37.920
when food was scarce?

00:08:37.944 --> 00:08:41.657
And then, only later, long after
it crossed over the land bridge

00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:46.099
did it retrofit those winter features
for a hot desert environment?

00:08:46.123 --> 00:08:50.197
Like, for instance, the hump
may be helpful to camels in hotter climes

00:08:50.221 --> 00:08:52.693
because having all your fat in one place,

00:08:52.717 --> 00:08:55.458
like a, you know, fat backpack,

00:08:55.482 --> 00:08:58.010
means that you don't have
to have that insulation

00:08:58.034 --> 00:08:59.793
all over the rest of your body.

00:08:59.817 --> 00:09:02.067
So it helps heat dissipate easier.
