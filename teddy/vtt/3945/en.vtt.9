(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what?
That's amazing -- if it's true.

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.501
LN: So they tested
a bunch of the fragments,

00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:35.769
and they got the same result for each one.

00:04:36.197 --> 00:04:41.617
However, based on the size
of the bone that they found,

00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:48.004
it meant that this camel was 30 percent
larger than modern-day camels.

00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:51.218
So this camel would have been
about nine feet tall,

00:04:51.242 --> 00:04:52.440
weighed around a ton.

00:04:52.464 --> 00:04:53.515
(Audience reacts)

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:54.588
Yeah.

00:04:54.612 --> 00:04:58.105
Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.271
