00:11:32.762 --> 00:11:34.344
That's not even a joke.

00:11:34.717 --> 00:11:36.454
Anyway --

00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:40.835
But really, Azuri is here
as a living reminder

00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:45.106
that the story of our world
is a dynamic one.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.837

00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:54.138
(Laughter)

00:11:54.162 --> 00:11:55.613
Right, Azuri?

00:11:55.637 --> 00:12:02.053
And, really, that we're all
just one shard of bone away
