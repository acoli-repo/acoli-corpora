But still, like, they would have
six-month-long winters

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:38.806
where the ponds would freeze over.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.298
You'd have blizzards.

00:07:40.322 --> 00:07:43.933
You'd have 24 hours a day
of straight darkness.

00:07:43.957 --> 00:07:46.938
Like, how ... How?

00:07:46.962 --> 00:07:51.120
How is it that one of these
Saharan superstars

00:07:51.144 --> 00:07:54.375
could ever have survived
those arctic conditions?

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:57.375
(Laughter)

00:07:57.399 --> 00:08:01.087
Natalia and her colleagues
think they have an answer.
