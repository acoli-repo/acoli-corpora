00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.813
Then a year or two later,
Natalia was at a conference in Bristol,

00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:35.031
and she saw that a colleague
of hers named Mike Buckley

00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:40.895
was demoing this new process
that he called "collagen fingerprinting."

00:03:41.284 --> 00:03:44.927
It turns out that different species
have slightly different structures

00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:46.103
of collagen,

00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:48.943
so if you get a collagen profile
of an unknown bone,

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:51.161
you can compare it
to those of known species,

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:53.723
and, who knows, maybe you get a match.

00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:57.825
So she shipped him one of the fragments,

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.143
FedEx.

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:02.977
(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it.
It's kind of important.
