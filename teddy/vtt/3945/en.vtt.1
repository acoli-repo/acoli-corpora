Now, one summer day in 2006,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.171
she was at a dig site called
the Fyles Leaf Bed,

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:40.773
which is less than 10 degrees latitude
away from the magnetic north pole.

00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:43.524
(Audio) NR: Really, it's not
going to sound very exciting,

00:00:43.548 --> 00:00:47.578
because it was a day of walking
with your backpack and your GPS

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:51.680
and notebook and just picking up
anything that might be a fossil.

00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:54.379
LN: And at some point,
she noticed something.

00:00:54.403 --> 00:00:56.570
(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored,

00:00:56.594 --> 00:00:58.529
about the size of the palm of my hand.

00:00:58.553 --> 00:01:00.847
It was just lying on the surface.
