Did you know that there is a global
experiment performed

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:06.496
on approximately 1.6 billion people

00:00:06.496 --> 00:00:09.496
across 75 countries twice a year?

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:12.454
Itâ€™s called daylight saving time.

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:22.579
The sleep-associated consequences
are more significant than you may realize.

00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:24.329
For example in the spring,

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.246
when we lose one hour of sleep,

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:31.413
there is a subsequent 24 percent
relative increase in heart attacks.
