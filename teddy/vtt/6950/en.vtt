00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:12.704
A procession of segmented creatures moves
across the sea floor.

00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:16.704
Up ahead, hundreds have begun 
shedding their exoskeletons

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:21.954
and piling on top of one another in what 
appears to be... a massive orgy.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:25.079
But this is not some alien world.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.579
Itâ€™s Earth about 500 million years ago,

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.246
when these creatures, called trilobites, 
prospered.
