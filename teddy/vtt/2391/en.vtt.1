00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.289
Data, data, data.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.788
So I analyzed the market data
before thinking of a product.

00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:39.080
However, I was unable to think
of anything new at that moment.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.542
(Laughter)

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:42.591
My ideas were unoriginal.

00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:46.904
I wasn't getting any new ideas
and I grew tired of thinking.

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:51.585
It was so hard that I became this skinny.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:53.582
(Laughter)

00:00:53.582 --> 00:00:55.344
It's true.
(Applause)

00:00:56.224 --> 00:01:00.279
You've all probably had
similar experiences and felt this way too.
