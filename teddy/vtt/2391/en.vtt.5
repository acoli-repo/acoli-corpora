Can we make a hat into a toy?

00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:36.757
How about something like a roulette game,
where you try the hat on one by one,

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:41.641
and then, when someone puts it on,
a scary alien breaks through the top

00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:43.635
screaming, "Ahh!"

00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:46.630
I wonder if there would be
a demand for this at parties?

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.873
Ideas that didn't come out while you stare
at the data will start to come out.

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:57.745
Actually, this bubble wrap,
which is used to pack fragile objects,

00:02:57.745 --> 00:03:02.551
combined with a toy,
