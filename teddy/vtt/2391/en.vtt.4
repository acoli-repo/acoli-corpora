A toy gun where you shoot cola
and get someone soaking wet?

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:01.343
(Laughter)

00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:04.376
Ridiculous ideas are okay.
The key is to keep them flowing.

00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:09.732
The more ideas you produce, you're sure
to come up with some good ones, too.

00:02:09.732 --> 00:02:14.598
A brush, for example.
Can we make a toothbrush into a toy?

00:02:14.598 --> 00:02:18.464
We could combine
a toothbrush with a guitar and --

00:02:18.464 --> 00:02:20.609
(Music noises) --

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.765
you've got a toy you can play with
while brushing your teeth.

00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:25.531
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:29.484
Kids who don't like to brush
their teeth might begin to like it.

00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:32.706
Can we make a hat into a toy?
