00:04:24.487 --> 00:04:30.467
If you do this, the ingredients for
the association of ideas are collected

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:33.356
and form connections
that will produce many ideas.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:37.245
The greatest advantage to this method
is the continuous flow of images.

00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:40.218
Because you're thinking
of one word after another,

00:04:40.218 --> 00:04:42.884
the image of the previous word
is still with you.

00:04:42.884 --> 00:04:45.649
That image will automatically
be related with future words.

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:48.171
Unconsciously, a concert will
be connected to a brush

00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:50.360
and a roulette game
will be connected to a hat.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.740
You wouldn't even realize it.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.081
You can come up with ideas that
you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

00:04:55.081 --> 00:04:57.181
This method is, of course,
not just for toys.

00:04:57.181 --> 00:05:01.892
You can collect ideas for books, apps,
events, and many other projects.
