00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:33.591
If you base your ideas on data analysis
and know what you're aiming for,

00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:36.060
you'll end up trying too hard,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.002
and you can't produce new ideas.

00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:40.235
Even if you know what your aim is,

00:03:40.235 --> 00:03:44.121
think of ideas as freely as if you were
throwing darts with your eyes closed.

00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:47.272
If you do this, you surely will hit
somewhere near the center.

00:03:47.272 --> 00:03:48.860
At least one will.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.907
That's the one you should choose.

00:03:50.907 --> 00:03:53.541
If you do so, that idea will be in demand

00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:56.325
and, moreover, it will be brand new.

00:03:56.325 --> 00:03:58.441
That is how I think of new ideas.

00:03:58.441 --> 00:04:01.633
It doesn't have to be Shiritori;
there are many different methods.
