00:00:56.224 --> 00:01:00.279
You've all probably had
similar experiences and felt this way too.

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:02.891
Your boss was being difficult.
The data was difficult.

00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:04.682
You become sick of thinking.

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:07.587
Now, I throw out the data.

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:10.596
It's my dream to create new toys.

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:12.824
And now, instead of data,

00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:17.012
I'm using a game called Shiritori
to come up with new ideas.

00:01:17.012 --> 00:01:20.580
I would like to introduce
this method today.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.701
What is Shiritori?

00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:25.166
Take apple, elephant 
and trumpet, for example.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.400
It's a game where 
you take turns saying words

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.962
that start with the last letter
of the previous word.

00:01:29.962 --> 00:01:31.864
It's the same in Japanese and English.
