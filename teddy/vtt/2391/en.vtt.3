It's the same in Japanese and English.

00:01:31.864 --> 00:01:34.158
You can play Shiritori as you like:

00:01:34.158 --> 00:01:37.396
"neko, kora, raibu, burashi," etc, etc.
[Cat, cola, concert, brush]

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:40.084
Many random words will come out.

00:01:40.084 --> 00:01:45.174
You force those words to connect to what
you want to think of and form ideas.

00:01:45.174 --> 00:01:48.777
In my case, for example,
since I want to think of toys,

00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:51.660
what could a toy cat be?

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.227
A cat that lands after doing
a somersault from a high place?

00:01:55.227 --> 00:01:57.353
How about a toy with cola?

00:01:57.353 --> 00:02:00.354
A toy gun where you shoot cola
and get someone soaking wet?
