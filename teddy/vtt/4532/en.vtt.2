What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.992
happens to ordinary citizens one by one.

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:07.315
And I understood that documentary photography

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:11.805
has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:15.853
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.

00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:21.338
My TED wish. There’s a vital story that needs to be told

00:01:21.338 --> 00:01:24.945
and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:28.529
and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:31.778
to use news photography in the digital era.
