00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.306
I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,

00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:09.932
and -- on a personal level -- an awakening sense of idealism.

00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:14.137
The war in Vietnam was raging, the Civil Rights movement was under way

00:00:14.137 --> 00:00:17.283
and pictures had a powerful influence on me.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.906
Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:23.619
and photographers were telling us another.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.163
I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans.

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:32.324
Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism.
