00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.459
of a hydrostatic skeleton.

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:02.968
It has a central space

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:04.488
of spongy erectile tissue

00:05:04.488 --> 00:05:07.066
that fills with fluid -- in this case blood --

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:09.465
surrounded by a wall of tissue

00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:13.316
that's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen.

00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:15.816
But at the time when I started this project,

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:19.017
the best explanation I could find for penal erection

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:23.301
was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues,

00:05:23.301 --> 00:05:25.000
and the spongy tissues filled with blood

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.268
and pressure rose and voila! it became erect.

00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:32.233
And that explained to me expansion --
