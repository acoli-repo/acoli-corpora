00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.575
When I go to parties,

00:00:01.575 --> 00:00:03.359
it doesn't usually take very long

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:04.399
for people to find out

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:07.507
that I'm a scientist and I study sex.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:12.408
And then I get asked questions.

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:15.575
And the questions usually have a very particular format.

00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:16.807
They start with the phrase,

00:00:16.807 --> 00:00:18.708
"A friend told me,"

00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:20.608
and then they end with the phrase,

00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:22.525
"Is this true?"

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:23.911
And most of the time

00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.030
I'm glad to say that I can answer them,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.877
but sometimes I have to say,

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:29.010
"I'm really sorry,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.194
but I don't know
