00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:32.233
And that explained to me expansion --

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:35.800
made sense: more fluid, you get tissues that expand --

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.817
but it didn't actually explain erection.

00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:42.708
Because there was no mechanism in this explanation

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:45.675
for making this structure hard to bend.

00:05:45.675 --> 00:05:48.391
And no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue.

00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:50.993
So I thought, wall tissue's important in skeletons.

00:05:50.993 --> 00:05:53.359
It has to be part of the explanation.

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:55.894
And this was the point

00:05:55.894 --> 00:05:58.491
at which my graduate adviser said,

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.874
"Whoa! Hold on. Slow down."
