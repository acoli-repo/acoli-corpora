00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.194
but I don't know

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:33.278
because I'm not that kind of a doctor."

00:00:33.278 --> 00:00:35.194
That is, I'm not a clinician,

00:00:35.194 --> 00:00:38.385
I'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:41.318
And my job is to look at lots of different species of animals

00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:44.635
and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:46.136
when everything's going right,

00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:47.754
rather than trying to figure out

00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:49.337
how to fix things when they go wrong,

00:00:49.337 --> 00:00:50.538
like so many of you.

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:52.937
And what I do is I look for similarities and differences

00:00:52.937 --> 00:00:55.204
in the solutions that they've evolved

00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:56.788
for fundamental biological problems.

00:00:56.788 --> 00:00:58.637
So today I'm here to argue

00:00:58.637 --> 00:01:02.503
that this is not at all
