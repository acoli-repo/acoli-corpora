00:01:28.248 --> 00:01:30.531
So today I'm going to give you an example

00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:32.248
drawn from my penis study

00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:33.865
to show you how knowledge

00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:35.632
drawn from studies of one organ system

00:01:35.632 --> 00:01:38.613
provided insights into a very different one.

00:01:38.613 --> 00:01:41.631
Now I'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows --

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:45.147
I did have to explain it to my nine-year-old late last week --

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:48.898
penises are structures that transfer sperm

00:01:48.898 --> 00:01:50.198
from one individual to another.

00:01:50.198 --> 00:01:51.698
And the slide behind me

00:01:51.698 --> 00:01:53.431
barely scratches the surface

00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:55.396
of how widespread they are in animals.

00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:57.381
There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation.

00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:01.255
You find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins,
