So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices,

00:07:31.014 --> 00:07:35.326
and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves,

00:07:35.326 --> 00:07:36.755
which means the skeleton's flexible.

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:39.228
It lengthens, shortens and bends really easily

00:07:39.228 --> 00:07:42.775
in response to internal or external forces.

00:07:42.775 --> 00:07:44.071
Now my adviser's concern

00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:46.437
was what if the penile wall tissue

00:07:46.437 --> 00:07:48.111
is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton.

00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:50.038
What are you going to contribute?

00:07:50.038 --> 00:07:51.505
What new thing are you contributing

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:53.153
to our knowledge of biology?

00:07:53.153 --> 00:07:56.571
And I thought, "Yeah, he does have a really good point here."

00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:58.321
So I spent a long, long time thinking about it.

00:07:58.321 --> 00:08:00.455
And one thing kept bothering me,
