but when internal fertilization evolves,

00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:32.924
penises often follow.

00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:37.341
And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is,

00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:40.257

00:02:40.257 --> 00:02:44.207
And the answer is skeletons.

00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:46.774
You wouldn't think that skeletons and penises

00:02:46.774 --> 00:02:48.625

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:50.757
And that's because we tend to think of skeletons

00:02:50.757 --> 00:02:52.407
as stiff lever systems

00:02:52.407 --> 00:02:54.090
that produce speed or power.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.657
And my first forays into biological research,

00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:00.475
doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate,
