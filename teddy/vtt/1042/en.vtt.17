There's an outer layer and an inner layer.

00:08:30.264 --> 00:08:32.814
The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton.

00:08:32.814 --> 00:08:35.383
I was really surprised at this.

00:08:35.383 --> 00:08:36.328
Everyone I showed it

00:08:36.328 --> 00:08:37.528
was really surprised at this.

00:08:37.528 --> 00:08:39.065
Why was everyone surprised at this?

00:08:39.065 --> 00:08:42.049
That's because we knew theoretically

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.864
that there was another way

00:08:44.864 --> 00:08:47.898
of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton,

00:08:47.898 --> 00:08:50.169
and that was with fibers at zero degrees

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:54.035
and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure.

00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:57.597
The thing is, no one had ever seen it before in nature.

00:08:57.597 --> 00:09:00.297
And now I was looking at one.
