00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:00.475
doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate,

00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:02.026
were really squarely in that realm.

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:05.143
But when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics,

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.608
I really wanted to find a dissertation project

00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:10.507
that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function.

00:03:10.507 --> 00:03:12.309
I tried a bunch of different stuff.

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:13.957
A lot of it didn't pan out.

00:03:13.957 --> 00:03:15.791
But then one day I started thinking

00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:17.573
about the mammalian penis.

00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:21.591
And it's really an odd sort of structure.

00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:24.408
Before it can be used for internal fertilization,

00:03:24.408 --> 00:03:25.891
its mechanical behavior has to change

00:03:25.891 --> 00:03:27.608
in a really dramatic fashion.

00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:30.206
Most of the time it's a flexible organ.
