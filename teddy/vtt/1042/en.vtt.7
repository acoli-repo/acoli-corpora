00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:30.206
Most of the time it's a flexible organ.

00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:31.490
It's easy to bend.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.484
But before it's brought into use

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:34.702
during copulation

00:03:34.702 --> 00:03:36.460
it has to become rigid,

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.475
it has to become difficult to bend.

00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:40.492
And moreover, it has to work.

00:03:40.492 --> 00:03:43.242
A reproductive system that fails to function

00:03:43.242 --> 00:03:46.557
produces an individual that has no offspring,

00:03:46.557 --> 00:03:49.728
and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool.

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:52.189
And so I thought, "Here's a problem

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.437
that just cries out for a skeletal system --

00:03:55.437 --> 00:03:58.649
not one like this one,

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.706
but one like this one --
