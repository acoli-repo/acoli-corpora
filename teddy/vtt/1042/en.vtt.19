00:09:29.754 --> 00:09:32.257
than just covering the vascular tissues.

00:09:32.257 --> 00:09:35.751
They're an integral part of the penile skeleton.

00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:38.288
If the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there,

00:09:38.288 --> 00:09:40.453
if it wasn't reinforced in this way,

00:09:40.453 --> 00:09:41.605
the shape would change,

00:09:41.605 --> 00:09:43.989
but the inflated penis would not resist bending,

00:09:43.989 --> 00:09:46.036
and erection simply wouldn't work.

00:09:46.036 --> 00:09:48.637
It's an observation with obvious medical applications

00:09:48.637 --> 00:09:50.419
in humans as well,

00:09:50.419 --> 00:09:53.354
but it's also relevant in a broad sense, I think,

00:09:53.354 --> 00:09:55.786
to the design of prosthetics, soft robots,

00:09:55.786 --> 00:09:56.853
basically anything

00:09:56.853 --> 00:10:00.171
where changes of shape and stiffness are important.
