You find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins,

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:05.101
as well as the mammalian fleshy, inflatable cylinder

00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:06.736
that we're all familiar with --

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:09.018
or at least half of you are.

00:02:09.018 --> 00:02:11.419
(Laughter)

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.157
And I think we see this tremendous variation

00:02:14.157 --> 00:02:17.308
because it's a really effective solution

00:02:17.308 --> 00:02:19.474
to a very basic biological problem,

00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:21.957
and that is getting sperm in a position

00:02:21.957 --> 00:02:24.509
to meet up with eggs and form zygotes.

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:28.458
Now the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion,

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:30.924
but when internal fertilization evolves,
