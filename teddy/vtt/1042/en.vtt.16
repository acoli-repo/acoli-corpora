00:07:58.321 --> 00:08:00.455
And one thing kept bothering me,

00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:02.905
and that's, when they're functioning,

00:08:02.905 --> 00:08:04.838
penises don't wiggle.

00:08:04.838 --> 00:08:07.177
(Laughter)

00:08:07.177 --> 00:08:10.078
So something interesting had to be going on.

00:08:10.078 --> 00:08:13.379
So I went ahead, collected wall tissue,

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:14.978
prepared it so it was erect,

00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:17.177
sectioned it, put it on slides

00:08:17.177 --> 00:08:19.829
and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look,

00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:24.865
fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety.

00:08:24.865 --> 00:08:27.263
But instead I saw this.

00:08:27.263 --> 00:08:30.264
There's an outer layer and an inner layer.
