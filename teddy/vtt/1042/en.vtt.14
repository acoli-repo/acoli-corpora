00:06:58.482 --> 00:07:00.332
And you can see two layers of fibers,

00:07:00.332 --> 00:07:02.033
one in blue and one in yellow,

00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:04.831
arranged in left-handed and right-handed angles.

00:07:04.831 --> 00:07:07.080
And if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.781
those fibers would be going in helices

00:07:09.781 --> 00:07:11.531
around the long axis of the skeleton --

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:13.664
something like a Chinese finger trap,

00:07:13.664 --> 00:07:15.565
where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck.

00:07:15.565 --> 00:07:18.648
And these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors,

00:07:18.648 --> 00:07:20.680
which I'm going to demonstrate in a film.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.831
It's a model skeleton

00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:24.014
that I made out of a piece of cloth

00:07:24.014 --> 00:07:26.567
that I wrapped around an inflated balloon.

00:07:26.567 --> 00:07:28.265
The cloth's cut on the bias.

00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:31.014
So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices,
