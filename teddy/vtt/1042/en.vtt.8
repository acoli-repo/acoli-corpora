00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.706
but one like this one --

00:04:01.706 --> 00:04:04.123
because, functionally,

00:04:04.123 --> 00:04:05.690
a skeleton is any system

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.722
that supports tissue and transmits forces.

00:04:08.722 --> 00:04:11.072
And I already knew that animals like this earthworm,

00:04:11.072 --> 00:04:12.518
indeed most animals,

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:13.811
don't support their tissues

00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:15.605
by draping them over bones.

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:18.438
Instead they're more like reinforced water balloons.

00:04:18.438 --> 00:04:22.305
They use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton.

00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:24.371
And a hydrostatic skeleton

00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:26.289
uses two elements.

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.439
The skeletal support comes from an interaction

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.213
between a pressurized fluid
