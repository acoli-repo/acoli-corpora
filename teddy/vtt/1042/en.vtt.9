00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.213
between a pressurized fluid

00:04:30.213 --> 00:04:31.819
and a surrounding wall of tissue

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.290
that's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.538
And the interaction is crucial.

00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:41.906
Without both elements you have no support.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.188
If you have fluid

00:04:43.188 --> 00:04:45.222
with no wall to surround it

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:46.656
and keep pressure up,

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.560
you have a puddle.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.660
And if you have just the wall

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.394
with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension,

00:04:52.394 --> 00:04:54.344
you've got a little wet rag.

00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:56.976
When you look at a penis in cross section,

00:04:56.976 --> 00:04:59.409
it has a lot of the hallmarks

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.459
of a hydrostatic skeleton.
