00:02:26.904 --> 00:02:31.161
To make barren land as fertile as forests,

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.920
we plow the land and add paddy,

00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:35.001
organic fertilizer,

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:38.440
sugarcane, coconut husk into it,

00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:41.040
and then we plant saplings
close to each other.

00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:42.520
We do it in such a way that small
and big plants are planted together,

00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:46.360
We do it in such a way that small
and big plants are planted together.

00:02:46.384 --> 00:02:49.200
By doing this we are able
to create a multilevel forest.

00:02:49.224 --> 00:02:52.280
So all the area above the land is green.

00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:56.280
Plants planted in this kind of soil
have roots that also grow fast.

00:02:56.304 --> 00:02:58.640
To protect the dampness of the soil,

00:02:58.664 --> 00:03:03.160
we cover it with a thick
sheet of dry grass or hay.
