00:03:25.425 --> 00:03:31.240
all the plants support each other
and grow like a family.

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:35.160
If the same trees had been planted
individually, far from each other,

00:03:35.184 --> 00:03:36.784
they would never grow so fast.

00:03:37.944 --> 00:03:39.920
In about ten years,

00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:43.140
these forests grow as much
as a 100-year-old forest.

00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:47.680
I believe these forests attract
rain-bearing clouds towards them,

00:03:47.704 --> 00:03:51.920
and the dampness these forests
emit in turn creates clouds.

00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:54.760
By using only local materials,

00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:56.904
in a space meant to park six cars,

00:03:57.744 --> 00:03:59.920
at the price of just one iPhone,

00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:03.904
you can very easily create
a 300-tree strong small forest.
