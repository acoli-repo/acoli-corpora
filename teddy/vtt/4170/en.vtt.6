00:02:58.664 --> 00:03:03.160
we cover it with a thick
sheet of dry grass or hay.

00:03:03.184 --> 00:03:06.720
By watering the soil, 
we keep the dampness intact,

00:03:06.744 --> 00:03:09.120
we weed out the dry grass --

00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:11.560
but we never trim or cut the trees.

00:03:11.584 --> 00:03:15.240
In two years, the forests become so dense

00:03:15.264 --> 00:03:17.880
that the sun’s rays
cannot reach the ground.

00:03:17.904 --> 00:03:19.880
Because of this, 
the soil always stays damp.

00:03:19.904 --> 00:03:23.984
The dry leaves and twigs that fall 
become fertilizer for the same soil.

00:03:23.984 --> 00:03:25.401
In this forest all the trees,

00:03:25.425 --> 00:03:31.240
all the plants support each other
and grow like a family.
