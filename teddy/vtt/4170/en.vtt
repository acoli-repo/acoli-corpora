Shah Rukh Khan: There used to be
a lush green forest in front of my house.

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:11.729
Where you now see buildings,
once there were only trees.

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:14.064
Nightingales used to sing in those trees.


00:00:14.094 --> 00:00:15.554
(Bird sounds)

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:17.024
(Laughter)

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:19.000
We all say these things.

00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:21.960
We remember the greenery of 
the days gone by

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:25.080
and even regret the fact that itâ€™s gone.

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:29.280
Yet soon enough we forget all 
about it, and life moves on.

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:35.160
Bengaluru based Shubhendu Sharma
is not one of those who lives in regret.
