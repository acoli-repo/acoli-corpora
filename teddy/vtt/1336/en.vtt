00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The question today is not:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Why did we invade Afghanistan?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The question is:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
why are we still in Afghanistan

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
one decade later?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Why are we spending

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
$135 billion?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Why were more people killed

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
last month

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
than in any preceding month

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
of this conflict?
