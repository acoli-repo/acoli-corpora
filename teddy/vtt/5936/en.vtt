Princess Savitri of the Madra Kingdom
was as benevolent, brilliant, and bright

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.798
as the Sun God she was named for.

00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:18.228
Her grace was known throughout the land,

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:23.351
and many powerful princes and wealthy
merchants flocked to her familyâ€™s palace

00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:26.211
to seek her hand in marriage.

00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:29.931
But upon witnessing her blinding splendor
in person,

00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:33.169
the men lost their nerve.
