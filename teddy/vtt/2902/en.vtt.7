00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:31.512
We live in a cohousing community
that I not only designed,

00:03:31.536 --> 00:03:32.700
but developed

00:03:32.724 --> 00:03:34.548
and have my architecture practice in.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.486
This community is very intentional
about our social interactions.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.025
So let me take you on a tour.

00:03:41.496 --> 00:03:44.711
From the outside, we look like
any other small apartment building.

00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:47.393
In fact, we look identical
to the one next door,

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:49.081
except that we're bright yellow.

00:03:50.266 --> 00:03:52.652
Inside, the homes are fairly conventional.

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:55.189
We all have living rooms and kitchens,

00:03:55.213 --> 00:03:57.111
bedrooms and baths,

00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:00.527
and there are nine of these homes
around a central courtyard.
