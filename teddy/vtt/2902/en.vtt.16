00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.966
It turns out, when you eat together,

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.153
you start planning
more activities together.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.373
When you eat together,
you share more things.

00:08:06.397 --> 00:08:08.181
You start to watch each other's kids.

00:08:08.205 --> 00:08:11.120
You lend our your power tools.
You borrow each other's cars.

00:08:11.144 --> 00:08:12.465
And despite all this,

00:08:13.578 --> 00:08:15.095
as my daughter loves to say,

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:18.567
everything is not rainbows
and unicorns in cohousing,

00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:23.058
and I'm not best friends
with every single person in my community.

00:08:23.082 --> 00:08:25.501
We even have differences and conflicts.

00:08:27.414 --> 00:08:30.812
But living in cohousing,
we're intentional about our relationships.
