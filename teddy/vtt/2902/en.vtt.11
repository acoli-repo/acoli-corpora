00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:30.949
In support of those meals,
we have a large kitchen

00:05:30.973 --> 00:05:33.468
so that we can take turns
cooking for each other

00:05:33.492 --> 00:05:34.730
in teams of three.

00:05:34.754 --> 00:05:36.953
So that means, with 17 adults,

00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:40.548
I lead cook once every six weeks.

00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:42.950

00:05:42.974 --> 00:05:44.771
with the preparation and cleanup.

00:05:44.795 --> 00:05:46.360

00:05:46.384 --> 00:05:47.621

00:05:48.423 --> 00:05:50.875
I have dinner, talk with my neighbors,

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:53.244
and I go home, having been fed
a delicious meal

00:05:53.268 --> 00:05:56.112
by someone who cares
about my vegetarian preferences.

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:01.577
Our nine families
have intentionally chosen
