00:04:30.138 --> 00:04:31.930
and depending on the time of year,

00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:33.303
we see this:

00:04:33.327 --> 00:04:36.733
kids and grownups in various combinations

00:04:36.757 --> 00:04:39.121
playing and hanging out with each other.

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:41.455
There's a lot of giggling and chatter.

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.114
There's a lot of hula-hooping.

00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:47.627
And every now and then,
"Hey, quit hitting me!"

00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:50.133
or a cry from one of the kids.

00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:52.468
These are the sounds of our daily lives,

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.706
and the sounds of social connectedness.

00:04:56.476 --> 00:04:59.867
At the bottom of the courtyard,
there are a set of double doors,

00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:01.956
and those lead into the common house.
