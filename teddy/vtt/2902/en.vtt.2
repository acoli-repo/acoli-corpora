00:00:59.723 --> 00:01:01.425
is a false sense of connection

00:01:02.606 --> 00:01:04.720
and an increase in social isolation.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.888
I know, I can hear you now,

00:01:06.912 --> 00:01:10.239
there's somebody in the room
screaming at me inside their head,

00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:12.554
"That's my house,
and that's my neighborhood,

00:01:12.578 --> 00:01:14.251
and I know everyone on my block!"

00:01:15.056 --> 00:01:17.355
To which I would answer, "Terrific!"

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.525
And I wish there were
more people like you,

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.534
because I'd wager to guess
there's more people in the room

00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:25.280
living in a similar situation

00:01:25.304 --> 00:01:27.189
that might not know their neighbors.

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:30.457
They might recognize them and say hello,
