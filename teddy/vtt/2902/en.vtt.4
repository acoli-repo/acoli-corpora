00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:00.709
but everyone else is,

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:02.952
and maybe, like me,
you've been in a situation

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:04.860
where you've made eye contact,

00:02:04.884 --> 00:02:07.177

00:02:10.534 --> 00:02:12.527

It's not a new concept.

00:02:21.978 --> 00:02:24.081
In fact, it's an age-old way of living,

00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:26.585
and it still exists in many
non-European cultures

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:27.836
around the world.

00:02:28.517 --> 00:02:30.395
And about 50 years ago,
