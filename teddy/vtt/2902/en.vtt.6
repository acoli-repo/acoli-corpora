In cohousing, you have your own home,

00:03:01.432 --> 00:03:04.569
but you also share significant spaces,
both indoors and out.

00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:07.359
Before I show you
some pictures of cohousing,

00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:10.475
I'd like to first introduce you
to my friends Sheila and Spencer.

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:14.431
When I first met Sheila and Spencer,
they were just entering their 60s,

00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:17.182
and Spencer was looking ahead
at the end of a long career

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:18.440
in elementary education.

00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:20.693
And he really disliked the idea

00:03:20.717 --> 00:03:23.230
that he might not have
children in his life

00:03:23.254 --> 00:03:24.443
upon retirement.

00:03:27.053 --> 00:03:28.474
They're now my neighbors.

00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:31.512
We live in a cohousing community
that I not only designed,
