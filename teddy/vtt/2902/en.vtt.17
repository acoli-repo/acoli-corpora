00:08:27.414 --> 00:08:30.812
But living in cohousing,
we're intentional about our relationships.

00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:34.096
We're motivated
to resolve our differences.

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:36.835
We follow up, we check in,

00:08:37.446 --> 00:08:39.540
we speak our personal truths

00:08:39.564 --> 00:08:40.903
and, when appropriate,

00:08:41.732 --> 00:08:42.953
we apologize.

00:08:43.986 --> 00:08:48.122
Skeptics will say that cohousing
is only interesting or attractive

00:08:48.146 --> 00:08:49.731
to a very small group of people.

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:51.888
And I'll agree with that.

00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:54.989
If you look at Western cultures
around the globe,

00:08:55.013 --> 00:08:57.729
those living in cohousing
are just a fractional percent.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.280
But that needs to change,
