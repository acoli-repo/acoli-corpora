00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:31.653
I'm going to tell you today
how loneliness can be the result

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:33.633
of our built environments --

00:00:33.657 --> 00:00:35.567
the very homes we choose to live in.

00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:39.061
Let's take a look at this house.

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:40.740
It's a nice house.

00:00:40.764 --> 00:00:43.179
There's a big yard, picket fence,

00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:44.404
two-car garage.

00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:48.754
And the home might be
in a neighborhood like this.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.080
And for many people around the globe,

00:00:52.104 --> 00:00:54.324
this home, this neighborhood --

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:56.245
it's a dream.

00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:59.699
And yet the danger of achieving this dream

00:00:59.723 --> 00:01:01.425
is a false sense of connection
