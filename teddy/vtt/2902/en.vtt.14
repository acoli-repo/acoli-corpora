00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:01.737
in the consideration of scale

00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:04.548
and distribution of social gathering nodes

00:07:04.572 --> 00:07:07.889
in and around the community
to support our daily lives,

00:07:07.913 --> 00:07:11.259
all of these spaces help
contribute to and elevate

00:07:11.283 --> 00:07:12.601
the sense of communitas

00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:13.964
in each community.

00:07:15.073 --> 00:07:16.900
What was that word? "Communitas."

00:07:18.117 --> 00:07:22.841
Communitas is a fancy social science way
of saying "spirit of community."

00:07:23.765 --> 00:07:26.227
And in visiting
over 80 different communities,

00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:28.707
my measure of communitas became:

00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:31.549
How frequently did residents eat together?
