research,

00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:33.234
a language we're used to in universities,

00:02:33.294 --> 00:02:35.374
a language we use in the workplace,

00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:41.798
a language we rely on if we were to perform
an advanced research project,

00:02:41.888 --> 00:02:44.555
and it definitely isn't a language
we use at the airport.

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:47.360
If we did so,
they'd strip us of our clothes.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.328
Where can I use it, then?
We could all ask this question!

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:55.980
So, you want us to use Arabic.
Where are we to do so?

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.130
This is one reality.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.488
But we have another more important reality
that we ought to think about.
