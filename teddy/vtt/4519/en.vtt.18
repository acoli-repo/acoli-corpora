00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:02.199
and we launched a campaign to preserve
the Arabic language.

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:05.594
Even though many people told me,
"Why do you bother?

00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:08.677
Forget about this headache
and go have fun."

00:09:08.717 --> 00:09:10.254
No problem!

00:09:10.434 --> 00:09:13.527
The campaign to preserve Arabic
launched a slogan that says,

00:09:13.527 --> 00:09:16.360
"I talk to you from the East,
but you reply from the West."

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:23.928
We didn't say,
"No! We do not accept this or that."

00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:29.053
We didn't adopt this style because
that way, we wouldn't be understood.

00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:32.647
And when someone talks to me that way,
I hate the Arabic language.
