00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:31.995
This is a reality
that developed societies are aware of.

00:04:32.352 --> 00:04:38.666
The Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese,
all these nations are aware of this.

00:04:38.876 --> 00:04:42.712
That's why they legislate
to protect their language.

00:04:42.842 --> 00:04:45.243
They make it sacred.

00:04:45.323 --> 00:04:50.830
That's why they use it in production,
they pay a lot of money to develop it.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.706
Do we know better than them?

00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:55.116
All right,

00:04:55.122 --> 00:04:56.949
we aren't from the developed world,

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.167
this advanced thinking
hasn't reached us yet,

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.901
and we would like to catch up
with the civilized world.
