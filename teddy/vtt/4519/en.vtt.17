The poor woman tried to translate
this for him:

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.695
"From them I extended my hands
and stole you --"

00:08:34.755 --> 00:08:35.830
(Laughter)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.405
And here's the pickle:

00:08:37.405 --> 00:08:41.500
"And because you belong to them,
I returned my hands and left you."

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.616
(Laughter)

00:08:42.765 --> 00:08:44.080
Translate that for me.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:51.674
(Applause)

00:08:51.804 --> 00:08:55.849
So, what have we done to protect
the Arabic language?

00:08:56.129 --> 00:08:59.265
We turned this into a concern
of the civil society,

00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:02.199
and we launched a campaign to preserve
the Arabic language.
