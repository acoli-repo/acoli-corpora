00:01:29.326 --> 00:01:32.391
I'm denied the right to speak
my own language in my own country?

00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:34.312
Where could this happen?

00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:37.672
How did we get here?

00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:41.504
Well, while we are here,
there are many people like me,

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:45.082
who would reach a stage in their lives,
where they involuntarily give up

00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:47.420
everything
that has happened to them in the past,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.559
just so they can say that they're modern

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:51.840
and civilized.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.745
Should I forget all my culture, thoughts,

00:01:54.835 --> 00:01:59.440
intellect and all my memories?

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.995
Childhood stories might be the best memories
we have of the war!
