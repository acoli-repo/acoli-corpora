00:12:57.904 --> 00:13:01.438
We're here to bring attention
to the necessity of preserving this language.

00:13:01.438 --> 00:13:04.313
Now I will tell you a secret.

00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:10.490
A baby first identifies its father

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.557
through language.

00:13:12.557 --> 00:13:17.716
When my daughter is born, I'll tell her,
"This is your father, honey (Arabic)."

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:22.324
I wouldn't say,
"This is your dad, honey (English)."

00:13:22.585 --> 00:13:25.770
And in the supermarket,
I promise my daughter Noor,

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.986
that if she says to me,
"Thanks (Arabic),"

00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:32.753
I won't say, "Dis, 'Merci, Maman,'"
and hope no one has heard her.
