00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.901
and we would like to catch up
with the civilized world.

00:05:03.181 --> 00:05:07.224
Countries that were once like us,
but decided to strive for development,

00:05:07.514 --> 00:05:08.950
do research,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.933
and catch up with those countries,

00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:13.773
such as Turkey, Malaysia and others,

00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:17.604
they carried their language with them
as they were climbing the ladder,

00:05:17.724 --> 00:05:21.011
protected it like a diamond.

00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:22.640
They kept it close to them.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.940
Because if you get any product
from Turkey or elsewhere

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.106
and it's not labeled in Turkish,

00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:32.065
then it isn't a local product.
