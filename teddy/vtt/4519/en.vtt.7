00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.390
when he first started writing,
he used Arabic.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.872
All his ideas, imagination and philosophy

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:42.589
were inspired by this little boy
in the village

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.980
where he grew up,
smelling a specific smell,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.361
hearing a specific voice,

00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:47.986
and thinking a specific thought.

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:52.787
So, when he started writing in English,
he had enough baggage.

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:55.185
Even when he wrote in English,

00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:58.976
when you read his writings in English,
you smell the same smell,

00:03:59.157 --> 00:04:00.871
sense the same feeling.
