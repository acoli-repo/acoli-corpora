00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:01.677
After that,
we launched another campaign

00:10:02.277 --> 00:10:05.685
with scenes of letters on the ground.

00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:08.104
You've seen an example of it outside,

00:10:08.284 --> 00:10:12.666
a scene of a letter surrounded
by black and yellow tape

00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:15.508
with "Don't kill your language!"
written on it.

00:10:15.508 --> 00:10:19.122
Why?
Seriously, don't kill your language.

00:10:19.212 --> 00:10:22.126
We really shouldn't kill our language.

00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:27.304
If we were to kill the language,
we'd have to find an identity.

00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:29.313
We'd have to find an existence.

00:10:29.383 --> 00:10:31.698
We'd go back to the beginning.
