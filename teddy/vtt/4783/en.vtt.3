Sitting in an awkward position 
for a long time can promote poor posture,

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:37.004
and so can using computers 
or mobile devices,

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.279
which encourage you to look downward.

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:43.873
Many studies suggest that, on average,
posture is getting worse.

00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:46.247
So what does good posture look like?

00:01:46.247 --> 00:01:48.877
When you look at the spine 
from the front or the back,

00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:53.429
all 33 vertebrae should appear stacked
in a straight line.

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.226
From the side, the spine
should have three curves:

00:01:56.226 --> 00:02:01.170
one at your neck, one at your shoulders,
and one at the small of your back.
