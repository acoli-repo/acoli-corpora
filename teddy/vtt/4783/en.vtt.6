like your elbows and wrists, 
are supported,

00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:11.512
using ergonomic aids if you need to.

00:03:11.512 --> 00:03:14.009

with your neck supported

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.584

00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:20.079
Wear shoes with low heels
and good arch support,

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.332
