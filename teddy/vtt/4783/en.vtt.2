Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear
on your joints and ligaments,

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:05.441
increases the likelihood of accidents,

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:09.582
and makes some organs, 
like your lungs, less efficient.

00:01:09.582 --> 00:01:12.277
Researchers have linked 
poor posture to scoliosis,

00:01:12.277 --> 00:01:13.877
tension headaches,

00:01:13.877 --> 00:01:15.164
and back pain,

00:01:15.164 --> 00:01:18.660
though it isn't the exclusive 
cause of any of them.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.679
Posture can even influence 
your emotional state

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.997
and your sensitivity to pain.

00:01:23.997 --> 00:01:27.781
So there are a lot of reasons
to aim for good posture.

00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:29.643
But it's getting harder these days.

00:01:29.643 --> 00:01:33.889
Sitting in an awkward position 
for a long time can promote poor posture,
