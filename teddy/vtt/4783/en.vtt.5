00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.344
to a few inches in front of your ankle.

00:02:32.344 --> 00:02:36.098
This keeps your center of gravity
directly over your base of support,

00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:38.209
which allows you to move efficiently

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.006
with the least amount of fatigue
and muscle strain.

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.735
If you're sitting, 
your neck should be vertical,

00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:45.444
not tilted forward.

00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:49.295
Your shoulders should be relaxed
with your arms close to your trunk.

00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:53.663
Your knees should be at a right angle
with your feet flat on the floor.

00:02:53.663 --> 00:02:56.449
But what if your posture isn't that great?

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.279
Try redesigning your environment.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:03.744
Adjust your screen so it's at
or slightly below eyelevel.
