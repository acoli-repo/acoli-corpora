Has anyone ever told you,
"Stand up straight!"

00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:14.762
or scolded you for slouching
at a family dinner?

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:18.644
Comments like that might be annoying,
but they're not wrong.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:22.883
Your posture, the way you hold your body
when you're sitting or standing,

00:00:22.883 --> 00:00:26.126
is the foundation for every movement
your body makes,

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:30.597
and can determine how well your body
adapts to the stresses on it.
