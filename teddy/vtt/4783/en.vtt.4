00:01:56.226 --> 00:02:01.170
one at your neck, one at your shoulders,
and one at the small of your back.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.483
You aren't born with this s-shaped spine.

00:02:03.483 --> 00:02:06.789
Babies' spines just have one curve like a "c."

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.398
The other curves usually develop
by 12-18 months

00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:12.827
as the muscles strengthen.

00:02:12.827 --> 00:02:16.323
These curves help us stay upright
and absorb some of the stress

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:19.406
from activities like walking and jumping.

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:20.950
If they are aligned properly,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.097
when you're standing up,

00:02:22.097 --> 00:02:24.301
you should be able to draw a straight line

00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:26.453
from a point just in front 
of your shoulders,

00:02:26.453 --> 00:02:27.813
to behind your hip,

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.449
to the front of your knee,

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.344
to a few inches in front of your ankle.
