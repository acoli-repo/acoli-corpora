00:03:57.627 --> 00:04:01.976
and I happened to be in Austin that day
doing a stand-up comedy show.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.096
Now I'll tell you,
as a Middle-Eastern male,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.864
when you show up around a lot
of these activities,

00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:08.834

00:04:26.527 --> 00:04:29.437
and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis
from all over the world.

00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:32.558
And one thing that happened there
was also the Pakistani Taliban
