00:02:58.347 --> 00:03:01.620
but do it with a gun, not with a bomb
strapped around me, right?

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:02.860
(Laughter)

00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:05.858
Because I imagine the director:
"Maz, I think your character

00:03:05.882 --> 00:03:07.976
would rob the bank
with a bomb around him."

00:03:08.507 --> 00:03:09.935
"Why would I do that?

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.976
If I want the money,
why would I kill myself?"

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.091
(Laughter)

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:17.291
Right?

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:20.250
(Applause)

00:03:20.274 --> 00:03:22.661
"Gimme all your money,
or I'll blow myself up!"

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:26.438
(Laughter)

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:28.280
"Well, then blow yourself up.

00:03:28.304 --> 00:03:29.454
(Laughter)

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.132
Just do it outside, please."
