00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:32.059
So I was in Kuwait recently,
doing a comedy show

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:33.778
with some other American comedians.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:34.955
They all went through.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.577
Then the border patrol saw my American
passport: "Ah-ha! American, great."

00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:40.650
Then he opened it up.
"Born in Iran? Wait."

00:01:40.674 --> 00:01:42.210
(Laughter)

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:43.930
And he started asking me questions.

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:45.930
He said, "What is your father's name?"

00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:49.493
I said, "Well, he's passed away,
but his name was Khosro."

00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:51.922
He goes, "What
is your grandfather's name?"

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.990
I said, "He passed away a long time ago.

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:55.558
His name was Jabbar."

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.138
He says, "You wait. I'll be back,"
and he walked away.

00:01:58.162 --> 00:01:59.455
And I started freaking out,

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.499
because I don't know what kind
of crap my grandfather was into.
