they put something on the slide

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:03.311
to slow the kid down
as he comes down the slide.

00:07:03.843 --> 00:07:05.433
Not in the Middle East.

00:07:05.457 --> 00:07:07.433
(Laughter)

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:11.153
I put my two-year-old on the slide,
he went whoosh! He took off!

00:07:11.177 --> 00:07:12.279
(Laughter)

00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:15.918

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.239

00:07:20.263 --> 00:07:21.989
(Laughter)

00:07:22.823 --> 00:07:25.540
"Try the yogurt. It's very good.
Little expensive."

00:07:25.564 --> 00:07:27.647
(Laughter)

00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:30.717
But one thing I try to do
with my stand-up is break stereotypes.
