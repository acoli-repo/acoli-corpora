00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:30.717
But one thing I try to do
with my stand-up is break stereotypes.

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:32.854
And I've been guilty
of stereotyping as well.

00:07:32.878 --> 00:07:35.842
I was in Dubai. And there's a lot
of Indians who work in Dubai.

00:07:35.866 --> 00:07:37.497
And they don't get paid that well.

00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:40.398
And I got it in my head that all
the Indians must be workers.

00:07:40.422 --> 00:07:43.236
I forgot there's obviously
successful Indians in Dubai too.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.677
I was doing a show, and they said,
"We'll send a driver to pick you up."

00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:49.071
I went down to the lobby,
and saw this Indian guy.

00:07:49.095 --> 00:07:50.488
I go, "He must be my driver,"

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:53.921
since he's standing there in a cheap
suit, thin mustache, staring at me.

00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:55.799
I say, "Excuse me, are you my driver?"

00:07:55.823 --> 00:07:57.600
He goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel."

00:07:57.624 --> 00:08:00.743
(Laughter)
