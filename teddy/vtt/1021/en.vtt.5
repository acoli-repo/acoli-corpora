00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:32.672
when casting directors find out
you're of Middle Eastern descent,

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:34.415
they go, "Oh, you're Iranian. Great!

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.118
Can you say 'I will kill you
in the name of Allah?'"

00:02:37.142 --> 00:02:39.561
I go, "I could say that,
but what if I were to say,

00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:40.976
'Hello. I'm your doctor'?"

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.631
They go, "Great! And then
you hijack the hospital."

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:48.416
(Laughter)

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.272
Like, I think you're
missing the point here.

00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:54.270
Don't get me wrong,
I don't mind playing bad guys.

00:02:54.294 --> 00:02:56.493
I want to play a bad guy.
I want to rob a bank.

00:02:56.517 --> 00:02:58.323
I want to rob a bank in a film,

00:02:58.347 --> 00:03:01.620
but do it with a gun, not with a bomb
strapped around me, right?
