00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.132
Just do it outside, please."

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:34.681
(Laughter)

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.262
But the fact is, there's good
people everywhere.

00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:40.402
That's what I try and show in my stand-up,
good people everywhere.

00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:42.387
All it takes in one person to mess it up.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.889
Like a couple months ago
in Times Square in New York,

00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:47.973
there was a Pakistani Muslim guy
who tried to blow up a car bomb.

00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:51.239
Now, I happened to be in Times Square
that night doing a comedy show.

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:54.889
And a few months before that, there
was a white American guy in Austin, Texas

00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:57.520
who flew his airplane
into the IRS building,

00:03:57.627 --> 00:04:01.976
and I happened to be in Austin that day
doing a stand-up comedy show.
