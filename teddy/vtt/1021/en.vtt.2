So, anyone who's gotten their passport
in America will tell you,

00:01:02.268 --> 00:01:05.175
when you get it, it still says
what country you were born in.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.234
So I remember getting
my American passport.

00:01:07.258 --> 00:01:09.318
I was like, "Woo-hoo!
I'm going to travel."

00:01:09.342 --> 00:01:12.868
And I opened it up, it said, "Born
in Iran." I'm like, "Oh, come on, man!"

00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:13.917
(Laughter)

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.211
"I'm trying to go places."

00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:16.295
(Laughter)

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:17.561
But what's interesting is,

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:21.097
I've never had trouble in any Western
countries with my American passport,

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.531
even though it says,
"Born in Iran" -- no problems.

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:26.234
Where I've had problems
is in some of the Arab countries.

00:01:26.258 --> 00:01:29.739
I guess some of the Arab countries
aren't getting along with Iran either.

00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:32.059
So I was in Kuwait recently,
doing a comedy show
