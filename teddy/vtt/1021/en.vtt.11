00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:30.246
But the fact is, I've been lucky

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.438
to get a chance to perform
all over the world,

00:05:32.462 --> 00:05:34.571
and I did a lot of shows
in the Middle East.

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:36.388
I just did a seven-country solo tour.

00:05:36.412 --> 00:05:38.730
I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.

00:05:38.754 --> 00:05:39.976
I was in Dubai.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.199
And it's great, there's good
people everywhere.

00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:44.374
And you learn great things
about these places.

00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:46.822
I encourage people always
to go visit these places.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.424
For example, Dubai -- cool place.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:52.008
They're obsessed with having the biggest,
tallest, longest, as we all know.

00:05:52.032 --> 00:05:53.954
They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:56.077
It is so big, they have taxis in the mall.

00:05:56.668 --> 00:06:00.303
I was walking. I heard, "Beep! Beep!"
I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
