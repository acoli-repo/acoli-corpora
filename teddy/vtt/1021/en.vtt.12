00:05:56.668 --> 00:06:00.303
I was walking. I heard, "Beep! Beep!"
I'm like, "What are you doing here?"

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:03.223
He goes, "I'm going to the Zara store.
It's three miles away.

00:06:03.247 --> 00:06:05.551
Out of my way. Out of my way.
Out of my way."

00:06:05.575 --> 00:06:06.825
(Laughter)

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.917
And what's crazy -- there's a recession
going on, even in Dubai,

00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:11.715
but you wouldn't know by the prices.

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:15.011
Like in the Dubai Mall,
they sell frozen yogurt by the gram.

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.279
It's like a drug deal.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.976
I was walking by. The guy goes,
"Psst! Habibi, my friend."

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.140
(Laughter)

00:06:23.164 --> 00:06:24.793
"You want some frozen yogurt?

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:26.364
(Laughter)

00:06:26.388 --> 00:06:28.034
Come here. Come here. Come here.

00:06:28.505 --> 00:06:31.589
I have one gram, five gram, 10 gram.
How many gram do you want?"
