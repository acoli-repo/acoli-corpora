00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.476
I was one of the founding members
of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.071
The other founding members
included Ahmed Ahmed,

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:10.046
who is an Egyptian-American,
who actually had the idea

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.349
to go to the Middle East and try it out
before we went out as a tour.

00:00:13.373 --> 00:00:15.027
He went out solo and did it first.

00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:17.976
Then there was Aron Kader,
who was the Palestinian-American.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.976
And then there was me,
the Iranian-American of the group.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.996
Now, being Iranian-American
presents its own set of problems,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.191
as you know.

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:27.692
Those two countries
aren't getting along these days.

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:29.976
So it causes a lot of inner
conflict, you know,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.182
like part of me likes me,
part of me hates me.
