And one thing that happened there
was also the Pakistani Taliban

00:04:32.582 --> 00:04:34.641
took credit for that failed car bombing.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.274
My question is: Why would you take credit
for a failed car bombing?

00:04:39.298 --> 00:04:40.832
"We just want to say:

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.719
we tried."

00:04:42.743 --> 00:04:45.767
(Laughter)

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:48.628
"And furthermore ...

00:04:48.652 --> 00:04:49.801
(Laughter)

00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:51.424
it is the thought that counts."

00:04:51.448 --> 00:04:53.146
(Laughter)

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.892
(Applause)

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.110
"And in conclusion, win some, lose some."
