00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.182
like part of me likes me,
part of me hates me.

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:33.206
(Laughter)

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.587
Part of me thinks I should
have a nuclear program,

00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:38.042
the other part thinks

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.678
These are dilemmas I have every day.

00:00:40.702 --> 00:00:43.429
But I was born in Iran;

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:45.429

00:00:45.453 --> 00:00:46.821
which means I can travel.

you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.440
(Laughter)

00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:02.244
So, anyone who's gotten their passport
in America will tell you,
