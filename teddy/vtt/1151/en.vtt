00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I want to talk about today is one idea.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's an idea for a new kind of school,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking

Schools for Social Entrepreneurs, Summer Universities

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and the School of Everything.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
