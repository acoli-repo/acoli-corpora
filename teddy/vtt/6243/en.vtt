In the 1930s, the United States
was ravaged by syphilis.

00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:15.871
This sexually transmitted infection
afflicted nearly 1 in 10 Americans,

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:20.538
producing painful sores and rashes 
that persisted for roughly two years.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:25.621
After these initial symptoms, late-stage
syphilis was known to cause organ damage,

00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:28.121
heart and brain disorders,
and even blindness.

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:31.538
It was incredibly difficult 
to slow the diseaseâ€™s spread.
