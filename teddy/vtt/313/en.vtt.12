it was the last time we were in Vancouver,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.726
about 10 years ago. We met in Vancouver,

00:06:02.726 --> 00:06:06.675
at the airport, on a trip 
that we were both taking

00:06:06.675 --> 00:06:08.530

00:06:15.624 --> 00:06:19.194
MK: She would call it an

00:06:19.194 --> 00:06:21.580
She was a state senator at the time,

and we met here, at the airport,

00:06:24.614 --> 00:06:26.132
before a trip to China.

00:06:26.132 --> 00:06:28.738
PM: Would you describe it 
as a whirlwind romance?

00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:30.786
GG: No, no, no.
