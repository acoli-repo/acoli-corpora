00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.880
was irrevocably changed forever.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.879
Mark Kelly: Yeah, it's amazing,

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.653
it's amazing how 
everything can change

00:00:33.653 --> 00:00:35.860
for any of us in an instant.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.508
People don't realize that.

00:00:37.508 --> 00:00:38.698
I certainly didn't.

00:00:38.698 --> 00:00:39.356
Gabby Giffords: Yes.

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:40.606
MK: And on that Saturday morning,

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:43.570
I got this horrible phone call

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.628
from Gabby's chief of staff.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.648
She didn't have much other information.

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:49.977
She just said, "Gabby was shot."

00:00:49.977 --> 00:00:51.194
A few minutes later, I called her back

00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:53.575
and I actually thought for a second,

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:56.314
well, maybe I just imagined 
getting this phone call.

00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:58.016
I called her back, and 
that's when she told me

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.319
that Gabby had been shot in the head.
