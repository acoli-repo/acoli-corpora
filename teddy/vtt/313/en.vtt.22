to replace the piece of skull

00:11:01.618 --> 00:11:03.367
that they took out on the day she was injured

00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:07.060
with a prosthetic, yeah, which
is the whole side of her head.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.040
Now if any of you guys would ever come

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.276
to our house in Tucson for the first time,

00:11:12.276 --> 00:11:14.012
Gabby would usually go up to the freezer

00:11:14.012 --> 00:11:16.080
and pull out the piece of Tupperware

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.140
that has the real skull. (Laughter)

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.244
GG: The real skull.
MK: Which freaks people out, sometimes.

00:11:22.244 --> 00:11:25.936
PM: Is that for appetizer or dessert, Mark?

00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:30.034
MK: Well, it just gets the conversation going.
