00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.505
we might be able to get her back on the bike,

00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:35.119
Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar.

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:37.417
PM: I have a feeling we might 
see that picture next,

00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:39.050
Gabby.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.495
But you meet, you're already decided

00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:44.485
that you're going to dedicate 
your life to service.

00:05:44.485 --> 00:05:46.492
You're going into the military

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:48.773
and eventually to become an astronaut.

00:05:48.773 --> 00:05:51.293
So you meet.

00:05:51.293 --> 00:05:54.070
What attracts you to Gabby?

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.674
MK: Well, when we met, oddly enough,

00:05:57.674 --> 00:06:00.280
it was the last time we were in Vancouver,
