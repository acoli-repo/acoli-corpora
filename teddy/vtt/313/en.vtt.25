MK: Well, that's Gabby's service dog Nelson.

00:12:31.973 --> 00:12:32.936
GG: Nelson.

00:12:32.936 --> 00:12:35.479
MK: New member of our family.
GG: Yes, yes.

00:12:35.479 --> 00:12:38.271
MK: And we got him from a—

00:12:38.271 --> 00:12:40.134
GG: Prison. Murder.
MK: We have a lot of connections

00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:42.786
with prisons, apparently. (Laughter)

00:12:42.786 --> 00:12:44.175
Nelson came from a prison,

00:12:44.175 --> 00:12:48.719
raised by a murderer in Massachusetts.

00:12:48.719 --> 00:12:53.049
But she did a great job with this dog.

00:12:53.049 --> 00:12:55.436
He's a fabulous service dog.

00:12:55.436 --> 00:12:58.379
PM: So Gabby, what have you learned

00:12:58.379 --> 00:13:02.513
from your experiences the past few years?
