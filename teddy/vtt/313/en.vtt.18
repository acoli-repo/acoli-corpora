00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.188
work incredibly hard.

00:09:01.188 --> 00:09:03.463
I mean, Gabby would run 
around like a crazy person,

00:09:03.463 --> 00:09:05.317
never take a day off,

00:09:05.317 --> 00:09:07.443
maybe a half a day off a month,

00:09:07.443 --> 00:09:09.923
and whenever she was awake she was working,

00:09:09.923 --> 00:09:12.308
and she really, really thrived on that,

00:09:12.308 --> 00:09:14.689
and still does today.
GG: Yes. Yes.

00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:17.067
PM: Installing solar panels on the top of her house,

00:09:17.067 --> 00:09:18.349
I have to say.

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:21.927
So after the tragic incident, Mark,

00:09:21.927 --> 00:09:23.656
you decided to resign

00:09:23.656 --> 00:09:25.356
your position as an astronaut,

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:26.910
even though you were supposed to take

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.651
the next space mission.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.332
Everybody, including Gabby,
