00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.319
that Gabby had been shot in the head.

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.144
And from that point on,

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:05.756
I knew that our lives were 
going to be a lot different.

00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:07.733
PM: And when you arrived at the hospital,

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.457
what was the prognosis that they gave you

00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:13.705
about Gabby's condition 
and what recovery, if any,

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:15.196
you could expect?

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:17.136
MK: Well, for a gunshot wound to the head

00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:18.338
and a traumatic brain injury,

00:01:18.338 --> 00:01:21.449
they typically can't tell you much.

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:24.198
Every injury is different. It's not predictable

00:01:24.198 --> 00:01:26.012
like often a stroke might be predictable,

00:01:26.012 --> 00:01:28.746
which is another TBI kind of injury.

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:31.738
So they didn't know how long
Gabby would be in a coma,
