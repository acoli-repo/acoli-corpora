00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.684
MK: I do.

00:04:00.684 --> 00:04:05.020
It might be some of the most
dangerous things I've ever done.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.920
PM: Gabby, are you optimistic

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.183
about your continuing recovery --

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:12.407
walking, talking,

00:04:12.407 --> 00:04:14.911
being able to move your arm and leg?

00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:19.265
GG: I'm optimistic. It will be a long, hard haul,

00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:22.113
but I'm optimistic.

00:04:22.113 --> 00:04:25.317
PM: That seems to be the number one 
characteristic of Gabby Giffords,

00:04:25.317 --> 00:04:26.596
wouldn't you say? (Applause)

00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:28.026
MK: Gabby's always been really optimistic.

00:04:28.026 --> 00:04:30.804
She works incredibly hard every day.
