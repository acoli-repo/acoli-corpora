00:07:27.457 --> 00:07:30.009
that Gabby decided to marry you.

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:32.781
You were willing to go to death row, after all.

00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:33.865
MK: I guess.

00:07:33.865 --> 00:07:37.545
PM: Gabby, what did make you want to marry Mark?

00:07:37.545 --> 00:07:43.781
GG: Um, good friends. Best friends. Best friends.

00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:47.271
MK: I thought we always

00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:49.503
had a very special relationship.

00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:51.395
We've gone through some tough times

00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:55.421
and it's only made it stronger.
GG: Stronger.

00:07:55.421 --> 00:07:57.967
PM: After you got married, however,

00:07:57.967 --> 00:08:00.890
you continued very independent lives.
