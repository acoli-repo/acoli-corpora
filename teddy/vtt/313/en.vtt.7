00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:31.737
for you during this recovery?

00:03:31.737 --> 00:03:36.041
GG: Talking. Really hard. Really.

00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:39.139
MK: Yeah, with aphasia, Gabby
knows what she wants to say,

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.013
she just can't get it out.

00:03:41.013 --> 00:03:42.425
She understands everything,

00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:44.775
but the communication is just very difficult

00:03:44.775 --> 00:03:47.017
because when you look at the picture,

00:03:47.017 --> 00:03:51.653
the part of your brain where
those communication centers are

00:03:51.653 --> 00:03:53.433
are on the left side of your head,

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.220
which is where the bullet passed through.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.433
PM: So you have to do 
a very dangerous thing:

00:03:57.433 --> 00:03:59.079
speak for your wife.

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.684
MK: I do.
