WEBVTT

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:00.159
has become very polarizing and political,

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:02.460
and we're trying to bring some balance

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.924
to the debate in Washington.

00:16:03.924 --> 00:16:05.962
PM: Thank you both for that effort.

00:16:05.962 --> 00:16:09.196
And not surprisingly for 
this woman of courage

00:16:09.196 --> 00:16:10.992
and of a sense of adventure,

00:16:10.992 --> 00:16:13.351
you just keep challenging yourself,

00:16:13.351 --> 00:16:15.154
and the sky seems to be the limit.

00:16:15.154 --> 00:16:16.898
I have to share this video

00:16:16.898 --> 00:16:19.446
of your most recent adventure.

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:22.380
Take a look at Gabby.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.579
MK: This is a couple months ago.

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:32.375
(Video) MK: You okay? You did great.
GG: Yes, it's gorgeous. Thank you.
