00:07:57.967 --> 00:08:00.890
you continued very independent lives.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.211
Actually, you didn't even live together.

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:05.045
MK: We had one of those commuter marriages.

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:08.100
In our case, it was Washington, D.C., Houston,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.223
Tucson.

00:08:09.223 --> 00:08:10.903
Sometimes we'd go clockwise,

00:08:10.903 --> 00:08:12.457
sometimes counterclockwise,

00:08:12.457 --> 00:08:14.072
to all those different places,

00:08:14.072 --> 00:08:17.949
and we didn't really live together

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:20.249
until that Saturday morning.

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:22.547
Within an hour of Gabby being shot,

00:08:22.547 --> 00:08:24.129
I was on an airplane to Tucson,

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:26.010
and that was the moment

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.753
where that had changed things.

00:08:28.753 --> 00:08:31.245
PM: And also, Gabby, you had run for Congress
