MK: Well, it just gets the conversation going.

00:11:30.034 --> 00:11:32.062
PM: But there was a lot 
of conversation about

00:11:32.062 --> 00:11:35.140
something you did, Gabby, after Mark's flight.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.578
You had to make another 
step of courage too,

00:11:38.578 --> 00:11:42.380
because here was 
Congress deadlocked again,

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:48.302
and you got out of the rehabilitation center,

00:11:48.302 --> 00:11:50.763
got yourself to Washington

00:11:50.773 --> 00:11:53.670
so that you could walk 
on the floor of the House --

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.322
I can barely talk about this
without getting emotional —

00:11:56.322 --> 00:11:59.281
and cast a vote which could have been

00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:01.116
the deciding vote.
