00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:01.116
the deciding vote.

00:12:01.116 --> 00:12:04.365
GG: The debt ceiling. The debt ceiling.

00:12:04.365 --> 00:12:06.924
MK: Yeah, we had that vote,

00:12:06.924 --> 00:12:08.874
I guess about five months after Gabby was injured,

00:12:08.874 --> 00:12:11.372
and she made this bold decision to go back.

00:12:11.372 --> 00:12:13.525
A very controversial vote,

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:15.034
but she wanted to be there

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:17.631
to have her voice heard one more time.

00:12:17.631 --> 00:12:19.406
PM: And after that, resigned

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:23.360
and began what has been a very slow

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.848
and challenging recovery.

00:12:25.848 --> 00:12:28.986
What's life like, day to day?

00:12:28.986 --> 00:12:31.973
MK: Well, that's Gabby's service dog Nelson.
