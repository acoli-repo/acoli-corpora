00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:30.979
MK: Well, the first thing, for me, was

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.439
Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious,

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.965
but she did something when she
was in the ICU hospital bed

00:02:39.965 --> 00:02:41.750
that she used to do when we might

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.685
be out to dinner at a restaurant,

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:45.568
in that she pulled my ring off

00:02:45.568 --> 00:02:48.667
and she flipped it from one finger to the next,

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.812
and at that point I knew

00:02:50.812 --> 00:02:52.396
that she was still in there.

00:02:52.396 --> 00:02:54.062
PM: And there were certain words, too.

00:02:54.062 --> 00:02:57.113
Didn't she surprise you with 
words in the beginning?

00:02:57.113 --> 00:03:03.050
MK: Well, it was tough in the beginning.
GG: What? What? Chicken. Chicken. Chicken.
