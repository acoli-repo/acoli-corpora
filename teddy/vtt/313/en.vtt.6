00:02:57.113 --> 00:03:03.050
MK: Well, it was tough in the beginning.
GG: What? What? Chicken. Chicken. Chicken.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.430
MK: Yeah, that was it.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.670
For the first month, that was the extent

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.146
of Gabby's vocabulary.

00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:11.782
For some reason, she has aphasia,

00:03:11.782 --> 00:03:13.778
which is difficulty with communication.

00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:16.220
She latched on to the word "chicken,"

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.496
which isn't the best but 
certainly is not the worst.

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:20.981
(Laughter)

00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:22.344
And we were actually worried

00:03:22.344 --> 00:03:26.585
it could have been a lot worse than that.

00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:28.945
PM: Gabby, what's been 
the toughest challenge

00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:31.737
for you during this recovery?
