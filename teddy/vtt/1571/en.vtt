00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:02.270
I'm going to talk to you today

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:05.777
about the design of medical technology
for low-resource settings.

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:08.154
I study health systems in these countries.

00:00:08.178 --> 00:00:10.093
And one of the major gaps in care,

00:00:10.117 --> 00:00:11.776
almost across the board,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.967
is access to safe surgery.

00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:16.650
Now one of the major
bottlenecks that we've found

00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:19.909
that's sort of preventing
both the access in the first place,

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.369
and the safety of those surgeries
that do happen, is anesthesia.

00:00:23.846 --> 00:00:26.238
And actually, it's the model
that we expect to work

00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:28.961
for delivering anesthesia
in these environments.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.473
Here, we have a scene that you would find
in any operating room across the US,
