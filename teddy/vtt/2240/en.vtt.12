this is a collective crisis,

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:06.079
coming at a time when
the whole notion of the collective,

00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:08.580
of the commons, of the public sphere,

00:06:08.604 --> 00:06:13.502
is being eroded quite deliberately
by neoliberalism and conservatism.

00:06:13.526 --> 00:06:18.054
And so reconnecting with groups of people,

00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:20.824
like-minded people in a common action,

00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:23.013
is solace to the soul.

00:06:23.037 --> 00:06:27.095
It gives you such strength.
It's a great antidote to depression.

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:29.760
So find out what organizations

00:06:29.784 --> 00:06:33.875
