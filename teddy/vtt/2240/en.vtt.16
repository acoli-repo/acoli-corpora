00:07:59.418 --> 00:08:04.361
I met with the Senate [Climate Change
Task Force] a few weeks ago,

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:06.127
and I asked the senators,

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:09.131
"Is there something else
we should be doing?

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.701
Should we be doing more?"

00:08:10.725 --> 00:08:13.245
And Senator Ed Markey said to me,

00:08:13.269 --> 00:08:15.911
"You're building an army.
That's what we need.

00:08:15.935 --> 00:08:17.106
Make it bigger.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.844
We need pressure from the outside."

00:08:18.868 --> 00:08:21.646
And I think that's true
all over the world.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.024
People need to be amassing
armies for the climate,

00:08:26.048 --> 00:08:28.421
armies for the environment,

00:08:28.445 --> 00:08:29.617
in the streets,

00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:32.360
shutting down governments if necessary.
