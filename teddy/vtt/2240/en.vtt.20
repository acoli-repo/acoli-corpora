(Applause)

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:09.003
PM: And you are in a city
that is probably more divided

00:10:09.027 --> 00:10:11.297
than it has been in a very long time.

00:10:11.321 --> 00:10:13.554
The polarities that exist there

00:10:13.578 --> 00:10:16.470
and in many other places around the world

00:10:16.494 --> 00:10:21.488
have kept our collective strength
from being unified and used,

00:10:21.512 --> 00:10:24.618
and in that way, you have been leading us.

00:10:24.642 --> 00:10:30.436
What would success look like to you
from Fire Drill Fridays?
