JF: I was very inspired by Greta Thunberg,
the Swedish student,

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:40.468
and by the young school climate strikers.

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:45.060
Greta says we've got to get
out of our comfort zone.

00:00:45.084 --> 00:00:49.319
We have to behave
like our house is burning,

00:00:49.343 --> 00:00:50.740
because it is.

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:54.100
And so she really struck a chord in me.

00:00:54.124 --> 00:01:00.008
And then, learning that just about
100 percent of climate scientists agree.
