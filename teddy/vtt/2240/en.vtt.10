PM: So Jane, we should also explain,

00:05:11.805 --> 00:05:15.083
because many people who are here
are thinking, what can they do?

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:18.272
Can they come to Washington
and join you in this action?

00:05:18.296 --> 00:05:22.685

who participates in Fire Drill Fridays

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:25.226
is under threat of being arrested.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.022

00:05:28.046 --> 00:05:33.056
like you are currently
in the Greenpeace offices in Washington.
