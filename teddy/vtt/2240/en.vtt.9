00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:32.591
Of course, voting is very, very important,

00:04:32.615 --> 00:04:36.134
and we have to vote for the people
that are the bravest,

00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:39.397
the boldest of our elected officials,

00:04:39.421 --> 00:04:41.729
because the task ahead of us --

00:04:41.753 --> 00:04:45.302
all over the world, but certainly
here in the United States --

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:48.040
we have to get rid
of this current administration,

00:04:48.064 --> 00:04:50.487
and we have to elect people
that are really brave,

00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:52.133
that will step up --

00:04:52.157 --> 00:04:53.232
(Applause)

00:04:53.256 --> 00:04:56.981
and do the bold actions that are needed,
the way Franklin Delano Roosevelt did

00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:00.440
during the 1930s,
during the Great Depression,
