Of course, Greenpeace has chapters
all around the world.

00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:41.404
And even if you just start yourself,
have house parties,

00:06:41.428 --> 00:06:45.117
invite people over
to talk about what's happening.

00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:48.874
Find an article that you can all read
and discuss together.

00:06:48.898 --> 00:06:51.914
Obviously, if there's
a climate action where you live,

00:06:51.938 --> 00:06:53.214

00:06:57.193 --> 00:06:59.035
and risk getting arrested,

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:02.265
but it is going to become
the new normal, I think.
