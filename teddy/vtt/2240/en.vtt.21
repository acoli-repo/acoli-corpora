What would success look like to you
from Fire Drill Fridays?

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.896
JF: Well, I can just speak
as a citizen of the United States.

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:38.652
Success would look like

00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:43.990
every state stops
all new fossil fuel expansion,

00:10:44.014 --> 00:10:47.567
because if they keep drilling
and fracking and mining,

00:10:47.591 --> 00:10:49.343
the problem will just get worse,

00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:51.726
so that no matter what
we do with windmills

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.425
and solar collectors and so forth,

00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:55.129
we'll never be able to catch up.

00:10:55.153 --> 00:10:57.635
We have to stop all new expansion.

00:10:57.659 --> 00:10:58.817
The other thing is,

00:10:58.841 --> 00:11:04.037
they would phase out
fossil fuel emissions gradually,
