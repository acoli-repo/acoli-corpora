00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:00.278
I just think that we do
have to build an army.

00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:02.440
This coming year is the critical year.

00:13:02.464 --> 00:13:05.208
What happens is going to be so important.

00:13:05.232 --> 00:13:06.870
So we have to be sure,

00:13:06.894 --> 00:13:09.634
especially someone who's healthy,

00:13:09.658 --> 00:13:12.090
who feels relatively young,

00:13:12.114 --> 00:13:13.862

that I could do it:

00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:24.078
talk to my neighbors, talk to my friends,

00:13:24.102 --> 00:13:25.404
talk to my family,

00:13:25.428 --> 00:13:27.027
join an organization.

00:13:27.051 --> 00:13:30.438
That's how, also, as I've said,
to stave off depression,
