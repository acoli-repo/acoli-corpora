00:00:00.863 --> 00:00:03.730
I am all in on sending humans to Mars.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.263
There is nothing I want
to achieve more in my career

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:08.830
than seeing humans step foot
on that planet,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.897
because I know it could be the start
of humanity spreading into the cosmos.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.230
I'd be happy to be
that first person on Mars,

00:00:15.263 --> 00:00:19.397
but my wife thinks that a three-year
vacation to a deserted planet

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.830
with no oxygen, no real atmosphere,

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:24.297
nothing to eat or drink,
freezing temperatures,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.063
bone-depleting gravity
and space radiation, is a bad idea,

00:00:28.063 --> 00:00:29.463
for some reason.

00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:32.163
So, I'll settle for sending someone else.
