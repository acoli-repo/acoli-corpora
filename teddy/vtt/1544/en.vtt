00:00:00.765 --> 00:00:04.367
So let me start by taking you back,

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:06.603
back into the mists of your memory

00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:10.116
to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life,

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:12.752
but certainly the most anticipated year

00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:14.730
in all human history:

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.668
the year 2000. Remember that?

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:21.221

00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:25.840
as the clock strikes midnight,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.882
before the champagne goes flat,

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:31.201
and then there's that inchoate yearning
