00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.499
Back pain is one of the biggest reasons
we seek medical care,

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:08.421
and low back pain is listed as a leading
cause of disability worldwide.

00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:11.132
But there's a lot
of misinformation out there,

00:00:11.132 --> 00:00:13.551
and along with it,
a lot of bad treatments.

So today, I want to bring up five things
you should know about back pain.

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:23.436
One:

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:25.521
Back pain isn't just limited to the spine.

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:27.565
Our back is made of bones called vertebrae

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:29.609
that run from your neck to your tailbone.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.030
These vertebrae form the spinal column,
which houses the spinal cord.
