When things break, we have an opportunity.

00:00:05.918 --> 00:00:10.423
We can pick up the pieces
and put them back together the old way,

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:12.842
or we can look for better ways to build.

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:16.387
Covid broke everything.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.558
It put a spotlight
on the many deficits in our economy --

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:27.356
in employment, education,
health care, housing --

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:30.902
and it showed how inequality
made it all worse.
