00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ with all of the city beneath us ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
♫ and all of our lives ahead ♫

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
♫ before cruel and foolish words ♫

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
♫ were cruelly and foolishly said ♫

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
♫ Some nights I think of you ♫

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
♫ and then I go up ♫

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
♫ on Kiteflyer's Hill ♫

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
♫ wrapped up against the winter chill ♫
