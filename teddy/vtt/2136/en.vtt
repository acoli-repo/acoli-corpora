This is about a place in London

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
called Kiteflyer's Hill

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
where I used to go and spend hours

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
going "When is he coming back? When is he coming back?"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
who I've got over.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But this is "Kiteflyer's Hill."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
actually, for me.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Boo Hewerdine, Thomas Dolby,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
thank you very much for inviting me. It's been a blessing singing for you.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Thank you very much.
