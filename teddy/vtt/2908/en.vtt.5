00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.868
into a chance to show to my coworkers
and my dear husband

00:02:30.892 --> 00:02:33.494
what a responsive person I was,

00:02:33.518 --> 00:02:36.403
or at least it was a chance to find
another perfect couch

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:38.133
for my page on Pinterest.

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.824
I realized that I was never bored.

00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:44.618
And anyway, don't only
boring people get bored?

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:46.590
But then I started to wonder:

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:48.876
What actually happens to us
when we get bored?

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.077
Or, more importantly: What happens to us
if we never get bored?

00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:58.052
And what could happen if we got rid of
this human emotion entirely?

00:02:58.076 --> 00:03:02.327
I started talking to neuroscientists
and cognitive psychologists,
