00:00:55.266 --> 00:01:00.709
It was only until about three months in
that something shifted, though.

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.820
As I pounded the pavement,

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:06.007
my mind started to wander, too.

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:10.281
I began imagining what I would do
when I finally did sleep again.

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:12.313
So the colic did fade,

00:01:12.337 --> 00:01:15.136
and I finally got an iPhone

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.055
and I put all those hours
of wandering into action.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.995
I created my dream job
hosting a public radio show.

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.179
So there was no more
rushing off to war zones,

00:01:24.203 --> 00:01:26.105
but thanks to my new smartphone,

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:28.400
I could be a mother and a journalist.

00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:32.776
I could be on the playground
and on Twitter at the same time.
