00:00:00.911 --> 00:00:04.727
My son and the iPhone
were born three weeks apart

00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:06.771
in June 2007.

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:10.916
So while those early adopters
were lined up outside,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.865
waiting to get their hands
on this amazing new gadget,

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.833
I was stuck at home
with my hands full of something else

00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:20.103
that was sending out
constant notifications --

00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:21.960
(Laughter)

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:24.596
a miserable, colicky baby

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.609
who would only sleep in a moving stroller
with complete silence.
