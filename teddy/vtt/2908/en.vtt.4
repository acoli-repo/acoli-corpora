This was different
than writer's block, right?

00:02:01.757 --> 00:02:04.832
It wasn't like there was something there
waiting to be unearthed.

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:06.280
There was just nothing.

00:02:06.304 --> 00:02:07.782
And so I started to think back:

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.573
When was the last time

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:13.347
Yeah, it was when I was pushing
that damn stroller.

00:02:14.052 --> 00:02:17.461

were filled with phone time.

00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:21.010
I checked the headlines
while I waited for my latte.

00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:25.106
I updated my calendar
while I was sitting on the couch.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.555
Texting turned every spare moment

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.868
into a chance to show to my coworkers
and my dear husband
