00:15:28.099 --> 00:15:30.767
But if it's to distract yourself
from doing the hard work

00:15:30.791 --> 00:15:33.091
that comes with deeper thinking,

00:15:33.115 --> 00:15:34.523
take a break,

00:15:34.547 --> 00:15:35.945
stare out the window

00:15:36.667 --> 00:15:39.512
and know that by doing nothing

00:15:39.536 --> 00:15:44.238
you are actually being
your most productive and creative self.

00:15:44.262 --> 00:15:46.985
It might feel weird
and uncomfortable at first,

00:15:47.009 --> 00:15:49.895
but boredom truly can lead to brilliance.

00:15:50.394 --> 00:15:51.546
Thank you.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:56.357
