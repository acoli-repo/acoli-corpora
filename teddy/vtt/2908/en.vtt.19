As one UX designer told me,

00:09:30.238 --> 00:09:33.511
the only people who refer
to their customers as "users"

00:09:33.535 --> 00:09:35.603
are drug dealers and technologists.

00:09:35.627 --> 00:09:36.983
(Laughter)

00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:39.951
(Applause)

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:46.803
And users, as we know,
are worth a lot of money.

00:09:46.827 --> 00:09:50.237
Here's former Facebook
product manager and author,

00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:52.827
Antonio García Martínez.

00:09:53.547 --> 00:09:56.865
(Audio) Antonio García Martínez:
The saying is, if any product is free

00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:59.490
then you're the product;
your attention is the product.

00:09:59.514 --> 00:10:01.088
But what is your attention worth?
