and switches tasks on their computer

00:05:01.678 --> 00:05:05.574
566 times a day.

00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:09.099
I discovered all this
talking to professor of informatics,

00:05:09.123 --> 00:05:10.847
Dr. Gloria Mark.

00:05:11.307 --> 00:05:14.853
(Audio) Dr. Gloria Mark: So we find
that when people are stressed,

00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:18.048
they tend to shift
their attention more rapidly.

00:05:18.072 --> 00:05:20.311
We also found, strangely enough,

00:05:20.335 --> 00:05:26.035
that the shorter the amount of sleep
that a person gets,

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.155
the more likely they are
to check Facebook.

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:32.221
So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle.
