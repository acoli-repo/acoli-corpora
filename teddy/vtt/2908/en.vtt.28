00:13:59.691 --> 00:14:02.296
And we really need this next generation

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.546
to be able to focus on some big problems:

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.014
climate change, economic disparity,

00:14:07.038 --> 00:14:09.075
massive cultural differences.

00:14:09.662 --> 00:14:12.383
No wonder CEOs in an IBM survey

00:14:12.407 --> 00:14:17.020
identified creativity as the number one
leadership competency.

00:14:18.214 --> 00:14:19.882
OK, here's the good news, though:

00:14:19.906 --> 00:14:23.677
In the end, 20,000 people
did "Bored and Brilliant" that week.

00:14:23.701 --> 00:14:26.133
Ninety percent cut down on their minutes.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:29.027
Seventy percent got more time to think.

00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:31.180
People told me that they slept better.
