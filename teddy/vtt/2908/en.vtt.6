I started talking to neuroscientists
and cognitive psychologists,

00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:05.276
and what they told me was fascinating.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.093
It turns out that when you get bored,

00:03:07.117 --> 00:03:11.201
you ignite a network in your brain
called the "default mode."

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:16.084
So our body, it goes on autopilot
while we're folding the laundry

00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:17.475
or we're walking to work,

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.460
but actually that is when our brain
gets really busy.

Here's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann.

00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:26.610
(Audio) Dr. Sandi Mann:
Once you start daydreaming

00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:28.450
and allow your mind to really wander,

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:31.033
you start thinking a little bit
beyond the conscious,
