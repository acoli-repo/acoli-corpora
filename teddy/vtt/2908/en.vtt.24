00:11:59.656 --> 00:12:03.194
and I feel I maybe, over the last year
when I've been on Twitter,

00:12:03.218 --> 00:12:04.838
have developed an addiction to it,

00:12:04.862 --> 00:12:08.250
and this "Bored and Brilliant" challenge
has really made me realize it.

00:12:08.274 --> 00:12:11.406
After a brief period of really horrible
withdrawal feeling,

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.399
like lack-of-caffeine headache,

00:12:13.423 --> 00:12:14.999
I now feel lovely.

00:12:15.023 --> 00:12:16.834
I had a lovely dinner with my family,

00:12:16.858 --> 00:12:21.533
and I hope to continue this structured use
of these powerful tools.

00:12:21.557 --> 00:12:24.056
(Audio) Woman 4: I don't have
that guilty gut feeling

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.375
I have when I know
I'm wasting time on my phone.

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.901
Maybe I'll have to start giving myself
challenges and reminders like this

00:12:29.925 --> 00:12:31.077
every morning.
