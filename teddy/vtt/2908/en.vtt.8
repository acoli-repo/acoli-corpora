00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:01.638
and we figure out what steps

00:04:01.662 --> 00:04:06.111
But now we chill out on the couch
also while updating a Google Doc

00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:08.055
or replying to email.

We call it "getting shit done,"

00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:13.669
but here's what neuroscientist
Dr. Daniel Levitin says

00:04:13.693 --> 00:04:15.009

to accomplish that.

00:04:26.114 --> 00:04:28.533
So if you're attempting to multitask,

00:04:28.557 --> 00:04:30.880
you know, doing four
or five things at once,
