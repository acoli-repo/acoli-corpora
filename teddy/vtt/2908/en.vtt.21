00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.129
and I thought, you know,

00:10:31.153 --> 00:10:34.414
I had just come down that stairway,
but I could go back up

00:10:34.438 --> 00:10:36.923
and then come back down
and get a little cardio.

00:10:36.947 --> 00:10:38.111
So I did,

00:10:38.135 --> 00:10:41.976
and then I had a little more time,
so I did it again and I did it again,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.806
and I did it 10 times.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.201
And I had a complete cardio workout.

00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:48.652
I got on that R train feeling
kind of exhausted,

00:10:48.676 --> 00:10:51.340
but, like, wow,
that had never occurred to me.

00:10:51.364 --> 00:10:52.759
How is that possible?

00:10:52.783 --> 00:10:53.887
(Laughter)

00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:57.897
MZ: So creativity, I learned, means
different things to different people.

00:10:57.921 --> 00:10:58.921
(Laughter)

00:10:58.945 --> 00:11:02.498
But everyone found
day three's challenge the hardest.
