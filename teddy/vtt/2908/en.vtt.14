yeah, but you gotta meet people
where they are.

00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:02.937
(Laughter)

00:07:02.967 --> 00:07:04.745
So before challenge week,

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:07.637
we were averaging two hours
a day on our phones

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:09.369

and I've been picking up my phone
70 to 100 times per day.

00:07:26.368 --> 00:07:28.044
And it's really concerning,

00:07:28.068 --> 00:07:30.502
because that's so much time
that I could have spent
