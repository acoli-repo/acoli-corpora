(Audio) Woman: I think of my phone
like a power tool:

00:06:30.997 --> 00:06:34.906
extremely useful, but dangerous
if I'm not handling it properly.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.208
(Audio) Woman 2:
If I don't pay close attention,

00:06:37.232 --> 00:06:39.685
I'll suddenly realize
that I've lost an hour of time

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:41.700
doing something totally mindless.

00:06:41.724 --> 00:06:44.027
MZ: OK, but to really measure
any improvement,

00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:45.472
we needed data, right?

00:06:45.496 --> 00:06:47.687
Because that's what we do these days.

00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:50.849
So we partnered with some apps
that would measure how much time

00:06:50.873 --> 00:06:52.965
we were spending every day on our phone.

00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:54.466
If you're thinking it's ironic

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.539
that I asked people
to download another app

00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:59.086
so that they would spend
less time on their phones:

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.417
yeah, but you gotta meet people
where they are.
