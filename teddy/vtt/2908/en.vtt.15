00:07:28.068 --> 00:07:30.502
because that's so much time
that I could have spent

00:07:30.526 --> 00:07:34.378
doing something more productive,
more creative, more towards myself,

00:07:34.402 --> 00:07:37.360
because when I'm on my phone,
I'm not doing anything important.

00:07:37.384 --> 00:07:40.729
MZ: Like Tina, people were starting
to observe their own behavior.

00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:43.327
They were getting ready
for challenge week.

00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:45.125
And that Monday,

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:48.024
they started to wake up
to instructions in their inbox,

00:07:48.048 --> 00:07:49.614
an experiment to try.

00:07:50.065 --> 00:07:51.616
Day one:

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.225
"Put it in your pocket."

00:07:53.249 --> 00:07:55.541
Take that phone out of your hand.

00:07:55.565 --> 00:07:58.540
See if you can eliminate the reflex
to check it all day long,

00:07:58.564 --> 00:08:00.058
just for a day.
