00:04:28.557 --> 00:04:30.880
you know, doing four
or five things at once,

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:33.445
you're not actually doing
four or five things at once,

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.394
because the brain doesn't work that way.

00:04:35.418 --> 00:04:38.269
Instead, you're rapidly shifting
from one thing to the next,

00:04:38.293 --> 00:04:40.336
depleting neural resources as you go.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.147
(Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, switch,
you're using glucose, glucose, glucose.

00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:47.488
(Audio) DL: Exactly right, and we have
a limited supply of that stuff.

00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:49.921
MZ: A decade ago, we shifted
our attention at work

00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:51.205
every three minutes.

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.122
Now we do it every 45 seconds,

00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:55.983
and we do it all day long.

00:04:56.007 --> 00:04:59.343
The average person checks email
74 times a day,

00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:01.654
and switches tasks on their computer
