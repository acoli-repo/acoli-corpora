00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:31.033
you start thinking a little bit
beyond the conscious,

00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:32.780
a little bit into the subconscious,

00:03:32.804 --> 00:03:35.976
which allows sort of different
connections to take place.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.490
It's really awesome, actually.

00:03:37.514 --> 00:03:39.528
Manoush Zomorodi: Totally awesome, right?

00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:42.247
So this is my brain in an fMRI,

00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:46.224
and I learned that in the default mode
is when we connect disparate ideas,

00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:48.758
we solve some of our most
nagging problems,

00:03:48.782 --> 00:03:51.823
and we do something called
"autobiographical planning."

00:03:51.847 --> 00:03:53.742
This is when we look back at our lives,

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.965
we take note of the big moments,
we create a personal narrative,

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.497
and then we set goals

00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:01.638
and we figure out what steps
we need to take to reach them.
