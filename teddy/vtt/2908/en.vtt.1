00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:33.367
I literally was walking
10 to 15 miles a day,

00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:34.966
and the baby weight came off.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.591
That part was great.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:39.373
But man, was I bored.

00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:41.549
Before motherhood, I had been a journalist

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:44.140
who rushed off when the Concorde crashed.

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:46.585
I was one of the first
people into Belgrade

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.110
when there was a revolution in Serbia.

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:51.956
Now, I was exhausted.

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:55.242
This walking went on for weeks.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:01:00.709
It was only until about three months in
that something shifted, though.
