00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:32.221
So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle.

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:34.343
MZ: But could this cycle be broken?

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:38.049
What would happen
if we broke this vicious cycle?

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:42.160
Maybe my listeners could help me find out.

00:05:43.461 --> 00:05:46.111
What if we reclaimed
those cracks in our day?

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:49.830
Could it help us
jump-start our creativity?

00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:54.648
We called the project
"Bored and Brilliant."

00:05:56.264 --> 00:05:59.313
And I expected, you know,
a couple hundred people to play along,

00:05:59.337 --> 00:06:02.414
but thousands of people
started signing up.
