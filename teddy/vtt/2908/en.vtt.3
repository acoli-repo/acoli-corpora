I could be on the playground
and on Twitter at the same time.

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:35.472
Yeah, well, when I thought that,

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:37.543
when the technology came in and took over,

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:39.717
that is when I hit a wall.

00:01:40.356 --> 00:01:42.566
So, I want you to picture this:

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.844
you host a podcast, and you have to prove

00:01:44.868 --> 00:01:48.288
that the investment
of precious public radio dollars in you

00:01:48.312 --> 00:01:49.488
is worth it.

00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:53.757
My goal was to increase
my audience size tenfold.

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:56.245
So one day, I sat down to brainstorm,

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:57.545
as you do,

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.538
and I came up barren.

00:01:59.562 --> 00:02:01.733
This was different
than writer's block, right?
