that's designed to trick your brain

And it goes like this:

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:18.222
if a newspaper came out once a century,

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:21.934
what would the front page
banner headline be?

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:25.021
“We defeated the Nazis,”
or “landed on the moon,”

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:27.106
or "built the Internet"?

00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:31.652
I would argue that it would be
the story of a single number,
