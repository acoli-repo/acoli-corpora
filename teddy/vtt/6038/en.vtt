“We are men.

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.788
We are not beasts and we do not intend 
to be beaten or driven as such...

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:16.496
What has happened here 
is but the sound before the fury

00:00:16.496 --> 00:00:18.246
of those who are oppressed.”

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.538
These words were spoken during 
the 1971 Attica Prison Rebellion

00:00:22.538 --> 00:00:24.788
by one of its leaders, Elliott Barkley.

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:28.954

was severely overcrowded.

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:34.412
Its majority Black and Latino population
faced constant physical and verbal abuse.
