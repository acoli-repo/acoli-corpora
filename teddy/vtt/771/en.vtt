00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a writer and a journalist,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and I'm also an insanely curious person,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
so in 22 years as a journalist,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I've learned how to do a lot of new things.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
was to become invisible.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I became one of the working homeless.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I quit my job as a newspaper editor

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
after my father died in February of that same year,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and decided to travel.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
His death hit me pretty hard.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.
