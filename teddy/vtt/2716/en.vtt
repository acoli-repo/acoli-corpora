Speaking up is hard to do.

00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:09.507
I understood the true meaning
of this phrase exactly one month ago,

00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:12.434
when my wife and I became new parents.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.791
It was an amazing moment.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.000
It was exhilarating and elating,

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:20.345
but it was also scary and terrifying.

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.571
And it got particularly terrifying
when we got home from the hospital,

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:26.056
and we were unsure

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.169
whether our little baby boy was getting
enough nutrients from breastfeeding.
