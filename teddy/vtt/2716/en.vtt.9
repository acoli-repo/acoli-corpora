00:04:26.127 --> 00:04:31.111
And the key thing is that women have
the same need as men to speak up,

00:04:31.135 --> 00:04:33.032
but they have barriers to doing so.

00:04:34.004 --> 00:04:37.282
But what my research has shown
over the last two decades

00:04:37.306 --> 00:04:40.587
is that what looks
like a gender difference

00:04:41.035 --> 00:04:43.432
is not really a gender double bind,

00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:45.812
it's a really a low-power double bind.

00:04:45.836 --> 00:04:47.720
And what looks like a gender difference

00:04:47.744 --> 00:04:50.850
are really often just power
differences in disguise.

00:04:51.394 --> 00:04:54.117
Oftentimes we see a difference
between a man and a woman

00:04:54.141 --> 00:04:55.339
or men and women,

00:04:55.363 --> 00:04:58.971
and think, "Biological cause.
There's something fundamentally different

00:04:58.995 --> 00:05:00.241
about the sexes."
