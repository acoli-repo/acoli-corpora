00:03:29.254 --> 00:03:30.713
or new to an organization

00:03:30.737 --> 00:03:32.296
or new to an experience,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.425
like my wife and I as new parents.

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:35.950
Sometimes it's at work,

00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:38.585
where someone's the boss
and someone's the subordinate.

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.293
Sometimes it's in relationships,

00:03:40.317 --> 00:03:43.298
where one person's more invested
than the other person.

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:46.837
And the key thing is that when
we have lots of power,

00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:48.690
our range is very wide.

00:03:48.714 --> 00:03:51.345
We have a lot of leeway in how to behave.

00:03:51.813 --> 00:03:54.141
But when we lack power, our range narrows.

00:03:54.537 --> 00:03:56.332
We have very little leeway.

00:03:56.947 --> 00:03:59.729
The problem is that when
our range narrows,

00:03:59.753 --> 00:04:03.856
that produces something called
the low-power double bind.
