00:06:58.862 --> 00:07:01.234
is something called perspective-taking.

00:07:01.258 --> 00:07:04.010
And perspective-taking is really simple:

00:07:04.034 --> 00:07:08.319
it's simply looking at the world
through the eyes of another person.

00:07:09.014 --> 00:07:12.802
It's one of the most important tools
we have to expand our range.

00:07:12.826 --> 00:07:14.533
When I take your perspective,

00:07:14.557 --> 00:07:16.996
and I think about what you really want,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.390
you're more likely to give me
what I really want.

00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:22.961
But here's the problem:

00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:25.266
perspective-taking is hard to do.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.820
So let's do a little experiment.

00:07:26.844 --> 00:07:29.858
I want you all to hold
your hand just like this:

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:31.177
your finger -- put it up.
