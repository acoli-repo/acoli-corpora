00:09:29.084 --> 00:09:30.257
Or option B:

00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:33.493
$23,000 and a three-year warranty.

00:09:33.845 --> 00:09:37.423
My research shows that when you give
people a choice among options,

00:09:37.447 --> 00:09:39.336
it lowers their defenses,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.558
and they're more likely
to accept your offer.

00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:44.319
And this doesn't just
work with salespeople;

00:09:44.343 --> 00:09:45.534
it works with parents.

00:09:45.558 --> 00:09:46.837
When my niece was four,

00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:49.778
she resisted getting dressed
and rejected everything.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.688
But then my sister-in-law
had a brilliant idea.

00:09:53.079 --> 00:09:55.630
What if I gave my daughter a choice?

00:09:55.654 --> 00:09:57.675
This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt.

00:09:57.699 --> 00:09:59.821
This pant or that pant? OK, that pant.

00:09:59.845 --> 00:10:01.183
And it worked brilliantly.
