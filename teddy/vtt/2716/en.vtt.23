00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.932
Two, I've actually done research
on the strategic benefits

00:11:33.956 --> 00:11:35.257
of asking for advice.

00:11:35.882 --> 00:11:38.208
And three, it still worked!

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:39.873
I took their perspective,

00:11:39.897 --> 00:11:42.084
I became more invested in their cause,

00:11:42.108 --> 00:11:45.914
I became more committed to them
because they asked for advice.

00:11:46.343 --> 00:11:49.527
Now, another time we feel
more confident speaking up

00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:51.690
is when we have expertise.

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:54.299
Expertise gives us credibility.

00:11:54.862 --> 00:11:57.789
When we have high power,
we already have credibility.

00:11:57.813 --> 00:11:59.278
We only need good evidence.

00:11:59.777 --> 00:12:02.747
When we lack power,
we don't have the credibility.
