00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:33.892
The first: you seem powerful
in your own eyes.

00:05:34.284 --> 00:05:37.605
The second: you seem powerful
in the eyes of others.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.484
When I feel powerful,

00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:41.992
I feel confident, not fearful;

00:05:42.016 --> 00:05:43.858
I expand my own range.

00:05:43.882 --> 00:05:46.028
When other people see me as powerful,

00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:49.150
they grant me a wider range.

00:05:49.174 --> 00:05:53.928
So we need tools to expand
our range of acceptable behavior.

00:05:53.952 --> 00:05:56.343
And I'm going to give you
a set of tools today.

00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:57.985
Speaking up is risky,

00:05:58.503 --> 00:06:02.432
but these tools will lower
your risk of speaking up.
