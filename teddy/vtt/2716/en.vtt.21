00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:31.243
but we also earn strong allies.

00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:36.513
Another way we can earn strong allies,
especially in high places,

00:10:36.537 --> 00:10:39.386
is by asking other people for advice.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:45.291
When we ask others for advice,
they like us because we flatter them,

00:10:45.315 --> 00:10:46.802
and we're expressing humility.

00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:50.477
And this really works to solve
another double bind.

00:10:50.831 --> 00:10:53.159
And that's the self-promotion double bind.

00:10:53.498 --> 00:10:55.002
The self-promotion double bind

00:10:55.026 --> 00:10:58.181
is that if we don't advertise
our accomplishments,

00:10:58.205 --> 00:10:59.415
no one notices.

00:10:59.439 --> 00:11:01.843
And if we do, we're not likable.
