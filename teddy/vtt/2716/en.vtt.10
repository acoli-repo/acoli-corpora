00:04:58.995 --> 00:05:00.241
about the sexes."

00:05:00.265 --> 00:05:02.119
But in study after study,

00:05:02.143 --> 00:05:06.349
I've found that a better explanation
for many sex differences

00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:08.405
is really power.

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:11.496
And so it's the low-power double bind.

00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:16.791
And the low-power double bind
means that we have a narrow range,

00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:18.645
and we lack power.

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:19.901
We have a narrow range,

00:05:19.925 --> 00:05:21.847
and our double bind is very large.

00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:24.691
So we need to find ways
to expand our range.

00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:26.292
And over the last couple decades,

00:05:26.316 --> 00:05:29.297
my colleagues and I have found
two things really matter.

00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:33.892
The first: you seem powerful
in your own eyes.
