00:06:27.196 --> 00:06:30.804
That's when they advocate for others.

00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:33.388
When they advocate for others,

00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:38.289
they discover their own range
and expand it in their own mind.

00:06:38.313 --> 00:06:39.722
They become more assertive.

00:06:39.746 --> 00:06:42.620
This is sometimes called
"the mama bear effect."

00:06:43.483 --> 00:06:45.742
Like a mama bear defending her cubs,

00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:49.714
when we advocate for others,
we can discover our own voice.

00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:53.445
But sometimes, we have
to advocate for ourselves.

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:54.809
How do we do that?

00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:58.838
One of the most important tools
we have to advocate for ourselves

00:06:58.862 --> 00:07:01.234
is something called perspective-taking.
