00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:02.644
Can I confront my coworker
who keeps stepping on my toes?

00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:06.063
Can I challenge my friend's
insensitive joke?

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.486
Can I tell the person I love the most
my deepest insecurities?

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:13.676
And through these experiences,
I've come to recognize

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.557
that each of us have something called
a range of acceptable behavior.

00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:22.832
Now, sometimes we're too strong;
we push ourselves too much.

00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:24.619
That's what happened with my brother.

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:29.269
Even making an offer was outside
his range of acceptable behavior.

00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:31.187
But sometimes we're too weak.
