00:00:58.943 --> 00:01:02.238
But sometimes we speak up
when we shouldn't,

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:06.188
and I learned that over 10 years ago
when I let my twin brother down.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.221
My twin brother
is a documentary filmmaker,

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:10.775
and for one of his first films,

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.414
he got an offer
from a distribution company.

00:01:13.438 --> 00:01:14.776
He was excited,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.467
and he was inclined to accept the offer.

00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:19.584
But as a negotiations researcher,

00:01:19.608 --> 00:01:22.561
I insisted he make a counteroffer,

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:25.815
and I helped him craft the perfect one.

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:27.520
And it was perfect --

00:01:27.544 --> 00:01:29.548
it was perfectly insulting.
