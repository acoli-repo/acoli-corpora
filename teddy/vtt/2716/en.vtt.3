00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.136
The company was so offended,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.209
they literally withdrew the offer

00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:36.450
and my brother was left with nothing.

00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:40.334
And I've asked people all over the world
about this dilemma of speaking up:

00:01:40.358 --> 00:01:42.192
when they can assert themselves,

00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:43.930
when they can push their interests,

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:46.149
when they can express an opinion,

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:48.384
when they can make an ambitious ask.

00:01:48.887 --> 00:01:53.120
And the range of stories
are varied and diverse,

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:55.815
but they also make up
a universal tapestry.

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:58.517
Can I correct my boss
when they make a mistake?

00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:02.644
Can I confront my coworker
who keeps stepping on my toes?
