00:08:29.873 --> 00:08:31.329
She took his perspective,

00:08:31.353 --> 00:08:33.720
and she noticed something
really important.

00:08:33.744 --> 00:08:36.450
He asked for a specific amount of money.

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.679
So she said,

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.928
"Why did you ask for $2,000?"

00:08:41.265 --> 00:08:43.633
And he said, "My friend
is going to be evicted

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:45.920
unless I get him $2,000 immediately."

00:08:45.944 --> 00:08:48.994
And she said, "Oh! You don't want
to rob the bank --

00:08:49.018 --> 00:08:50.506
you want to take out a loan."

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.615
(Laughter)

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:53.512
"Why don't you come back to my office,

00:08:53.536 --> 00:08:55.715
and we can have you
fill out the paperwork."

00:08:55.739 --> 00:08:56.778
(Laughter)

00:08:57.214 --> 00:09:01.717
Now, her quick perspective-taking
defused a volatile situation.
