00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.169
whether our little baby boy was getting
enough nutrients from breastfeeding.

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:33.943
And we wanted to call our pediatrician,

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.542
but we also didn't want
to make a bad first impression

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.030
or come across as a crazy,
neurotic parent.

00:00:39.054 --> 00:00:40.701
So we worried.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.107
And we waited.

00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:44.426

she immediately gave him formula
because he was pretty dehydrated.

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:50.746
Our son is fine now,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.726
and our doctor has reassured us
we can always contact her.

00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:55.632
But in that moment,

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.290
I should've spoken up, but I didn't.

00:00:58.943 --> 00:01:02.238
But sometimes we speak up
when we shouldn't,
