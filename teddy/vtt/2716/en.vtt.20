00:09:59.845 --> 00:10:01.183
And it worked brilliantly.

00:10:01.207 --> 00:10:04.741
She got dressed quickly
and without resistance.

00:10:05.498 --> 00:10:07.785
When I've asked the question
around the world

00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:09.860
when people feel comfortable speaking up,

00:10:09.884 --> 00:10:11.220
the number one answer is:

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:15.998
"When I have social support
in my audience; when I have allies."

00:10:16.022 --> 00:10:19.568
So we want to get allies on our side.

00:10:19.957 --> 00:10:21.227
How do we do that?

00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:24.010
Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear.

00:10:24.034 --> 00:10:25.510
When we advocate for others,

00:10:25.534 --> 00:10:29.063
we expand our range in our own eyes
and the eyes of others,

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:31.243
but we also earn strong allies.
