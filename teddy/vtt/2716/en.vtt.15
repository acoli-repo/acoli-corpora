00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:31.177
your finger -- put it up.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.002
And I want you to draw
a capital letter E on your forehead

00:07:36.026 --> 00:07:37.607
as quickly as possible.

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:43.383
OK, it turns out that we can
draw this E in one of two ways,

00:07:43.407 --> 00:07:46.892
and this was originally designed
as a test of perspective-taking.

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:48.837
I'm going to show you two pictures

00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:50.861
of someone with an E on their forehead --

00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:52.743
my former student, Erika Hall.

00:07:53.294 --> 00:07:55.262
And you can see over here,

00:07:55.286 --> 00:07:56.553
that's the correct E.

00:07:56.577 --> 00:08:00.027
I drew the E so it looks like
an E to another person.
