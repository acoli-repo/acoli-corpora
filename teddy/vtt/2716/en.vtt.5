00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:31.187
But sometimes we're too weak.

00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:33.275
That's what happened with my wife and I.

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.515
And this range of acceptable behaviors --

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.634
when we stay within our range,
we're rewarded.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:42.827
When we step outside that range,
we get punished in a variety of ways.

00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:45.990
We get dismissed or demeaned
or even ostracized.

00:02:46.014 --> 00:02:49.273
Or we lose that raise
or that promotion or that deal.

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.693
Now, the first thing we need to know is:

00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:54.205
What is my range?

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:58.689
But the key thing is,
our range isn't fixed;

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:00.681
it's actually pretty dynamic.
