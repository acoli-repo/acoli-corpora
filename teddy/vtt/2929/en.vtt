Whether you like it or not,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.296
radical transparency and algorithmic
decision-making is coming at you fast,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.296
and it's going to change your life.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.136
That's because it's now easy
to take algorithms

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.056
and embed them into computers

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.016
and gather all that data
that you're leaving on yourself

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.416
all over the place,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.136
and know what you're like,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.096
and then direct the computers
to interact with you

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.240
in ways that are better
than most people can.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.776
Well, that might sound scary.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.440
I've been doing this for a long time
and I have found it to be wonderful.
