I realized that we would need
radical truthfulness

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.536
and radical transparency.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.416
What I mean by radical truthfulness
and radical transparency

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.096
is people needed to say
what they really believed

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.120
and to see everything.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.416
And we literally
tape almost all conversations

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.056
and let everybody see everything,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.496
because if we didn't do that,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.600
we couldn't really have
an idea meritocracy.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.456
In order to have an idea meritocracy,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.856
we have let people speak
and say what they want.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.256
Just to give you an example,
