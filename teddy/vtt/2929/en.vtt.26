WEBVTT

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.776
And we do it because it elevates ourselves
above our own opinions

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.696
so that we start to see things
through everybody's eyes,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.640
and we see things collectively.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.696
Collective decision-making is so much
better than individual decision-making

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.920
if it's done well.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.976
It's been the secret sauce
behind our success.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.176
It's why we've made
more money for our clients

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.136
than any other hedge fund in existence

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.880
and made money
23 out of the last 26 years.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.416
So what's the problem
with being radically truthful

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.680
and radically transparent with each other?
