00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.176
to create a pointilist painting
of what people are like

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.440
and how they think.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.880
And it does that guided by algorithms.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.560
Knowing what people are like helps
to match them better with their jobs.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.336
For example,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.096
a creative thinker who is unreliable

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.200
might be matched up with someone
who's reliable but not creative.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.616
Knowing what people are like
also allows us to decide

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.896
what responsibilities to give them

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.400
and to weigh our decisions
based on people's merits.
