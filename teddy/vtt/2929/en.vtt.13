00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.096
I wanted to find the smartest
people who would disagree with me

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.016
to try to understand their perspective

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.640
or to have them
stress test my perspective.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.176
I wanted to make an idea meritocracy.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.416
In other words,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.256
not an autocracy in which
I would lead and others would follow

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.896
and not a democracy in which everybody's
points of view were equally valued,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.016
but I wanted to have an idea meritocracy
in which the best ideas would win out.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.296
And in order to do that,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.896
I realized that we would need
radical truthfulness
