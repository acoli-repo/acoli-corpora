00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.296
And it's great because if I don't let Jim,
and people like Jim,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.896
to express their points of view,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.976
our relationship wouldn't be the same.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.056
And if I didn't make that public
for everybody to see,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.040
we wouldn't have an idea meritocracy.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.040
So for that last 25 years
that's how we've been operating.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.696
We've been operating
with this radical transparency

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.016
and then collecting these principles,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.096
largely from making mistakes,

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.536
and then embedding
those principles into algorithms.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.256
And then those algorithms provide --
