00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.296
And I didn't like following instructions,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.736
I was no good at following instructions.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
But I loved to figure out
how things worked for myself.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.056
When I was 12,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.360
I hated school but I fell in love
with trading the markets.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.576
I caddied at the time,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.176
earned about five dollars a bag.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.400
And I took my caddying money,
and I put it in the stock market.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.616
And that was just because
the stock market was hot at the time.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.096
And the first company I bought

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.720
was a company by the name
of Northeast Airlines.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.096
Northeast Airlines was
the only company I heard of
