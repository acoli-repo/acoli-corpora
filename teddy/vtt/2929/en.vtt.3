Northeast Airlines was
the only company I heard of

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.816
that was selling for less
than five dollars a share.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.816
(Laughter)

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.696
And I figured I could buy more shares,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.816
and if it went up, I'd make more money.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.680
So, it was a dumb strategy, right?

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.816
But I tripled my money,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.960
and I tripled my money
because I got lucky.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.336
The company was about to go bankrupt,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.456
but some other company acquired it,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.936
and I tripled my money.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.160
And I was hooked.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.000
And I thought, "This game is easy."

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.416
With time,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.400
I learned this game is anything but easy.
