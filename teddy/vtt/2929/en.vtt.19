00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.920
a researcher named Jen rated me a three --

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.656
in other words, badly --

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.056
(Laughter)

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.240
for not showing a good balance
of open-mindedness and assertiveness.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.536
As the meeting transpired,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.800
Jen's assessments of people
added up like this.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.096
Others in the room
have different opinions.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.336
That's normal.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.280
Different people are always
going to have different opinions.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.200
And who knows who's right?

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.680
Let's look at just what people thought
about how I was doing.
