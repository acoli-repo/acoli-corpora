00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.612
that would help me in the future.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.696
And because I wrote them down so clearly,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.056
I could then --

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.656
eventually discovered --

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.440
I could then embed them into algorithms.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.856
And those algorithms
would be embedded in computers,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.216
and the computers would
make decisions along with me;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.376
and so in parallel,
we would make these decisions.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.376
And I could see how those decisions
then compared with my own decisions,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.496
and I could see that
those decisions were a lot better.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.256
And that was because the computer
could make decisions much faster,
