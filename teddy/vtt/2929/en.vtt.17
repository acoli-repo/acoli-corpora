00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.256
And then those algorithms provide --

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.296
we're following the algorithms

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.760
in parallel with our thinking.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.456
That has been how we've run
the investment business,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.216
and it's how we also deal
with the people management.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.976
In order to give you a glimmer
into what this looks like,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.336
I'd like to take you into a meeting

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.496
and introduce you to a tool of ours
called the "Dot Collector"

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.800
that helps us do this.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.816
A week after the US election,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.936
our research team held a meeting

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.280
to discuss what a Trump presidency
would mean for the US economy.
