00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.560
and what goes along with that
is making a lot of painful mistakes.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.256
So I made a lot of painful mistakes,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.536
and with time,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.520
my attitude about those mistakes
began to change.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.256
I began to think of them as puzzles.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.216
That if I could solve the puzzles,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.680
they would give me gems.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.816
And the puzzles were:

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.720
What would I do differently in the future
so I wouldn't make that painful mistake?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.856
And the gems were principles

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.016
that I would then write down
so I would remember them

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.612
that would help me in the future.
