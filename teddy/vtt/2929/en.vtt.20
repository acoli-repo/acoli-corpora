00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.680
Let's look at just what people thought
about how I was doing.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.816
Some people thought I did well,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.040
others, poorly.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.416
With each of these views,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.760
we can explore the thinking
behind the numbers.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.680

including their critical thinking,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.200
regardless of their position

and right out of college,

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.080
can tell me, the CEO,
that I'm approaching things terribly.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.256
This tool helps people
both express their opinions
