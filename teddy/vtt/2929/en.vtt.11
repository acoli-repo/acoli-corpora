00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.136
I look at that now, I think,
"What an arrogant jerk!"

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
(Laughter)

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.216
I was so arrogant, and I was so wrong.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.816
I mean, while the debt crisis happened,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.816

went up rather than going down,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.856
and I lost so much money
for myself and for my clients

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.296
that I had to shut down
my operation pretty much,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.200
I had to let almost everybody go.

And these were like extended family,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.016
I was heartbroken.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.856
And I had lost so much money

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.216
that I had to borrow
4,000 dollars from my dad
