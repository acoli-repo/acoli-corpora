00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.080
in examination with what
is going wrong with our economy.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.576
The economy is now flat --

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.736
teetering on the brink of failure.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.256
Martin Zweig: You were recently
quoted in an article.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.616
You said, "I can say this
with absolute certainty

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.256
because I know how markets work."

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.376
Ray Dalio: I can say
with absolute certainty

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.256
that if you look at the liquidity base

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.656
in the corporations
and the world as a whole,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.776
that there's such reduced
level of liquidity

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.016
that you can't return
to an era of stagflation."

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.136
I look at that now, I think,
"What an arrogant jerk!"
