Mexico defaulted on its debt,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.776
and a number of other countries followed.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.200
And we had the greatest debt crisis
since the Great Depression.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.856
And because I had anticipated that,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.216
I was asked to testify to Congress
and appear on "Wall Street Week,"

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.216
which was the show of the time.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.176
Just to give you a flavor of that,
I've got a clip here,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.120
and you'll see me in there.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.176
(Video) Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mitchell,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.576
it's a great pleasure and a great honor
to be able to appear before you

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.080
in examination with what
is going wrong with our economy.
