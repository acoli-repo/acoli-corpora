People say it's emotionally difficult.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.480
Critics say it's a formula
for a brutal work environment.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.256
Neuroscientists tell me it has to do
with how are brains are prewired.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.496
There's a part of our brain
that would like to know our mistakes

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.480
and like to look at our weaknesses
so we could do better.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.560
I'm told that that's
the prefrontal cortex.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.896
And then there's a part of our brain
which views all of this as attacks.
