This tool helps people
both express their opinions

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.376
and then separate themselves
from their opinions

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.440
to see things from a higher level.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.536
When Jen and others shift their attentions
from inputting their own opinions

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.136
to looking down on the whole screen,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.880
their perspective changes.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.816
They see their own opinions
as just one of many

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.376
and naturally start asking themselves,

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.400
"How do I know my opinion is right?"

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.536
That shift in perspective is like going
from seeing in one dimension
