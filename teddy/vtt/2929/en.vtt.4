00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.400
I learned this game is anything but easy.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.016
In order to be an effective investor,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.936
one has to bet against the consensus

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.216
and be right.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.096
And it's not easy to bet
against the consensus and be right.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.456
One has to bet against
the consensus and be right

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.120
because the consensus
is built into the price.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.576
And in order to be an entrepreneur,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.216
a successful entrepreneur,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.720
one has to bet against
the consensus and be right.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.336
I had to be an entrepreneur
and an investor --

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.560
and what goes along with that
is making a lot of painful mistakes.
