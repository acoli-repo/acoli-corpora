00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:08.342
The world is getting closer

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:12.772
to achieving one of the most important 
public health goals of our time:

00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:15.062
eradicating HIV.

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:18.292
And to do this, we wonâ€™t even have 
to cure the disease.

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:21.722
We simply have to stop HIV from 
being transmitted

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.392
until eventually it fizzles out.

00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:27.072
Once, this goal would have 
seemed impossible.

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:29.832
HIV has caused millions of deaths

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:34.182
and is one of the most devastating 
diseases that humanity has ever known.
