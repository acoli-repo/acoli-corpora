Let's start with the backbone
of the problem, literally.

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:34.128
Your spine is a long structure

00:01:34.128 --> 00:01:38.044
made of bones and the cartilage discs
that sit between them.

00:01:38.044 --> 00:01:41.451
Joints, muscles and ligaments
that are attached to the bones

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:43.376
hold it all together.

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:47.651
A common way of sitting is with a
curved back and slumped shoulders,

00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:51.379
a position that puts uneven
pressure on your spine.

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:55.331
Over time, this causes wear and tear
in your spinal discs,

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:57.873
overworks certain ligaments and joints,

00:01:57.873 --> 00:02:00.916
and puts strain on muscles that stretch
