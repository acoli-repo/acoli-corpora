00:00:54.841 --> 00:01:00.205
Inside us are over 360 joints,
and about 700 skeletal muscles

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:03.352
that enable easy, fluid motion.

00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:07.721
The body's unique physical structure
gives us the ability to stand up straight

00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:09.908
against the pull of gravity.

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:14.232
Our blood depends on us moving around
to be able to circulate properly.

00:01:14.232 --> 00:01:16.713
Our nerve cells benefit from movement,

00:01:16.713 --> 00:01:21.440
and our skin is elastic, 
meaning it molds to our motions.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.426
So if every inch of the body
is ready and waiting for you to move,

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:28.798
what happens when you just don't?

00:01:28.798 --> 00:01:32.105
Let's start with the backbone
of the problem, literally.
