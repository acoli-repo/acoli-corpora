00:02:55.421 --> 00:03:00.879
Sitting for long periods also temporarily
deactivates lipoprotein lipase,

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.759
a special enzyme in the walls
of blood capillaries

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.362
that breaks down fats in the blood,

00:03:07.362 --> 00:03:13.016
so when you sit, you're not burning fat
nearly as well as when you move around.

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:16.268
What effect does all of this stasis
have on the brain?

00:03:16.268 --> 00:03:19.512
Most of the time, 
you probably sit down to use your brain,

00:03:19.512 --> 00:03:24.568
but ironically, lengthy periods of sitting
actually run counter to this goal.

00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:26.968
Being stationary reduces blood flow

00:03:26.968 --> 00:03:30.856
and the amount of oxygen entering
your blood stream through your lungs.
