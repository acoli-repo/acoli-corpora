In fact, researchers 
have worked out that, worldwide,

00:04:00.768 --> 00:04:05.773
inactivity causes about 
9% of premature deaths a year.

00:04:05.773 --> 00:04:08.604
That's over 5 million people.

00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:10.704
So what seems like such a harmless habit


00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:14.102
actually has the power 
to change our health.

00:04:14.102 --> 00:04:19.674
But luckily, the solutions to this
mounting threat are simple and intuitive.

00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:21.436
When you have no choice but to sit,

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:25.149
try switching the slouch 
for a straighter spine,

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:27.540
and when you don't have 
to be bound to your seat,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.396
aim to move around much more,
