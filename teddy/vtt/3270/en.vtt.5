00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:31.256
My teachers insisted
that I would go for an eye test.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.339
I resisted it for as many years as I could

00:02:33.363 --> 00:02:35.575
because as the only
brown boy in the school,

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.424
I already felt like
a chocolate chip in rice pudding,

00:02:38.448 --> 00:02:42.423
and the idea of looking more different
was not particularly appealing.

00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:45.110
You see, I'd associated
an eye test with wearing glasses

00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:46.507
and looking different,

00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:48.113
not with seeing differently.

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:50.846
When eventually I was persuaded to go,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.218
the optometrist fitted me
with the trial lenses

00:02:53.242 --> 00:02:55.990
and was shocked
at just how poor my sight was.

00:02:56.014 --> 00:02:58.642
He sent me outside
to report what I could see.

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:03.474
I remember looking up and seeing
trees had leaves on them.
