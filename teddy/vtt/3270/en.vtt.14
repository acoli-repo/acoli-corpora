We agreed on the outcome,
what had to be done.

But critically, they were flexible
and gave us autonomy

00:07:06.956 --> 00:07:09.204
to work out how we got there,

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:13.204
giving us the space to be creative,
ambitious and take risk.

00:07:13.795 --> 00:07:16.159
What if all health care looked like this?

00:07:16.183 --> 00:07:20.279

the social causes we're trying to solve?

By taking a long-term, ambitious view

00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:27.744
and giving people
the autonomy to be creative

00:07:27.768 --> 00:07:29.776
to solve our world's biggest challenges,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.872
we've disrupted entire industries.
