00:01:28.892 --> 00:01:31.258
and with it, her place in her community.

00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:33.838
She had no prospects
for marriage or children

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:35.895
and had been completely ostracized.

00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:39.523
I knew how to treat her condition;
it was pretty straightforward.

00:01:39.547 --> 00:01:42.292
But we had strict instructions
that the funds we had

00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:43.945
were for people with cataracts.

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:46.841
What was I supposed to do?

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:48.239
Ignore her?

00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:52.196
My wife and I managed to raise the funds
to cover her treatment,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.052
but situations like Theresa
were common every day,

00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:57.579
where people had the wrong diseases.

00:01:58.068 --> 00:01:59.663
And by the "wrong diseases,"

00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:03.597
I mean conditions for which
funding hadn't been earmarked.
