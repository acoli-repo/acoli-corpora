00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.965
and created new tools that made it
easier to diagnose them

00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:33.838
and connect them to services.

00:04:33.862 --> 00:04:36.158
Inspired by the challenges
I'd had as a child,

00:04:36.182 --> 00:04:39.074
we equipped teachers,
25 of them, with smartphones

00:04:39.098 --> 00:04:40.965
to screen children in schools.

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:43.387
Our first program resulted
in 21,000 children

00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:45.563
being screened in just nine days.

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:49.569
That same program was replicated
to reach 200,000 children,

00:04:49.593 --> 00:04:51.438
covering the entire district.

00:04:51.462 --> 00:04:54.031
Soon we were able to repeat this
in six new programs

00:04:54.055 --> 00:04:55.405
in different countries.

00:04:56.106 --> 00:05:00.024
But now, I was faced with the very
same problems I had with Theresa
