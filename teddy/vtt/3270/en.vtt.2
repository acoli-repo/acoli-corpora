00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:03.064
Four in every five people
who are blind don't need to be;

00:01:03.088 --> 00:01:06.280
curative or preventive
treatments already exist.

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.561
Fortunately for Mama Jane and her friend,

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:11.412
a donor had provided treatment

00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:13.770
so that we could take them
to the nearest hospital

00:01:13.794 --> 00:01:15.338
three hours away.

00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:17.176
But in that very same clinic,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.875
I met Theresa,

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.986
a shy young woman who couldn't
look me in the eyes,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.891
not because she couldn't see,

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:27.069
but the appearance of the growth
on her eyes called pterygium

00:01:27.093 --> 00:01:28.868
meant she'd lost her confidence,

00:01:28.892 --> 00:01:31.258
and with it, her place in her community.
