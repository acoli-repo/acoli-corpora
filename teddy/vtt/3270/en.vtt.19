the individuals affected

00:09:31.476 --> 00:09:33.723
can receive the care that they deserve.

00:09:34.176 --> 00:09:35.878
And as we've shown,

00:09:35.902 --> 00:09:38.641
it doesn't make just a health
and social difference,

00:09:38.665 --> 00:09:41.046
it creates huge economic benefit.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.935
This benefit in itself
will create sustainability

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:49.103
to perpetuate a virtuous,
catalytic cycle of improvement and change.

00:09:49.749 --> 00:09:51.619
Because when we do this,

00:09:51.643 --> 00:09:54.912
the individual needs of people
like myself can be met.

00:09:55.979 --> 00:10:00.138
And this coalition
has come together this year
