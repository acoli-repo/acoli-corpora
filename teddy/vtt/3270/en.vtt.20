00:09:55.979 --> 00:10:00.138
And this coalition
has come together this year

00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:02.950
to make a commitment
with 53 heads of government,

00:10:02.974 --> 00:10:05.016

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.928
towards achieving access

of glasses to the fund

00:10:13.031 --> 00:10:14.704

00:10:21.551 --> 00:10:24.533
and like Theresa, who just

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:25.884
can be met.

00:10:26.475 --> 00:10:30.477
For Theresa, it meant
her place back in society,
