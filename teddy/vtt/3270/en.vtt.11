00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:31.189
Soon, we were able to align ourselves
with partners who understood,

00:05:31.213 --> 00:05:33.270
because I understand the challenge.

00:05:33.294 --> 00:05:36.569
Ultimately, you need to trust
where your money's going,

00:05:36.593 --> 00:05:39.213
and that trust usually manifests
through the requirement

00:05:39.237 --> 00:05:41.688
to create detailed plans --
lots of paperwork.

00:05:41.712 --> 00:05:44.052
But what happens
if the dynamic needs of people

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:46.118
don't fit with the plan that you created,

00:05:46.142 --> 00:05:49.071
and your funding is dependent
on delivering the plan?

00:05:49.095 --> 00:05:50.547
You end up with a choice:

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:53.563
Do you serve the plan, the funder,

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:54.998
or do you serve the need?

00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:57.909
This is not a choice
we should have to make,

00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:00.994
because ultimately,
we can only serve one master.
