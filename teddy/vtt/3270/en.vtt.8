00:03:56.503 --> 00:04:00.175
This deep sense of injustice
drove me to become a doctor,

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.876
eventually an eye surgeon,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.431
and in 2012, my wife and I
packed our bags and moved to Kenya

00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:08.086
to try and give something back.

00:04:08.797 --> 00:04:11.082
We started by setting up
a hundred eye clinics

00:04:11.106 --> 00:04:12.553
across the Great Rift Valley,

00:04:12.577 --> 00:04:15.083
where we met people
like Mama Jane and Theresa.

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:18.353
We founded a new organization
called Peek Vision,

00:04:18.377 --> 00:04:22.005
a social enterprise where
we built smartphone technology

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.626
that makes it possible
for people in the community

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.377
to find people in their homes,

00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:29.096
the most vulnerable groups
who are being missed,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.965
and created new tools that made it
easier to diagnose them
