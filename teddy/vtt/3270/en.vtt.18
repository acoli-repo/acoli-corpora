00:08:57.669 --> 00:09:00.541
we've come together --
two world-leading banks,

00:09:00.565 --> 00:09:03.932
for-profit and private,
not-for-profit organizations,

00:09:03.956 --> 00:09:05.830
foundations and philanthropists --

00:09:05.854 --> 00:09:08.273
to launch the Vision Catalyst Fund,

00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:11.034
a fund which will have trust
built in by design.

00:09:11.693 --> 00:09:14.240
It will make funding available now

00:09:14.264 --> 00:09:18.127
to the organizations that can serve
the need of the most vulnerable.

00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:22.066
It will ensure that those organizations
can work together in partnership,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.526
rather than competing for limited funds,

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.353
serving the priority needs
of an entire population,

00:09:27.377 --> 00:09:28.909
whatever they are,

00:09:28.933 --> 00:09:31.452
so that ultimately
the individuals affected
