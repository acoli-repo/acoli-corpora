00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.872
we've disrupted entire industries.

00:07:31.896 --> 00:07:34.047
Look at Amazon, Google.

00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:36.202
Surely, we need the same level of ambition

00:07:36.226 --> 00:07:39.193
if we're going to serve the most
vulnerable in our societies.

00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:41.918
As a planet, we've set a target,

00:07:41.942 --> 00:07:44.338
the Sustainable Development Goals,

00:07:44.362 --> 00:07:48.493
yet we're spending less than half
the amount on tackling the global goals

00:07:48.517 --> 00:07:50.452
than we are on conflict resolution,

00:07:50.476 --> 00:07:54.172
which mostly arises from
the very inequalities we're not serving.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.569
It's time for change.

00:07:57.015 --> 00:08:00.747
It's not just common sense as well --
it makes business sense.
