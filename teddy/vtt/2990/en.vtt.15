00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.536
who had what I thought
was a mental health issue,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.016
I went for my script
and I started to ask questions.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.136
"Um, sir, do you take psycho --
um, psychotrop --

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.800
psychotropic medication?"

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.680
"Nope."

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.680
"Uh, sir, have you treated
with a psychiatrist before?"

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.776
"Nope."

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.816
But it was obvious that the person
was suffering from mental illness.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.576
One day, in my frustration, I decided
to scrap the script and ask one question.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.016
"Ma'am, do you take medication
to clear your mind?"

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.656
"Yeah, judge, I take Haldol
for my schizophrenia,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.640
Xanax for my anxiety."
