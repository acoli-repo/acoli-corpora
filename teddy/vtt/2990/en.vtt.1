00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.056
after I said her male name low enough

be picked up by the record,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.096

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.760

towards counselor's table with dignity.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.576
who was born in Harlem

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.616
and spent his summers
in the segregated South.
