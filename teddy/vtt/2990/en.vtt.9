The good news is is that the principles
of procedural justice are easy

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.176
and can be implemented
as quickly as tomorrow.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.616
The even better news,
that it can be done for free.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.656
(Laughter)

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.656
The first principle is voice.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.856
Give people an opportunity to speak,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.016
even when you're
not going to let them speak.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.296
Explain it.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.896
"Sir, I'm not letting you speak right now.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.256
You don't have an attorney.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.336
I don't want you to say anything
that's going to hurt your case."

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.216
For me, assigning essays to defendants

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.120
has been a tremendous way
of giving them voice.
