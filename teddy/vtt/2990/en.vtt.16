Xanax for my anxiety."

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.896
The question works even when it doesn't.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.656
"Mr. L, do you take medication
to clear your mind?"

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.336
"No, judge, I don't take
no medication to clear my mind.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.776
I take medication
to stop the voices in my head,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.056
but my mind is fine."

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.656
(Laughter)

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.736

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.616

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.016
that allows the court
to make meaningful decisions

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.000
about the cases that are before them.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.536
The last principle is respect,

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.416
that without it none
of the other principles can work.
