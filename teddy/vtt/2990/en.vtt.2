00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.416
Soy la hija de una peluquera dominicana.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.936
I do that to make sure
you're still paying attention.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.296
(Laughter)

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.576
I'm the daughter of a Dominican beautician

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.416
who came to this country
for a better life for her unborn children.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.456
My parents taught me, you treat everyone
you meet with dignity and respect,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.896
no matter how they look,
no matter how they dress,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.176
no matter how they spoke.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.816
You see, the principles of fairness

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.576
were taught to me at an early age,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.536
and unbeknownst to me,
it would be the most important lesson

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.376
that I carried with me
to the Newark Municipal Court bench.
