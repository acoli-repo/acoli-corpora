00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.416
like the 60-something-year-old
schizophrenic homeless woman

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.856
who was in distress

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.856
and fighting with the voices in her head,

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.256
and barges into court,
and screams, "Judge!

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.256
I just came by to see how you were doing."

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.976
I had been monitoring her case
for a couple of months,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.016
her compliance with her medication,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.016
and had just closed out her case
a couple of weeks ago.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.656
On this day she needed help,

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.936
and she came to court.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.376
And after four hours
of coaxing by the judge,

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.696
the police officers and the staff,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.536
she is convinced to get into the ambulance
