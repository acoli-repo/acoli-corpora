00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.416
that without it none
of the other principles can work.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.176
Now, respect can be as simple as,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.480
"Good afternoon, sir."
"Good morning, ma'am."

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.376
It's looking the person in the eye
who is standing before you,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.280
especially when you're sentencing them.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.336
It's when I say,
"Um, how are you doing today?

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.816
And what's going on with you?"

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.096
And not as a greeting,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.840
but as someone who is
actually interested in the response.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.736
Respect is the difference between saying,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.376
"Ma'am, are you having difficulty

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.776
understanding the information
in the paperwork?"

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.256
versus, "You can
read and write, can't you?"
