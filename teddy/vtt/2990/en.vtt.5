00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.776
They finally get through court security,
they walk around the building,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.816
they ask different people
the same question

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.320
and get different answers.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.776
When they finally get
to where they're supposed to be,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.400
it gets really bad
when they encounter the courts.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.936
What would you think if I told you

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.096

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.976

the public's trust

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.256
in the justice system

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.840
with a simple idea?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.640
Well, that simple idea
is procedural justice
