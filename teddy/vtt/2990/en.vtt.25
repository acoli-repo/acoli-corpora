00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.976
and you'll come back in two weeks,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.536
and when you come back, we'll give you
some assistance for your addiction."

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.800
Surprisingly, two weeks passed
and he was sitting the courtroom.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.056
When he came up, he said,
"Judge, I came back to court

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.536
because you showed me more love
than I had for myself."

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.216
And I thought, my God,
he heard love from the bench?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.656
I could do this all day.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.696
(Laughter)

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.856
Because the reality is that
when the court behaves differently,

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.576
then naturally people respond differently.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.656
The court becomes a place
you can go to for assistance,

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.416
like the 60-something-year-old
schizophrenic homeless woman
