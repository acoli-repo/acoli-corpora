00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.496
I like to say that legalese
is the language we use to confuse.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.576
(Laughter)

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.336
I am keenly aware that the people
who appear before me,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.936
many of them have very little education

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.496
and English is often
their second language.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.976
So I speak plain English in court.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.616
A great example of this
was when I was a young judge --

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.536
oh no, I mean younger judge.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.576
(Laughter)

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.216
When I was a younger judge,
a senior judge comes to me,

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.576
gives me a script and says,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.856
"If you think somebody
has mental health issues,

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.616
ask them these questions
and you can get your evaluation."

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.176
So the first time I saw someone

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.536
who had what I thought
was a mental health issue,
