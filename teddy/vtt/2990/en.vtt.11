00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.296
"If I believed one
positive thing about myself,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.136
how would my life be different?"

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.856
gives the person an opportunity
to be introspective,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.176
go on the inside,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.576
which is where all the answers are anyway.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.416
But it also gives them an opportunity

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.416
to share something with the court
that goes beyond their criminal record

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.680
and their charges.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.776
The next principle is neutrality.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.096
When increasing public trust
in the justice system,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.896
neutrality is paramount.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.816
The judge cannot be perceived
to be favoring one side over the other.
