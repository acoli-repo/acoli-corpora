00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.256
versus, "You can
read and write, can't you?"

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.496
when you've realized
there's a literacy issue.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.216
And the good thing about respect
is that it's contagious.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.536
People see you being
respectful to other folks

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.936
and they impute
that respect to themselves.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.656
You see, that's what
the transgender prostitute was telling me.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.840

as you think you may be judging me.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.896
Now, I am not telling you what I think,

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.976
I am telling you what I have lived,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.536
using procedural justice
to change the culture at my courthouse

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.080
and in the courtroom.
