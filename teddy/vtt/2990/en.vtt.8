00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.336
is sometimes like having
a reserve seat to a tragic reality show

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.496
that has no commercial interruptions

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.080
and no season finale.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.896
It's true.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.576
People come before me handcuffed,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.616
drug-sick, depressed, hungry

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.680
and mentally ill.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.216
When I saw that their need for help

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.976
was greater than my fear
of appearing vulnerable on the bench,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.056
I realized that not only
did I need to do something,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.280
but that in fact I could do something.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.096
The good news is is that the principles
of procedural justice are easy
