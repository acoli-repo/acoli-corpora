that aliens are not only out there, we're looking for them

out there, but they're here, right?

abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of.

00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:12.685
Well, that would be interesting if it was true,

00:12:23.466 --> 00:12:27.017
or that evolution is just, you know, sort of a crazy idea

00:12:27.017 --> 00:12:30.048
by scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution,
