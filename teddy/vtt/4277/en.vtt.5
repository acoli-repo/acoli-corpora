00:02:26.615 --> 00:02:30.004
in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T.

00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:31.600
Now, Frank didn't hear anything.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.009
Actually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force,

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.974
which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:02:36.974 --> 00:02:39.740
But Drake's idea here became very popular

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.197
because it was very appealing — and I'll get back to that —

00:02:42.197 --> 00:02:45.613
and on the basis of this experiment, which didn't succeed,

00:02:45.613 --> 00:02:47.468
we have been doing SETI ever since,

00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:49.502
not continuously, but ever since.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.388
We still haven't heard anything.

00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:53.066
We still haven't heard anything.

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:54.859
In fact, we don't know about any life beyond Earth,

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.659
but I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.028
rather soon, and part of the reason, in fact,
