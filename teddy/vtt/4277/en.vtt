00:00:00.044 --> 00:00:01.037
Is E.T. out there?

00:00:01.037 --> 00:00:04.016
Well, I work at the SETI Institute.

00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:05.251
That's almost my name. SETI:

00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:07.658
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

00:00:07.658 --> 00:00:09.277
In other words, I look for aliens,

00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:12.945
and when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.706
look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face.

00:00:15.706 --> 00:00:18.039
I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.799
Now, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic,

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:23.049
ridiculous, maybe even hopeless,

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:26.754
but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:30.568
that the job I have is actually a privilege, okay,
