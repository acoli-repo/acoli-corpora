00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:01.584
wondered whether there was any truth in this story,

00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:03.088
or I was just, you know, misremembering something,

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:05.836
but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine,

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:07.435
and sure enough, there you can see

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:09.546
the Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.023
analog calculating device.

00:02:12.023 --> 00:02:12.926
So it was true.

00:02:12.926 --> 00:02:15.367
All right. Now, the idea for doing this, it wasn't very old

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:17.031
at the time that I made that photo.

00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:20.509
The idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.005
by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna

00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.615
in West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars

00:02:26.615 --> 00:02:30.004
in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T.
