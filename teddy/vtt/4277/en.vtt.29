or if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates. Okay?

00:14:33.015 --> 00:14:35.026
I mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that

00:14:35.026 --> 00:14:37.047
have big teeth. Right?

00:14:37.047 --> 00:14:38.521
We're interested in things that have big teeth, and you

00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:41.066
can see the evolutionary value of that, and you can also see

00:14:41.066 --> 00:14:44.754
the practical consequences by watching Animal Planet.

00:14:44.754 --> 00:14:47.088
You notice they make very few programs about gerbils.

00:14:47.088 --> 00:14:49.144
It's mostly about things that have big teeth.

00:14:49.144 --> 00:14:52.091
Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:56.026
And not just us. It's also kids.

00:14:56.026 --> 00:14:59.453
This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a

00:14:59.453 --> 00:15:02.685
hook to science, because SETI involves all kinds of science,
