asking Chris Columbus in 1491, "Hey Chris,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.014
you know, what happens if it turns out that there's a

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:38.550
continent between here and Japan, where you're sailing to,

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.325
what will be the consequences for humanity

00:08:41.325 --> 00:08:43.071
if that turns out to be the case?"

00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:45.301
And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer

00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:48.012
that you might not have understood, but it probably

00:08:48.012 --> 00:08:50.846
wouldn't have been right, and I think that to predict

00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:52.605
what finding E.T.'s going to mean,

00:08:52.605 --> 00:08:53.685
we can't predict that either.

00:08:53.685 --> 00:08:55.307
But here are a couple things I can say.

00:08:55.307 --> 00:08:59.464
To begin with, it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own.

00:08:59.464 --> 00:09:01.088
You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals.
