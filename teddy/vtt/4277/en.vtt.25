00:12:27.017 --> 00:12:30.048
by scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution,

00:12:30.048 --> 00:12:32.604
all that sort of thing, or global warming.

00:12:32.604 --> 00:12:36.005
These sorts of ideas don't really have any validity,

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:38.080
that you can't trust the scientists.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.323
Now, we've got to solve that problem, because that's

00:12:40.323 --> 00:12:44.401
a critically important problem, and you might say,

00:12:44.401 --> 00:12:47.030
"Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?"

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.429
Well, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't

00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:51.092
solve the problem, but it can address the problem.

00:12:51.092 --> 00:12:54.035
It can address the problem by getting young people

00:12:54.035 --> 00:12:57.033
interested in science. Look, science is hard, it

00:12:57.033 --> 00:13:00.086
has a reputation of being hard, and the facts are, it is hard,
