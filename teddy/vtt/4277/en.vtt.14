00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:00.320
or you get a cup of coffee.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.293
Now, let me tell you about some aspect of this that

00:07:04.293 --> 00:07:06.331
people don't think about, and that is,

00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:10.039
what happens? Suppose that what I say is true.

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:12.404
I mean, who knows, but suppose it happens.

00:07:12.404 --> 00:07:13.891
Suppose some time in the next two dozen years

00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:16.068
we pick up a faint line that tells us

What is the effect? What's the consequence?

00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:22.015
Now, I might be at ground zero for this.

00:07:22.015 --> 00:07:23.836
I happen to know what the consequence for me would be,

00:07:23.836 --> 00:07:26.745
because we've had false alarms. This is 1997,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.044
and this is a photo I made at about 3 o'clock in the morning

00:07:29.044 --> 00:07:31.053
in Mountain View here, when we were watching
