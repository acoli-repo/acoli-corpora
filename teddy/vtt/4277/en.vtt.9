00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:30.001
In fact, it's doubling every 18 months, and, of course,

00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:32.005
every card-carrying member of the digerati knows

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:33.497
that that's Moore's Law.

00:04:33.497 --> 00:04:36.098
So this means that over the course of the next

00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:40.010
two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems,

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.038
a million star systems, looking for signals

00:04:42.038 --> 00:04:43.547
that would prove somebody's out there.

00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:46.045
Well, a million star systems, is that interesting?

00:04:46.045 --> 00:04:49.059
I mean, how many of those star systems have planets?

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:51.204
And the facts are, we didn't know the answer to that

00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:53.978
even as recently as 15 years ago, and in fact, we really

00:04:53.978 --> 00:04:56.501
didn't know it even as recently as six months ago.

00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:59.379
But now we do. Recent results suggest

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.018
that virtually every star has planets, and more than one.
