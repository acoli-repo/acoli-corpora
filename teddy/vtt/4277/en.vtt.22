00:10:59.584 --> 00:11:01.700
and you might say, "Oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity,"

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.028
but that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity,

00:11:05.028 --> 00:11:07.059
because, I mean, think of ants.

00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:09.056
You know, most ants are programmed to follow one another

00:11:09.056 --> 00:11:11.304
along in a long line, but there are a couple of ants,

00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:14.000
maybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.175
pioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off.

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:18.076
They're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop.

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:20.074
You gotta get them with your thumb before they

00:11:20.074 --> 00:11:21.658
find the sugar or something.

00:11:21.658 --> 00:11:24.063
But those ants, even though most of them get wiped out,

00:11:24.063 --> 00:11:27.355
those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival

00:11:27.355 --> 00:11:30.929
of the hive. So exploration is important.
