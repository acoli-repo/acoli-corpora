00:07:29.044 --> 00:07:31.053
in Mountain View here, when we were watching

00:07:31.053 --> 00:07:33.368
the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal

00:07:33.368 --> 00:07:36.446
that we thought, "This is the real deal." All right?

00:07:36.446 --> 00:07:39.814
And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right?

00:07:39.814 --> 00:07:44.017
I kept waiting for -- I kept waiting for my mom to call,

00:07:44.017 --> 00:07:47.021
somebody to call, the government to call. Nobody called.

00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:50.191
Nobody called. I was so nervous

00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:52.015
that I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around

00:07:52.015 --> 00:07:55.005
taking photos like this one, just for something to do.

00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:57.039
Well, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.069
on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night,

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:01.406
the phone rings and it's The New York Times.
