00:03:25.543 --> 00:03:30.038
100 trillion times better than they were in 1960,

00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:31.534
100 trillion times better.

00:03:31.534 --> 00:03:33.623
That's a degree of an improvement that would look good

00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:36.030
on your report card, okay?

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.664
But something that's not appreciated by the public is,

00:03:38.664 --> 00:03:41.389
in fact, that the experiment continues to get better,

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.037
and, consequently, tends to get faster.

00:03:44.037 --> 00:03:45.726
This is a little plot, and every time you show a plot,

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:47.364
you lose 10 percent of the audience.

00:03:47.364 --> 00:03:49.673
I have 12 of these. (Laughter)

00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:54.093
But what I plotted here is just some metric

00:03:54.093 --> 00:03:56.647
that shows how fast we're searching.

00:03:56.647 --> 00:03:58.755
In other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.

00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:01.042
We know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy.
