00:15:58.054 --> 00:16:01.030
it was actually my junior high school. I was in sixth grade.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.510
And he gave some talk. All I remember from it

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.085
was one word: electronics.

00:16:05.085 --> 00:16:07.646
It was like Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate," right,

00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:10.044
when he said "plastics," whatever that means, plastics.

00:16:10.044 --> 00:16:12.039
All right, so the guy said electronics. I don't remember

00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:14.043
anything else. In fact, I don't remember anything

00:16:14.043 --> 00:16:16.053
that my sixth grade teacher said all year,

00:16:16.053 --> 00:16:18.067
but I remember electronics.

00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:20.719
And so I got interested in electronics, and you know,

00:16:20.719 --> 00:16:23.044
I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff.

00:16:23.044 --> 00:16:26.022
Here I am at about 15 or something, doing that sort of stuff.

00:16:26.022 --> 00:16:27.605
Okay? That had a big effect on me.

00:16:27.605 --> 00:16:29.317
So that's my point, that you can have a big effect

00:16:29.317 --> 00:16:32.033
on these kids.
