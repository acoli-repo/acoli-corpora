00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.028
rather soon, and part of the reason, in fact,

00:03:00.028 --> 00:03:02.803
the majority of the reason why I think that's going to change

00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:04.068
is that the equipment's getting better.

00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:07.005
This is the Allen Telescope Array, about 350 miles

00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:09.021
from whatever seat you're in right now.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:11.026
This is something that we're using today

00:03:11.026 --> 00:03:13.030
to search for E.T., and the electronics have gotten

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.500
very much better too.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.026
This is Frank Drake's electronics in 1960.

00:03:17.026 --> 00:03:19.047
This is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today.

00:03:19.047 --> 00:03:22.536
Some pundit with too much time on his hands

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:25.543
has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately

00:03:25.543 --> 00:03:30.038
100 trillion times better than they were in 1960,
