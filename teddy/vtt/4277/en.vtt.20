advanced society, because they will be,

00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:03.513
that will tell you something about our own possibilities,

00:10:03.513 --> 00:10:08.295
that we're not inevitably doomed to self-destruction.

00:10:08.295 --> 00:10:10.091
Because they survived their technology,

00:10:10.091 --> 00:10:11.203
we could do it too.

00:10:11.203 --> 00:10:13.094
Normally when you look out into the universe,

00:10:13.094 --> 00:10:15.555
you're looking back in time. All right?

00:10:15.555 --> 00:10:17.594
That's interesting to cosmologists.

00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:21.038
But in this sense, you actually can look into the future,

00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:23.053
hazily, but you can look into the future.

00:10:23.053 --> 00:10:28.590
So those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.022
Now, let me talk a little bit about something that happens
