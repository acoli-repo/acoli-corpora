00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:01.042
We know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy.

00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:03.753
But we're going through the haystack no longer

00:04:03.753 --> 00:04:06.045
with a teaspoon but with a skip loader,

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:08.016
because of this increase in speed.

00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:09.451
In fact, those of you who are still conscious

00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:12.011
and mathematically competent,

00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:14.089
will note that this is a semi-log plot.

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:18.481
In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.

00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:21.214
It's exponentially improving. Now, exponential is an

00:04:21.214 --> 00:04:23.533
overworked word. You hear it on the media all the time.

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:25.070
They don't really know what exponential means,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.081
but this is exponential.

00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:30.001
In fact, it's doubling every 18 months, and, of course,
