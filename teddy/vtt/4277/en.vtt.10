00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.018
that virtually every star has planets, and more than one.

00:05:03.018 --> 00:05:06.344
They're like, you know, kittens. You get a litter.

00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:08.084
You don't get one kitten. You get a bunch.

00:05:08.084 --> 00:05:11.018
So in fact, this is a pretty accurate estimate

00:05:11.018 --> 00:05:15.014
of the number of planets in our galaxy,

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:17.041
just in our galaxy, by the way,

00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:19.811
and I remind the non-astronomy majors among you

00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:22.056
that our galaxy is only one of 100 billion

00:05:22.056 --> 00:05:24.040
that we can see with our telescopes.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.563
That's a lot of real estate, but of course,

00:05:25.563 --> 00:05:27.472
most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless,

00:05:27.472 --> 00:05:29.564
like, you know, Mercury, or Neptune.

00:05:29.564 --> 00:05:31.654
Neptune's probably not very big in your life.
