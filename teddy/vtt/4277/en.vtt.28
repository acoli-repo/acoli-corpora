00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:01.041
And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:03.194
Okay? So that doesn't get people interested in science

00:14:03.194 --> 00:14:05.070
because they can't comprehend what it's about.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.687
SETI, on the other hand, is really simple.

00:14:06.687 --> 00:14:08.303
We're going to use these big antennas and we're going to

00:14:08.303 --> 00:14:11.055
try to eavesdrop on signals. Everybody can understand that.

00:14:11.055 --> 00:14:13.064
Yes, technologically, it's very sophisticated,

00:14:13.064 --> 00:14:15.070
but everybody gets the idea.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:19.008
So that's one thing. The other thing is, it's exciting science.

00:14:19.008 --> 00:14:21.422
It's exciting because we're naturally interested

00:14:21.422 --> 00:14:23.647
in other intelligent beings, and I think that's

00:14:23.647 --> 00:14:25.071
part of our hardwiring.

00:14:25.071 --> 00:14:26.631
I mean, we're hardwired to be interested

00:14:26.631 --> 00:14:29.432
in beings that might be, if you will, competitors,

00:14:29.432 --> 00:14:33.015
or if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates. Okay?
