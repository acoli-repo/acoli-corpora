Neptune's probably not very big in your life.

00:05:31.654 --> 00:05:36.001
So the question is, what fraction of these planets

00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:37.683
are actually suitable for life?

00:05:37.683 --> 00:05:39.088
We don't know the answer to that either,

00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:41.326
but we will learn that answer this year, thanks to

00:05:41.326 --> 00:05:43.082
NASA's Kepler Space Telescope,

00:05:43.082 --> 00:05:47.104
and in fact, the smart money, which is to say the people who work on this project,

00:05:47.104 --> 00:05:50.533
the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets

00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:54.569
that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand,

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.876
one in a hundred, something like that.

00:05:57.876 --> 00:06:00.016
Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's
