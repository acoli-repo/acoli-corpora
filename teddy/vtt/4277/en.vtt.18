You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals.

00:09:01.088 --> 00:09:02.378
They're not building transmitters.

00:09:02.378 --> 00:09:04.304
They're going to be ahead of us, maybe by a few thousand

00:09:04.304 --> 00:09:07.371
years, maybe by a few millions years, but substantially

00:09:07.371 --> 00:09:09.600
ahead of us, and that means, if you can understand

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.386
anything that they're going to say, then you might be able

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:16.476
to short-circuit history by getting information from a society

00:09:16.476 --> 00:09:18.050
that's way beyond our own.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.001
Now, you might find that a bit hyperbolic, and maybe it is,

00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:23.654
but nonetheless, it's conceivable that this will happen,

00:09:23.654 --> 00:09:26.027
and, you know, you could consider this like, I don't know,

00:09:26.027 --> 00:09:28.496
giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key

00:09:28.496 --> 00:09:29.603
to the library of Congress.

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:32.058
It would change his day, all right?
