00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:04.286
because, you know, at night, I would be the only hominid

00:01:04.286 --> 00:01:06.034
within about 30 miles.

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:08.043
So here are pictures of myself.

00:01:08.043 --> 00:01:11.631
The observatory had just acquired a new book,

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:13.381
written by a Russian cosmologist

00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:16.999
by the name of Joseph Shklovsky, and then expanded

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:19.452
and translated and edited by a little-known

00:01:19.452 --> 00:01:22.061
Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan.

00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:24.058
And I remember reading that book,

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:26.066
and at 3 in the morning I was reading this book

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.759
and it was explaining how the antennas I was using

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.706
to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used
