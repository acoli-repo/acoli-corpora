00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.706
to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used

00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:36.018
to communicate, to send bits of information

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:38.610
from one star system to another.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.078
Now, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone,

00:01:40.078 --> 00:01:43.009
haven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea,

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.898
but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.382

that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job

00:01:53.328 --> 00:01:55.301
at the SETI Institute. Now, I have to say

00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:59.751
that my memory is notoriously porous, and I've often

00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:01.584
wondered whether there was any truth in this story,
