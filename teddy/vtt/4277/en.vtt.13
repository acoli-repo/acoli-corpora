every time you think you're a miracle, you're wrong,

00:06:30.512 --> 00:06:33.040
so probably not the case.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.091
All right, so the bottom line is this:

00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:38.054
Because of the increase in speed, and because of the

00:06:38.054 --> 00:06:43.005
vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos, I figure

00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:45.050
we're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.021
And I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you:

00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:50.458
Either we're going to find E.T. in the next two dozen years,

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:54.076
or I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

00:06:54.076 --> 00:06:56.710
So that's not so bad. I mean, even with two dozen years,

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.569
you open up your browser and there's news of a signal,

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:00.320
or you get a cup of coffee.
