00:05:57.876 --> 00:06:00.016
Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's

00:06:00.016 --> 00:06:03.127
one in a thousand, that means that there are

00:06:03.127 --> 00:06:05.656
at least a billion cousins of the Earth

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:07.383
just in our own galaxy.

00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:09.636
Okay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here,

00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:13.562
but they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know,

00:06:13.562 --> 00:06:16.041
keep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate,

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.054
plenty of real estate in the universe,

00:06:18.054 --> 00:06:21.003
and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's

00:06:21.003 --> 00:06:24.038
some interesting occupants, that makes you a miracle,

00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:26.719
and I know you like to think you're a miracle,

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.629
but if you do science, you learn rather quickly that

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:30.512
every time you think you're a miracle, you're wrong,
