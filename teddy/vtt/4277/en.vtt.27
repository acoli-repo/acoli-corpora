00:13:28.081 --> 00:13:30.509
Today, you've got to spend years in grad school

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:34.007
and post-doc positions just to figure out what

00:13:34.007 --> 00:13:36.063
the important questions are.

00:13:36.063 --> 00:13:38.058
It's hard. There's no doubt about it.

00:13:38.058 --> 00:13:40.367
And in fact, here's an example: the Higgs boson,

00:13:40.367 --> 00:13:42.276
finding the Higgs boson.

00:13:42.276 --> 00:13:44.076
Ask the next 10 people you see on the streets,

00:13:44.076 --> 00:13:46.414
"Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions

00:13:46.414 --> 00:13:49.055
of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"

00:13:49.055 --> 00:13:51.376
And I bet the answer you're going to get, is,

00:13:51.376 --> 00:13:53.033
"Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is,

00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:54.265
and I don't know if it's important."

00:13:54.265 --> 00:13:56.064
And probably most of the people wouldn't even know

00:13:56.064 --> 00:13:58.511
the value of a Swiss franc, okay?

00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:01.041
And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.
