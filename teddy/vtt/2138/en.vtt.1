00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Yeah. And as I drive through a neighborhood,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
say, where people got-a-lotta, I'll take a mockingbird I caught

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go, you know.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Up goes the bird, out come the words, "Juanito, Juanito,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
vente a comer mi hijo!"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Oh, I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
(Laughter)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Cruising random city streets, rocking a drop-top Cadillac

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
with a big backseat, packing like 13 brown paper Walmart bags

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
full of loaded mockingbirds, and I'll get everybody.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
(Laughter)

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
"We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis."
