00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
"We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis."

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'll get your postman making dinner plans.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'll get the last time you lied.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'll get, "Baby, just give me the frickin' TV guide."

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'll get a lonely, little sentence with real error in it,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"Yeah, I guess I could come inside, but only for a minute."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
(Laughter)

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning "It's Raining, It's Pouring."

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'll get your ex-lover telling someone else, "Good morning."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'll get everyone's good mornings.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I don't care how you make 'em.
