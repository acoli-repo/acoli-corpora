00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Everybody gets this one, honest mockingbird as a witness.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And I'm on this.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
singing, "Hush, little baby, don't say a word.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Wait for the man with the mockingbird."

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
(Laughter)

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Yeah. And then come the news crews, and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
the man-in-the-street interviews, and the letters to the editor.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Everybody asking, just who is responsible for this citywide,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
nationwide mockingbird cacophony, and somebody finally is going to tip

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the City Council of Monterey, California off to me,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and they'll offer me a key to the city.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
A gold-plated, oversized key to the city
