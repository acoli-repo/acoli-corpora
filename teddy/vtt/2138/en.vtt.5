00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and here we are, right in the middle.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
(Laughter)

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
When all the little mockingbirds fly away,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
they're going to sound like the last four days.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I will get uptown gurus, downtown teachers,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
broke-ass artists and dealers, and Filipino preachers, leaf blowers,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
bartenders, boob-job doctors, hooligans, garbage men,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
your local Congressmen in the spotlight, guys in the overhead helicopters.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Everybody gets heard.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Everybody gets this one, honest mockingbird as a witness.
