00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We are 12 billion light years from the edge.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That's a guess.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in America

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
because countries are beginning to eat like us, live like us and die like us.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You might wanna avert your gaze, because that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000

and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
There's about 10 million phage per job.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It's a very strange world inside a nanotube.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Women can talk; black men ski; white men build strong buildings;

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
we build strong suns.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes,
