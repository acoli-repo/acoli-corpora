00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'll get everyone's good mornings.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I don't care how you make 'em.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah-Salam Alaikum.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Everybody means everybody, means everybody here.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Inside it, I will place a mockingbird for --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
short explanation, hippie parents.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What does a violin have to do with technology?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Where in the world is this world heading?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
On one end, gold bars --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
on the other, an entire planet.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We are 12 billion light years from the edge.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That's a guess.
