00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:12.955
In the savannahs of Kenya, two female 
northern white rhinos, Nájin and Fatu,

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:15.565
munch contentedly on the grass.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:18.040
At the time of this video’s publication,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.390
these are the last two known 
northern white rhinos left on Earth.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.030
Their species is functionally extinct—

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.990
without a male, 
Nájin and Fatu can’t reproduce.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.410
And yet, there’s still hope to revive 
the northern white rhino.
