00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in these 170 countries.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
This is the result of computational geometry,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
gesture recognition, and machine learning.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
This is a victory of thousands of users,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
in hundreds of cities,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
one user, one edit at a time.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
This is an invitation to the 70 percent

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
of our unmapped planet.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Welcome to the new world.
