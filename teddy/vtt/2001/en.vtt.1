00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that the majority of the world's populous faces:

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
not having detailed maps.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But help was coming.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
At Google, 40 volunteers

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
used a new software

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to map 120,000 kilometers of roads,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And it took them four days.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us
