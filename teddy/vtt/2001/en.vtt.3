In the last year alone,

thousands of users in 170 countries

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
have mapped millions of pieces of information,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And this was made possible by

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the power of passionate users everywhere.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
being created by users right now.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in these 170 countries.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
