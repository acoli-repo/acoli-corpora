Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to map what we know locally.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
People have used this software

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to map everything from roads to rivers,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
from schools to local businesses,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and video stores to the corner store.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Maps matter.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
recognized that the key to economic liftoff

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
for most developing countries

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
For example, a trillion dollars

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.
