00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:31.417
isn't it interesting that we're never
explicitly taught how to love?

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:34.143
We build friendships,

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.643
navigate early romantic relationships,

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:39.101
get married and bring babies
home from the hospital

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:41.292
with the expectation
that we'll figure it out.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:46.476
But the truth is, we often
harm and disrespect the ones we love.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.809
It can be subtle things

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:50.684
like guilting a friend
into spending time with you

00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:53.976
or sneaking a peak at your partner's texts

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.583
or shaming a child
for their lack of effort at school.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.184
100 percent of us
will be on the receiving end
