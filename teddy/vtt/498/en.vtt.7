00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.184
Abusive relationships
don't start out abusive.

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:34.184
They start out exciting and exhilarating.

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:37.518
There's an intensity
of affection and emotion, a rush.

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:39.226
It feels really good.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.667
You feel so lucky,
like you've hit the jackpot.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.934
But in unhealthy love,
these feelings shift over time

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:50.250
from exciting to overwhelming
and maybe a little bit suffocating.

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:52.601
You feel it in your gut.

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:54.893
Maybe it's when your
new boyfriend or girlfriend

00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:57.184
says "I love you"
faster than you were ready for

00:03:57.208 --> 00:04:00.750
or starts showing up everywhere,
texting and calling a lot.
