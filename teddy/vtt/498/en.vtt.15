"Why are you so sensitive?
What's your problem. Give me a break."

00:07:34.417 --> 00:07:36.375
You are silenced by these words.

00:07:37.417 --> 00:07:40.809
It seems pretty obvious,
but your partner should have your back.

00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:43.476
Their words should build you up,
not break you down.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.893
They should keep
your secrets and be loyal.

00:07:45.917 --> 00:07:47.893
They should make you feel more confident,

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:49.208
not less.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.208
Finally, a fifth marker: volatility.

00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:56.143
(Video) Orange 1:
I'd be sad if we broke up.

00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:58.000
Orange 2: I'd be sad too. (#thatslove)

00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:01.268
Orange 1: I'd so depressed
if we ever broke up.
