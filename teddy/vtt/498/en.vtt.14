00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.417
Blue: You'll get an A anyway,
A for amazing. (#thatslove)

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.309
Blue: Wanna hang out?
Orange: I gotta study.

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:04.768
Blue: You'll get an F anyway,

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:07.958
F for, F for... stupid. (#thatsnotlove)

00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:10.434
KH: Yeah, hmm.

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:13.018
In unhealthy love,
words are used as weapons.

00:07:13.042 --> 00:07:15.393
Conversations that used to be
fun and lighthearted

00:07:15.417 --> 00:07:17.226
turn mean and embarrassing.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.268
Maybe your partner makes fun of you
in a way that hurts,

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:23.768
or maybe they tell stories and jokes
for laughs at your expense.

00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:26.518
When you try to explain
that your feelings have been hurt,

00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:29.934
they shut you down
and accuse you of overreacting.

00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.750
"Why are you so sensitive?
What's your problem. Give me a break."
