00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:33.018
By this point, you've been so conditioned
to this relationship roller coaster

00:08:33.042 --> 00:08:36.058
that you may not realize how unhealthy
and maybe even dangerous

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:37.667
your relationship has become.

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:41.018
It can be really hard to see

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:43.976
when unhealthy love turns towards abuse,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.434
but it's fair to say
that the more of these markers

00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:47.893
your relationship might have,

00:08:47.917 --> 00:08:51.393
the more unhealthy and maybe dangerous
your relationship could be.

00:08:51.417 --> 00:08:53.601
And if your instinct is
to break up and leave,

00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:55.809
which is advice
so many of us give our friends

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:57.768
when they're in unhealthy relationships,

00:08:57.792 --> 00:08:59.726
that's not always the best advice.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.351
Time of breakup can be
a real trigger for violence.
