00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.268
I screamed,

00:10:30.292 --> 00:10:32.559
"Everybody just shut up and do what I say!

00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:34.143
You are the worst!

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.393
I am going to take away
screen time and dessert

00:10:36.417 --> 00:10:39.601
and anything else you could possibly
ever enjoy in life!"

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:41.101
(Laughter)

00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:42.434
Anybody been there?

00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:45.851
(Applause)

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:48.500
Volatility, belittling.

00:10:49.417 --> 00:10:52.351
My oldest son turned around
and looked at me, and said,

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:53.976
"Mom, that's not love."

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.351
(Laughter)

00:10:57.375 --> 00:11:00.268
For a minute, I really wanted
to kill him for calling me out.
