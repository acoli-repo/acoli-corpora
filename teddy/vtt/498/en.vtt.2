00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.184
100 percent of us
will be on the receiving end

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:02.518
of unhealthy relationship behaviors

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:05.851
and 100 percent of us
will do unhealthy things.

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:07.333
It's part of being human.

00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:11.351
In its worst form,
the harm we inflict on loved ones

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.309
shows up as abuse and violence,

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.059
and relationship abuse

00:01:15.083 --> 00:01:17.976
is something that one in three women
and one in four men

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.708
will experience in their lifetime.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:23.434
Now, if you're like most people,
when you hear those stats,

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.268
you'll go, "Oh, no, no, no,
that would never happen to me."

00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:29.726
It's instinctual to move away
from the words "abuse" and "violence,"

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.601
to think that they happen
to someone else somewhere else.
