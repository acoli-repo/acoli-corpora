00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:01.268
Orange 1: I'd so depressed
if we ever broke up.

00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:02.809
I'd throw myself off this step.

00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:05.393
I would! Don't try to stop me!

00:08:05.417 --> 00:08:06.667
(#thatsnotlove)

00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:12.893
KH: Frequent breakups and makeups,
high highs and low lows:

00:08:12.917 --> 00:08:15.292
as tension rises, so does volatility.

00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:20.018
Tearful, frustrated fights
followed by emotional makeups,

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:21.684
hateful and hurtful comments like,

00:08:21.708 --> 00:08:24.351
"You're worthless,
I'm not even sure why I'm with you!"

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:29.184
followed quickly by apologies
and promises it will never happen again.

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:33.018
By this point, you've been so conditioned
to this relationship roller coaster
