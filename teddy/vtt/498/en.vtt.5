00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:30.934
give all of us a language
for talking about a subject

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.351
that's quite awkward
and uncomfortable to discuss;

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:39.226

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.333
and, in the process, improve
all of our ability to love better.

00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:47.143

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.893
the unhealthy signs
that we frequently miss,

00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:52.393

on creating content

00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:54.667
to start conversations with young people.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.018
As you'd expect, most of our content
is pretty serious,

00:02:58.042 --> 00:02:59.893
given the subject at hand,

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.559
but today I'm going to use
one of our more light-hearted
