00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:02.684
Because every new relationship
starts out with this intense desire

00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:04.059
to spend time together,

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:07.018
it's easy to miss when something shifts.

00:05:07.042 --> 00:05:09.768
Isolation creeps in
when your new boyfriend or girlfriend

00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:12.643
starts pulling you away
from your friends and family,

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.226
your support system,

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.250
and tethering you more tightly to them.

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:18.809
They might say things like,

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:21.309
"Why do you hang out with them?
They're such losers"

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:22.601
about your best friends,

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:25.476
or, "They want us to break up.
They're totally against us"

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.309
about your family.

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:29.934
Isolation is about sowing seeds of doubt

00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.833
about everyone from
your prerelationship life.
