00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:05.309
So when you think about a child,
a close friend, or a romantic partner,

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.226
the word "love" probably comes to mind,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.393
and instantly other emotions rush in:

00:00:11.417 --> 00:00:13.018
joy and hope,

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:16.601
excitement, trust and security,

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:19.684
and yes, sometimes
sadness and disappointment.

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:21.768
There might not be
a word in the dictionary

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:23.833
that more of us
are connected to than love.

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.893
Yet, given its central
importance in our lives,

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:31.417
isn't it interesting that we're never
explicitly taught how to love?
