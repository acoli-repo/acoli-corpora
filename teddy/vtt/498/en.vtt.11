Healthy love includes independence,

00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:38.684
two people who love spending time together

00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:42.934
but who stay connected to the people
and activities they cared about before.

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.851

00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:58.875
A third marker of unhealthy love
is extreme jealousy.
