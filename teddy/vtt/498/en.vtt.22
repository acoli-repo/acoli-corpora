00:10:57.375 --> 00:11:00.268
For a minute, I really wanted
to kill him for calling me out.

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:01.809
Trust me.

00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:03.351
But then I gathered myself

00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:06.434
and I thought, you know what,
I'm actually proud.

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:09.792
I'm proud that he has a language
to make me pause.

00:11:10.511 --> 00:11:13.226
I want all of my kids to understand
what the bar should be

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.684
for how they're treated

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:17.851
and to have a language and a voice
to use when that bar is not met

00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:19.792
versus just accepting it.

00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:26.518
For too long, we've treated
relationships as a soft topic,

00:11:26.542 --> 00:11:29.101
when relationship skills
are one of the most important

00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:31.684
and hard to build things in life.
