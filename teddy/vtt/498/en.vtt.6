00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.559
but today I'm going to use
one of our more light-hearted

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:04.393
yet still thought-provoking pieces,

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:05.726
"The Couplets,"

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.375
to illuminate five markers
of unhealthy love.

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:12.351
The first is intensity.

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:15.559
(Video) Blue: I haven't seen you
in a couple days. I've missed you.

00:03:15.583 --> 00:03:17.536
Orange: I've missed you too. (#thatslove)

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.726
Blue: I haven't seen you in five minutes.
It feels like a lifetime.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.559
What have you been doing
without me for five whole minutes?

00:03:23.583 --> 00:03:26.018
Orange: It's been three minutes.

00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:28.625
Katie Hood: Anybody recognize that?
I don't know. I do.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.184
Abusive relationships
don't start out abusive.
