00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A fact

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
came out of MIT,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
couple of years ago. Ken Hale,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
who's a linguist,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
said that of the 6,000 languages

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
spoken on Earth right now,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
3,000 aren't spoken by the children.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we're going to halve our cultural diversity.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
He went on to say

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that every two weeks,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
an elder goes to the grave

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
carrying the last spoken word
