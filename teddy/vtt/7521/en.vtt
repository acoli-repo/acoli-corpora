Do you remember
when you were 12 years old?

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:05.396
I do.

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:06.596
I was on a mission,

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:09.716
convinced that I could change
the world around me.

00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:12.596
In 2013, together with my sister Isabel,

00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:14.356
I started a movement in Bali

00:00:14.356 --> 00:00:18.236
because I saw a problem
that I thought had an easy solution.

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:19.756
We wanted to do something

00:00:19.796 --> 00:00:22.036
about the growing problem
of plastic pollution

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:24.836
on our home island of Bali, Indonesia.

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:26.676
Now, when I first started,

00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:30.356
I had never heard of the word
“changemaker” or “activist.”
