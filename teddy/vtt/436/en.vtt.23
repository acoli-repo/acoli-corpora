00:11:31.169 --> 00:11:33.044
What are we going to do about this,

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:34.847
our precious land?

00:11:34.871 --> 00:11:36.210
Well, looking at honey DNA,

00:11:36.234 --> 00:11:39.534
we can see what plants are good
for pollinators that have deep roots,

00:11:39.558 --> 00:11:41.369
that can secure the land,

00:11:41.393 --> 00:11:43.602
and together, everybody can participate.

00:11:43.626 --> 00:11:45.992
And the solution fits in a teaspoon.

00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:51.300

or destroyed by a natural disaster,

00:11:51.324 --> 00:11:54.621
we now have a blueprint suspended in time

00:11:54.645 --> 00:11:57.173
for how to restore that on Earth,

00:11:57.197 --> 00:12:01.390
or perhaps even in a greenhouse on Mars.
