00:04:57.945 --> 00:05:00.318
diseases of bees, of which there are many;

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.878
and habitat loss.

00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:03.973
So what we did is we looked on our maps

00:05:03.997 --> 00:05:06.359
and we identified areas
where bees were thriving.

00:05:06.383 --> 00:05:09.149
This was mostly in cities, we found.

00:05:09.173 --> 00:05:12.128
Data are now showing that urban
beehives produce more honey

00:05:12.152 --> 00:05:14.813
than rural beehives and suburban beehives.

00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:19.758
Urban beehives have a longer life span
than rural and suburban beehives,

00:05:19.782 --> 00:05:22.195
and bees in the city are more biodiverse;

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:24.962
there are more bee species in urban areas.

00:05:24.986 --> 00:05:26.437
(Laughter)

00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:27.700
Right?

00:05:27.724 --> 00:05:29.048
Why is this?

00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:31.011
That was our question.
