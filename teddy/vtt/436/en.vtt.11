00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:31.011
That was our question.

00:05:31.035 --> 00:05:33.243
So we started with
these three killers of bees,

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:34.422
and we flipped it:

00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:36.581
Which of these is different in the cities?

00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:38.151
So the first one, pesticides.

00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:40.853
We partnered up with
the Harvard School of Public Health.

00:05:40.877 --> 00:05:42.370
We shared our data with them.

00:05:42.394 --> 00:05:44.976
We collected samples
from our citizen science beehives

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.946
at people's homes and business rooftops.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.417
We looked at pesticide levels.

00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:52.243
We thought there would be less pesticides
in areas where bees are doing better.

00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:53.430
That's not the case.

00:05:53.454 --> 00:05:57.504
So what we found here in our study
is -- the orange bars are Boston,

00:05:57.528 --> 00:05:59.783
and we thought those bars
would be the lowest,

00:05:59.807 --> 00:06:02.041
there would be the lowest
levels of pesticides.
