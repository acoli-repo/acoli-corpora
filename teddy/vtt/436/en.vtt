00:00:00.793 --> 00:00:04.963
Pollinator decline is a grand challenge
in the modern world.

00:00:04.987 --> 00:00:07.896
Of the 200,000 species of pollinators,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.756
honeybees are the most well-understood,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.973
partly because of our long history
with them dating back 8,000 years ago

00:00:14.997 --> 00:00:18.165
to our cave drawings
in what is now modern-day Spain.

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.519
And yet we know that
this indicator species is dying off.

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:27.818
Last year alone, we lost 40 percent
of all beehives in the United States.

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:30.541
That number is even higher
in areas with harsh winters,
