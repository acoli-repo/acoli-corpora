00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:01.524
But we didn't know how to test this.

00:07:01.548 --> 00:07:03.608
So I had a really interesting meeting.

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:06.749
An idea sparked with my friend
and colleague Anne Madden,

00:07:06.773 --> 00:07:07.956
fellow TED speaker.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.632
We thought about genomics,
kind of like AncestryDNA or 23andMe.

00:07:12.656 --> 00:07:13.991
Have you done these?

00:07:14.015 --> 00:07:16.651
You spit in a tube and
you find out, "I'm German!"

00:07:16.675 --> 00:07:17.778
(Laughter)

00:07:17.802 --> 00:07:19.651
Well, we developed this for honey.

00:07:19.675 --> 00:07:23.221
So we have a sample of honey
and we look at all the plant DNA,

00:07:23.245 --> 00:07:25.090
and we find out, "I'm sumac!"

00:07:25.114 --> 00:07:26.384
(Laughter)

00:07:26.408 --> 00:07:28.792
And that's what we found
here in Provincetown.

00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:31.355
So for the first time ever,
I'm able to report to you
