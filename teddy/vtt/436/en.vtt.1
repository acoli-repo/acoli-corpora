00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:30.541
That number is even higher
in areas with harsh winters,

00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:31.925
like here in Massachusetts,

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.817
where we lost 47 percent of beehives

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:36.436
in one year alone.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.825
Can you imagine if we lost
half of our people last year?

00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:42.938
And if those were
the food-producing people?

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:44.694
It's untenable.

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.689
And I predict that in 10 years,

00:00:48.713 --> 00:00:51.100
we will lose our bees.

00:00:52.027 --> 00:00:56.340
If not for the work of beekeepers
replacing these dead beehives,

00:00:56.364 --> 00:00:59.279
we would be without foods
that we rely upon:

00:00:59.303 --> 00:01:01.125
fruits, vegetables,
