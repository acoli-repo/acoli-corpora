00:10:58.434 --> 00:11:01.953
This is how we're going to save
Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.

00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:05.390
We now have a baseline measure of honey,

00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:08.169
honey DNA from before and after the storm.

00:11:08.193 --> 00:11:10.203
We started in Humacao.

00:11:10.227 --> 00:11:12.750
This is right where
Hurricane Maria made landfall.

00:11:12.774 --> 00:11:16.583
And we know what plants to replace
and in what quantity and where

00:11:16.607 --> 00:11:19.422
by triangulating honey DNA samples.

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:22.112
You might even think about right here,

00:11:22.136 --> 00:11:24.803
the beautiful land
that connected us, that primed us,

00:11:24.827 --> 00:11:26.694
all the citizen science to begin with,

00:11:26.718 --> 00:11:28.867
the erosion, the winter storms

00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:31.145
that are getting more violent every year.
