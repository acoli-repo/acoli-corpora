00:05:59.807 --> 00:06:02.041
there would be the lowest
levels of pesticides.

00:06:02.065 --> 00:06:06.074
And, in fact, there are
the most pesticides in cities.

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.361
So the pesticide hypothesis
for what's saving bees --

00:06:09.385 --> 00:06:10.784
less pesticides in cities --

00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:12.213
is not it.

00:06:12.237 --> 00:06:16.107
And this is very typical
of my life as a scientist.

00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.021
Anytime I've had a hypothesis,

00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:21.365
not only is it not supported,
but the opposite is true.

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:22.410
(Laughter)

00:06:22.434 --> 00:06:24.569
Which is still an interesting
finding, right?

00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:25.753
We moved on.

00:06:25.777 --> 00:06:26.951
The disease hypothesis.

00:06:26.975 --> 00:06:29.270
We looked at diseases
all over our beehives.

00:06:29.294 --> 00:06:33.407
And what we found in a similar study
to this one with North Carolina State is:
