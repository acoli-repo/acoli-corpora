00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:30.370
and the presidential delegation
from the country of Haiti.

00:10:30.394 --> 00:10:34.148
We've worked with wonderful graduate
students at Yale University and Ethiopia.

00:10:34.172 --> 00:10:36.585
In these countries,
we can add value to their honey

00:10:36.609 --> 00:10:37.881
by identifying what it is,

00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:39.893
but informing the people of what to plant

00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:43.099
to restore their habitat
and secure their food systems.

00:10:43.123 --> 00:10:46.991
But what I think is even more important
is when we think about natural disasters.

00:10:47.015 --> 00:10:48.166
For the first time,

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.242
we now know how we can have
a baseline measure of any habitat

00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:53.258
before it might be destroyed.

00:10:53.282 --> 00:10:54.959
Think about your hometown.

00:10:54.983 --> 00:10:58.410
What risks does
the environment pose to it?

00:10:58.434 --> 00:11:01.953
This is how we're going to save
Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.
