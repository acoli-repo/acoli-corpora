00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:01.320
what you see here, this hidden beehive --

00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:03.914
that beehive produced
more honey that first year

00:03:03.938 --> 00:03:07.096
than we have ever experienced
in any beehive we had managed.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.744
It shifted our research
perspective forever.

00:03:09.768 --> 00:03:14.635
It changed our research question away from
"How do we save the dead and dying bees?"

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.978
to "Where are bees doing best?"

00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:19.941
And we started to be able
to put maps together,

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:22.287
looking at all of these
citizen science beehives

00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:24.739
from people who had
beehives at home decks,

00:03:24.763 --> 00:03:26.840
gardens, business rooftops.

00:03:26.864 --> 00:03:28.434
We started to engage the public,

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.045
and the more people who got
these little data points,
