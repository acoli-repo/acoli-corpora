00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.045
and the more people who got
these little data points,

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.722
the more accurate our maps became.

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:35.921
And so when you're sitting here thinking,
"How can I get involved?"

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:38.214
you might think about a story
of my friend Fred,

00:03:38.238 --> 00:03:40.223
who's a commercial real estate developer.

00:03:40.247 --> 00:03:42.323
He was thinking the same thing.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.736
He was at a meeting,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.310
thinking about what he could do
for tenant relations

00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:48.143
and sustainability at scale.

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:49.913
And while he was having a tea break,

00:03:49.937 --> 00:03:53.101
he put honey into his tea
and noticed on the honey jar

00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:56.933
a message about corporate sustainability
from the host company of that meeting.

00:03:56.957 --> 00:03:58.927
And it sparked an idea.

00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:00.614
He came back to his office.
