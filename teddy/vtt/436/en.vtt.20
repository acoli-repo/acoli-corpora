"Here lies Noah. Plant a flower." Right?

00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:03.715
I mean -- it's exhausting
after all of this.

00:10:04.255 --> 00:10:05.888
But when we scale together,

00:10:05.912 --> 00:10:08.107
when we go to governments
and city planners --

00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:10.457
like in Boston, the honey
is mostly linden trees,

00:10:10.481 --> 00:10:13.907
and we say, "If a dead tree
needs to be replaced, consider linden."

00:10:13.931 --> 00:10:17.352
When we take this information
to governments, we can do amazing things.

00:10:17.376 --> 00:10:19.225
This is a rooftop from Fred's company.

00:10:19.249 --> 00:10:22.963
We can plant those things
on top of rooftops worldwide

00:10:22.987 --> 00:10:26.048
to start restoring habitat
and securing food systems.

00:10:26.072 --> 00:10:27.604
We've worked with the World Bank

00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:30.370
and the presidential delegation
from the country of Haiti.
