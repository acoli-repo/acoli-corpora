00:08:28.484 --> 00:08:31.432
But what's more interesting is
85 different plant species

00:08:31.456 --> 00:08:33.122
in one teaspoon of honey.

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:35.657
That's the measure we want, the big data.

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:38.656
Indian honey: that is oak.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.134
Every sample we've tested
from India is oak,

00:08:41.158 --> 00:08:45.611
and that's 172 different flavors
in one taste of Indian honey.

00:08:45.635 --> 00:08:49.185
Provincetown honey goes from
116 plants in the spring

00:08:49.209 --> 00:08:52.150
to over 200 plants in the summer.

00:08:52.174 --> 00:08:55.622
These are the numbers that we need
to test the habitat hypothesis.

00:08:55.646 --> 00:08:57.395
In another citizen science approach,

00:08:57.419 --> 00:09:00.687
you find out about your food
and we get some interesting data.
