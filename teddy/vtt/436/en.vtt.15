00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:31.355
So for the first time ever,
I'm able to report to you

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:34.169
what type of honey is from right here
in our own community.

00:07:34.193 --> 00:07:36.626
HoneyDNA, a genomics test.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.286
Spring honey in Provincetown
is from privet.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.681
What's privet? Hedges.

00:07:41.705 --> 00:07:42.860
What's the message?

00:07:42.884 --> 00:07:45.456
Don't trim your hedges to save the bees.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.590
(Laughter)

00:07:46.614 --> 00:07:49.062
I know we're getting crunchy
and it's controversial,

00:07:49.086 --> 00:07:50.712
so before you throw your tomatoes,

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:53.472
we'll move to the summer honey,
which is water lily honey.

00:07:53.496 --> 00:07:56.376
If you have honey from Provincetown
right here in the summer,

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.169
you're eating water lily juice;

00:07:58.193 --> 00:08:00.608
in the fall, sumac honey.
