A wonderful woman named Natalie
got eight beehives at her home in Truro,

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.705
and she introduced us
to her friend Valerie,

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.307
who let us set up 60 beehives at
an abandoned tennis court on her property.

00:02:09.902 --> 00:02:13.063
And so we started testing
vaccines for bees.

00:02:13.087 --> 00:02:15.606
We were starting to look at probiotics.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.246
We called it "bee yogurt" --

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.316
ways to make bees healthier.

00:02:19.798 --> 00:02:22.708
And our citizen science project
started to take off.

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:26.057
Meanwhile, back in my apartment here,

00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:28.517
I was a bit nervous about my landlord.

00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:31.316
I figured I should tell him
what we were doing.
