00:00:59.303 --> 00:01:01.125
fruits, vegetables,

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.410
crunchy almonds and nuts,

00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:04.838
tart apples,

00:01:04.862 --> 00:01:06.838
sour lemons.

00:01:06.862 --> 00:01:12.116
Even the food that our cattle rely
upon to eat, hay and alfalfa -- gone,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.105
causing global hunger,

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:15.931
economic collapse,

00:01:15.955 --> 00:01:18.397
a total moral crisis across earth.

00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:22.151
Now, I first started keeping bees
here in Cape Cod

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:25.560
right after I finished my doctorate
in honeybee immunology.

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:28.016
(Laughter)

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.547
(Applause)
