00:06:29.294 --> 00:06:33.407
And what we found in a similar study
to this one with North Carolina State is:

00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:35.557
there's no difference
between disease in bees

00:06:35.581 --> 00:06:37.332
in urban, suburban and rural areas.

00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:39.958
Diseases are everywhere;
bees are sick and dying.

00:06:39.982 --> 00:06:42.448
In fact, there were more diseases
of bees in cities.

00:06:42.472 --> 00:06:44.504
This was from Raleigh, North Carolina.

00:06:44.528 --> 00:06:48.515
So again, my hypothesis was not supported.
The opposite was true.

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:49.988
We're moving on.

00:06:50.012 --> 00:06:52.270
(Laughter)

00:06:52.294 --> 00:06:54.388
The habitat hypothesis.

00:06:54.412 --> 00:06:58.063
This said that areas where bees
are thriving have a better habitat --

00:06:58.087 --> 00:06:59.702
more flowers, right?

00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:01.524
But we didn't know how to test this.
