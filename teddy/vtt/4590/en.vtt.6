00:02:55.394 --> 00:03:00.746
have given us our current model 
of how this consolidation process works.

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.798
Sensory data is initially transcribed

00:03:02.798 --> 00:03:07.071
and temporarily recorded in the neurons
as short-term memory.

00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:09.624
From there, it travels to the hippocampus,

00:03:09.624 --> 00:03:13.150
which strengthens and enhances 
the neurons in that cortical area.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.369
Thanks to the phenomenon
of neuroplasticity,

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:20.341
new synaptic buds are formed,
allowing new connections between neurons,

00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:22.184
and strengthening the neural network

00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:25.934
where the information will be returned
as long-term memory.

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:28.801
So why do we remember
some things and not others?

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:30.689
Well, there are a few ways to influence
