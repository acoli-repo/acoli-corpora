00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:32.794
Through a continuing dialogue 
between the cortex and hippocampus,

00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:35.497
it is then repeatedly reactivated,

00:04:35.497 --> 00:04:40.998
driving its gradual redistribution
to long-term storage in the cortex.

00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:44.884
REM sleep, on the other hand, with
its similarity to waking brain activity,

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:48.474
is associated with the consolidation
of procedural memory.

00:04:48.474 --> 00:04:50.305
So based on the studies,

00:04:50.305 --> 00:04:53.533
going to sleep three hours after 
memorizing your formulas

00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:58.515
and one hour after practicing your scales
would be the most ideal.

00:04:58.515 --> 00:05:01.017
So hopefully you can see now
that skimping on sleep
