At first glance,

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:34.255
our ability to remember things 
doesn't seem very impressive at all.

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:37.038
19th century psychologist 
Herman Ebbinghaus

00:01:37.038 --> 00:01:40.913
demonstrated that we normally forget
40% of new material

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:43.394
within the first twenty minutes,

00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:47.134
a phenomenon known
as the forgetting curve.

00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:50.735
But this loss can be prevented 
through memory consolidation,

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:53.289
the process by which
information is moved

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.903
from our fleeting short-term memory
to our more durable long-term memory.

00:01:58.903 --> 00:02:02.623
This consolidation occurs with the help
of a major part of the brain,
