00:01:58.903 --> 00:02:02.623
This consolidation occurs with the help
of a major part of the brain,

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:05.340
known as the hippocampus.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.360
Its role in long-term memory formation

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.368
was demonstrated in the 1950s
by Brenda Milner

00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:14.656
in her research with 
a patient known as H.M.

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:16.955
After having his hippocampus removed,

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:21.323
H.M.'s ability to form new short-term memories
was damaged,

00:02:21.323 --> 00:02:25.888
but he was able to learn physical tasks
through repetition.

00:02:25.888 --> 00:02:27.719
Due to the removal of his hippocampus,

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.294
H.M.'s ability to form long-term memories
was also damaged.
