H.M.'s ability to form long-term memories
was also damaged.

00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:34.437
What this case revealed,
among other things,

00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:37.359
was that the hippocampus 
was specifically involved

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.062
in the consolidation of
long-term declarative memory,

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:45.316
such as the facts and concepts
you need to remember for that test,

00:02:45.316 --> 00:02:47.125
rather than procedural memory,

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:51.728
such as the finger movements
you need to master for that recital.

00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:55.394
Milner's findings, along with work 
by Eric Kandel in the 90's,

00:02:55.394 --> 00:03:00.746
have given us our current model 
of how this consolidation process works.
