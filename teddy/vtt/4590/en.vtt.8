00:03:59.228 --> 00:04:02.387
EEG machines monitoring
people during these stages

00:04:02.387 --> 00:04:04.377
have shown electrical impulses

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:09.686
moving between the brainstem,
hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex,

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:13.528
which serve as relay stations 
of memory formation.

00:04:13.528 --> 00:04:16.901
And the different stages of sleep
have been shown to help consolidate

00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:19.108
different types of memories.

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:22.557
During the non-REM slow-wave sleep,

00:04:22.557 --> 00:04:26.125
declarative memory is encoded 
into a temporary store

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.952
in the anterior part of the hippocampus.

00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:32.794
Through a continuing dialogue 
between the cortex and hippocampus,
