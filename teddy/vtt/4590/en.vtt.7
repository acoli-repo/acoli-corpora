00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:30.689
Well, there are a few ways to influence

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.300
the extent and effectiveness 
of memory retention.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.435
For example, memories that are formed
in times of heightened feeling,

00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:39.470
or even stress,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.727
will be better recorded due to 
the hippocampus' link with emotion.

00:03:44.727 --> 00:03:48.723
But one of the major factors contributing
to memory consolidation is,

00:03:48.723 --> 00:03:49.891
you guessed it,

00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:51.878
a good night's sleep.

00:03:51.878 --> 00:03:54.214
Sleep is composed of four stages,

00:03:54.214 --> 00:03:56.952
the deepest of which are known
as slow-wave sleep

00:03:56.952 --> 00:03:59.228
and rapid eye movement.
