00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is compassion,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and it's empathy, and it's passion itself,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and it's vulnerability,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and it's openness, and it's intensity,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and it's association, and it's relationship,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and it is intuitive.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and that vulnerability is our greatest strength,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and that emotions have inherent logic,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And then let's remember that we've been taught

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the exact opposite by the powers that be,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that compassion clouds your thinking,
