00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
who are literally being treated like ashtrays.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and brothers and fathers and uncles.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I've seen that we cut girls and we control them

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and we keep them illiterate,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
or we make them feel bad about being too smart.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
We silence them. We make them feel guilty

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
for being smart. We get them to behave,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
to tone it down, not to be too intense.
