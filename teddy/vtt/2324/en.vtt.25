00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
we asked her what we could do for her,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster."

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So, we got her a Jeep. And then she saved 4,500 girls.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And then we asked her, "Okay, what else do you need?"

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And she said, "Well, now, I need a house."

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
So, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
in Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And it was a house where girls could run away,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
they could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
they could go to school.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And in the years that Agnes has had the house,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
she has changed the situation there.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
She has literally become deputy mayor.
