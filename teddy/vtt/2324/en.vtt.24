00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
a house we opened seven years ago

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
she was female genitally mutilated.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And she made a decision as many women do across this planet,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
that what was done to her would not be enforced and done

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
to other women and girls.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
So, for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and what a mutilated vagina looked like.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
we asked her what we could do for her,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster."
