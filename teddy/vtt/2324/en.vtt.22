00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and rolled over by that tank.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
in Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And she was holding her baby.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And I asked her if she loved her baby.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
"Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It's my baby and it's full of love."

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
The capacity for girls to overcome situations

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing.
