00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
are girls between the ages of 10 to 24,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
they are they key, really, in the developing world,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that keep them where society wants them to be,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
including lack of access to healthcare,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
education, healthy foods,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
labor force participation.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The burden of all the household tasks

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
usually falls on girls and younger siblings,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
The state of girls, the condition of girls,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
will, in my belief -- and that's the girl inside us
