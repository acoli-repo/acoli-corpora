00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I want to say that I think the powers that be

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
know that empire-building

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and excavating the Earth, and destroying things.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I remember, for example, when my father,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
who was very, very violent, used to beat me.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And he would actually say, while he was beating me,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
"Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry."

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of what he was doing.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.
