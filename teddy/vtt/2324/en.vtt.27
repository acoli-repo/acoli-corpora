how he was about to sell her for the cows.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And she knew that meant she would be cut.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
She knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So, one afternoon, she'd heard about the safe house,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Jaclyn left her father's house

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and she walked for two days, two days

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
through Masai land.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
She imagined her father killing her on one hand,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and Mama Agnes greeting her,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house.
