00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Namaste. Good morning.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm very happy to be here in India.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
over these last particularly 11 years

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues,"

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
traveling the world,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to stop violence against women.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What I want to talk about today

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
is this particular cell,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And I want to call it the girl cell.
