In the Congo, for those of you who don't know,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
there has been a war raging for the last 12 years,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
a war that has killed nearly six million people.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
have been raped there.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I sat with women

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Their stories were so horrific,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And I will tell you that what happened
