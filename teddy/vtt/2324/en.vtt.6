00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the most extreme forms of violence,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the most horrific poverty,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
genocide, mass rapes,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And because we have suppressed our girl cells

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and suppressed our girl-ship,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
we do not feel what is going on.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So, we are not being charged with

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the adequate response to what is happening.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I want to talk a little bit about

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
For me, it was the turning point of my life.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.
