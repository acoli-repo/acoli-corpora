I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And I think in some ways

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
we've been much harsher to men

in the annihilation of their girl cell.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
(Applause)

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet:

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
to distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I actually realized once in Kosovo,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
when I watched a man break down,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that bullets are actually hardened tears,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that when we don't allow men to have their girl self
