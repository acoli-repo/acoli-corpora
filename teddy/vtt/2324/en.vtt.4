00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the exact opposite by the powers that be,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that compassion clouds your thinking,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that it gets in the way,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that vulnerability is weakness,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that emotions are not to be trusted,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and you're not supposed to take things personally,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
which is one of my favorites.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I think the whole world has essentially

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
been brought up not to be a girl.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
How do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
To be a boy really means not to be a girl.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
To be a man means not to be a girl.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
To be a woman means not to be a girl.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
To be strong means not to be a girl.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
To be a leader means not to be a girl.
