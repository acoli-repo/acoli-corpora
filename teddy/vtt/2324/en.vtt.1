00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And I want to call it the girl cell.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And it's in men as well as in women.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is central to the evolution of our species

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and the continuation of the human race.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I want you imagine that at some point in history

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
understood that the suppression of this particular cell,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the oppression of these cells,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the reinterpretation of these cells,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the undermining of these cells,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells
