00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in a place called Bukavu

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
In the Congo, for those of you who don't know,
