00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
She has literally become deputy mayor.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
She's changed the rules.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
When we were there she was doing a ritual

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
where she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and there's a drought in Kenya.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So cows are dying, and cows are the most

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
valued possession.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And Jaclyn overheard her father

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
talking to an old man about

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
how he was about to sell her for the cows.
