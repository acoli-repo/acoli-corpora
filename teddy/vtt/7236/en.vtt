00:00:00.747 --> 00:00:02.957
All right, I'm going to go out
on a limb here.

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:08.421
I'm going to say that every single
one of us in this room

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:10.465
made drawings when we were little.

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:11.632
Yes?

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:13.134
Yes? OK.

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:18.014
And maybe around the age of like,
four or five or something like that,

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:19.474
you might have been drawing,

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.643
and a grown-up came over
and looked over your shoulder and said,

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:23.853
"What's that?"

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:26.189
And you said, "It's a face."

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.815
And they said,

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:30.610
"That's not really what a face looks like.
