00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How do you observe something you can't see?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is the basic question of somebody who's interested

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in finding and studying black holes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Because black holes are objects

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
whose pull of gravity is so intense

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that nothing can escape it, not even light,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so you can't see it directly.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So, my story today about black holes

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is about one particular black hole.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm interested in finding whether or not

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
there is a really massive, what we like to call

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
"supermassive" black hole at the center of our galaxy.
