00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:32.348
But by then, I was speaking
perfect Spanish --

00:02:32.372 --> 00:02:36.048
better than I speak it now, I think,
because it's been years since I left.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:41.908
And I felt forced to choose
between my Argentine identity

00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:43.239
and my Korean one.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:45.501
Apparently, I couldn't be both,

00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:49.033
and I had to abandon my previous identity

00:02:49.057 --> 00:02:51.897
in order to adopt the new one.

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:56.962
So when I turned 18, I went to Korea

00:02:56.986 --> 00:03:02.102
to see if I could find this home
that I could call my place in the world.
