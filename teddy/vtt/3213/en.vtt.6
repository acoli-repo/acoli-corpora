to see if I could find this home
that I could call my place in the world.

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:07.260
In Korea, people assumed
I was a foreigner, and they'd ask me,

00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:09.806
“Why do you speak Korean
with a Spanish accent?”

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.980
(Laughter)

00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:14.714
Apparently, I was too Korean
to be Argentine,

00:03:14.738 --> 00:03:18.370
but too Argentine to be Korean.

00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:21.879
Realizing that, honestly,
was very transformative.

00:03:22.943 --> 00:03:28.183
I decided not to try and change
what I can't change

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:29.617
and accept it.

00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:33.043
In fact, I was inspired
by one of my grandmother's stories.
