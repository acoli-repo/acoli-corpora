00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:33.843
I changed majors so many times
that my advisor told me

00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:35.890
that instead of chemical engineering,

00:06:35.914 --> 00:06:39.327
I should get a degree in random studies.

00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:40.555
(Laughter)

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:44.352
Over the years, I've had
a lot of identities:

00:06:44.376 --> 00:06:49.062
academic, scientist,
social innovator, inventor

00:06:49.086 --> 00:06:54.755
entrepreneur, investor;
most recently, networker, teacher

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:58.587
and, most importantly,
a mother, three years ago.

00:06:59.698 --> 00:07:05.318
I was so confused that even my accent
couldn't decide who it was.
