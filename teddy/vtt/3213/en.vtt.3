00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:31.597
Where is my home?

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:36.976
To be honest, I didn't have
an answer to these questions,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.517
and that really worried me.

00:01:40.672 --> 00:01:46.934
This episode triggered
an existential search for my identity.

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.601
I was born in Korea, the land of kimchi,

00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:54.808
and I grew up in Argentina,
where there was always meat on the table;

00:01:54.832 --> 00:01:59.604
truly, it would not be surprising
if today I were 80 percent cow.

00:01:59.628 --> 00:02:00.965
(Laughter)
