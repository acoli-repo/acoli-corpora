businesswoman, Korean, immigrant,
mother, grandmother.

00:11:33.236 --> 00:11:36.151
With her last wish, she taught me

00:11:36.175 --> 00:11:42.311
that finding our home isn't about
putting down roots somewhere.

00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:47.846
It's about intertwining those roots
with the roots of others

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.308
who enrich our lives.

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:51.994
Thank you.

00:11:52.018 --> 00:11:53.851
