00:09:28.289 --> 00:09:33.744
I hope that my kids will have
a multidimensionality

00:09:33.768 --> 00:09:36.208
that works for them;

00:09:36.232 --> 00:09:39.780
that they see it as a tool
for creating connections

00:09:39.804 --> 00:09:43.509
in a world that's every day more global

00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:45.017
and also more divided.

00:09:45.583 --> 00:09:48.657
I hope that instead of feeling
anxious and worried

00:09:48.681 --> 00:09:52.207
that they don't fit into a predefined box,

00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:55.524
that they can feel free to experiment

00:09:55.548 --> 00:10:00.235
and take control of their life narratives
