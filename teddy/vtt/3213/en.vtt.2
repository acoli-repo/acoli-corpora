00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:04.352
We knew no Spanish,
or how we were going to make a living.

00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:08.437
We were immigrants in a new land,

00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:12.583
where we had lost everything
on account of a scam,

00:01:12.607 --> 00:01:17.033
and we had worked very hard
to rebuild our lives.

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:21.118
That's why I couldn't imagine
that after so many years,

00:01:21.836 --> 00:01:24.691
our home would still be Korea.

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:29.949
It made me wonder:
Where do I want to be buried someday?

00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:31.597
Where is my home?
