00:07:56.711 --> 00:08:02.385
a chart showing the average income

00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:05.743
of people who graduated
with doctorates from Stanford

00:08:05.767 --> 00:08:11.502
compared to the average incomes
of Stanford students

00:08:11.526 --> 00:08:14.067
who abandoned their thesis or doctorate.

00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:18.654
Now, I have to confess
that the chart was really skewed

00:08:18.678 --> 00:08:20.747
by the founders of Google.

00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:22.008
(Laughter)

00:08:22.032 --> 00:08:26.796
My mom looked at the chart
and without blinking, said,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.639
"I've always said
you should follow your heart."

00:08:29.663 --> 00:08:32.341
(Laughter)
