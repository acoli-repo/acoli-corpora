00:09:55.548 --> 00:10:00.235
and take control of their life narratives

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:01.513
in their own way.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:06.531
I hope they can use the unique
combination of values,

00:10:06.555 --> 00:10:09.730
cultures, languages
and abilities that they have

00:10:09.754 --> 00:10:16.378
to create a world where their identities
are used to unite peoples and people,

00:10:16.402 --> 00:10:20.269
and not as an excuse
to generate intolerance --

00:10:20.293 --> 00:10:23.720
because identity can be
a double-edged sword:

00:10:23.744 --> 00:10:28.317
we can use it to differentiate
ourselves from others,

00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:30.789
or to find points of connection.
