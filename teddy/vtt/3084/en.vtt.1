Those are my students,

00:00:36.806 --> 00:00:41.037
and whenever I'm asked to articulate
my work or my priorities as a teacher,

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:46.167
I explain that I believe education
can be a tool for social justice.

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:50.925
But a few months ago, I logged
onto Twitter -- as I do --

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.947
and I saw that a fellow teacher
had taken issue with that belief.

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:59.939
"Teachers," he said,
"should not be social justice warriors,

00:00:59.963 --> 00:01:02.942
because the purpose
of education is to educate."
