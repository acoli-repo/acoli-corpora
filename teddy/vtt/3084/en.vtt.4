lazier and more dangerous than whites.

00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:04.302
And that's just one concrete example
of the insidious effects

00:02:04.326 --> 00:02:07.462
of historic and systemic racism
on our country.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.309
For more evidence,
we could look at incarceration rates;

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:14.631
we could look at statistics on police
violence against black people;

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:17.091
we could look at the opportunity

belongs in our schools.

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.856
Social justice should be a part
of the mission of every school

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.025
and every teacher in America,

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.882
if we want "liberty and justice for all"
to be more than a slogan ...
