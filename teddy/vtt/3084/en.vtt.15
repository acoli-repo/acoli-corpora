00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:32.459
This was in the wake
of Michael Brown's death

00:07:32.483 --> 00:07:33.633
in Ferguson, Missouri,

00:07:33.657 --> 00:07:36.780
and the students were planning
to join a walkout and march

00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:39.170
in support of the Black Lives
Matter movement.

00:07:39.622 --> 00:07:40.773
So at this point,

00:07:40.797 --> 00:07:42.995
the staff at the school
had a decision to make.

00:07:43.363 --> 00:07:47.464
Would we use our authority and our power
to try to control the students

00:07:47.488 --> 00:07:49.155
and prevent them from leaving,

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:51.357
or would we support them

00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:54.497
as they put into practice
the principles of social justice

00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:57.639
that we had taught them about
since the ninth-grade year?

00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:01.134
So the next morning,
the kids left school en masse
