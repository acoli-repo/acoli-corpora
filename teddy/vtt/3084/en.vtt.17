And those who chose to leave
participated in a citywide student walkout

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.732
and raised their collective
voice for justice.

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.812
But no matter where they chose
to spend the afternoon,

our kids learned
valuable lessons that day.

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:45.454
They learned that the adults
in their lives would support them

00:08:45.478 --> 00:08:47.767
even as we worried for their safety.

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:51.590
And they learned that they didn't need us

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.352

00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:57.007
They learned that they were members
of a community of young people

00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:00.079
with a shared vision
of a more equitable society,
