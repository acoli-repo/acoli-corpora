with a shared vision
of a more equitable society,

00:09:00.103 --> 00:09:02.913
and they learned that they had power
within that society.

00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:06.211
They learned that events
like the Soweto uprising

00:09:06.235 --> 00:09:08.454
are not ancient history,

00:09:08.478 --> 00:09:10.746
and they don't have to end in tragedy.

00:09:11.882 --> 00:09:16.153
And that's what education as a tool
for social justice can look like.

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:18.500
And here's the thing:

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:20.577
our kids are ready for this kind of work.

00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:21.772
So in 2015,

00:09:21.796 --> 00:09:24.043
incoming college freshmen were surveyed,

00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:26.418
and 8.5 percent of them said

00:09:26.442 --> 00:09:29.776
that there was a "very good chance"
they would participate in a protest

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.691
sometime during their college career.
