00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.882
if we want "liberty and justice for all"
to be more than a slogan ...

00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:38.213
because schools are crucial places
for children to become active citizens

00:02:38.237 --> 00:02:42.410
and to learn the skills and the tools
that they need to change the world.

00:02:42.906 --> 00:02:44.121
So what are those skills?

00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:46.103
OK, here's a secret:

00:02:46.127 --> 00:02:47.927
many of the skills that people need

00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:51.029
to orchestrate the kinds of change
that will lead to justice

00:02:51.053 --> 00:02:53.515
are already built
into the work of schools.

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.854
Things like problem-solving,

00:02:55.878 --> 00:02:58.195
critical thinking,
collaboration, perseverance --

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.769
none of that should be
revolutionary on its own.
