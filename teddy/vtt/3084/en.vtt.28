00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:00.238
and imagine schools
where teachers are thought partners,

00:14:00.262 --> 00:14:04.249
letting students grapple 
with complex, hard issues

00:14:04.273 --> 00:14:07.056
and not necessarily giving them
the right answers.

00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:12.370
And imagine schools
where we let students make choices --

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:14.692
we trust them enough to do that

00:14:14.716 --> 00:14:18.104
and we let them experience
the consequences of those choices.

00:14:19.714 --> 00:14:24.478
Imagine schools where
we let students be humans,

00:14:24.502 --> 00:14:27.213
with all of the messiness
and the uncertainty

00:14:27.237 --> 00:14:29.167
that is bound to come with that.
