00:04:59.647 --> 00:05:00.798
well ...

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:02.554
we benefited from its resources.

00:05:03.214 --> 00:05:07.539
So in 1976, the South African
government passed a new law

00:05:07.563 --> 00:05:10.032
which required that all students
in South Africa

00:05:10.056 --> 00:05:12.204
learn in the language Afrikaans,

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:13.606
which was a white language,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.202
and many black South Africans
referred to that language

00:05:16.226 --> 00:05:18.176
as the language of the oppressor.

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:19.935
So not surprisingly,

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:22.096
students of color
were outraged at this law.

00:05:22.738 --> 00:05:25.217
They already attended segregated schools

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.296
with overcrowded classrooms,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.684
a lack of resources

00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:30.791
and a frankly racist curriculum,
