it actually goes the other way, too.

00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:03.482
So working for justice,
engaging in activism,

00:10:03.506 --> 00:10:07.770
helps students build skills
like leadership and critical thinking,

00:10:07.794 --> 00:10:10.901
and it correlates positively
with their political participation

00:10:10.925 --> 00:10:12.299
and their civic engagement

00:10:12.323 --> 00:10:14.943
and their commitment
to their communities later in life.

00:10:14.967 --> 00:10:16.439
So in other words,

00:10:16.463 --> 00:10:20.332
students are telling us
that social justice matters to them

00:10:20.356 --> 00:10:23.811
and researchers are telling us
that it helps students learn.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.173
So now it's up to us to listen,

00:10:27.197 --> 00:10:29.033
and that might not be easy.
