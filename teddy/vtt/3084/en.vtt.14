00:07:05.145 --> 00:07:07.071
they would risk their lives

00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:10.271
so that a future generation
could live in a more just world.

00:07:10.813 --> 00:07:14.013
And most profoundly for me,
every single year,

00:07:14.037 --> 00:07:19.349
they ask themselves whether adults
will ever listen to their voices.

A few years ago,

00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:25.296
my principal got an anonymous email
from one of our students.

00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:27.553
It informed him that the following day,

00:07:27.577 --> 00:07:29.807
the students planned
to walk out of school.
