00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.691
sometime during their college career.

00:09:31.715 --> 00:09:33.867
That might not seem very impressive,

00:09:33.891 --> 00:09:35.092
but consider the fact

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:39.276
that it's the largest number
of students to say that since 1967.

00:09:40.073 --> 00:09:41.812
And 75 percent of those kids

00:09:41.836 --> 00:09:44.461
said that helping other people
who are having difficulty

00:09:44.485 --> 00:09:46.916
was a "very important"
or "essential" goal for them.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.454
Again, the highest number of people
to say that since the late 1960s.

00:09:50.984 --> 00:09:55.947
And research shows us that working
for justice doesn't just follow

00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:58.599
from building all those skills
I talked about earlier --

00:09:58.623 --> 00:10:00.372
it actually goes the other way, too.
