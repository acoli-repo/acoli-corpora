00:12:29.965 --> 00:12:31.748
or the way that we do things,

00:12:31.772 --> 00:12:36.117
what if we chose to see that as a sign
that we're doing something right

00:12:36.141 --> 00:12:38.160
and that they're becoming liberated?

00:12:39.474 --> 00:12:41.310
I know it would be easier

00:12:41.334 --> 00:12:45.456
if their critical thinking skills
manifested in more convenient ways --

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.433
on their essays
or their standardized tests --

00:12:48.457 --> 00:12:49.607
I get it --

00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:53.313
but convenience and justice
do not often go hand in hand.

00:12:53.671 --> 00:12:57.258
And when our kids learn to think
critically about the world around them,

00:12:57.282 --> 00:12:59.932
they become the kinds of engaged citizens

00:12:59.956 --> 00:13:03.267
who will recognize and question
injustice when they see it
