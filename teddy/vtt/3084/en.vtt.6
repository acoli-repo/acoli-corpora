00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.769
none of that should be
revolutionary on its own.

00:03:01.502 --> 00:03:04.578
Combine that with the ability
to understand history

00:03:04.602 --> 00:03:09.548
not as one static and objective narrative
on which we all agree,

00:03:09.572 --> 00:03:12.272
but as a series of intertwined events

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:14.998
about which there can be
countless interpretations.

00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:18.852
If we deliberately choose
to explore history with our students

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:20.666
rather than just teach it,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.456
we help them understand
that history is ongoing

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.892
and that it's connected
to current movements for justice.

00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:29.666
And we help them see themselves
as potential players

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.444
within a living history.
