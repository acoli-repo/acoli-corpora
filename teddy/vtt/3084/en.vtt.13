00:06:26.996 --> 00:06:30.060
and it became nearly impossible
to ignore the brutality

00:06:30.084 --> 00:06:31.818
of the apartheid regime.

00:06:31.842 --> 00:06:35.097
In the months and the years
that followed the Soweto uprising,

00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:38.391
more and more countries
exerted political and economic pressure

00:06:38.415 --> 00:06:41.295
on the South African government
to end apartheid,

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:45.783
and it was largely due to the activism
of those kids in Soweto.

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:50.563
So every year my kids learn about this.

00:06:50.587 --> 00:06:53.585
And invariably, they start
to draw connections

00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:55.968
between those kids
in Soweto and themselves.

00:06:56.486 --> 00:06:58.243
And they start to ask themselves

00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:01.608
what kind of political power
and agency they have.
