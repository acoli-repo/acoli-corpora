who will recognize and question
injustice when they see it

00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:05.077
and work to do something about it.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.142
Welcoming rebellion into our schools
is going to require some rethinking

00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:12.369
about what teaching
and learning look like,

00:13:12.393 --> 00:13:14.418
because there's this misconception

00:13:14.442 --> 00:13:18.425
that if we give students any wiggle room,
they're going to walk all over us

00:13:18.449 --> 00:13:23.246
and classrooms and dinner tables
will devolve into total chaos.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:29.088
And if we expect kids to sit silently
and passively receive knowledge from us,

00:13:29.112 --> 00:13:32.315
then their voices will always
feel overwhelming.
