00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:01.134
So the next morning,
the kids left school en masse

00:08:01.158 --> 00:08:02.713
and they gathered on the lawn.

00:08:02.737 --> 00:08:05.341
And one of the seniors
jumped up on a picnic table

00:08:05.365 --> 00:08:07.309
and went over safety expectations.

00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:08.341
(Laughter)

00:08:08.365 --> 00:08:10.612
And the younger kids
took it very seriously.

00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:13.166
And as teachers and as staff we told them,

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.482
"OK, be safe,"

00:08:14.506 --> 00:08:16.439
and we watched as they marched off.

00:08:16.808 --> 00:08:20.388
The kids who chose to stay
spent that afternoon in class.

00:08:20.412 --> 00:08:22.593
They debated the merits of protest,

00:08:22.617 --> 00:08:25.717
they talked about the history
of the Black Lives Matter movement,

00:08:25.741 --> 00:08:27.750
and they went on
with classes as scheduled.

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:32.071
And those who chose to leave
participated in a citywide student walkout
