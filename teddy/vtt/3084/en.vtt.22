00:10:57.635 --> 00:11:00.207
but they wouldn't really know
why they were protesting.

00:11:00.231 --> 00:11:02.311
And some, including
some students' families,

00:11:02.335 --> 00:11:04.692
were really angry
that the school hadn't done more

00:11:04.716 --> 00:11:06.118
to prevent them from leaving.

00:11:06.142 --> 00:11:10.374
And all of those fears that adults have
about getting this stuff wrong --

00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:12.848
all of those fears make total sense.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.801
But despite those fears,

00:11:15.825 --> 00:11:20.467
we have got to prove to our students
that we will listen to their voices

00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:23.422
and that they do have the power
to effect change.

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:27.350
It's our responsibility
to equip our students

00:11:27.374 --> 00:11:29.892
with the tools and the skills
that they need

00:11:29.916 --> 00:11:32.181
to insist on a more equitable world --
