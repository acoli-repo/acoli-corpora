In 1976, one of those kids
who participated in the Soweto uprising,

00:10:34.424 --> 00:10:37.067
he said that that event
represented divorce

00:10:37.091 --> 00:10:39.117
between black children and their families,

00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:41.721
because their families
had grown up under apartheid,

00:10:41.745 --> 00:10:43.984
and they knew how dangerous
it was to speak out.

00:10:44.008 --> 00:10:46.435
They wanted their kids
to lay low and stay safe.

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:48.429
And when our kids threatened to walk out,

00:10:48.453 --> 00:10:51.914
a lot of the adults in our community
were really conflicted, too.

00:10:52.515 --> 00:10:55.433
Some of us worried that they might
encounter violence.

00:10:55.457 --> 00:10:57.611
Other people worried
that they would walk out

00:10:57.635 --> 00:11:00.207
but they wouldn't really know
why they were protesting.
