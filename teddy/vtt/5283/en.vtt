On January 17, 1920, six armed men 
robbed a Chicago freight train.

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:15.756
But it wasnâ€™t money they were after.

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:18.996
Less than one hour after spirits 
had become illegal

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:20.433
throughout the United States,

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:24.788
the robbers made off with thousands 
of dollars worth of whiskey.

00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:30.038
It was a first taste of the unintended 
consequences of Prohibition.
