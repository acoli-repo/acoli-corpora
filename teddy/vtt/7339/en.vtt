00:00:01.196 --> 00:00:04.156
Who am I? Who is anyone, really?

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:07.836
When I wake up in the morning
and open my eyes,

00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:09.316
a world appears.

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:11.436
These days, since I've hardly
been anywhere,

00:00:11.476 --> 00:00:12.836
it's a very familiar world:

00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:15.276
there's the wardrobe
beyond the end of the bed,

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:18.116
the shuttered windows
and the shrieking of seagulls,

00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:21.716
which drives Brighton residents
like me absolutely crazy.

00:00:22.596 --> 00:00:26.196
But even more familiar
is the experience of being a self,

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:27.756
of being me,

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:31.596
that glides into existence
at almost the same time.
