00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:04.342
Twelve years ago, I was in the street writing my name

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:06.181
to say, "I exist."

00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:11.174
Then I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:13.531
to say, "They exist."

00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:18.046
From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine,

00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:20.456
the rooftops of Kenya

00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:22.344
to the favelas of Rio,

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:26.087
paper and glue -- as easy as that.

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:28.306
I asked a question last year:

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:30.581
Can art change the world?
