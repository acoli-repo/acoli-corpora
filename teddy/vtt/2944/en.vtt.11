Kédougou first strikes visitors
with its stunning vistas

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.360
and views of the Fouta Djallon Mountains.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.360
Sadly, it is also one of the poorest
regions of Senegal.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.136
Because of desertification
and lack of job prospects,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.200
much of Kédougou's
young population has left.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.176
They chose the deadly path of migration

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.640
in search of "better" opportunities.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.120
Often,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.960
they risk their lives
trying to reach Europe.
