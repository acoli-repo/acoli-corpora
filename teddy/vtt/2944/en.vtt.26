00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:01.360
allowing the producers to focus
on farming rather than processing.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.840
There is untapped
agricultural capacity in the Sahel,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.040
and all it takes
is changing market conditions

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.880
to activate that capacity.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.856
By relieving fonio producers
of manual operations,

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.176
the mill will free up their time

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.360
and remove the production bottleneck
that limits their output.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.496
And there are other benefits as well

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.920
in using Sahel land for agriculture.
