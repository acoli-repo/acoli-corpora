How can we turn its current status
of "country-people food"

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.360
into a world-class crop?

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.136
Last year,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.576

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.976
the US's largest natural food store chain,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.200
to carry fonio.
