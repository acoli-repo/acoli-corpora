00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.200
to carry fonio.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.896
And we got a large
American ingredient importer

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.936
interested enough
to send a team of executives

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.776
to West Africa with us

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.280
to explore the supply chain's viability.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.336
We found ourselves
observing manual operations

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.696
in remote locations

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.680
with few controls over quality.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.760
So we started focusing
on processing issues.
