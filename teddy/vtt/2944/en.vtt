00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.896
I was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.936
and through a combination
of accidents and cosmic justice,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.856
became a chef in the US.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.656
(Laughter)

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.280
When I first arrived in New York,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.576
I began working in these restaurants --
different types of restaurants --

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.296
from French bistro to Italian,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.240
global ethnic to modern American.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.536
At the time,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.280
New York was already well-established
as a food capital of the world.
