Traditional processing
is laborious and time-consuming,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.080
especially when compared to other grains.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.720
Well, thankfully, technology has evolved.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.136
And there are now machines

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.776
that can process fonio
in a more efficient way.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.176
And as a matter of fact,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.816
a few years ago,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.296
Sanoussi Diakité,

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.576
a Senegalese engineer,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.816
won a Rolex prize

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.440
for his invention of the first
mechanized fonio processor.
