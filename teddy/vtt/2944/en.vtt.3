00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.536
I wanted to give back, both to New York --

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.616
the city that allowed me
the opportunity to follow my calling --

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.320
but also to my origins
and ancestors in Senegal.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.576
I wanted to contribute
to that universal civilization

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.120
Senghor had described.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.456
But I didn't know how to make
a measurable impact

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.840
as a cook and writer.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.976
While I was writing my first cookbook,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.520
I often traveled to different regions
of Senegal for research.
