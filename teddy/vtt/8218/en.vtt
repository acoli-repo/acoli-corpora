00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.709
My uncle came home
from prison when I was 15,

00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:07.128
but a few months later he was sent back.

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:12.633
The whole experience made me pay attention
to the criminal justice system

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:13.968
for the first time.

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:16.888
I started talking
to researchers, advocates

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.600
and eventually to the people
who run the US prison system.

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:23.853
What surprised me most
in those conversations

00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:26.022
was something they all agreed on.

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:30.109
Everyone, the left, the right,
advocates, agencies
