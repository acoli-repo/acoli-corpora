00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.126
I was born and raised in Sierra Leone,

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:07.371
a small and very beautiful country

00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:09.076
in West Africa,

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:11.980
a country rich both in physical resources

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.312
and creative talent.

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:16.274
However, Sierra Leone is infamous

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:18.688
for a decade-long rebel war in the '90s

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:21.778
when entire villages were burnt down.

00:00:21.778 --> 00:00:25.990
An estimated 8,000 men, women and children

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.256
had their arms and legs amputated during this time.
