00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:32.229
than conventional prostheses.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.471
I used magnetic resonance imaging

00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:38.360
to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.464
then use finite element modeling to better predict

00:02:41.464 --> 00:02:43.407
the internal stresses and strains

00:02:43.407 --> 00:02:45.405
on the normal forces,

00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:50.018
and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture.

00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:53.432
We use a 3D printer to create

00:02:53.432 --> 00:02:57.248
a multi-material prosthetic socket

00:02:57.248 --> 00:02:59.714
which relieves pressure where needed

00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:03.246
on the anatomy of the patient.
