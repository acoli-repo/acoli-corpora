If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable,

00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:03.265
you will not use your leg,

00:02:03.265 --> 00:02:07.145
and that is just simply unacceptable in our age.

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:09.565
So one day, when I met professor Hugh Herr

00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:11.090
about two and a half years ago,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.577
and he asked me if I knew 
how to solve this problem,

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:15.677
I said, "No, not yet,

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:18.287
but I would love to figure it out."

00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:21.577
And so, for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab,

00:02:21.577 --> 00:02:24.470
I designed custom prosthetic sockets

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.377
quickly and cheaply

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:29.232
that are more comfortable

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:32.229
than conventional prostheses.
