00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:03.246
on the anatomy of the patient.

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:06.177
In short, we're using data

00:03:06.177 --> 00:03:09.976
to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply.

00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:11.772
In a recent trial we just wrapped up

00:03:11.772 --> 00:03:13.534
at the Media Lab,

00:03:13.534 --> 00:03:16.044
one of our patients, a U.S. veteran

00:03:16.044 --> 00:03:18.970
who has been an amputee for about 20 years

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.052
and worn dozens of legs,

00:03:22.052 --> 00:03:26.140
said of one of our printed parts,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.544
"It's so soft, it's like walking on pillows,

00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:32.480
and it's effing sexy."
