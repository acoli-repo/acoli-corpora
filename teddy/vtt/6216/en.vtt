T. Morgan Dixon: I would like to tell you
about the most powerful woman

00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:05.728
you've never heard of.

00:00:07.017 --> 00:00:09.102
This is Septima Clark.

00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:10.910
Remember her name: Septima Clark.

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:14.671
Dr. King called her the "the architect
of the civil rights movement,"

00:00:14.695 --> 00:00:17.362
because she created something
called Citizenship Schools.

00:00:17.386 --> 00:00:20.602
And in those schools, she taught
ordinary women the practical skills

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:23.810
to go back into their communities
and teach people to read.

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:25.882
Because if they could read,

00:00:25.906 --> 00:00:27.056
they could vote.

00:00:27.383 --> 00:00:29.698
Well, these women took
those organizing skills,

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:32.795
and they became some of the most
legendary civil rights activists
