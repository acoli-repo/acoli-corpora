Most people have heard the word "gerrymandering" once or twice,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.000
probably during a presidential election.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.215
What exactly is gerrymandering?

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:29.649
Essentially, it's the process of giving one political party an advantage over another political party

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.631
by redrawing district lines.
