Hi, I’m Derek Sarno.

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:03.996
I'm a vegan chef.

00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:07.396
I specialize in bringing mushrooms
and veg to the center plate

00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:09.716
by unleashing the mighty
flavors of plants.

00:00:10.036 --> 00:00:11.916
I cofounded a plant-based food company

00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:13.116
called Wicked Kitchen,

00:00:13.116 --> 00:00:14.716
and I lead plant-based innovation

00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:17.516
at one of the world's largest
grocery retailers.

00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:20.276
In case you’re wondering
what plant-based and vegan means,

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:21.476
it's super simple.

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:24.716
Vegan and plant-based foods
are entirely free from animals

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:26.476
and from their byproducts.

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:28.796
Think no animals harmed nor killed.

00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:33.916
No meat, no fish, no dairy milk
or eggs are used at all.
