There's a group of people in Kenya.

00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:09.085
People cross oceans to go see them.

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:11.119
These people are tall.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.626
They jump high. They wear red.

00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:17.738
And they kill lions.

00:00:17.738 --> 00:00:20.795
You might be wondering, who are these people?

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.389
These are the Maasais.

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:29.291
And you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them.

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:33.651
The Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors.
