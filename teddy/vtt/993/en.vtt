Many believe driving is an activity

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
solely reserved for those who can see.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
was thought to be an impossible task, until now.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
by building a vehicle for the visually impaired.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So before I talk about this car for the blind,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
called the DARPA Urban Challenge.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now this was about building a robotic car

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that can drive itself.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You press start, nobody touches anything,
