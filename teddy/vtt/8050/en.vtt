Successful companies
don't invest in talent

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.711
so the competition can hire them away.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.674
They keep their people motivated
to grow with the company

00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:15.094
and inspire those around them
to lean in with them.

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:18.765
I believe that talent retention,

00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:22.351
the same tool used to grow
successful companies,

00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:27.440
can be used to build great neighborhoods
for the people born and raised in them.
