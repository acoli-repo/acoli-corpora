00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.824
the initial impact of Khrushchev's
apparent words

00:01:00.824 --> 00:01:05.973
put the world on a path
that could have led to nuclear armageddon.

00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:10.046
So now, given the complexities of language
and cultural exchange,

00:01:10.046 --> 00:01:14.076
how does this sort of thing
not happen all the time?

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:18.387
Much of the answer lies with the skill
and training of interpreters

00:01:18.387 --> 00:01:21.326
to overcome language barriers.

00:01:21.326 --> 00:01:25.270
For most of history, interpretation
was mainly done consecutively,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.441
with speakers and interpreters making
pauses to allow each other to speak.
