At some point, a second language
is introduced.

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:41.510
Practicing in this way creates new neural
pathways in the interpreter's brain,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.325
and the constant effort of reformulation

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:49.167

They may resort to acronyms 
to shorten long names,
