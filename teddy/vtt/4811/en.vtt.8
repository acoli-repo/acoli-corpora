00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:00.440
looking up words,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.163
and tracking down pertinent information.

00:04:03.163 --> 00:04:07.263
Because simultaneous interpretation
requires intense concentration,

00:04:07.263 --> 00:04:10.665
every 30 minutes, the pair switches roles.

00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:14.769
Success is heavily dependent 
on skillful collaboration.

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.459
Language is complex,

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.041
and when abstract or nuanced concepts
get lost in translation,

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:24.571
the consequences may be catastrophic.

00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:31.105
As Margaret Atwood famously noted,
"War is what happens when language fails."
