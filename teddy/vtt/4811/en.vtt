In 1956, during a diplomatic 
reception in Moscow,

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:15.475
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev
told Western Bloc ambassadors,

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:17.468
"My vas pokhoronim!"

00:00:17.468 --> 00:00:21.041
His interpreter rendered that
into English as,

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.483
"We will bury you!"

00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:26.535
This statement sent shockwaves
through the Western world,

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.671
heightening the tension between
the Soviet Union and the US

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.471
who were in the thick of the Cold War.
