00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.441
with speakers and interpreters making
pauses to allow each other to speak.

00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:33.069
But after the advent of radio technology,

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.698
a new simultaneous interpretations system
was developed in the wake of World War II.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.608
In the simultaneous mode

00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:44.071
interpreters instantaneously 
translate a speaker's words

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.822
into a microphone while he speaks.

00:01:46.822 --> 00:01:50.106
Without pauses, those in the audience
can choose the language

00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:52.295
in which they want to follow.

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:54.727
On the surface, it all looks seamless,

00:01:54.727 --> 00:01:56.256
but behind the scenes,

00:01:56.256 --> 00:01:58.480
human interpreters work incessantly


00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.260
to ensure every idea 
gets across as intended.
