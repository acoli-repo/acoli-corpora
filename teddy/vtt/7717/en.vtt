On September 1st, 1859, miners following 
the Colorado gold rush woke up

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.385
to another sunny day.

00:00:14.927 --> 00:00:16.220
Or so they thought.

00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:20.850
To their surprise,
they soon discovered it was actually 1 am;

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.314
and the sky wasnâ€™t lit by the Sun,
but rather by brilliant drapes of light.

00:00:26.314 --> 00:00:29.275
The blazing glow could be seen as far 
as the Caribbean,

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:33.863
leading people in many regions to believe
that nearby cities had caught fire.
