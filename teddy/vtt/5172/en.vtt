00:00:07.484 --> 00:00:10.461
This is the tale of two ancient cities

00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:14.071
and the trees 
that determined their destinies.

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:19.930
In 3,000 BC Uruk was more densely 
populated than modern day New York City.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.802
This crowded capital had to continually
expand their irrigation system

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:26.902
to feed its growing population.

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:33.784
2,500 years later in Sri Lanka, the city 
of Anuradhapura had a similar problem.
