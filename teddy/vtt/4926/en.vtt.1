00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.930
You bravely step forward
and demand it let them go.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.470
The troll laughs.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.370
“If you’re such a
fan of paradoxes,” it says,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.040
“then I’ll make you an offer.


00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.440
If you say something true,
I’ll release all these creatures."

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.640
You’re about to say, “You are a troll,”

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.060
but before you can,
the troll grabs your brother.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.480
“If you say something false,”
he continues,


00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.890
“then I’ll release your brother."

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.792
Your statement can 
only be a single sentence.

00:00:56.792 --> 00:01:01.452
And as you can see,
I hate paradoxes more than anything.
