00:02:29.422 --> 00:02:32.162
and would never willingly create one.

00:02:32.162 --> 00:02:35.952
So his only option 
is for the statement to be true.

00:02:35.952 --> 00:02:38.132
If “you will free my brother” is true,

00:02:38.132 --> 00:02:40.462
then the troll 
has to release your brother.

00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:44.872
And by its own rules, the troll
has to free the creatures as well,

00:02:44.872 --> 00:02:47.382
since you said a true statement.


00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:51.052
By wielding just 5 words
like a logical scalpel,


00:02:51.052 --> 00:02:54.502
you’ve forced the troll
to free all its prisoners.

00:02:54.502 --> 00:02:56.492
As the troll stomps off in anger,

00:02:56.492 --> 00:02:59.922
the paradoxes cheer you
for winning them their freedom,

00:02:59.922 --> 00:03:03.389
and promise to lead you to the
treasure at the top of the stairs.
