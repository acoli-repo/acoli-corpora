00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:03.762
the troll could respond, “that’s false… 
I’m only going to free your brother.”

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:07.262
Similarly, if you said, “You will free 
the paradoxes,”

00:02:07.262 --> 00:02:11.442
the troll could say, “That’s true,” 
and free the paradoxes.

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:16.462
But watch what happens if you say,
“You will free my brother.”

00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:18.202
The statement can’t be false,

00:02:18.202 --> 00:02:21.442
because if it were, the troll, 
by its own rules,

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:23.452
would have to free your brother.


00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:27.432
That would make the statement
paradoxically true and false.


00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:29.422
But the troll hates paradoxes

00:02:29.422 --> 00:02:32.162
and would never willingly create one.
