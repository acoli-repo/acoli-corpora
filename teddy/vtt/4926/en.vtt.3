00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:30.972
but incredibly, you can say something

00:01:30.972 --> 00:01:34.432
that will force the troll to
release all its prisoners.

00:01:34.432 --> 00:01:37.452
This is an example of coercive logic,


00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:42.462
invented by the great logician 
and puzzle creator Raymond Smullyan.

00:01:42.462 --> 00:01:45.922
The trick Smullyan came up with
involves saying a statement

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:51.152
whose truth or falseness depends on
what you want the troll to do.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:54.242
Your statement still
has to be carefully crafted.


00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:56.292
For example, if you were to say,

00:01:56.292 --> 00:01:59.102
“You are going to free the 
creatures and my brother,”

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:03.762
the troll could respond, “that’s false… 
I’m only going to free your brother.”
