00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:00.694
then stop.

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:03.659
A voice announces 
that she must enter a code

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.166
consisting of three positive whole numbers
in ascending order,

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.466
so the second number is greater than
or equal to the first,

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:15.254
and the third is greater than
or equal to the second.

00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:17.432
She may ask for up to three clues,

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:19.026
but if she makes a wrong guess,

00:01:19.026 --> 00:01:20.966
or says anything else,

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.754
she'll be thrown back into the dungeon.

00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:30.848
For the first clue, the voice says
the product of the three numbers is 36.
