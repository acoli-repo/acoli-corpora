But each exit is blocked by 
an electric barrier

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:34.506
with a combination keypad.

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:39.541
You learn that one of you will be allowed
to try to escape by passing a challenge

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:44.852
while everyone else will be fed to
the mutant salamanders the next morning.

00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:48.631
With her perfect logical reasoning,
Zara is the obvious choice.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:54.466
You hand her a concealed audio transmitter
so that the rest of you can listen along.

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.058
As Zara is led away,

00:00:56.058 --> 00:00:58.942
you hear her footsteps echo 
through one of the hallways,

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:00.694
then stop.
