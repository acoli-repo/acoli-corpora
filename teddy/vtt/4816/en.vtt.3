00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:30.848
For the first clue, the voice says
the product of the three numbers is 36.

00:01:30.848 --> 00:01:33.092
When Zara asks for the second clue,

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.092
it tells her the sum of the numbers

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:39.876
is the same as the number 
of the hallway she entered.

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:41.682
There's a long silence.

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:44.317
You're sure Zara remembers 
the hallway number,

00:01:44.317 --> 00:01:46.809
but there's no way for you to know it,

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:50.002
and she can't say it outloud.

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:53.422
If Zara could enter the passcode 
at this point, she would,

00:01:53.422 --> 00:01:57.215
but instead, she asks for the third clue,

00:01:57.215 --> 00:02:01.811
and the voice announces that the largest
number appears only once
