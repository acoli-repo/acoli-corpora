00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:33.829
You're worried about the fact that you
don't know Zara's hallway number,

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.140

00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:51.313
Even though you don't know which number
you're looking for,

00:02:51.313 --> 00:02:55.782

That's when it hits you.

00:02:57.564 --> 00:03:00.562
All but two of the sums are unique,
