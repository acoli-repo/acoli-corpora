00:02:57.564 --> 00:03:00.562
All but two of the sums are unique,

00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:03.532
and if the hallway number had matched
any of these,

00:03:03.532 --> 00:03:07.259
Zara would have known the correct
combination right then and there

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.687
without asking for the third clue.

00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:11.501
Since she did ask for the clue,

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.356
the hallway number must have 
matched the only sum

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:17.104
that appears more than once in the list:

00:03:17.104 --> 00:03:18.478
thirteen.

00:03:18.478 --> 00:03:22.391
But which of the two combinations
that add up to thirteen is correct:

00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:23.539
1,6,6,

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.433
or 2,2,9?

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:27.594
That's where the third clue comes in.

00:03:27.594 --> 00:03:30.465
Since it tells us that the largest
number must be unique,
