and risk being seen as rude.

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:04.522
So if you're ever working as a translator

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:07.617
and come across this sentence
without any context:

00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:09.167
"You and you, no, not you,

00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.706
you, your job is to translate
'you' for yourselves" ...

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.134
Well, good luck.

00:03:14.698 --> 00:03:17.822
And to the volunteer community
who will be translating this video

00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:19.205
into multiple languages:

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:21.649
Sorry about that!
