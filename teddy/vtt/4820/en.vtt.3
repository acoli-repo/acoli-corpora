In languages like Hausa or Korana,

00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:33.676
the "you" form depends on
the listener's gender.

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:37.778
In many more, it depends on
whether they are one or many,

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:40.469
such as with German "Du" or "ihr."

00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:42.220
Even in English,

00:01:42.244 --> 00:01:46.250
some dialects use words
like "y'all" or "youse" the same way.

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:49.560
Some plural forms, like the French "vous"

00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:50.900
and Russian "Вы"

00:01:50.924 --> 00:01:53.110
are also used for a single person

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:56.557
to show that the addressee
is that much more important,

00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:57.913
much like the royal "we."

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.344
And a few languages
even have a specific form
