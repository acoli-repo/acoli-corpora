00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.042
and "ustedes" is the unisex formal plural.

00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:31.738
Phew!

00:02:31.762 --> 00:02:32.913
After all that,

00:02:32.937 --> 00:02:34.190
it may come as a relief

00:02:34.214 --> 00:02:37.238
that some languages often leave out
the second person pronoun.

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:40.386
In languages like Romanian and Portuguese,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.616
the pronoun can be dropped from sentences

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.036
because it's clearly implied
by the way the verbs are conjugated.

00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:50.040
And in languages like Korean,
Thai, and Chinese,

00:02:50.064 --> 00:02:53.189
pronouns can be dropped
without any grammatical hints.

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.378
Speakers often would rather have

00:02:55.402 --> 00:02:58.124
the listener guess
the pronoun from context

00:02:58.148 --> 00:03:01.846
than use the wrong one
and risk being seen as rude.
