00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:31.268
it's often impossible
to accurately translate "you"

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:35.293
without knowing a lot more about
the situation where it's being said.

00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:40.386
To start with, how familiar are you
with the person you're talking to?

00:00:40.723 --> 00:00:44.108
Many cultures have different levels
of formality.

00:00:44.132 --> 00:00:45.308
A close friend,

00:00:45.332 --> 00:00:47.267
someone much older or much younger,

00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:48.441
a stranger,

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:49.621
a boss.

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:52.161
These all may be slightly
different "you's."

00:00:53.097 --> 00:00:56.248
In many languages, the pronoun
reflects these differences

00:00:56.272 --> 00:00:59.486
through what's known
as the T–V distinction.
