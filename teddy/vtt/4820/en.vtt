Which is the hardest word
to translate in this sentence?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.390
"Know" is easy to translate.

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.975
"Pep rally" doesn't have a direct analog

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:21.794
but can be approximated.

00:00:21.818 --> 00:00:26.326
But the hardest word there
is actually one of the smallest: "you."

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.944
As simple as it seems,

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:31.268
