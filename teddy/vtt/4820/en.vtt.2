In French, for example,

00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:04.855
you would say "tu" when talking
to your friend at school,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.935
but "vous" when addressing your teacher.

00:01:07.453 --> 00:01:09.922
Even English once had something similar.

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:12.366
Remember the old-timey "thou?"

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.367
Ironically, it was actually
the informal pronoun

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:16.819
for people you're close with,

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.945
while "you" was the formal
and polite version.

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:21.611
That distinction was lost

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:24.396
when the English decided
to just be polite all the time.

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:28.449
But the difficulty in translating
"you" doesn't end there.

00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:31.007
In languages like Hausa or Korana,
