00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:03.997
So, last month, the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced

00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:05.746
that it is going out of print

00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:09.571
after 244 years, which made me nostalgic,

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:15.218
because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:16.467
back when I was a kid,

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:17.810
maybe 12 years old.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.450
And I wondered if I could update that game,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.466
not just for modern methods,

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.170
but for the modern me.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.306
So I tried.

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:26.613
I went to an online encyclopedia,

00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:29.371
Wikipedia, and I entered the term "Earth."

00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:32.037
You can start anywhere, this time I chose Earth.
