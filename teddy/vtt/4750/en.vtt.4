00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.987
some of them are carried back with a belly
full of dye into the lymph nodes

00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:06.950
while others remain in the dermis.

00:02:06.974 --> 00:02:08.877
With no way to dispose of the pigment,

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.730
the dyes inside them remain
visible through the skin.

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:14.722
Some of the ink particles
are also suspended

00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:17.053
in the gel-like matrix of the dermis,

00:02:17.077 --> 00:02:21.379
while others are engulfed
by dermal cells called fibroblasts.

00:02:22.053 --> 00:02:25.613
Initially, ink is deposited
into the epidermis as well,

00:02:25.637 --> 00:02:29.390
but as the skin heals, the damaged
epidermal cells are shed

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:32.267
and replaced by new, dye-free cells
