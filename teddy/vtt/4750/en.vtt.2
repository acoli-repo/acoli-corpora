Throughout history, different cultures

00:01:01.574 --> 00:01:03.760
have used various methods
to accomplish this.

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:05.977
But the first modern tattooing machine

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.374
was modeled after Thomas Edison's
engraving machine

00:01:09.398 --> 00:01:10.614
and ran on electricity.

00:01:11.532 --> 00:01:13.427
Tattooing machines used today

00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:17.303
insert tiny needles,
loaded with dye, into the skin

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:20.655
at a frequency of 50
to 3,000 times per minute.

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.347
The needles punch through the epidermis,

00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:26.947
allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis,

00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:32.828
which is composed of collagen fibers,
nerves, glands, blood vessels and more.
