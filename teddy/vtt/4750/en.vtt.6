00:02:59.254 --> 00:03:01.837
But with time, tattoos do fade naturally

00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:05.192
as the body reacts
to the alien pigment particles,

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:07.490
slowly breaking them down
to be carried off

00:03:07.514 --> 00:03:09.558
by the immune system's macrophages.

00:03:10.203 --> 00:03:14.108
Ultraviolet radiation can also
contribute to this pigment breakdown,

00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:16.612
though it can be mitigated
by the use of sunblock.

00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:19.597
But since the dermal cells
are relatively stable,

00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:23.430
much of the ink will remain deep
in the skin for a person's whole life.

00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:28.870
But if tattoos are embedded in your skin
for life, is there any way to erase them?

00:03:28.894 --> 00:03:30.011
Technically, yes.
