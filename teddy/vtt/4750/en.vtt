Tattoos have often been presented

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:12.702
in popular media as either marks
of the dangerous and deviant

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:14.663
or trendy youth fads.

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:17.001
But while tattoo styles come and go,

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.743
and their meaning has differed
greatly across cultures,

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:23.088

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:27.365
Decorative skin markings have
been discovered in human remains

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:28.899
all over the world,

with the oldest found on a Peruvian
mummy dating back to 6,000 BCE.
