and replaced by new, dye-free cells

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:35.522
with the topmost layer peeling
off like a heeling sunburn.

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:39.564
Blistering or crusting is not typically
seen with professional tattoos

00:02:39.588 --> 00:02:43.739
and complete epidermal
regeneration requires 2-4 weeks,

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.226
during which excess
sun exposure and swimming

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.229
should be avoided to prevent fading.

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:52.541
Dermal cells, however,
remain in place until they die.

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:57.306
When they do, they are taken up,
ink and all, by younger cells nearby,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.230
so the ink stays where it is.

00:02:59.254 --> 00:03:01.837
But with time, tattoos do fade naturally
