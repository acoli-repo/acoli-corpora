Technically, yes.

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:33.809
Today, a laser is used
to penetrate the epidermis

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:37.954
and blast apart underlying pigment
colors of various wavelengths,

00:03:37.978 --> 00:03:40.054
black being the easiest to target.

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:44.109
The laser beam breaks the ink globules
into smaller particles

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:46.943
that can then be cleared away
by the macrophages.

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.638
But some color inks are harder
to remove than others,

00:03:50.662 --> 00:03:52.494
and there could be complications.

00:03:52.518 --> 00:03:56.656
For this reason, removing a tattoo
is still more difficult than getting one,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.905
but not impossible.

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:01.367
So a single tattoo may
not truly last forever,
