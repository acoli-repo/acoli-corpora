00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.209
And I have a question:
"Well, what do you mean?

00:06:00.233 --> 00:06:01.677
How does it apply over here?"

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:03.776
And you answer my question.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.509
Now, suppose at the end of the day,

00:06:05.533 --> 00:06:07.643
I've objected, I've questioned,

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:10.263
I've raised all sorts of counter
counter-considerations

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:13.876
and in every case you've responded
to my satisfaction.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.543
And so at the end of the day, I say,

00:06:16.567 --> 00:06:19.900
"You know what? I guess you're right: P."

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.843
So, I have a new belief.

00:06:22.867 --> 00:06:24.280
And it's not just any belief;

00:06:24.304 --> 00:06:30.600
it's well-articulated, examined --
it's a battle-tested belief.
