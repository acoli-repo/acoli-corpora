00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:00.609
arguments that are right on target.

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:03.809
We want to have our defenses up
and our strategies all in order.

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:06.409
We want killer arguments.

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:08.430
That's the kind of argument we want.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.609
It is the dominant way
of thinking about arguments.

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:13.243
When I'm talking about arguments,

00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:16.100
that's probably what you thought of,
the adversarial model.

00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:18.942
But the war metaphor,

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:21.709
the war paradigm or model
for thinking about arguments,

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:24.700
has, I think, deforming effects
on how we argue.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.067
First, it elevates tactics over substance.

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:31.109
You can take a class
in logic, argumentation.
