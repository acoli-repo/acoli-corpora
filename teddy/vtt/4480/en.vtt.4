Is that a nice way to treat
another human being,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.476
try and make them think something
they don't want to think?

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.175
Well, my answer is going to make reference
to three models for arguments.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.943
The first model -- let's call it
the dialectical model --

00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:13.876
is we think of arguments as war;
you know what that's like --

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.609
a lot of screaming and shouting
and winning and losing.

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:18.776
That's not a very helpful
model for arguing,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.543
but it's a pretty common
and entrenched model for arguing.

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:24.809
But there's a second model for arguing:
arguments as proofs.

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:26.909
Think of a mathematician's argument.

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:29.709
Here's my argument.
Does it work? Is it any good?

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:34.209
Are the premises warranted?
Are the inferences valid?
