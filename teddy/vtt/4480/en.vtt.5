00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:34.209
Are the premises warranted?
Are the inferences valid?

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:36.776
Does the conclusion follow
from the premises?

No opposition, no adversariality --

not necessarily any arguing
in the adversarial sense.

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:46.909
But there's a third model to keep in mind

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:48.909
that I think is going to be very helpful,

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:53.943
and that is arguments as performances,
arguments in front of an audience.

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:56.909

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:59.076
trying to convince
the audience of something.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.576
But there's another twist on this model
that I really think is important;
