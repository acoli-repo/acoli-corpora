00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.576
But there's another twist on this model
that I really think is important;

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.609
namely, that when we argue
before an audience,

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:10.709
sometimes the audience has
a more participatory role in the argument;

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:15.243
that is, arguments are also
[performances] in front of juries,

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:18.043
who make a judgment and decide the case.

00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:19.876
Let's call this the rhetorical model,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.609
where you have to tailor your argument
to the audience at hand.

00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:26.276
You know, presenting a sound, well-argued,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.676
tight argument in English
before a francophone audience

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.300
just isn't going to work.
