00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:31.109
You can take a class
in logic, argumentation.

00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:32.843
You learn all about the subterfuges

00:04:32.867 --> 00:04:35.743
that people use to try and win
arguments -- the false steps.

00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:38.943
It magnifies the us-versus
them aspect of it.

00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:42.376
It makes it adversarial; it's polarizing.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.209
And the only foreseeable outcomes
are triumph -- glorious triumph --

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:51.309
or abject, ignominious defeat.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:53.076
I think those are deforming effects,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.943
and worst of all, it seems
to prevent things like negotiation

00:04:56.967 --> 00:05:01.667
or deliberation or compromise
or collaboration.
