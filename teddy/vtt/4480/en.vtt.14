00:06:57.867 --> 00:07:02.676
The war metaphor forces us into thinking
that you're the winner and I lost,

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.743
even though I gained.

00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:07.043
And there's something wrong
with that picture.

00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:09.776
And that's the picture
I really want to change if we can.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.149
So, how can we find ways

00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:16.733
to make arguments
yield something positive?

00:07:17.633 --> 00:07:20.633
What we need is new
exit strategies for arguments.

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:24.243
But we're not going to have
new exit strategies for arguments

00:07:24.267 --> 00:07:27.576
until we have new entry
approaches to arguments.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.600
We need to think
of new kinds of arguments.
