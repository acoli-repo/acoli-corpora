00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:30.243
What do I win if I convince you

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:32.696
that utilitarianism isn't really
the right framework

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.476
for thinking about ethical theories?

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.376
What do we win when we win an argument?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.743
Even before that,

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:39.009
what does it matter to me

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.976
whether you have this idea
that Kant's theory works

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.176
or Mill is the right ethicist to follow?

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.576
It's no skin off my back

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.767
whether you think functionalism
is a viable theory of mind.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.343
So why do we even try to argue?

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:54.209
Why do we try to convince other people

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:56.409
to believe things
they don't want to believe,

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:58.209
and is that even a nice thing to do?

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.476
Is that a nice way to treat
another human being,
