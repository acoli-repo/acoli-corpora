00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.476
I've gotten better at arguing.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.009
But the more that I argue
and the better I get at arguing,

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:36.333
the more that I lose.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:38.209
And that's a puzzle.

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:41.100
And the other puzzle
is that I'm actually okay with that.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.343
Why is it that I'm okay with losing

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:46.809
and why is it that I think good arguers
are actually better at losing?

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:48.843
Well, there are some other puzzles.

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:50.743
One is: why do we argue?

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:52.409
Who benefits from arguments?

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.776
When I think about arguments,
I'm talking about --

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.643
let's call them academic arguments
or cognitive arguments --

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.509
where something cognitive is at stake:

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.276
Is this proposition true?
Is this theory a good theory?
