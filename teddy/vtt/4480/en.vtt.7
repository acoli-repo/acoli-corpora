00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.300
just isn't going to work.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.443
So we have these models --
argument as war, argument as proof

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:37.847
and argument as performance.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:41.933
Of those three, the argument as war
is the dominant one.

00:03:42.467 --> 00:03:45.076
It dominates how we talk about arguments,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.143
it dominates how we think about arguments,

00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:50.143
and because of that,
it shapes how we argue,

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:51.943
our actual conduct in arguments.

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:53.643
Now, when we talk about arguments,

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.643
we talk in a very militaristic language.

00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:58.909
We want strong arguments,
arguments that have a lot of punch,

00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:00.609
arguments that are right on target.
