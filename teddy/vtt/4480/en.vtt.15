00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.600
We need to think
of new kinds of arguments.

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:33.843
In order to do that, well --

00:07:33.867 --> 00:07:35.533
I don't know how to do that.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.443
That's the bad news.

00:07:37.467 --> 00:07:40.476
The argument-as-war metaphor
is just ... it's a monster.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.895
It's just taken up habitation in our mind,

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:45.366
and there's no magic bullet
that's going to kill it.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.025
There's no magic wand
that's going to make it disappear.

00:07:48.049 --> 00:07:49.309
I don't have an answer.

00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:50.676
But I have some suggestions.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.633
Here's my suggestion:

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.884
If we want to think
of new kinds of arguments,

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:59.567
what we need to do
is think of new kinds of arguers.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.833
So try this:
