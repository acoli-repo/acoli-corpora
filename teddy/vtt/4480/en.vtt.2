Is this proposition true?
Is this theory a good theory?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.776
Is this a viable interpretation
of the data or the text? And so on.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.776
I'm not interested really in arguments
about whose turn it is to do the dishes

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.476
or who has to take out the garbage.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.809
Yeah, we have those arguments, too.

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:17.576
I tend to win those arguments,
because I know the tricks.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.576
But those aren't the important arguments.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.376

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.267
and here are the things that puzzle me.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:27.743
First, what do good arguers win
when they win an argument?

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:30.243
What do I win if I convince you
