My name is Dan Cohen
and I am an academic, as he said.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.576
And what that means is that I argue.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.243
It's an important part of my life.

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:10.433
And I like to argue.

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:14.109
And I'm not just an academic,
I'm a philosopher,

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:17.076
so I like to think that I'm actually
pretty good at arguing.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.900
But I also like to think
a lot about arguing.

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.843
And in thinking about arguing,
I've come across some puzzles.

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:25.776
And one of the puzzles is that,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.343
as I've been thinking
about arguing over the years --

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:29.776
and it's been decades now --

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.476
I've gotten better at arguing.
