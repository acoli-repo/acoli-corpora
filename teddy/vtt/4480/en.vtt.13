00:06:24.304 --> 00:06:30.600
it's well-articulated, examined --
it's a battle-tested belief.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.960
Great cognitive gain.

00:06:32.984 --> 00:06:34.339
OK, who won that argument?

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.543
Well, the war metaphor
seems to force us into saying you won,

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:42.276
even though I'm the only one
who made any cognitive gain.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.943
What did you gain, cognitively,
from convincing me?

00:06:45.967 --> 00:06:48.943
Sure, you got some pleasure out of it,
maybe your ego stroked,

00:06:48.967 --> 00:06:50.943
maybe you get some professional status

00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:53.543
in the field --
"This guy's a good arguer."

00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:56.543
But just from a cognitive point of view,

00:06:56.567 --> 00:06:57.843
who was the winner?

00:06:57.867 --> 00:07:02.676
The war metaphor forces us into thinking
that you're the winner and I lost,
