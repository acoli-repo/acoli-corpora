00:04:56.967 --> 00:05:01.667
or deliberation or compromise
or collaboration.

00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:05.400
Think about that one -- have you
ever entered an argument thinking,

00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:08.809
"Let's see if we can hash something out,
rather than fight it out.

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:10.743
What can we work out together?"

00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:13.139
I think the argument-as-war metaphor

00:05:13.163 --> 00:05:17.576
inhibits those other kinds
of resolutions to argumentation.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.043
And finally -- this is really
the worst thing --

00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:22.876
arguments don't seem to get us
anywhere; they're dead ends.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.576
They are like roundabouts or traffic jams
or gridlock in conversation.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.867
We don't get anywhere.
