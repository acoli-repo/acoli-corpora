00:08:59.567 --> 00:09:02.343
Now, I lose a lot of arguments.

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:04.776
It takes practice to become a good arguer,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.956
in the sense of being able to benefit
from losing, but fortunately,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.943
I've had many, many colleagues
who have been willing to step up

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.676
and provide that practice for me.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.875
Thank you.

00:09:13.899 --> 00:09:17.967
