On sunny days, 
the Roman citizens of Ostia

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:14.788
could be found on a long stone bench
near the Forum.

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:18.663
Friends and neighbors exchanged 
news and gossip

00:00:18.663 --> 00:00:22.704
while simultaneously attending
to more... urgent business.

00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:27.038
These public latrines could sit
up to 20 Romans at a time,

00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:29.663
draining waste in water conduits below.

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:35.412
Today, most cultures consider trips to the
restroom to be a more private occasion.
