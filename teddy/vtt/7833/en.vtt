Even after writing eleven books 
and winning several prestigious awards,

00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:15.491
Maya Angelou couldn’t escape 
the nagging doubt

00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:19.685
that she hadn’t really earned 
her accomplishments.

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:22.592
Albert Einstein experienced 
something similar:

00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:25.966
he described himself 
as an “involuntary swindler”

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:29.535
whose work didn’t deserve 
as much attention as it had received.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:33.374
Accomplishments at the level 
of Angelou’s or Einstein’s are rare,
