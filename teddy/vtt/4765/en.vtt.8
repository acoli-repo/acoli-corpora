00:03:59.227 --> 00:04:01.737
and suffer from higher accident rates,

00:04:01.737 --> 00:04:04.913
they would be less successful
in a purely cooperative world,

00:04:04.913 --> 00:04:08.251
eventually disappearing
from the population.

00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:10.251
So by correctly predicting
the distribution

00:04:10.275 --> 00:04:12.846
of left-handed people
in the general population,

00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:15.653
as well as matching data
from various sports,

00:04:15.653 --> 00:04:16.699
the model indicates

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.499
that the persistence of lefties
as a small but stable minority

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:22.458
reflects an equilibrium

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:24.990
that comes from competitive
and cooperative effects

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.071
playing out simultaneously over time.

00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:29.738
And the most intriguing thing

00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:33.477
is what the numbers can tell us
about various populations.
