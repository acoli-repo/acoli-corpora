00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:03.434
a recent mathematical model

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:06.899
suggests that the actual ratio
reflects a balance

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.181
between competitive and cooperative
pressures on human evolution.

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:13.489
The benefits of being left-handed

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.409
are clearest in activities
involving an opponent,

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.205
like combat or competitive sports.

00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:25.285
For example, about 50% of top hitters
in baseball have been left-handed.

00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:26.286
Why?

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.278
Think of it as a surprise advantage.

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:31.584
Because lefties are a minority
to begin with,
