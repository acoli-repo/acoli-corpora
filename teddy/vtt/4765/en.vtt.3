00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:31.947
If your father was left-handed
but your mother was right-handed,

00:01:31.947 --> 00:01:36.063
you have a 17% chance
of being born left-handed,

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:39.769
while two righties will have
a left-handed child only 10% of the time.

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:43.678
Handedness seems to be determined
by a roll of the dice,

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.811
but the odds are set by your genes.

00:01:46.354 --> 00:01:48.077
All of this implies there's a reason

00:01:48.077 --> 00:01:51.582
that evolution has produced
this small proportion of lefties,

00:01:51.582 --> 00:01:53.821
and maintained it
over the course of millennia.

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:56.304
And while there have been several theories

00:01:56.304 --> 00:01:59.830
attempting to explain why handedness
exists in the first place,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.928
or why most people are right-handed,
