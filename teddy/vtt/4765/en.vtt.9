00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:33.477
is what the numbers can tell us
about various populations.

00:04:33.477 --> 00:04:37.457
From the skewed distribution of pawedness
in cooperative animals,

00:04:37.457 --> 00:04:39.666
to the slightly larger
percentage of lefties

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:42.592
in competitive hunter-gatherer societies,

00:04:42.592 --> 00:04:47.636
we may even find that the answers
to some puzzles of early human evolution

00:04:47.636 --> 00:04:49.639
are already in our hands.
