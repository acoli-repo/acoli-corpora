00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:31.584
Because lefties are a minority
to begin with,

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:34.220
both right-handed
and left-handed competitors

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.846
will spend most of their time
encountering

00:02:36.846 --> 00:02:39.679
and practicing against righties.

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.223
So when the two face each other,

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:45.430
the left-hander will be better prepared
against this right-handed opponent,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.577
while the righty will be thrown off.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.897
This fighting hypothesis,

00:02:49.897 --> 00:02:51.699
where an imbalance in the population

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.228
results in an advantage for left-handed
fighters or athletes,

00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:58.787
is an example of negative
frequency-dependent selection.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.599
But according to the principles
of evolution,
