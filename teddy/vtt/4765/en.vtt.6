00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.599
But according to the principles
of evolution,

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.361
groups that have a relative advantage

00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:06.556
tend to grow until
that advantage disappears.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.553
If people were only fighting and competing
throughout human evolution,

00:03:10.553 --> 00:03:14.434
natural selection would lead to more
lefties being the ones that made it

00:03:14.434 --> 00:03:16.014
until there were so many of them,

00:03:16.014 --> 00:03:18.438
that it was no longer a rare asset.

00:03:18.962 --> 00:03:21.094
So in a purely competitive world,

00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:23.731
50% of the population
would be left-handed.

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:29.068
But human evolution has been shaped
by cooperation, as well as competition.

00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:30.223
And cooperative pressure
