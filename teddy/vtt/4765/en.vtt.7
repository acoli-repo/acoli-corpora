And cooperative pressure

00:03:30.223 --> 00:03:33.627
pushes handedness distribution
in the opposite direction.

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:38.449
In golf, where performance
doesn't depend on the opponent,

only 4% of top players are left-handed,

00:03:41.562 --> 00:03:44.620
an example of the wider phenomenon
of tool sharing.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.338

that have shaped society

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:56.945

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.227

00:03:59.227 --> 00:04:01.737
and suffer from higher accident rates,
