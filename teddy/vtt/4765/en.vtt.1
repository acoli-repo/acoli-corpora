00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.838
But if being left-handed is so wrong,

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:32.962
then why does it happen
in the first place?

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.618
Today, about 1/10 of the world's
population are left-handed.

00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:40.127
Archeological evidence shows
that it's been that way

00:00:40.127 --> 00:00:43.400
for as long as 500,000 years,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.216
with about 10% of human remains

00:00:45.216 --> 00:00:49.925
showing the associated differences
in arm length and bone density,

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:54.542
and some ancient tools and artifacts
showing evidence of left-hand use.

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:59.496
And despite what many may think,
handedness is not a choice.

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:04.175
It can be predicted even before birth
based on the fetus' position in the womb.
