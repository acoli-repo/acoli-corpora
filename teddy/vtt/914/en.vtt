Let me share with you today an original discovery.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But I want to tell it to you the way it really happened --

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
not the way I present it in a scientific meeting,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
or the way you'd read it in a scientific paper.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's a story about beyond biomimetics,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to something I'm calling biomutualism.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I define that as an association between biology and another discipline,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
where each discipline reciprocally advances the other,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, in terms of biomimetics,
