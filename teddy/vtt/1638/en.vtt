Tonight, I'm going to try to make the case

00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:07.699
that inviting a loved one, a friend
or even a stranger

00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:10.130
to record a meaningful interview with you

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.536
just might turn out to be one of the most 
important moments in that person's life,

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:17.481
and in yours.

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:20.825
When I was 22 years old,
I was lucky enough to find my calling

00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:23.285
when I fell into making radio stories.

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:25.719
At almost the exact same time,

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:30.688
I found out that my dad,
who I was very, very close to, was gay.
