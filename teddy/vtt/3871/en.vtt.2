00:00:59.944 --> 00:01:06.190
and if we don't, we will end up
with our own survival situation

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.636
here on planet Earth.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:15.668
I have faced head-on these places,

00:01:15.668 --> 00:01:20.196
and to walk across a melting ocean of ice

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:23.330
is without doubt
the most frightening thing

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.117
that's ever happened to me.

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:33.064
Antarctica is such a hopeful place.
