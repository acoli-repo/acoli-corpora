taking out resources from areas
already that have been covered in ice

00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:34.961
for the last 10, 20, 30,000,

00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:38.305
100,000 years.

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:41.578
Can they not join the dots

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:47.940
and think, "Why is the ice
actually melting?"

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.284
This is such an amazing place,

00:02:51.284 --> 00:02:55.138
the Antarctic, and I have worked hard

00:02:55.138 --> 00:03:00.293
for the last 23 years on this mission
