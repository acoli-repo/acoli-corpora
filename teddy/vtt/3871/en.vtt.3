Antarctica is such a hopeful place.

00:01:33.064 --> 00:01:39.695
It is protected by 
the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959.

00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:47.100
In 1991, a 50-year agreement
was entered into

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.855
that stops any exploitation in Antarctica,

00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:57.695
and this agreement could be altered,

00:01:57.695 --> 00:02:03.058
changed, modified, or even abandoned
