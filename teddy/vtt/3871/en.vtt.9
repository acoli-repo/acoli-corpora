00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.353
70 percent of all the world's fresh water.

00:04:34.353 --> 00:04:36.095
We're standing on it.

00:04:36.095 --> 00:04:40.762
This is the power of Antarctica.

00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:44.268
On this journey, we faced
the danger of crevasses,

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:46.566
intense cold,

00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:52.046
so cold that sweat turns
to ice inside your clothing,

00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:53.834
your teeth can crack,

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:55.993
water can freeze in your eyes.

00:04:55.993 --> 00:04:59.058
Let's just say it's a bit chilly.
(Laughter)

00:04:59.058 --> 00:05:03.229
And after 70 desperate days,
we arrive at the South Pole.
