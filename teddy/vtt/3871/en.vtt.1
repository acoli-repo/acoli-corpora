00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:33.201
Now, I am not an explorer.

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:36.753
I'm not an environmentalist.

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:40.282
I'm actually just a survivor,

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:45.851
and these photographs
that I'm showing you here are dangerous.

00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:51.976
They are the ice melt
of the South and North Poles.

00:00:51.976 --> 00:00:53.516
And ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:59.944
we need to listen to what
these places are telling us,

00:00:59.944 --> 00:01:06.190
and if we don't, we will end up
with our own survival situation
