To succeed at something is often harder
than actually making it happen.

00:08:04.412 --> 00:08:08.525
I was empty, lonely,
financially destroyed.

00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:10.870
I was without hope,

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.585
but hope came in the form
of the great Jacques Cousteau,

00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:19.981
and he inspired me to take on 
the 2041 mission.

00:08:19.981 --> 00:08:23.153
Being Jacques, he gave me
clear instructions:

00:08:23.153 --> 00:08:27.550
Engage the world leaders,
talk to industry and business,

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.489
and above all, Rob, inspire young people,
