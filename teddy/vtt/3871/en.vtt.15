00:07:27.474 --> 00:07:32.064
his heel dropped off 
from frostbite 200 klicks out.

00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:34.231
He must keep going, he does,

00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:39.061
and after 60 days on the ice,
we stood at the North Pole.

00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:40.555
We had done it.

00:07:40.555 --> 00:07:45.825
Yes, I became the first person in history
stupid enough to walk to both Poles,

00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:48.217
but it was our success.

00:07:49.387 --> 00:07:53.247
And sadly, on return home,

00:07:53.247 --> 00:07:56.382
it was not all fun.

00:07:56.382 --> 00:07:58.123
I became very low.

00:07:58.123 --> 00:08:04.412
To succeed at something is often harder
than actually making it happen.
