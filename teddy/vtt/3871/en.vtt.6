00:02:55.138 --> 00:03:00.293
for the last 23 years on this mission

00:03:00.293 --> 00:03:04.297
to make sure that what's happening
up here in the North

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:09.716
does never happen, 
cannot happen in the South.

00:03:09.716 --> 00:03:11.508
Where did this all begin?

00:03:11.508 --> 00:03:14.457
It began for me at the age of 11.

00:03:14.457 --> 00:03:17.452
Check out that haircut. 
It's a bit odd. (Laughter)

00:03:17.452 --> 00:03:22.556
And at the age of 11, 
I was inspired by the real explorers

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:27.320
to want to try to be the first
to walk to both Poles.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.685
I found it incredibly inspiring
