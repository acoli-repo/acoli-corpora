00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.685
I found it incredibly inspiring

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:35.563
that the idea of becoming a polar traveler

00:03:35.563 --> 00:03:39.910
went down pretty well with girls 
at parties when I was at university.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.878
That was a bit more inspiring.

00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:45.500
And after years, seven
years of fundraising,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.147
seven years of being told no,

00:03:48.147 --> 00:03:54.393
seven years of being told
by my family to seek counseling

00:03:54.393 --> 00:03:58.155
and psychiatric help,

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:04.112
eventually three of us found ourselves
marching to the South Geographic Pole
