00:06:57.614 --> 00:07:04.706
as I realized we, as a world,
are in a survival situation,

00:07:04.706 --> 00:07:09.070
and that feeling has never gone away
for 25 long years.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.543
Back then, we had to march or die.

00:07:13.543 --> 00:07:17.351
And we're not some TV survivor program.

00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:20.282
When things go wrong for us,
it's life or death,

00:07:20.282 --> 00:07:23.596
and our brave African-American Daryl,

00:07:23.596 --> 00:07:27.474
who would become the first American
to walk to the North Pole,

00:07:27.474 --> 00:07:32.064
his heel dropped off 
from frostbite 200 klicks out.
