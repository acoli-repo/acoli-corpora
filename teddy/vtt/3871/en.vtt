All of you are actually going south.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:15.229
This is the direction of south, this way,

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:21.749
and if you go 8,000 kilometers
out of the back of this room,

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.982
you will come to as far south
as you can go anywhere on Earth,

00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:29.393
the Pole itself.

00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:33.201
Now, I am not an explorer.
