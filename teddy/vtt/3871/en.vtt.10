00:04:59.058 --> 00:05:03.229
And after 70 desperate days,
we arrive at the South Pole.

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.977
We had done it.

00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:10.696
But something happened to me
on that 70-day journey in 1986

00:05:10.696 --> 00:05:13.500
that brought me here, and it hurt.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.615
My eyes changed color
in 70 days through damage.

00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:20.652
Our faces blistered out.

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:25.644
The skin ripped off
and we wondered why.

00:05:25.644 --> 00:05:29.173
And when we got home,
we were told by NASA

00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:32.029
that a hole in the ozone
had been discovered
