00:11:27.233 --> 00:11:31.951
and all those people who come with us
return home as great champions,

00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:33.899
not only for Antarctica,

00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:37.543
but for local issues
back in their own nations.

00:11:37.543 --> 00:11:43.891
Let's go back to where we began:
the ice melt of the North and South Poles.

00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:46.433
And it's not good news.

00:11:47.713 --> 00:11:51.689
NASA informed us six months ago

00:11:51.689 --> 00:11:56.688
that the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf
is now disintegrating.

00:11:56.688 --> 00:11:59.113
Huge areas of ice --

00:11:59.113 --> 00:12:03.385
look how big Antarctica is
even compared to here --
