00:00:01.396 --> 00:00:03.076
(Marshallese) Ukot boka eo.

00:00:04.716 --> 00:00:06.076
“Turn the tides.

00:00:06.676 --> 00:00:08.236
We must give back,”

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:10.196
chant my ancestors.

00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:14.236
The thunder strikes --

00:00:14.236 --> 00:00:15.236
(Hands clap)

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:18.316
as the sea demoness 
swept through the lands

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:20.876
with a fiery likeness of Letao’s fire.

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:24.356
Tearing apart livelihood,

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:27.876
the mounting waves and erosions
leave my island gaping

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:30.796
like the mouth of a dead fish.
