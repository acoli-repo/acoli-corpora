I think we can have that in 2020 for 10 dollars. Okay?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Now, just imagine what that $100 computer will be in 2020

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
as a tool for education.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I think the challenge for us is --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I'm very certain that that will happen, the challenge is,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
to let us take advantage of that device?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
but we don't have very good software for them.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And it's only in retrospect, after the better software comes along,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and you take it and you run it on a ten-year-old machine, you say,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
God, the machine was that fast?
