00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Their strength: they're almost the strongest material,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
tensile strength material known.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
They're very, very stiff. They stretch very, very little.


00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
In two dimensions, if you make, like, a fabric out of them,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
they're 30 times stronger than Kevlar.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And if you make a three-dimensional structure, like a buckyball,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
they have all sorts of incredible properties.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
If you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
they repair themselves; they go zip and they repair the hole

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
in femtoseconds, which is not -- is really quick.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
