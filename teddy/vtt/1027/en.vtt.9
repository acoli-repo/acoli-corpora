00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and you know, nuclear bombs exploding in New York

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
where I would be within the circle, and so on.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And then I was there on September 11th,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and everything below 14th Street was closed.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It was quite a compelling experience, but not really, I suppose,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
a surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It was always a surprise that it happened then and there,
