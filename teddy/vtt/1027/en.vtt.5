00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So that this is possible to do this is not deniable.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So individuals in small groups super-empowered by access to these

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
kinds of self-replicating technologies, whether it be biological

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
or other, are clearly a danger in our world.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And we really don't have experience with pandemics,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and we're also not very good as a society at acting

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to things we don't have direct and sort of gut-level experience with.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So it's not in our nature to pre-act.
