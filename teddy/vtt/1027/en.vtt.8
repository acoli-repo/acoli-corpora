00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
is going to prevent a crazy person from doing something.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And you know, and the troubling thing is that

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
it's much easier to do something bad than to defend

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
against all possible bad things,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So these are the kind of thoughts I was thinking in 1999 and 2000,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and my friends told me I was getting really depressed,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and they were really worried about me.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And then I signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and moved into a hotel room in New York

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
with one room full of books on the Plague,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and you know, nuclear bombs exploding in New York

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
where I would be within the circle, and so on.
