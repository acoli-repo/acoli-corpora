00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
that will go fill these gaps? And Brooks told me in a break here,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
he said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
because there's so many great technologies out there,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
we're essentially buried. And we need them, you know.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
that still works, roughly. That's Tamiflu.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
But Tamiflu -- the virus is resistant. It is resistant to Tamiflu.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
We've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work well

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
so that the viral resistance -- we need several anti-virals.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
We need better surveillance.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We need networks that can find out what's going on.
