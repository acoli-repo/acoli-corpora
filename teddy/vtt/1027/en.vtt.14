00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that I was talking about in the Wired article.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
The first is this whole area of education,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a $100 computer.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And that is to say that there's a lot of legs left in Moore's Law.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
The most advanced transistors today are at 65 nanometers,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and we've seen, and I've had the pleasure to invest

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
in, companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend Moore's Law

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
all the way down to roughly the 10 nanometer scale.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Another factor of, say, six in dimensional reduction,
