00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to fight an asymmetric threat, which is what we seem to be doing

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
because of the present, the people that are in power,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
because that's to give up the thing that makes civilization.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
because a million-dollar act

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
causes a billion dollars of damage, causes a trillion dollar response

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
which is largely ineffective and arguably, probably almost certainly,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
has made the problem worse.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So we can't fight the thing with a million-to-one cost,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
one-to-a-million cost-benefit ratio.
