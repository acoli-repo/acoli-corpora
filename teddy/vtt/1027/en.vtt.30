And the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So we're very excited because we think we can fund 10,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
in the next couple years that will address this.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So if we can address, use technology, help address education,
