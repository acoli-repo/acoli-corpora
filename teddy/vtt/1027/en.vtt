What technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And what I found was quite surprising.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and how they'd been improved, and very simple things turned out.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but it's actually the opposite.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And so very simple things -- off-the-shelf technologies

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that we could easily find on the then-early Web --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
would clearly make a huge difference to that problem.
