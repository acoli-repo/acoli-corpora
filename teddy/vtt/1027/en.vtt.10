a surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It was always a surprise that it happened then and there,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
but it wasn't a surprise that it happened at all.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And everyone then started writing about this.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Thousands of people started writing about this.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And I eventually abandoned the book, and then Chris called me

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
to talk at the conference. I really don't talk about this anymore

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
because, you know, there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
But I agreed to come and say a few things about this.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And I would say that we can't give up the rule of law

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to fight an asymmetric threat, which is what we seem to be doing
