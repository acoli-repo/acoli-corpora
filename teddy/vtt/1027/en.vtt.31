00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So if we can address, use technology, help address education,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
help address the environment, help address the pandemic,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
does that solve the larger problem that I was talking about

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
in the Wired article? And I'm afraid the answer is really no,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
because you can't solve a problem with the management of technology

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
with more technology.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
If we let an unlimited amount of power loose, then we will --

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
a very small number of people will be able to abuse it.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
We can't fight at a million-to-one disadvantage.
