Things where, you know, a factor of 10 difference

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
It's overwhelming at times. I'm very thankful for Google and Wikipedia

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
so I can understand at least a little of what people are talking about

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
who come through the doors.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
But I wanted to share with you three areas

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that I'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that I was talking about in the Wired article.
