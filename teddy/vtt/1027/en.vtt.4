00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We saw genome sequences.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You can download the gene sequences

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
of pathogens off the Internet if you want to,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and clearly someone recently -- I saw in a science magazine --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
they said, well, the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If people want to use it in their labs for working on research,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
just reconstruct it yourself,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
because, you know, it might break in FedEx.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So that this is possible to do this is not deniable.
