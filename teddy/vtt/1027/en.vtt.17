00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and you take it and you run it on a ten-year-old machine, you say,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
God, the machine was that fast?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I remember when they took the Apple Mac interface

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and they put it back on the Apple II.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The Apple II was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
we just didn't know how to do it at the time.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
because Moore's Law's been, like, a constant,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I mean, it's just been very predictable progress

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
over the last 40 years or whatever.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
We can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
It's great that we have initiatives to say,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
let's go create the education and educate people in the world,
