00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Another factor of, say, six in dimensional reduction,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
which should give us about another factor of 100 in raw improvement

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
in what the chips can do. And so, to put that in practical terms,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
if something costs about 1,000 dollars today,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
say, the best personal computer you can buy, that might be its cost,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I think we can have that in 2020 for 10 dollars. Okay?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Now, just imagine what that $100 computer will be in 2020
