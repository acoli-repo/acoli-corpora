(Laughter)

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
If you shine a light on them, they produce electricity.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
In fact, if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
If you put electricity on them, they emit light.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
If you run current through them, you can run 1,000 times more current

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
through one of these than through a piece of metal.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You can make both p- and n-type semiconductors,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
which means you can make transistors out of them.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
They conduct heat along their length but not across --

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
well, there is no width, but not in the other direction

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
if you stack them up; that's a property of carbon fiber also.
