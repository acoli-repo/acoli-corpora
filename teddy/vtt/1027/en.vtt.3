a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But now we have a new situation, really what people call

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
an asymmetric situation, where technology is so powerful

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that it extends beyond a nation-state.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's not the nation-states that have potential access

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to mass destruction, but individuals.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We saw genome sequences.
