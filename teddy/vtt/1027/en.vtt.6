00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So it's not in our nature to pre-act.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And in this case, piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
because it only super-empowers people more.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So the solution has to be, as people like Russell and Einstein

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and others imagine in a conversation that existed

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
in a much stronger form, I think, early in the 20th century,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
You know, public policy and moral progress.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power.
