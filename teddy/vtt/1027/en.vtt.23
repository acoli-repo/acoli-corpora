00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
well, there is no width, but not in the other direction

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
if you stack them up; that's a property of carbon fiber also.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
If you put particles in them, and they go shooting out the tip --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
The inside of the nanotubes is so small --

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers --

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
that it's basically a quantum world.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
It's a strange place inside a nanotube.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And so we begin to see, and we've seen business plans already,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
where the kind of things Lisa Randall's talking about are in there.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Witten's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand
