00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
We can't fight at a million-to-one disadvantage.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So what we need to do is, we need better policy.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And for example, some things we could do

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
but perhaps with the change of administration would be -- use markets.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Markets are a very strong force.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
For example, rather than trying to regulate away problems,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
which probably won't work, if we could price

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
into the cost of doing business, the cost of catastrophe,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
would have to take insurance against that risk.
