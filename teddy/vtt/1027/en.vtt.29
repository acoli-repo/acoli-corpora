00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We need networks that can find out what's going on.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
We need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
We've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
We need new anti-virals and cocktails. We need new kinds of vaccines.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Vaccines that are broad spectrum.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Vaccines that we can manufacture quickly.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Cocktails, more polyvalent vaccines.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
We need -- we don't know where this thing is going.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps,
