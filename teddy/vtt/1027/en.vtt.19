00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that's driving improvement in our ability to address

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
the environmental problem is new materials.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
We have a challenge, because the urban population is growing

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
in this century from two billion to six billion

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
in a very short amount of time. People are moving to the cities.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
They all need clean water, they need energy, they need transportation,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and we want them to develop in a green way.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
but the consumer sector, especially in America, is very inefficient.
