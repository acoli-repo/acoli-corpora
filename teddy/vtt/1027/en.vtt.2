00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We came up with something -- the Ten Commandments: Thou shalt not kill.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That's a, kind of a one-on-one thing.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We organized into cities. We had many people.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And to keep the many from tyrannizing the one,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we came up with concepts like individual liberty.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And then, to have to deal with large groups,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
say, at the nation-state level,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and we had to have mutual non-aggression,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
or through a series of conflicts, we eventually came to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace.
