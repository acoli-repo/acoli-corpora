00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
don't have any personal responsibility

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
for the consequences of their actions.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
So if you tie that -- you have to tie that back with the law.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And finally, I think we have to do something that's not really --

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
it's almost unacceptable to say this -- which,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
we have to begin to design the future.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
We can't pick the future, but we can steer the future.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
We may not be able to stop it, but the likelihood

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem.
