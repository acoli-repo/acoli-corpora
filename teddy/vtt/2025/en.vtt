00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because of the fact

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that we have what most people consider

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
an unusual friendship.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And it is.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And yet, it feels natural to us now.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I first learned

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that my son had been in the World Trade Center

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
on the morning of September 11th, 2001.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We didn't know

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
if he had perished yet

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
until 36 hours later.
