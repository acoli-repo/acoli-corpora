00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And what happened then is we all told our stories,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and we all connected as human beings.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
By the end of the afternoon --

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
it was about three hours after lunch --

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Now what I learned from her,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is a woman, not only who could be so generous

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
under these present circumstances

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and what it was then,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and what was being done to her son,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
but the life she's had.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I never had met

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
someone with such a hard life,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
