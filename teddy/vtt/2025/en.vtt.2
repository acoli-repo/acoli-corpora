00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we were not vengeful.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And a couple of weeks later

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and the U.S. government called for a death penalty

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
for him, if convicted,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
my husband and I spoke out

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in opposition to that, publicly.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Through that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and through human rights groups,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we were brought together

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with several other victims' families.
