00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And I feel

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
which I value very much.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And I think it's all about

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
being afraid of the other,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Who else can I meet that I don't know,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
or that I'm so different from?"

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So, Aicha,
