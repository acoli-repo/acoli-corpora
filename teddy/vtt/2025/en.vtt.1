until 36 hours later.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
At the time,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we knew that it was political.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We were afraid of what our country was going to do

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in the name of our son --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
my husband, Orlando, and I and our family.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And when I saw it --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and yet, through the shock,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the terrible shock,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we were not vengeful.
