Some of the worst issues
of our time are connected to it.

00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:02.176
It's destroying our oceans.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.218
The worst slavery issues
imaginable are connected to it.

00:09:05.702 --> 00:09:08.512
Recently, an article came out of Stanford

00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:11.409
saying that if 50 percent
of the world's aquaculture industry

00:09:11.433 --> 00:09:12.735
would stop using fish meal,

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:14.409
our oceans would be saved.

00:09:14.837 --> 00:09:16.492
Now think about that for a minute.

00:09:16.516 --> 00:09:19.536
Now, we know that the oceans
have far more problems --

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.345
they have pollution,
there's acidification,

00:09:22.369 --> 00:09:23.952
coral reef destruction and so on.

00:09:23.976 --> 00:09:26.513
But it underlines the impact
of our fisheries,

00:09:26.537 --> 00:09:29.112
and it underlines how
interconnected everything is.

00:09:29.608 --> 00:09:33.224
