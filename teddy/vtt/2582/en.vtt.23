00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:30.884
Insects are the --

00:11:30.908 --> 00:11:32.869
well, first of all, the perfect recycling

00:11:32.893 --> 00:11:34.623
because they're grown on food waste;

00:11:34.647 --> 00:11:35.799
but second,

00:11:35.823 --> 00:11:36.974
think of fly-fishing,

00:11:36.998 --> 00:11:40.311
and you know how logical
it actually is to use it as fish feed.

00:11:40.712 --> 00:11:42.735
You don't need large tracts of land for it

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:45.169
and you don't need
to cut down rain forests for it.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.959
And microbes and insects are actually
net water producers.

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:51.738
This revolution is starting as we speak,

00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:53.239
it just needs scale.

00:11:54.492 --> 00:11:57.559
We can now farm far more
species than ever before

00:11:57.583 --> 00:12:01.220
in controlled, natural conditions,
creating happy fish.
