You can farm one pound of fish
with just one pound of feed,

00:08:03.126 --> 00:08:05.458
and depending on species, even less.

00:08:05.845 --> 00:08:07.075
And why is that?

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:10.868
Well, that's because fish,
first of all, float.

00:08:10.892 --> 00:08:14.478
They don't need to stand around all day
resisting gravity like we do.

00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:16.560
And most fish are cold-blooded --

00:08:16.584 --> 00:08:18.264
they don't need to heat themselves.

00:08:18.288 --> 00:08:19.456
Fish chills.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.101
(Laughter)

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.665
And it needs very little water,

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:23.967
which is counterintuitive,

00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:25.378
but as we say,

00:08:25.402 --> 00:08:27.796
it swims in it but it hardly drinks it.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.233
Fish are the most resource-efficient
animal protein available to humankind,
