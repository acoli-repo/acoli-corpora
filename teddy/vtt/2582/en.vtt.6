00:02:56.977 --> 00:03:00.013
People are eating animal protein
whether we like it or not.

00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:02.396
And suppose we fail to change our ways

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.546
and continue on the current path,

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.404
failing to meet demands.

00:03:06.428 --> 00:03:08.650
The World Health Organization
recently reported

00:03:08.674 --> 00:03:12.836
that 800 million people are suffering
from malnutrition and food shortage,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.271
which is due to that same
growing, global population

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:20.317
and the declining access to resources
like water, energy and land.

00:03:21.212 --> 00:03:23.272
It takes very little imagination

00:03:23.296 --> 00:03:28.246
to picture a world of global unrest,
riots and further malnutrition.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.896
People are hungry,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.958
and we are running dangerously low
on natural resources.
