00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.313
And make no mistake --
all of these things are possible

00:13:01.337 --> 00:13:04.472
at a cost that's competitive
to what a farmer spends today.

00:13:05.024 --> 00:13:08.971
Tomorrow, there will be no excuse
for anyone to not do the right thing.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:12.423
So somebody needs to connect the dots

00:13:12.447 --> 00:13:15.030
and give these developments
a big kick in the butt.

00:13:15.054 --> 00:13:18.071
And that's what we've been working on
the last couple of years,

00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:20.581
and that's what we need
to be working on together --

00:13:21.049 --> 00:13:23.400
rethinking everything from the ground up,

00:13:23.424 --> 00:13:25.943
with a holistic view
across the value chain,

00:13:25.967 --> 00:13:28.101
connecting all these things
across the globe,

00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:30.173
alongside great entrepreneurs
