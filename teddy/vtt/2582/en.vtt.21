00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:30.861
and then of course, as just mentioned,

00:10:30.885 --> 00:10:32.964
the unsustainable feed ingredients.

00:10:33.396 --> 00:10:34.639
How blessed were the days

00:10:34.663 --> 00:10:37.110
when we could just enjoy
food that was on our plate,

00:10:37.134 --> 00:10:38.339
whatever it was.

00:10:38.825 --> 00:10:40.364
Once you know, you know.

00:10:40.388 --> 00:10:41.594
You can't go back.

00:10:41.618 --> 00:10:42.769
It's not fun.

00:10:42.793 --> 00:10:45.982
We really need a transparent food
system that we can trust,

00:10:46.006 --> 00:10:47.680
that produces healthy food.

00:10:48.726 --> 00:10:49.925
But the good news is

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:52.862
that decades of development and research

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:55.348
have led to a lot of new
technologies and knowledge

00:10:55.372 --> 00:10:57.184
that allow us to do a lot better.

00:10:57.208 --> 00:10:59.854
We can now farm fish
without any of these issues.
