If you feed salmon soy with nothing else,

00:10:02.048 --> 00:10:03.810
it literally explodes.

00:10:04.463 --> 00:10:05.615
Salmon is a carnivore,

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:07.534
it has no way to digest soy.

00:10:09.049 --> 00:10:11.171
Now, fish farming is by far

00:10:11.195 --> 00:10:13.512
the best animal farming
available to humankind.

00:10:13.536 --> 00:10:15.908
But it's had a really bad reputation.

00:10:16.373 --> 00:10:18.552
There's been excessive use of chemicals,

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:21.756
there's been virus and disease
transfered to wild populations,

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.109
ecosystem destruction and pollution,

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:26.347
escaped fish breeding
with wild populations,

00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:28.371
altering the overall genetic pool,

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:30.861
and then of course, as just mentioned,
