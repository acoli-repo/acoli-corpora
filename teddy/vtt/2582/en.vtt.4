00:01:59.694 --> 00:02:02.944
over 90 percent has disappeared
since the 1950s.

And there are a lot of great, sustainable

working towards better practices
and better-managed fisheries.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.231
But ultimately,

00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:15.857

towards keeping current catch constant.

00:02:16.564 --> 00:02:17.715
It's unlikely,

We need to alleviate the pressure on it.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.988
And we are at a point
