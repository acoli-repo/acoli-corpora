00:07:28.763 --> 00:07:31.658
A cow needs to eat
eight to nine pounds of feed

00:07:31.682 --> 00:07:34.133
and drink almost 8,000 liters of water

00:07:34.157 --> 00:07:36.037
to create just one pound of meat.

00:07:36.535 --> 00:07:38.578
Experts agree that it's impossible

00:07:38.602 --> 00:07:41.754
to farm cows for every
inhabitant on this planet.

00:07:41.778 --> 00:07:44.516
We just don't have enough feed or water.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.294
And we can't keep cutting down
rain forests for it.

00:07:47.318 --> 00:07:50.827
And fresh water -- planet earth
has a very limited supply.

00:07:50.851 --> 00:07:52.962
We need something more efficient

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:55.867
to keep humankind alive on this planet.

00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:58.664
And now let's compare
that with fish farming.

00:07:59.164 --> 00:08:03.102
You can farm one pound of fish
with just one pound of feed,
