00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.233
Fish are the most resource-efficient
animal protein available to humankind,

00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:33.692
aside from insects.

00:08:35.297 --> 00:08:36.911
How much we've learned since.

00:08:37.482 --> 00:08:40.919
For example, on top of that
65 million tons that's annually caught

00:08:40.943 --> 00:08:42.553
for human consumption,

00:08:42.577 --> 00:08:46.564
there's an additional 30 million tons
caught for animal feed,

00:08:46.588 --> 00:08:50.129
mostly sardines and anchovies
for the aquaculture industry

00:08:50.153 --> 00:08:52.190
that's turned into fish meal and fish oil.

00:08:52.602 --> 00:08:53.949
This is madness.

00:08:54.548 --> 00:08:58.120
Sixty-five percent of these fisheries,
globally, are badly managed.

00:08:58.144 --> 00:09:00.854
Some of the worst issues
of our time are connected to it.
