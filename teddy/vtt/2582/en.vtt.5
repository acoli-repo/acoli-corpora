00:02:30.012 --> 00:02:32.777
where if we push much harder
for more produce,

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:34.500
we might face total collapse.

00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:39.869
Our current systems are not going to feed
a growing global population.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.129
So how do we fix this?

00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:44.891
What's the world going to look like
in just 35 short years

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:48.514
when there's 2.7 billion more of us
sharing the same resources?

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:50.931
We could all become vegan.

00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:52.708
Sounds like a great idea,

00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:54.036
but it's not realistic

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.405
and it's impossibly hard
to mandate globally.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:03:00.013
People are eating animal protein
whether we like it or not.
