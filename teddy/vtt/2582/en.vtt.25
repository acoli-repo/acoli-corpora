I think of seaweed growing
off the effluent of fish, for example.

00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:37.248
There's great technologies
popping up all over the globe.

00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:39.753
From alternatives to battle disease

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:42.642
so we don't need antibiotics
and chemicals anymore,

00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:46.322
to automated feeders that feel
when the fish are hungry,

00:12:46.346 --> 00:12:49.637
so we can save on feed
and create less pollution.

00:12:50.016 --> 00:12:52.619
Software systems that gather
data across farms,

00:12:52.643 --> 00:12:54.529
so we can improve farm practices.

00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:57.983
There's really cool stuff
happening all over the globe.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.313
And make no mistake --
all of these things are possible
