00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.189
from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.

00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:36.436
Something similar has been going on
with milk and eggs.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.029
In every society where incomes have risen,
so has protein consumption.

00:00:41.053 --> 00:00:43.982
And we know that globally,
we are getting richer.

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:47.211
And as the middle class is on the rise,
so is our global population,

00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:52.186
from 7 billion of us today
to 9.7 billion by 2050,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.673
which means that by 2050,

00:00:53.697 --> 00:00:56.224
we are going to need at least
70 percent more protein

00:00:56.248 --> 00:00:58.681
than what is available to humankind today.

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:02.341
And the latest prediction of the UN
puts that population number,
