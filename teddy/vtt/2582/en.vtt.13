00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:30.789
And to talk about stats --

00:06:30.813 --> 00:06:33.589
right now, the amount of fish
consumed globally,

00:06:33.613 --> 00:06:35.669
wild catch and farmed combined,

00:06:35.693 --> 00:06:38.025
is twice the tonnage
of the total amount of beef

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:39.922
produced on planet earth last year.

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:42.746
Every single fishing vessel combined,

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.701
small and large, across the globe,

00:06:44.725 --> 00:06:48.602
together produce about 65 million tons
of wild-caught seafood

00:06:48.626 --> 00:06:50.023
for human consumption.

00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:51.929
Aquaculture this year,

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.532
for the first time in history,

00:06:53.556 --> 00:06:56.413
actually produces more
than what we catch from the wild.

00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:58.025
But now this:

00:06:58.049 --> 00:06:59.403
Demand is going to go up.
