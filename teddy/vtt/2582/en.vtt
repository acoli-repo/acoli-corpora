00:00:00.823 --> 00:00:03.191
So I come from the tallest
people on the planet --

00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:04.365
the Dutch.

00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:07.069
It hasn't always been this way.

00:00:07.093 --> 00:00:10.307
In fact, all across the globe,
people have been gaining height.

00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:11.894
In the last 150 years,

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:13.079
in developed countries,

00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:15.611
on average, we have gotten
10 centimeters taller.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.918
And scientists have a lot
of theories about why this is,

00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:21.362
but almost all of them involve nutrition,

00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:23.670
namely the increase of dairy and meat.

00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:25.940
In the last 50 years,

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:28.838
global meat consumption
has more than quadrupled,

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.189
from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.
