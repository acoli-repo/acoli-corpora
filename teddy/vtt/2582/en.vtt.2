00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:02.341
And the latest prediction of the UN
puts that population number,

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:04.825
by the end of this century, at 11 billion,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.809
which means that we are going
to need a lot more protein.

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.566
This challenge is staggering --

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.397
so much so, that recently,

00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:15.539
a team at Anglia Ruskin
Global Sustainability Institute suggested

00:01:15.563 --> 00:01:17.699
that if we don't change
our global policies

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:19.271
and food production systems,

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:22.557
our societies might actually collapse
in the next 30 years.

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:28.463
Currently, our ocean serves
as the main source of animal protein.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:32.169
Over 2.6 billion people
depend on it every single day.
