00:13:58.577 --> 00:14:02.476
And this is not just for people
in San Francisco or Northern Europe --

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.346
this is for all of us.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.030
Even in the poorest countries,

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.564
it's not just about money.

00:14:07.588 --> 00:14:11.404
People prefer something fresh
and healthy that they can trust

00:14:11.428 --> 00:14:15.220
over something that comes from far away
that they know nothing about.

00:14:15.244 --> 00:14:16.560
We're all the same.

00:14:18.267 --> 00:14:19.418
The day will come

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:22.683
where people will realize -- no, demand --
farmed fish on their plate

00:14:22.727 --> 00:14:25.084
that's farmed well
and that's farmed healthy --

00:14:26.204 --> 00:14:27.458
and refuse anything less.

00:14:27.482 --> 00:14:28.851
You can help speed this up.

00:14:29.163 --> 00:14:31.521
Ask questions when you order seafood.
