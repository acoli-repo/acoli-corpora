00:07:00.157 --> 00:07:01.666
In the next 35 years,

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.685
we are going to need an additional
85 million tons to meet demand,

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:09.304
which is one-and-a-half times
as much, almost,

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.887
as what we catch globally
out of our oceans.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.466
An enormous number.

00:07:14.812 --> 00:07:17.911
It's safe to assume that that's not
going to come from the ocean.

00:07:17.935 --> 00:07:19.604
It needs to come from farming.

00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:21.478
And talk about farming --

00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:23.469
for farming you need resources.

00:07:24.313 --> 00:07:27.242
As a human needs to eat
to grow and stay alive,

00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:28.739
so does an animal.

00:07:28.763 --> 00:07:31.658
A cow needs to eat
eight to nine pounds of feed
