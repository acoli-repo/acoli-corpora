00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:03.682
And why is it that we keep
hearing phrases like,

00:04:03.706 --> 00:04:05.389
"Life's too short for farmed fish,"

00:04:05.413 --> 00:04:07.001
or, "Wild-caught, of course!"

00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:09.374
over fish that we know
virtually nothing about?

00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:11.609
We don't know what it ate
during its lifetime,

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:13.825
and we don't know what
pollution it encounters.

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.739
And if it was a large predatory species,

00:04:15.773 --> 00:04:18.602
it might have gone through the coast
of Fukushima yesterday.

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:19.970
We don't know.

00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:21.337
Very few people realize

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:25.003
the traceability in fisheries
never goes beyond the hunter

00:04:25.027 --> 00:04:26.542
that caught the wild animal.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.003
But let's back up for a second

00:04:28.027 --> 00:04:30.614
and talk about why fish
is the best food choice.
