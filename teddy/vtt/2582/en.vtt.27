00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:30.173
alongside great entrepreneurs

00:13:30.197 --> 00:13:32.770
that are willing to share
a collective vision.

00:13:33.474 --> 00:13:36.307
Now is the time to create
change in this industry

00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:38.542
and to push it into
a sustainable direction.

00:13:38.566 --> 00:13:39.988
This industry is still young,

00:13:40.012 --> 00:13:41.704
much of its growth is still ahead.

00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:44.875
It's a big task, but not
as far-fetched as you might think.

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:46.049
It's possible.

00:13:47.032 --> 00:13:49.209
So we need to take pressure off the ocean.

00:13:49.233 --> 00:13:50.780
We want to eat good and healthy.

00:13:50.804 --> 00:13:52.876
And if we eat an animal,
it needs to be one

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.558
that had a happy and healthy life.

00:13:54.582 --> 00:13:56.789
We need to have a meal that we can trust,

00:13:56.813 --> 00:13:58.026
live long lives.

00:13:58.577 --> 00:14:02.476
And this is not just for people
in San Francisco or Northern Europe --
