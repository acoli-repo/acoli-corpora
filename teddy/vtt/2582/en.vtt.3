00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:32.169
Over 2.6 billion people
depend on it every single day.

00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:34.360
At the same time,

00:01:34.384 --> 00:01:37.035
our global fisheries
are two-and-a-half times larger

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:39.583
than what our oceans
can sustainably support,

00:01:39.607 --> 00:01:42.329
meaning that humans take
far more fish from the ocean

00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:44.657
than the oceans can naturally replace.

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:49.473
WWF recently published a report
showing that just in the last 40 years,

00:01:49.497 --> 00:01:52.087
our global marine life
has been slashed in half.

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:57.298
And another recent report suggests
that of our largest predatory species,

00:01:57.322 --> 00:01:59.670
such as swordfish and bluefin tuna,

00:01:59.694 --> 00:02:02.944
over 90 percent has disappeared
since the 1950s.
