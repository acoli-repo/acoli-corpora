00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.958
and we are running dangerously low
on natural resources.

00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:34.884
For so, so many reasons,

00:03:34.908 --> 00:03:37.662
we need to change our global
food production systems.

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:39.679
We must do better

00:03:39.703 --> 00:03:40.868
and there is a solution.

00:03:40.892 --> 00:03:43.477
And that solution lies in aquaculture --

00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:47.447
the farming of fish, plants like seaweed,
shellfish and crustaceans.

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.290
As the great ocean hero
Jacques Cousteau once said,

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:53.188
"We must start using the ocean
as farmers instead of hunters.

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:56.742
That's what civilization is all about --
farming instead of hunting."

00:03:57.402 --> 00:03:59.830
Fish is the last food that we hunt.
