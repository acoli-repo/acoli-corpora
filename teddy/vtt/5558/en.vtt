A handful of species on Earth 
share a seemingly mysterious trait:

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:13.132
a menstrual cycle.

00:00:13.132 --> 00:00:15.152
We're one of the select few.

00:00:15.152 --> 00:00:19.545
Monkeys, apes, bats, humans,
and possibly elephant shrews

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:22.998
are the only mammals on Earth
that menstruate.

00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:25.426
We also do it more than any other animal,

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:29.509
even though its a waste of nutrients
and can be a physical inconvenience.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.649
So where's the sense in this
uncommon biological process?
