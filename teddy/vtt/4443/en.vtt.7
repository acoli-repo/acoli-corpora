00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:31.926
After five years of living in Japan
and focusing on my craft,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.400
I felt like I needed a new challenge.

00:03:34.903 --> 00:03:36.110
So I moved to New York,

00:03:36.134 --> 00:03:38.379
because that's what you do
as an artist, right?

00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:40.394
You move to the greatest
city in the world

00:03:40.418 --> 00:03:41.642
that has the ability

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:45.873
to make you feel
completely and utterly invisible.

00:03:46.788 --> 00:03:49.882
This is when I began to truly ask myself,

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:52.255
"Who are you?"

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.288
I would wake up in the morning,
and before I began my day,

00:03:55.312 --> 00:03:57.006
I would meditate on this.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.991
And with this question in mind,

00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:00.498
I kept drawing.
