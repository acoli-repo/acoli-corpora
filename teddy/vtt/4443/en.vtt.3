00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:30.545
So as you can see, I've got this pen,

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.180
and it knows where it's going.

00:01:32.204 --> 00:01:34.799
And I've learned very well
how to follow it.

00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:38.125
And the first thing I did is
I followed this line,

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.899
and I drew myself out of a culture

00:01:40.923 --> 00:01:43.603
that was only telling me
what I couldn't do.

00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:45.804
I trusted my pen,

00:01:45.828 --> 00:01:48.569
and it led me to Central Saint Martin's,

00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:50.815
a very fancy art school in London,

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:53.362
where I graduated top of my year.

00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:57.463
However, I soon realized
there wasn't a place for me in London,

00:01:57.487 --> 00:02:00.133
because whether you wish
to believe it or not,
