00:01:57.487 --> 00:02:00.133
because whether you wish
to believe it or not,

00:02:00.157 --> 00:02:03.519
England is still a country
that is rooted and functions within

00:02:03.543 --> 00:02:04.704
the class system.

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:10.671
And as a young, black, gay female artist
from a working-class family,

00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:12.425
I didn't stand a chance.

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.283
So I left London and I moved to Japan,

00:02:15.307 --> 00:02:19.276
where I didn't experience
people asking me where I was really from.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.251
I was just another gaijin,

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.206
which, ironically, means "outsider."

00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:28.669
I was immersed in a culture
that honors both making and craft,

00:02:28.693 --> 00:02:31.879
where people perfect their craft
over generations.
