00:06:59.247 --> 00:07:00.856
And I don't mean that literally,

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.222
because sight is only one way
in which one can see.

00:07:04.246 --> 00:07:07.934
But what I mean is to experience
the world in its entirety,

00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.466
maybe even more so
during the most challenging moments

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.693
like the one we face today.

00:07:13.717 --> 00:07:15.096
I'm Shantell Martin.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.271
I draw.

00:07:16.295 --> 00:07:18.212
And I invite you to pick up a pen

00:07:18.236 --> 00:07:20.188
and see where it takes you.

00:07:20.212 --> 00:07:23.071
