00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:00.498
I kept drawing.

00:04:00.522 --> 00:04:02.124
I followed the line.

00:04:02.148 --> 00:04:03.791
I let it lead the way.

00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:05.995
The process of picking up a pen,

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.653
something everyone has access to,

00:04:08.677 --> 00:04:12.077
the act of giving myself
permission to let go

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:16.014
of all thoughts, all fears,
insecurities --

00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:17.688
anything that would get in the way

00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:20.490
of allowing myself to be completely me --

00:04:20.514 --> 00:04:23.726
that became my way
of experiencing freedom.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.361
When I got to New York,

00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:28.090
I didn't want to play by the rules
of the art world.

00:04:28.114 --> 00:04:31.288
I continued my practice as an outsider.
