It has taught me to open my eyes
to see not only what is,

00:06:31.846 --> 00:06:33.160
but what can be.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.715
And where there are broken systems,

00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:40.656
we can create new ones
that actually function and benefit all,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.680
instead of just a select few.

00:06:43.046 --> 00:06:45.939
Drawing has taught me
how to fully engage with the world.

00:06:46.288 --> 00:06:49.820
And what I've come to realize
through this language of lines

00:06:49.844 --> 00:06:52.383
is not the importance of being seen,

00:06:52.407 --> 00:06:55.493
but rather the gift of seeing
that we give to others

00:06:55.517 --> 00:06:59.223
and how true freedom
is the ability to see.

00:06:59.247 --> 00:07:00.856
And I don't mean that literally,
