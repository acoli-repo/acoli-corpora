00:01:00.022 --> 00:01:02.553
blond hair, blue eyes, very cute.

00:01:02.577 --> 00:01:03.777
And then there was me:

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:06.984
half Nigerian, brown, with an Afro.

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:10.077
So what happens when you look different

00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:11.514
and you feel different,

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:13.709
and in many ways,
start to think differently

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.966
from everyone and everything around you?

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.354
How do you find your way
out of a dark, racist, homophobic

00:01:22.378 --> 00:01:24.331
and very lonely place?

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:26.423
This is where the pen comes in.

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:28.450
I started to draw.

00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:30.545
So as you can see, I've got this pen,
