00:05:28.053 --> 00:05:30.363
I was given the opportunity
to do just that

00:05:30.387 --> 00:05:32.198
by the Trust of Governor's Island.

00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:35.085
They provided me with the perfect canvas

00:05:35.109 --> 00:05:37.577
in the form of a former military chapel.

00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:39.349
Meet "The May Room."

00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:43.926
With drawings on the exterior
inspired by the history of the island,

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.601
you walk inside, you take your shoes off,

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:49.395
and there's a drawing on the floor
in the form of a maze

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:50.990
that brings you back to you.

00:05:51.014 --> 00:05:53.585
It's an invitation to become calm.

00:05:53.609 --> 00:05:57.222
And this allows you
to see phrases on the wall.

00:05:57.246 --> 00:05:58.968
"May you be wise."

00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:01.066
"May you sleep soundly at night."
