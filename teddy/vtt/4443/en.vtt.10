00:04:57.237 --> 00:05:00.744
I've created and collaborated
with some of the most unique artists,

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:02.655
institutions and spaces,

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:04.855
from the screens of Times Square,

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.934
to the New York City Ballet
for their incredible artist series,

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.434
where I interviewed a number of dancers.

00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:14.181
Their stories and words
became the foundation

00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:16.950
of over 30 drawings and artworks,

00:05:16.974 --> 00:05:19.268
which took over the promenade walls,

00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:21.467
windows and floors.

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:23.495
For a long time,

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:26.725
I wanted to create a space
for contemplation and poetry.

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.029
And in 2019,

00:05:28.053 --> 00:05:30.363
I was given the opportunity
to do just that
