to use in the future should you need it.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And ultimately -- and here's a picture of our

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
bone marrow transplant survivors,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Hopefully this technology will let us

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
have more of these survivors in the future.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Thanks.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
