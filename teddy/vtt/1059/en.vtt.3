00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Our standard see-through patient.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And we have a flexible, powered catheter

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
or suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We can do multiple passes through that same entry.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
No robots required.
