00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
than the standard approach done on the same patient.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You all know about embryonic stem cells.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Adult stem cells are throughout our body,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
for over 40 years.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use
