00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
such as heart disease, vascular disease,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
orthopedics, tissue engineering,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
even in neurology to treat Parkinson's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and diabetes.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We've just come out, we're commercializing, this year,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The hope is that this gets more stem cells out,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
which translates to better outcomes.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It may encourage more people to sign up to be

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
potential live-saving bone marrow donors.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It may even enable you to bank

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to use in the future should you need it.
