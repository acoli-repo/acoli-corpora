00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
each time, with a syringe.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
About 200 times usually.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
let alone Bob,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
whose rear end looks something more like this,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
like Swiss cheese.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And there is probably a better way to do this.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.
