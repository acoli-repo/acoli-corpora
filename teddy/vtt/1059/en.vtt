00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So I am a pediatric cancer doctor

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I didn't bring a human brain,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but I did bring a liter of bone marrow.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And bone marrow is actually what we use

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and some other diseases.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.
