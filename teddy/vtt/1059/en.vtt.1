00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
who is a volunteer donor.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of a child with leukemia.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and another doctor across from me.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Bob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
you know, not too big.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And the way we do this is we basically

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
place this through the soft tissue,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and kind of punch it into the hard bone,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
into the tuchus -- that's a technical term --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out,
