00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
No robots required.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and do this harvest as an outpatient.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And played around with this a little bit.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And our team members developed this technology.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but we got 10 times the stem cell activity

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.
