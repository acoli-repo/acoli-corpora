One morning, in the year 1957,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
saw himself like this,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
a weird freak with huge hands,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
huge mouth,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and a tiny bottom.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Actually this creature

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is the result of the Penfield research.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
He named it homunculus.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Basically the homunculus is

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the visualization of a human being

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
where each part of the body is proportional
