00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:05.835
You're sitting in the doctor's office
waiting for test results.

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:08.838
She comes in and says,

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:10.923
"You have Parkinson's disease."

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:14.802
Your heart sinks, and you think about
everything that will go wrong:

00:00:14.844 --> 00:00:21.100
you'll be unable to walk, unable to feed
yourself, your hands trembling, drooling,

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:22.602
unable to swallow.

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:26.105
But before you say anything, she says,

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:31.819
"Not to worry, we'll put
in an order for your cells today."
