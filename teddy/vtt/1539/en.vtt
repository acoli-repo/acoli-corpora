00:00:02.963 --> 00:00:05.988
It's said that to be a poet

00:00:06.948 --> 00:00:10.553
you have to go to hell and back.

00:00:12.173 --> 00:00:15.349
The first time I visited the prison,

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.025
I was not surprised by the noise
of the padlocks,

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:24.243
or the closing doors,
or the cell bars,

00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:28.246
or by any of the things
I had imagined.

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:33.559
Maybe because the prison
is in a quite open space.
