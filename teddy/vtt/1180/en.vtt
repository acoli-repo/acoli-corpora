00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is a representation of your brain,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and your brain can be broken into two parts.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's the left half, which is the logical side,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and then the right half,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which is the intuitive.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
then we can plot our brain.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This would be someone who's entirely intuitive.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So where would you put your brain on this scale?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but I think for most people in the audience,
