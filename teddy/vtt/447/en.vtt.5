00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.079
I often get a shrug
and a statement to the effect of,

00:02:30.103 --> 00:02:32.840
"Well, you know, Chuck,
we've got to die of something."

00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:36.287
(Laughter)

00:02:36.311 --> 00:02:39.668
And yeah, but what this also tells me

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:45.286
is that we've resigned ourselves to this
as the status quo because we have to.

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:48.047
Or do we?

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.152
I think there's a better way,

00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:53.679
and this better way involves the use
of stem cells as medicines.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.351
So what, exactly, are stem cells?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.997
If you look at them under the microscope,
there's not much going on.
