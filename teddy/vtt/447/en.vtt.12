00:05:59.466 --> 00:06:02.755
We grow our heart muscle cells
in little three-dimensional clumps

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.289
called cardiac organoids.

00:06:04.313 --> 00:06:07.456
Each of them has 500 to 1,000
heart muscle cells in it.

00:06:08.003 --> 00:06:11.810
If you look closely, you can see these
little organoids are actually twitching;

00:06:11.834 --> 00:06:13.641
each one is beating independently.

00:06:14.094 --> 00:06:16.237
But they've got another trick
up their sleeve.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.964
We took a gene from jellyfish
that live in the Pacific Northwest,

00:06:19.988 --> 00:06:22.388
and we used a technique
called genome editing

00:06:22.412 --> 00:06:25.426
to splice this gene into the stem cells.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.875
And this makes our heart muscle cells
flash green every time they beat.

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:33.588
OK, so now we were finally ready
to begin animal experiments.
