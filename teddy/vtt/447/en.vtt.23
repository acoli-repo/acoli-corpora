00:11:29.678 --> 00:11:32.967
and that is, of course, the whole purpose
that we set out to do this:

00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:36.313
Can we actually restore function
to the injured heart?

00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:38.478
To answer this question,

00:11:38.502 --> 00:11:42.268
we went to something that's called
"left ventricular ejection fraction."

00:11:42.292 --> 00:11:44.622
Ejection fraction is simply
the amount of blood

00:11:44.646 --> 00:11:47.012
that is squeezed
out of the chamber of the heart

00:11:47.036 --> 00:11:48.208
with each beat.

00:11:48.232 --> 00:11:50.691
Now, in healthy macaques,
like in healthy people,

00:11:50.715 --> 00:11:53.185
ejection fractions are about 65 percent.

00:11:53.748 --> 00:11:57.868
After a heart attack, ejection fraction
drops down to about 40 percent,

00:11:57.892 --> 00:12:00.726
so these animals are
well on their way to heart failure.
