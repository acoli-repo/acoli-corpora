But when we got around
to doing the cell counts,

00:05:00.052 --> 00:05:03.083
we found that only one
out of 1,000 of our stem cells

00:05:03.107 --> 00:05:05.525
were actually turning into heart muscle.

00:05:05.937 --> 00:05:11.457
The rest was just a gemisch
of brain and skin and cartilage

00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:13.266
and intestine.

00:05:13.824 --> 00:05:17.153
So how do you coax a cell
that can become anything

00:05:17.177 --> 00:05:19.456
into becoming just a heart muscle cell?

00:05:20.243 --> 00:05:22.838
Well, for this we turned
to the world of embryology.

00:05:22.862 --> 00:05:25.560
For over a century, the embryologists
had been pondering

00:05:25.584 --> 00:05:27.266
the mysteries of heart development.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.647
And they had given us
what was essentially a Google Map
