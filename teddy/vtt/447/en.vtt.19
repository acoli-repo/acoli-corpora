Again, you can see
the monkey's heart muscle in red,

00:09:33.249 --> 00:09:35.956
but it's very hard to even see
the blue scar tissue,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.100
and that's because we've
been able to repopulate it

00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:40.988
with the human heart muscle,

00:09:41.012 --> 00:09:43.194
and so we've got this nice, plump wall.

00:09:43.218 --> 00:09:45.336
OK, let's just take a second and recap.

00:09:45.678 --> 00:09:48.212
I've showed you
that we can take our stem cells

00:09:48.236 --> 00:09:50.748
and differentiate them
into cardiac muscle.

00:09:50.772 --> 00:09:53.972
We've learned how to keep them alive
after transplantation,

00:09:53.996 --> 00:09:57.251
we've showed that they beat
in synchrony with the rest of the heart,

00:09:57.275 --> 00:09:59.270
and we've shown that we can scale them up

00:09:59.294 --> 00:10:03.644
into an animal that is the best possible
predictor of a human's response.
