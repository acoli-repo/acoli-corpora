00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:01.917
They're just simple little round cells.

00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:04.454
But that belies two remarkable attributes.

00:03:04.922 --> 00:03:07.237
The first is they can divide like crazy.

00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:10.095
So I can take a single cell,
and in a month's time,

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:12.087
I can grow this up to billions of cells.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.351
The second is they can differentiate
or become more specialized,

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:21.520
so these simple little round cells
can turn into skin, can turn into brain,

00:03:21.544 --> 00:03:23.719
can turn into kidney and so forth.

00:03:24.377 --> 00:03:27.463
Now, some tissues in our bodies
are chock-full of stem cells.

00:03:27.487 --> 00:03:31.384
Our bone marrow, for example, cranks out
billions of blood cells every day.
