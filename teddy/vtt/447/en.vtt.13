00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:33.588
OK, so now we were finally ready
to begin animal experiments.

00:06:33.612 --> 00:06:35.973
We took our cardiac muscle cells

00:06:35.997 --> 00:06:38.271
and we transplanted them
into the hearts of rats

00:06:38.295 --> 00:06:40.517
that had been given
experimental heart attacks.

00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:44.093
A month later, I peered anxiously
down through my microscope

00:06:44.117 --> 00:06:46.008
to see what we had grown,

00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:47.337
and I saw ...

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:48.972
nothing.

00:06:49.616 --> 00:06:51.383
Everything had died.

00:06:51.407 --> 00:06:55.355
But we persevered on this,
and we came up with a biochemical cocktail

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:57.683
that we called
our "pro-survival cocktail,"

00:06:57.707 --> 00:07:00.330
and this was enough to allow
our cells to survive
