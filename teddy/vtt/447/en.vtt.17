and the human heart muscle cells
are following in lockstep

00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:36.994
like good soldiers.

00:08:37.922 --> 00:08:42.538

00:08:44.017 --> 00:08:47.017
Our current studies have moved into

the best possible predictor
of a human patient,

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:51.843

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.446
This next slide shows you

from the heart of a macaque that was given
an experimental heart attack
