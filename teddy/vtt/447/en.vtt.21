00:10:27.038 --> 00:10:30.615
This was quite unexpected, because
we hadn't seen this in smaller animals.

00:10:31.266 --> 00:10:33.053
We've studied it extensively,

00:10:33.077 --> 00:10:37.065
and it turns out that it results
from the fact that our cellular graphs

00:10:37.089 --> 00:10:38.627
are quite immature,

00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:42.233
and immature heart muscle cells
all act like pacemakers.

00:10:42.257 --> 00:10:44.652
So what happens is,
we put them into the heart,

00:10:44.676 --> 00:10:48.121
and there starts to be a competition
with the heart's natural pacemaker

00:10:48.145 --> 00:10:49.764
over who gets to call the shots.

00:10:50.502 --> 00:10:51.665
It would be sort of like

00:10:51.689 --> 00:10:56.306
if you brought a whole gaggle of teenagers
into your orderly household all at once,

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.467
and they don't want to follow the rules
and the rhythms of the way you run things,
