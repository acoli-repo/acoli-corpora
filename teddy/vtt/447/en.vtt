00:00:00.562 --> 00:00:03.507
I'd like to tell you
about a patient named Donna.

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:06.704
In this photograph,
Donna was in her mid-70s,

00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:08.103
a vigorous, healthy woman,

00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:10.068
the matriarch of a large clan.

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:12.991
She had a family history
of heart disease, however,

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:16.354
and one day, she had the sudden onset
of crushing chest pain.

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:19.410
Now unfortunately, rather than
seeking medical attention,

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:23.350
Donna took to her bed for about 12 hours
until the pain passed.

00:00:23.374 --> 00:00:25.434
The next time she went
to see her physician,

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.095
he performed an electrocardiogram,

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.563
and this showed that she'd had
a large heart attack,

00:00:29.587 --> 00:00:32.551
or a "myocardial infarction"
in medical parlance.
