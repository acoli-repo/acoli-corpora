00:07:58.598 --> 00:08:00.623
and they're flashing in synchrony,

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.736
back through the walls
of the injured heart.

00:08:03.117 --> 00:08:04.268
What does this mean?

00:08:04.292 --> 00:08:05.776
It means the cells are alive,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.948
they're well, they're beating,

00:08:07.972 --> 00:08:10.201
and they've managed
to connect with one another

00:08:10.225 --> 00:08:12.297
so that they're beating in synchrony.

00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:14.436
But it gets even more
interesting than this.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.903
If you look at that tracing
that's along the bottom,

00:08:16.927 --> 00:08:20.272
that's the electrocardiogram
from the guinea pig's own heart.

00:08:20.296 --> 00:08:23.449
And if you line up the flashing
with the heartbeat

00:08:23.473 --> 00:08:24.773
that's shown on the bottom,

00:08:24.797 --> 00:08:27.984
what you can see is there's a perfect
one-to-one correspondence.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:32.474
In other words, the guinea pig's
natural pacemaker is calling the shots,
