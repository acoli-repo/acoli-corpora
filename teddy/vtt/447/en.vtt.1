00:00:29.587 --> 00:00:32.551
or a "myocardial infarction"
in medical parlance.

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:36.546
After this heart attack,
Donna was never quite the same.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.192
Her energy levels progressively waned,

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:42.874
she couldn't do a lot of the physical
activities she'd previously enjoyed.

00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:46.012
It got to the point where she couldn't
keep up with her grandkids,

00:00:46.036 --> 00:00:49.177
and it was even too much work
to go out to the end of the driveway

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:50.352
to pick up the mail.

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:53.429
One day, her granddaughter
came by to walk the dog,

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.876
and she found her grandmother
dead in the chair.

00:00:56.673 --> 00:01:01.020
Doctors said it was a cardiac arrhythmia
that was secondary to heart failure.
