00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:31.284
Just for reference, that's more than
twice the annual budget

00:01:31.308 --> 00:01:32.625
of the state of Washington.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.257
What makes this disease so deadly?

00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:39.643
Well, it all starts with the fact that
the heart is the least regenerative organ

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:41.003
in the human body.

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:45.470
Now, a heart attack happens when
a blood clot forms in a coronary artery

00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:47.989
that feeds blood to the wall of the heart.

00:01:48.013 --> 00:01:50.111
This plugs the blood flow,

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:52.550
and the heart muscle
is very metabolically active,

00:01:52.574 --> 00:01:53.922
and so it dies very quickly,

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:57.734
within just a few hours
of having its blood flow interrupted.

00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:00.845
Since the heart can't
grow back new muscle,
