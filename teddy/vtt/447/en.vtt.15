WEBVTT

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.721
that we could launch
into a foreign environment

00:07:30.745 --> 00:07:33.065
and then have that flashing
report back to us

00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:35.147
about their biological activity.

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:37.252
What you're seeing here
is a zoomed-in view,

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:39.498
a black-and-white image
of a guinea pig's heart

00:07:39.522 --> 00:07:43.123
that was injured and then received
three grafts of our human cardiac muscle.

00:07:43.147 --> 00:07:45.789
So you see those sort of diagonally
running white lines.

00:07:45.813 --> 00:07:47.299
Each of those is a needle track

00:07:47.323 --> 00:07:51.019
that contains a couple of million
human cardiac muscle cells in it.

00:07:51.713 --> 00:07:54.467
And when I start the video,
you can see what we saw

00:07:54.491 --> 00:07:56.511
when we looked through the microscope.

00:07:57.011 --> 00:07:58.574
Our cells are flashing,

00:07:58.598 --> 00:08:00.623
and they're flashing in synchrony,
