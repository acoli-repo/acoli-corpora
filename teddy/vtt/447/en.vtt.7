00:03:27.487 --> 00:03:31.384
Our bone marrow, for example, cranks out
billions of blood cells every day.

00:03:31.808 --> 00:03:34.242
Other tissues like the heart
are quite stable,

00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:38.426
and as far as we can tell,
the heart lacks stem cells entirely.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.411
So for the heart, we're going to have
to bring stem cells in from the outside,

00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:45.315
and for this, we turn to
the most potent stem cell type,

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:47.342
the pluripotent stem cell.

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:49.082
Pluripotent stem cells are so named

00:03:49.106 --> 00:03:52.175
because they can turn into
any of the 240-some cell types

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.053
that make up the human body.

00:03:54.684 --> 00:03:56.667
So this is my big idea:

00:03:56.691 --> 00:03:59.445
I want to take human
pluripotent stem cells,

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.596
grow them up in large numbers,
