Doctors said it was a cardiac arrhythmia
that was secondary to heart failure.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.984
But the last thing that I should tell you

00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.878
is that Donna was not just
an ordinary patient.

00:01:06.902 --> 00:01:08.458
Donna was my mother.

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:12.889
Stories like ours are,
unfortunately, far too common.

00:01:12.913 --> 00:01:15.872
Heart disease is the number one killer
in the entire world.

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:17.055
In the United States,

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.207
it's the most common reason

00:01:20.231 --> 00:01:22.289

00:01:22.313 --> 00:01:25.241

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:26.527
in this country every year

00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:28.383
on the treatment of heart disease.

00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:31.284
Just for reference, that's more than
twice the annual budget
