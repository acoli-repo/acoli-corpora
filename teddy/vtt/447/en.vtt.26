00:12:59.874 --> 00:13:02.324
Function in these
treated hearts is so good

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:06.178
that if we didn't know up front
that these animals had had a heart attack,

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:11.678
we would never be able to tell
from their functional studies.

00:13:12.757 --> 00:13:16.411
Going forward, our plan
is to start phase one,

00:13:16.435 --> 00:13:20.080
first in human trials here at
the University of Washington in 2020 --

00:13:20.104 --> 00:13:22.096
two short years from now.

00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:25.902
Presuming these studies
are safe and effective,

00:13:25.926 --> 00:13:27.872
which I think they're going to be,

00:13:27.896 --> 00:13:32.037
our plan is to scale this up
and ship these cells all around the world
