00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:33.792
And I was young,
I was full of it, and I thought,

00:04:33.816 --> 00:04:36.141
five years in the lab,
and we'll crank this out,

00:04:36.165 --> 00:04:38.739
and we'll have this into the clinic.

00:04:38.763 --> 00:04:40.793
Let me tell you what really happened.

00:04:40.817 --> 00:04:41.936
(Laughter)

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.665
We began with the quest to turn these
pluripotent stem cells into heart muscle.

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.205
And our first experiments worked, sort of.

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.995
We got these little clumps of beating
human heart muscle in the dish,

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:55.443
and that was cool,
because it said, in principle,

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:57.729
this should be able to be done.

00:04:57.753 --> 00:05:00.028
But when we got around
to doing the cell counts,
