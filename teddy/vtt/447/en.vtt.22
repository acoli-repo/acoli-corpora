00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.467
and they don't want to follow the rules
and the rhythms of the way you run things,

00:11:00.491 --> 00:11:02.463
and it takes a while to rein everybody in

00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:04.964
and get people working
in a coordinated fashion.

00:11:05.471 --> 00:11:06.720
So our plans at the moment

00:11:06.744 --> 00:11:09.887
are to make the cells go through
this troubled adolescence period

00:11:09.911 --> 00:11:11.893
while they're still in the dish,

00:11:11.917 --> 00:11:16.338
and then we'll transplant them in
in the post-adolescent phase,

00:11:16.362 --> 00:11:18.332
where they should be much more orderly

00:11:18.356 --> 00:11:21.086
and be ready to listen
to their marching orders.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.914
In the meantime, it turns out
we can actually do quite well

00:11:23.938 --> 00:11:26.342
by treating with
anti-arrhythmia drugs as well.

00:11:27.064 --> 00:11:29.654
So one big question still remains,

00:11:29.678 --> 00:11:32.967
and that is, of course, the whole purpose
that we set out to do this:
