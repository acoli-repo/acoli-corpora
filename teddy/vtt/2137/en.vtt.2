00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now this was in 1945.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
A computer in those days

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
was something the secret services used to use for code breaking.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And nobody knew anything about it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So this was before the computer was invented.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And he proposed this machine called the memex.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And he had a platform where you linked information to other information,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and then you could call it up at will.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So spinning forward,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and he was a U.S. Air Force officer.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And he was reading it in their library in the Far East.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And he was so inspired by this article,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
it kind of directed the rest of his life.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And by the mid-60s, he was able to put this into action
