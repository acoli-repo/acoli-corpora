00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
would take over the world one day.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything;

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
it was just plain text.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I thought, well, you know, interesting,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
but a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So we didn't do it.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
In the next couple of years,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the hypertext community didn't recognize him either.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
In 1992, his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
In 1993,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
there was a table at the conference in Seattle,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and a guy called Marc Andreessen

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.
