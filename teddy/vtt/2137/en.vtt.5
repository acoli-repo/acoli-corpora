00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So for a personal computer,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane;

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
it wasn't really very practical.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But spin on to the 80s

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
when personal computers did arrive,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And my company, OWL

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And this began to get a head of steam.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and they made a bit of a fuss about it.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched.
