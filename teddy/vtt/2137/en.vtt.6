00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The magazines started to cover it.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
had special issues covering hypertext.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We developed a PC version of this product

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
as well as the Macintosh version.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And our PC version became quite mature.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
You were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We developed a system such

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that it had a markup language based on html.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We called it hml: hypertext markup language.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And the system was capable of doing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
very, very large documentation systems over computer networks.
