WEBVTT

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And I saw it, and I thought, yep, that's it.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And the very next year, in 1994, we had the conference here in Edinburgh,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So that puts me in pretty illustrious company.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
There was a guy called Dick Rowe

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
There was a guy called Gary Kildall

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
who went flying his plane

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
when IBM came looking for an operating system

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
for the IBM PC,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and he wasn't there, so they went back to see Bill Gates.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And the 12 publishers

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess.
