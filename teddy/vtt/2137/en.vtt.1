00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And the article was called "As We May Think."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And what Vannevar Bush was saying

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
was the way we use information is broken.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We don't work in terms of libraries

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and catalog systems and so forth.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The brain works by association.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
With one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And the way information is structured

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is totally incapable of keeping up with this process.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And so he suggested a machine,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and he called it the memex.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And the memex would link information,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now this was in 1945.
