00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
What he showed --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
he sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
He had his head mic like I've got.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And he works this system.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And you can see, he's working between documents

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and graphics and so forth.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And he's driving it all

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
with this platform here,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
with a five-finger keyboard

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and the world's first computer mouse,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
which he specially designed in order to do this system.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So this is where the mouse came from as well.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So this is Doug Engelbart.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The trouble with Doug Engelbart's system

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.
