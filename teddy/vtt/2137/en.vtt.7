WEBVTT

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And the system was capable of doing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
very, very large documentation systems over computer networks.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
in late November 1990.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
would take over the world one day.
