00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well we all know the World Wide Web

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
has absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
commerce and social connectivity,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but where did it all come from?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I'll quote three people:

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So let's just run through these guys.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is Vannevar Bush.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And in 1945,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And the article was called "As We May Think."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And what Vannevar Bush was saying
