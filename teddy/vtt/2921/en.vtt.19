April 8, 2024, the moon's shadow
heads north from Texas to Maine.

00:09:32.723 --> 00:09:34.895
In 2045, on August 12,

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:37.657
the path cuts from California to Florida.

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:40.704
I say:

00:09:41.673 --> 00:09:44.264
What if we made these holidays?

00:09:44.288 --> 00:09:45.494
What if we --

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:46.546
(Laughter)

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.252
(Applause)

00:09:50.276 --> 00:09:55.333
What if we all stood together,

00:09:55.357 --> 00:09:57.433
as many people as possible,

00:09:57.457 --> 00:09:59.229
in the shadow of the moon?

00:09:59.253 --> 00:10:05.093
Just maybe, this shared experience of awe
would help heal our divisions,
