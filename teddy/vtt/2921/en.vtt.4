00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.267
And so I learned
that a few years later, in 1998,

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:06.078
a total eclipse was going
to cross the Caribbean.

00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:10.730
Now, a total eclipse is visible
only along a narrow path,

00:02:10.754 --> 00:02:12.434
about a hundred miles wide,

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.552
and that's where the moon's shadow falls.

00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:16.707
It's called the "path of totality."

00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:19.154
And in February 1998,

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:22.625
the path of totality
was going to cross Aruba.

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.965
So I talked to my husband,
and we thought: February? Aruba?

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.708
Sounded like a good idea anyway.

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:29.804
(Laughter)

00:02:29.828 --> 00:02:32.463
So we headed south,
