00:10:59.596 --> 00:11:02.712
I picture myself on that beach,

00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:04.172
looking at that sky,

00:11:05.037 --> 00:11:07.209
and I remember how I felt.

00:11:08.661 --> 00:11:11.273
My existence may be temporary,

00:11:11.978 --> 00:11:14.485
but that's OK because, my gosh,

00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:16.598
look at what I'm a part of.

00:11:18.214 --> 00:11:20.343
And so this is a lesson I've learned,

00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:22.930
and it's one that applies
to life in general:

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.205
duration of experience
does not equal impact.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:32.731
One weekend, one conversation --
hell, one glance --
