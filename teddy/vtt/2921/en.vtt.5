00:02:29.828 --> 00:02:32.463
So we headed south,

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:34.959
to enjoy the sun
and to see what would happen

00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:36.798
when the sun briefly went away.

00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:40.527
Well, the day of the eclipse
found us and many other people

00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.732
out behind the Hyatt Regency,

00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:43.919
on the beach,

00:02:43.943 --> 00:02:45.654
waiting for the show to begin.

00:02:45.678 --> 00:02:48.849
And we wore eclipse glasses
with cardboard frames

00:02:48.873 --> 00:02:52.992
and really dark lenses that enabled us
to look at the sun safely.

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:58.202
A total eclipse begins
as a partial eclipse,

00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:02.002
as the moon very slowly makes its way
in front of the sun.
