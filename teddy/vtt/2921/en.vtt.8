00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:00.960
And then all of a sudden,

00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:02.348
the lights went out.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.468
Well, at that,

00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:08.109
a cheer erupted from the beach,

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:10.026
and I took off my eclipse glasses,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.641
because at this point
during the total eclipse,

00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:15.760
it was safe to look at the sun
with the naked eye.

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:18.181
And I glanced upward,

00:04:20.006 --> 00:04:22.816
and I was just dumbstruck.

00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:30.278
Now, consider that, at this point,
I was in my mid-30s.
