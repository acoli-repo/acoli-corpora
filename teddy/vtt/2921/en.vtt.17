It makes us feel connected.

00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:41.976
Indeed, it promotes
empathy and generosity.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.595
Well, there is nothing truly more awesome
than a total solar eclipse.

00:08:48.497 --> 00:08:50.882

have seen one,

00:08:50.906 --> 00:08:53.126
because it's been 38 years

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.320

the continental United States

00:08:56.344 --> 00:09:00.412
and 99 years since one last crossed
the breadth of the nation.
