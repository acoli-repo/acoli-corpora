00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:01.398
And so let me tell you:

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.763
before you die,

00:08:04.787 --> 00:08:09.765
you owe it to yourself
to experience a total solar eclipse.

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:13.670
It is the ultimate experience of awe.

00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:19.364
Now, that word, "awesome,"
has grown so overused

00:08:19.388 --> 00:08:21.552
that it's lost its original meaning.

00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:26.055
True awe, a sense of wonder
and insignificance

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:28.610
in the face of something
enormous and grand,

00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:29.869
is rare in our lives.
