00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:02.002
as the moon very slowly makes its way
in front of the sun.

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:06.254
So first it looked the sun
had a little notch in its edge,

00:03:06.278 --> 00:03:09.399
and then that notch grew
larger and larger,

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:11.271
turning the sun into a crescent.

00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:15.579
And it was all very interesting,
but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.

00:03:15.603 --> 00:03:17.527
I mean, the day remained bright.

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:20.561
If I hadn't known
what was going on overhead,

00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:22.998
I wouldn't have noticed anything unusual.

00:03:24.052 --> 00:03:28.862
Well, about 10 minutes before
the total solar eclipse was set to begin,

00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:30.677
weird things started to happen.
