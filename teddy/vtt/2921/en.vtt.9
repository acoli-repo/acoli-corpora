00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:30.278
Now, consider that, at this point,
I was in my mid-30s.

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:36.915
I had lived on earth long enough
to know what the sky looks like.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:38.820
I mean --

00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:39.926
(Laughter)

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.044
I'd seen blue skies and grey skies

00:04:43.068 --> 00:04:47.009
and starry skies and angry skies

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:49.141
and pink skies at sunrise.

00:04:49.882 --> 00:04:52.946
But here was a sky I had never seen.

00:04:54.317 --> 00:04:56.593
First, there were the colors.

00:04:56.617 --> 00:04:59.582
Up above, it was a deep purple-grey,

00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.019
like twilight.
