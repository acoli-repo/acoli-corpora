00:06:30.387 --> 00:06:32.935
or it just kind of felt nonexistent,

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:36.043
and what I beheld with my eyes --

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:37.552
I didn't just see it,

00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:40.182
it felt like a vision.

00:06:41.858 --> 00:06:44.716
And I stood there in this nirvana

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.166
for all of 174 seconds --
less than three minutes --

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.573
when all of a sudden, it was over.

00:06:53.597 --> 00:06:54.948
The sun burst out,

00:06:54.972 --> 00:06:56.634
the blue sky returned,

00:06:56.658 --> 00:06:59.835
the stars and the planets
and the corona were gone.

00:06:59.859 --> 00:07:01.676
The world returned to normal.
