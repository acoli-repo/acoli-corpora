00:06:59.859 --> 00:07:01.676
The world returned to normal.

00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:04.296
But I had changed.

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:08.875
And that's how I became an umbraphile --

00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:10.747
an eclipse chaser.

00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:11.780
(Laughter)

00:07:11.804 --> 00:07:16.474
So, this is how I spend my time
and hard-earned money.

00:07:16.998 --> 00:07:22.627
Every couple of years, I head off
to wherever the moon's shadow will fall

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:25.041
to experience another couple minutes

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:26.525
of cosmic bliss,

00:07:26.549 --> 00:07:28.836
and to share the experience with others:

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.867
with friends in Australia,
