00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:32.093
I got some advice from an astronomer

00:00:32.117 --> 00:00:34.224
that challenged my outlook,

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:36.246
and frankly, changed my life.

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:39.384
You see, the story was about an eclipse,

00:00:39.408 --> 00:00:43.952
a partial solar eclipse
that was set to cross the country

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.808
in May of 1994.

00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:48.815
And the astronomer -- I interviewed him,

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.116
and he explained what was going to happen
and how to view it,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.361
but he emphasized that, as interesting
as a partial solar eclipse is,

00:00:57.385 --> 00:01:01.895
a much rarer total solar eclipse
is completely different.
