00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.019
like twilight.

00:05:01.043 --> 00:05:02.753
But on the horizon it was orange,

00:05:02.777 --> 00:05:04.078
like sunset,

00:05:04.102 --> 00:05:05.696
360 degrees.

00:05:06.426 --> 00:05:09.068
And up above, in the twilight,

00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:11.517
bright stars and planets had come out.

00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:13.143
So there was Jupiter

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:14.903
and there was Mercury

00:05:14.927 --> 00:05:16.200
and there was Venus.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.105
They were all in a line.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:23.482
And there, along this line,

00:05:24.288 --> 00:05:26.754
was this thing,

00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:30.302
this glorious, bewildering thing.
