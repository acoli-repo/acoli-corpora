In a total eclipse,
for all of two or three minutes,

00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:09.128

the face of the sun,

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:14.392
creating what he described
as the most awe-inspiring spectacle

00:01:14.416 --> 00:01:15.812
in all of nature.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.969
And so the advice he gave me was this:

00:01:20.087 --> 00:01:23.084

00:01:23.108 --> 00:01:27.385
"you owe it to yourself
to experience a total solar eclipse."

00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:30.586
Well honestly,
I felt a little uncomfortable
