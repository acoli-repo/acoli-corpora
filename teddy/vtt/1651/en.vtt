I am honored to be here,

00:00:06.388 --> 00:00:08.365
and I'm honored to talk about this topic,

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.214
which I think is of grave importance.

00:00:10.238 --> 00:00:11.461
We've been talking a lot

00:00:11.485 --> 00:00:17.428
about the horrific impacts of plastic
on the planet and on other species,

00:00:17.452 --> 00:00:19.460
but plastic hurts people, too --

00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:21.333
especially poor people.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.158
And both in the production of plastic,

00:00:25.182 --> 00:00:27.900
the use of plastic
and the disposal of plastic,

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:30.489
the people who have
the bull's-eye on their foreheads
