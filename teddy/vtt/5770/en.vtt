00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:04.547
Any reality we are given
is not set in stone,

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.166
it can be changed.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.659
I come from Costa Rica,

00:00:07.683 --> 00:00:10.888
a country known for our deep
commitment to peace,

00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:12.856
our high level of education

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.658
and our far-sighted stewardship of nature.

00:00:15.993 --> 00:00:17.933
But it wasn't always like that.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:19.857
Way back in the '40s,

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:22.366
my father, JosÃ© Figueres Ferrer,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.108
was a young farmer,
tilling the soil of these mountains,

00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:33.362
and cultivating his vision
of a country grounded in social justice
