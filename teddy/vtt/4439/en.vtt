Every day in this country,

00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:05.996
families are forced to make
impossible choices

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.113
when it comes to their health care.

00:00:08.137 --> 00:00:10.388
Like Kimberly, who said,

00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:15.634
"There was times I had to choose
between my food and my pills.

00:00:15.658 --> 00:00:18.989
It wasn't luxury stuff,
because I didn't make that much.

00:00:19.013 --> 00:00:21.869
It was like, 'Can I get
shampoo or conditioner?'

00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:24.299
Things you take for granted."

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:26.950
And Debbie, who said,

00:00:26.974 --> 00:00:29.773
"You put your medicine in one hand,

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:31.998
your living costs in the other.
