00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:33.150
And that allows a predictable,
affordable price

00:05:33.174 --> 00:05:35.742
that folks can actually budget for.

00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:41.239
We've already supplied enough medication
for 150,000 people.

00:05:41.756 --> 00:05:43.566
But we can do more.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.754
Our goal is to reach one million people

00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:50.817
with approaching a billion dollars
of unused medicine

00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:52.471
in the next five years,

00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:55.231
scaling our program to 12 states.

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:59.672
At this scale, we can actually cover
communities that are home

00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:03.614
to 40 percent of the 10 million people
