00:03:27.428 --> 00:03:31.134
by putting recycling bins into
these hundreds of facilities

00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:32.539
that have surplus.

00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:35.799
They fill the bin,
and when the box is full,

00:03:35.823 --> 00:03:39.725
SIRUM initiates a courier pickup
to pick up that medication,

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:46.262
and we handle the shipping, the tracking,
the manifests and the tax receipt.

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:51.278
Medicine donors want to donate
because it's actually cheaper and easier

00:03:51.302 --> 00:03:54.511
than the highly regulated
medicine destruction process.

00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:59.215
And there are strong tax incentives
to actually donate.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.674
We then deliver those donated medications
to people who need it.
