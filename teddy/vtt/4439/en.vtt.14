By using surplus medications
as a beachhead to force change

00:07:08.445 --> 00:07:11.877
into this multibillion dollar industry,

00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:15.920
we can create radical access
to medications

00:07:15.944 --> 00:07:18.139
based on a fundamental belief

00:07:18.163 --> 00:07:22.859
that people who live in one of
the wealthiest nations in the world

00:07:22.883 --> 00:07:27.417
can and should have access
to medicine that they need

00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:29.903
to survive and to thrive.
