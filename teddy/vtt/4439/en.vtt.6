It also comes from health care facilities

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:07.555
like hospitals, pharmacies
and nursing homes,

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.388
who end up with surplus
when a patient stops taking medication

00:03:11.412 --> 00:03:13.212
or when they pass away.

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:17.307
We can use this untapped
source of medications

00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:22.449
to supply all 10 million people
who need medications.

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:24.117
And we can do this today.

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:27.404

00:03:27.428 --> 00:03:31.134

these hundreds of facilities
