This waste is unconscionable,
but it also offers an opportunity.

00:02:32.236 --> 00:02:34.045
I started SIRUM,

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.349
a not-for-profit technology company,
with my cofounders Adam and George,

00:02:39.373 --> 00:02:43.452
to turn discarded medications
into a lifeline,

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:46.469
just like the medications
in this warehouse.

00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:48.441
We may not be able to fix

00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:51.896
all the ways in which
our health care system is failing us,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.307
but we can fix this one.

00:02:54.927 --> 00:02:59.561
Medications come from manufacturers
and wholesalers who have safety stock,

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:01.746
and when it's short-dated,
they destroy it.
