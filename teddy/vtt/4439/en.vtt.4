00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:01.837
Ten million -- it's a big number,

00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.858
but it's also a solvable number,

00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:07.921
because there's also 10 billion dollars

00:02:07.945 --> 00:02:11.313
of perfectly good, unused medication

00:02:11.337 --> 00:02:12.733
that goes to waste.

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:15.389
So this is an injustice on two sides:

00:02:15.413 --> 00:02:20.264
people not getting the medicine
that they need to survive and to thrive,

00:02:20.288 --> 00:02:25.917
and that very same medication
being sent to a medical waste incinerator

00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:27.293
to be destroyed.

00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:32.212
This waste is unconscionable,
but it also offers an opportunity.
