00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So for the past year and a half,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
my team at Push Pop Press

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
have been working on creating

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the first feature-length interactive book.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's called "Our Choice"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and the author is Al Gore.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth,"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and it explores all the solutions

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that will solve the climate crisis.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The book starts like this. This is the cover.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
As the globe spins,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we can see our location,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and we can open the book
