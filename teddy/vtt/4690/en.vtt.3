00:01:31.603 --> 00:01:33.565
Okay, so you'll wear a mask

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:35.142
to avoid destroying your face.

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.884
But what about people in buildings

00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:39.189
between you and your destination?

00:01:39.213 --> 00:01:41.945
It takes us approximately
one-fifth of a second

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.308
to react to what we see.

00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:45.142
By the time we see what is ahead of us

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.105
and react to it -

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:47.689
time times velocity equals distance

00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:48.709
equals one-fifth of a second

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.069
times 25,000 miles per hour

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:51.859
equals 1.4 miles

00:01:51.883 --> 00:01:53.391
- we would have gone past it

00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:56.082
or through it by over a mile.

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:57.821
We're either going to kill ourselves

00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:00.163
by crashing into the nearest
wall at super speed
