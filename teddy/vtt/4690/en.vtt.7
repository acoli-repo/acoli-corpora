00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:30.446
Remember, it's not the speed
that causes the damage

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.798
because the astronauts survived Apollo 10,

00:03:32.822 --> 00:03:34.222
it's the acceleration

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:35.758
or sudden stop

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:37.363
that causes our internal organs

00:03:37.387 --> 00:03:39.149
to crash into the front of our bodies

00:03:39.173 --> 00:03:40.697
the way we move forward in a bus

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.833
when the driver slams on the brakes.

00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:44.982
What the hero did to the girl

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:47.497
is mathematically the same
as running her over

00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:50.619
with a space shuttle at maximum speed.

00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:53.748
She probably died instantly
at the point of impact.

00:03:53.772 --> 00:03:56.446
He's going to owe this poor
girl's family an apology

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.995
and a big fat compensation check.

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.270
Oh, and possibly face jail time.
