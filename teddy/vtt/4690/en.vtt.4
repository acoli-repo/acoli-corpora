WEBVTT

00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:00.163
by crashing into the nearest
wall at super speed

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:02.557
or, worse, if we're indestructible,

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.915
we've essentially turned
our bodies into missiles

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.128
that destroy everything in our path.

00:02:08.152 --> 00:02:11.045
So, long distance travel
at 25,000 miles per hour

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.839
would leave us burning up,

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:13.632
covered in bugs,

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:16.639
and leaves no time to react.

00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:17.751
What about short bursts

00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:18.862
to a location we can see

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:20.915
with no obstacles in between?

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.385
Okay, let's say a bullet

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.631
is about to hit a beautiful
damsel in distress.

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:28.918
So, our hero swoops in at super speed,

00:02:28.942 --> 00:02:29.596
grabs her,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.346
and carries her to safety.
