00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.271
So, if we're running
at 25,000 miles per hour,

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:08.379
the heat from friction
would burn our faces off.

00:01:09.532 --> 00:01:11.441
Even if we somehow withstood the heat,

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:12.940
the sand and dirt in the air

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:14.164
would still scrape us up

00:01:14.188 --> 00:01:15.587
with millions of tiny cuts

00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:17.810
all happening at the same time.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.059
Ever seen the front bumper
or grill of a truck?

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:24.417
What do you think all the birds
and bugs would do

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:27.561
to your open eyes or exposed skin?
