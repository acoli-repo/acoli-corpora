00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.130
velocity equals zero miles per hour,

00:03:00.154 --> 00:03:02.741
begins accelerating to reach
the speed within seconds,

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:04.042
velocity increases rapidly

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.666
to 25,000 miles per hour,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.677
her brain would crash
into the side of her skull.

00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:11.991
And, when she stops suddenly,

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:14.892
velocity decreases rapidly
back to zero miles per hour,

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:17.688
her brain would crash
into the other side of her skull,

00:03:17.712 --> 00:03:21.991
turning her brain into mush.

00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:25.893
The brain is too fragile
to handle the sudden movement.

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:27.898
So is every part of her
body, for that matter.

00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:30.446
Remember, it's not the speed
that causes the damage
