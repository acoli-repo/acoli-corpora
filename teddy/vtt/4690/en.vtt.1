00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:30.024
Wouldn't we save a lot of time

00:00:30.048 --> 00:00:32.227
to be able to move that fast?

00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:34.897
But what's the catch?

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.582
Air is not empty.

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:38.704
Elements like oxygen and nitrogen,

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:40.370
even countless dust particles,

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:42.382
make up the air around us.

00:00:44.812 --> 00:00:47.129
When we move past these things in the air,

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:48.203
we're rubbing against them

00:00:48.227 --> 00:00:49.871
and creating a lot of friction,

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:51.433
which results in heat.

00:00:51.457 --> 00:00:53.886
Just like rubbing your hands
together warms them up

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.950
or rubbing two sticks together makes fire,

00:00:55.974 --> 00:00:57.498
the faster objects rub together,

00:00:57.522 --> 00:00:59.797
the more heat is generated.
