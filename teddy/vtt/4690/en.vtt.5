00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.346
and carries her to safety.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.307
That sounds very romantic,

00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:36.570
but, in reality, that girl
will probably suffer

00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:38.547
more damage from the hero than the bullet

00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:40.457
if he moved her at super speed.

00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:44.531
Newton's First Law of Motion
deals with inertia,

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:46.278
which is the resistance to a change

00:02:46.302 --> 00:02:48.203
in its state of motion.

00:02:48.227 --> 00:02:49.847
So, an object will continue moving

00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:51.311
or staying at the same place

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:53.404
unless something changes it.

00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:57.070
Acceleration is the rate
the velocity changes over time.

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:58.488
When the girl at rest,

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.130
velocity equals zero miles per hour,
