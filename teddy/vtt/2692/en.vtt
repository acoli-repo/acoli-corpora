00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.416
The language I'm speaking right now

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.776
is on its way to becoming
the world's universal language,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.136
for better or for worse.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.376
Let's face it,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.256
it's the language of the internet,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.256
it's the language of finance,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.616
it's the language of air traffic control,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.016
of popular music,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.256
diplomacy --

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.720
English is everywhere.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.416
Now, Mandarin Chinese
is spoken by more people,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.936
but more Chinese people
are learning English

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.656
than English speakers
are learning Chinese.
