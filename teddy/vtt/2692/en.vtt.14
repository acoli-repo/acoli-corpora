00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.816
is like driving on the different side
of a street if you go to certain country,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.336
or the feeling that you get when you
put Witch Hazel around your eyes

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.696
and you feel the tingle.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.296
A language can do that to you.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.536
So for example,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.576
"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,"

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.096
a book that I'm sure
we all often return to,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.376
like "Moby Dick."

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.496
One phrase in it is,
"Do you know where I found him?

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.176
Do you know where he was?
He was eating cake in the tub,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.416
Yes he was!"

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.776
Fine. Now, if you learn that
in Mandarin Chinese,
