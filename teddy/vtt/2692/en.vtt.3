I think there are a lot of reasons,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.736
but I first want to address

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.616
the one that you're probably
most likely to have heard of,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.976
because actually it's more
dangerous than you might think.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.736
And that is the idea

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.536
that a language channels your thoughts,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.936
that the vocabulary
and the grammar of different languages

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.776
gives everybody
a different kind of acid trip,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.016
so to speak.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.256
That is a marvelously enticing idea,
