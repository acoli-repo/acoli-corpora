00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.936
but a good 30 different vowels

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.856
scooching and oozing around
in the Cambodian mouth

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.216
like bees in a hive.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.760
That is what a language can get you.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.696
And more to the point,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.656
we live in an era when it's never been
easier to teach yourself another language.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.936
It used to be that you had
to go to a classroom,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.016
and there would be
some diligent teacher --

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.656
some genius teacher in there --

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.016
but that person was only
in there at certain times

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.296
and you had to go then,

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.136
and then was not most times.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.560
You had to go to class.

00:08:28.974 --> 00:08:31.736
If you didn't have that,
you had something called a record.
