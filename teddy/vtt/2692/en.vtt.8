It's not a matter of giving you
a different pair of glasses on the world.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.016
Now, if that's the case,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.976
then why learn languages?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.536
If it isn't going to change

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.160

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.920
There are some.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.976
One of them is that if you

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.136

if you want to become part of it,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.056
then whether or not
the language channels the culture --

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.016
and that seems doubtful --

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.856
if you want to imbibe the culture,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.336
you have to control to some degree
