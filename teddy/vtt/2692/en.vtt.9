00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.336
you have to control to some degree

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.696
the language that the culture
happens to be conducted in.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.416
There's no other way.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.936
There's an interesting
illustration of this.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.656
I have to go slightly obscure,
but really you should seek it out.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.016
There's a movie by the Canadian
film director Denys Arcand --

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.736
read out in English on the page,
"Dennis Ar-cand,"

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.096
if you want to look him up.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.176
He did a film called "Jesus of Montreal."

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.336
And many of the characters

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.416
are vibrant, funny, passionate,
interesting French-Canadian,
