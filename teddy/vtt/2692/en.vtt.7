And here is Ms. Kardashian,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.856
and she is an English speaker, too.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.656
So here are three speakers
of the English language.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.256
What worldview do those
three people have in common?

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.376
What worldview is shaped through
the English language that unites them?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.216
It's a highly fraught concept.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.096
And so gradual consensus is becoming
that language can shape thought,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.576
but it tends to be in rather darling,
obscure psychological flutters.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.200
It's not a matter of giving you
a different pair of glasses on the world.
