Fine. Now, if you learn that
in Mandarin Chinese,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.056
then you have to master,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.336
"You can know, I did where him find?

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.176
He was tub inside gorging cake,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.016
No mistake gorging chewing!"

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.256
That just feels good.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.576
Imagine being able to do that
for years and years at a time.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.936
Or, have you ever learned any Cambodian?

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.976
Me either, but if I did,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.616
I would get to roll around in my mouth
not some baker's dozen of vowels

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.896
like English has,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.936
but a good 30 different vowels
