00:08:28.974 --> 00:08:31.736
If you didn't have that,
you had something called a record.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.456
I cut my teeth on those.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.176
There was only so much data on a record,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.456
or a cassette,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.816
or even that antique object known as a CD.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.456
Other than that you had books
that didn't work,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.856
that's just the way it was.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.776
Today you can lay down --

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.256
lie on your living room floor,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.496
sipping bourbon,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.296
and teach yourself
any language that you want to

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.896
with wonderful sets
such as Rosetta Stone.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.056
I highly recommend
the lesser known Glossika as well.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.376
You can do it any time,
