00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.576
it's at the point where
instant translation of live speech

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.720
is not only possible,
but it gets better every year.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.096
The reason I'm reciting
those things to you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.256
is because I can tell
that we're getting to the point

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.496
where a question
is going to start being asked,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.056
which is: Why should we
learn foreign languages --

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.056
other than if English
happens to be foreign to one?

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.096
Why bother to learn another one
when it's getting to the point

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.600
where almost everybody in the world
will be able to communicate in one?
