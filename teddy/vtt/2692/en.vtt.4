That is a marvelously enticing idea,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.576
but it's kind of fraught.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.056
So it's not that it's untrue completely.

So for example, in French and Spanish

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:13.176
the word for table is,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.136

of one of those languages

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.776
and you happen to be asked

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.856
how you would imagine a table talking,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.776
then much more often
than could possibly be an accident,
