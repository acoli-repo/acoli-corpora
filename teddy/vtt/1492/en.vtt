Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last 25 years

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:09.307
of anti-poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for TED.

00:00:09.307 --> 00:00:13.304
That's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct.

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:15.369
(Laughter)

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.942
I said, "Chris, that would take a miracle."

00:00:19.942 --> 00:00:25.097
He said, "Bono, wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex?"

00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:27.118
So, yeah.

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:31.115
Then I thought, let's go even further than 25 years.
