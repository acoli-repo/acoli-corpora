00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.240
you'll stay in the more flexible,
informal economy.

00:02:31.264 --> 00:02:33.776
The law forces you to keep selling sex,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.751
which is the exact opposite
of its intended effect.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:41.544
Being criminalized leaves you exposed
to mistreatment by the state itself.

00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:44.333
In many places you may be coerced
into paying a bribe

00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:46.712
or even into having sex
with a police officer

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:47.925
to avoid arrest.

00:02:48.432 --> 00:02:51.360
Police and prison guards
in Cambodia, for example,

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:53.408
have been documented
subjecting sex workers

00:02:53.432 --> 00:02:55.721
to what can only be described as torture:

00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:56.896
threats at gunpoint,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.712
beatings, electric shocks, rape

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:01.176
and denial of food.
