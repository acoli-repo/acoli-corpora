00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.382
or getting an abortion

00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:01.766
or selling sex,

00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:04.371
you create more problems than you solve.

00:12:04.395 --> 00:12:06.184
Prohibition barely makes a difference

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.638
to the amount of people
actually doing those things.

00:12:08.672 --> 00:12:10.143
But it makes a huge difference

00:12:10.177 --> 00:12:13.096
as to whether or not
they're safe when they do them.

00:12:13.591 --> 00:12:15.890
Why else might people support prohibition?

00:12:16.787 --> 00:12:20.153
As a feminist, I know
that the sex industry is a site

00:12:20.177 --> 00:12:23.057
of deeply entrenched social inequality.

00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:26.133
It's a fact that most buyers of sex
are men with money,

00:12:26.157 --> 00:12:28.448
and most sellers are women without.

00:12:28.472 --> 00:12:30.772
You can agree with all that -- I do --
