WEBVTT

00:06:29.413 --> 00:06:31.138
is to force you to lower your prices

00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:33.567
or offer more risky sexual services.

00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:35.164
If you need to find more clients,

00:06:35.188 --> 00:06:36.986
you might seek the help of a manager.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.990
So you see, rather than putting a stop

00:06:39.014 --> 00:06:40.847
to what's often descried as pimping,

00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:42.891
a law like this actually gives oxygen

00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:44.951
to potentially abusive third parties.

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:47.419
To keep safe in my work,

00:06:47.443 --> 00:06:49.336
I try not to take bookings from someone

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.110
who calls me from a withheld number.

00:06:51.134 --> 00:06:53.059
If it's a home or a hotel visit,

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:55.252
I try to get a full name and details.

00:06:55.703 --> 00:06:57.830
If I worked under the Swedish model,

00:06:57.854 --> 00:07:00.552
a client would be too scared
to give me that information.
