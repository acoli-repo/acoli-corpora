Regulation sounds great on paper,

00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:03.467
but politicians deliberately make
regulation around the sex industry

00:08:03.491 --> 00:08:06.158
expensive and difficult to comply with.

00:08:06.182 --> 00:08:10.526
It creates a two-tiered system:
legal and illegal work.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.552
We sometimes call it
"backdoor criminalization."

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:16.997
Rich, well-connected brothel owners
can comply with the regulations,

00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:19.194
but more marginalized people
find those hoops

00:08:19.218 --> 00:08:21.172
impossible to jump through.

00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:23.166
And even if it's possible in principle,

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.175
getting a license or proper venue
takes time and costs money.

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:27.678
It's not going to be an option

00:08:27.702 --> 00:08:30.156
for someone who's desperate
and needs money tonight.
