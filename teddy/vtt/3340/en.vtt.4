00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.545
regulates sex work by criminalizing
everyone involved.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.697
So that's seller, buyer and third parties.

00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:06.806
Lawmakers in these countries
apparently hope

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.702
that the fear of getting arrested
will deter people from selling sex.

00:02:10.726 --> 00:02:13.278
But if you're forced to choose
between obeying the law

00:02:13.302 --> 00:02:15.286
and feeding yourself or your family,

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.087
you're going to do the work anyway,

00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:18.546
and take the risk.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.487
Criminalization is a trap.

00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:24.585
It's hard to get a conventional job
when you have a criminal record.

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.605
Potential employers won't hire you.

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:28.425
Assuming you still need money,

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.240
you'll stay in the more flexible,
informal economy.
