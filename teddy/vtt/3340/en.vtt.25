You can agree with all that -- I do --

00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:34.102
and still think prohibition
is a terrible policy.

00:12:34.783 --> 00:12:36.921
In a better, more equal world,

00:12:36.945 --> 00:12:40.573
maybe there would be far fewer
people selling sex to survive,

00:12:40.597 --> 00:12:44.208
but you can't simply legislate
a better world into existence.

00:12:44.232 --> 00:12:46.718
If someone needs to sell sex
because they're poor

00:12:46.742 --> 00:12:48.184
or because they're homeless

00:12:48.208 --> 00:12:51.350
or because they're undocumented
and they can't find legal work,

00:12:51.374 --> 00:12:54.929
taking away that option
doesn't make them any less poor

00:12:54.953 --> 00:12:56.576
or house them

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.553
or change their immigration status.

00:12:58.577 --> 00:13:01.108
People worry that selling
sex is degrading.
