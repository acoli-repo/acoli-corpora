00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.512
that voters don't want
to see or know about.

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:07.076

00:10:07.465 --> 00:10:11.122
Well, lots of people have
understandable fears about trafficking.

00:10:11.664 --> 00:10:15.511
Folks think that foreign women
kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery

00:10:15.535 --> 00:10:18.153

a whole industry down.

especially those where the workers
are migrants or otherwise vulnerable,

00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:30.047
and this needs to be addressed.
