00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:01.176
and denial of food.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:03.313
Another worrying thing:

00:03:03.337 --> 00:03:07.736
if you're selling sex in places
like Kenya, South Africa or New York,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.456
a police officer can arrest you
if you're caught carrying condoms,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.482
because condoms can legally be used
as evidence that you're selling sex.

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:17.948
Obviously, this increases HIV risk.

00:03:17.972 --> 00:03:20.432
Imagine knowing if you're busted
carrying condoms,

00:03:20.456 --> 00:03:22.310
it'll be used against you.

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:25.336
It's a pretty strong incentive
to leave them at home, right?

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.666
Sex workers working in these places
are forced to make a tough choice

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.451
between risking arrest
or having risky sex.
