00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:00.610
and that means working alone

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.669
or in isolated locations like dark forests

00:05:02.693 --> 00:05:04.745
where they're vulnerable to attack.

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:06.666
If you're caught selling sex outdoors,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.908
you pay a fine.

00:05:08.353 --> 00:05:11.152
How do you pay that fine
without going back to the streets?

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:13.723
It was the need for money
that saw you in the streets

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:14.898
in the first place.

00:05:14.922 --> 00:05:16.445
And so the fines stack up,

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.207
and you're caught in a vicious cycle

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:21.591
of selling sex to pay the fines
you got for selling sex.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.892
Let me tell you about Mariana Popa
who worked in Redbridge, East London.

00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:29.443
The street workers on her patch
would normally wait for clients in groups

00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:30.763
for safety in numbers
