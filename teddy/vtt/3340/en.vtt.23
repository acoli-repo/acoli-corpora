00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:30.105
hospitality work and domestic work.

00:11:30.653 --> 00:11:34.046
Ultimately, nobody wants
to be forced to do any kind of work,

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.571
but that's a risk many migrants
are willing to take,

00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:38.465
because of what they're leaving behind.

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.449
If people were allowed to migrate legally

00:11:40.473 --> 00:11:44.010
they wouldn't have to place their lives
into the hands of people smugglers.

00:11:44.034 --> 00:11:45.185
The problems arise

00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:47.034
from the criminalization of migration,

00:11:47.058 --> 00:11:49.019
just as they do from the criminalization

00:11:49.043 --> 00:11:50.194
of sex work itself.

00:11:50.218 --> 00:11:51.800
This is a lesson of history.

00:11:51.824 --> 00:11:55.470
If you try to prohibit something
that people want or need to do,

00:11:55.494 --> 00:11:59.069
whether that's drinking alcohol
or crossing borders

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.382
or getting an abortion
