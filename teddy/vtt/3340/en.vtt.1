00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.966
In fact, most of those people would say,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.778
"There should be a law against it!"

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:34.965
Maybe that sounds reasonable to you.

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:39.808
It sounded reasonable to me
until the closing months of 2009,

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:43.013
when I was working two dead-end,
minimum-wage jobs.

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.048
Every month my wages would just
replenish my overdraft.

00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:49.627
I was exhausted and my life
was going nowhere.

00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:52.033
Like many others before me,

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:54.450
I decided sex for money
was a better option.

00:00:55.203 --> 00:00:56.441
Now don't get me wrong --

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:58.872
I would have loved
to have won the lottery instead.

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.991
But it wasn't going
to happen anytime soon,
