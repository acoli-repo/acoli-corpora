00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:00.874
I want to talk about --

00:06:00.898 --> 00:06:02.986
the Swedish or Nordic
model of sex-work law.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.237
The idea behind this law

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:06.724
is that selling sex
is intrinsically harmful

00:06:06.748 --> 00:06:10.250
and so you're, in fact, helping
sex workers by removing the option.

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:12.002
Despite growing support

00:06:12.026 --> 00:06:14.708
for what's often described
as the "end demand" approach,

00:06:14.732 --> 00:06:16.375
there's no evidence that it works.

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:19.738
There's just as much prostitution
in Sweden as there was before.

00:06:19.762 --> 00:06:21.178
Why might that be?

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.567
It's because people selling sex

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.707
often don't have other options for income.

00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:26.883
If you need that money,

00:06:26.907 --> 00:06:29.389
the only effect that a drop
in business is going have

00:06:29.413 --> 00:06:31.138
is to force you to lower your prices
