00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.281
Well, sex work is work, too.

00:16:30.877 --> 00:16:32.033
Just like you,

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.663
some of us like our jobs,

00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:35.088
some of us hate them.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.413
Ultimately, most of us
have mixed feelings.

00:16:39.238 --> 00:16:41.644
But how we feel about our work

00:16:42.566 --> 00:16:43.740
isn't the point.

00:16:44.484 --> 00:16:47.502
And how others feel
about our work certainly isn't.

00:16:48.373 --> 00:16:51.121
What's important is that we have
the right to work safely

00:16:51.145 --> 00:16:52.453
and on our own terms.

00:16:52.477 --> 00:16:54.352
Sex workers are real people.

00:16:54.823 --> 00:16:57.003
We've had complicated experiences

00:16:57.655 --> 00:17:00.710
and complicated responses
to those experiences.
