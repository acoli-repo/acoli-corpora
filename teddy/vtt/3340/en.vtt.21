00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:30.047
and this needs to be addressed.

00:10:30.535 --> 00:10:34.814
But it's best addressed with legislation
targeting those specific abuses,

00:10:34.838 --> 00:10:36.354
not an entire industry.

00:10:36.791 --> 00:10:39.168
When 23 undocumented Chinese migrants

00:10:39.192 --> 00:10:42.109
drowned while picking cockles
in Morecambe Bay in 2004,

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:45.069
there were no calls to outlaw
the entire seafood industry

00:10:45.093 --> 00:10:47.154
to save trafficking victims.

00:10:47.178 --> 00:10:50.533
The solution is clearly to give
workers more legal protections,

00:10:50.557 --> 00:10:52.326
allowing them to resist abuse

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.390
and report it to authorities
without fear of arrest.

00:10:55.414 --> 00:10:57.714
The way the term trafficking
is thrown around

00:10:57.738 --> 00:11:01.959
implies that all undocumented
migration into prostitution is forced.
