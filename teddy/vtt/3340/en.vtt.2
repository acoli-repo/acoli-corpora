00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.991
But it wasn't going
to happen anytime soon,

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:02.425
and my rent needed paying.

00:01:02.832 --> 00:01:05.353
So I signed up for my first
shift in a brothel.

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:08.020
In the years that have passed,

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:09.878
I've had a lot of time to think.

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:13.917
I've reconsidered the ideas
I once had about prostitution.

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.846
I've given a lot of thought to consent

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.099
and the nature of work under capitalism.

00:01:18.552 --> 00:01:20.338
I've thought about gender inequality

00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:22.878
and the sexual and reproductive
labor of women.

00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:26.684
I've experienced exploitation
and violence at work.

00:01:27.142 --> 00:01:28.717
I've thought about what's needed

00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:30.971
to protect other sex workers
from these things.
