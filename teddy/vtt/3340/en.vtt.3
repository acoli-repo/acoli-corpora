00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:30.971
to protect other sex workers
from these things.

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:33.104
Maybe you've thought about them, too.

00:01:33.128 --> 00:01:34.285
In this talk,

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:36.778
I'll take you through
the four main legal approaches

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:38.786
applied to sex work throughout the world,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.373
and explain why they don't work;

00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:43.555
why prohibiting the sex industry
actually exacerbates every harm

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.489
that sex workers are vulnerable to.

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:50.478
Then I'm going tell you about what we,
as sex workers, actually want.

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:54.541
The first approach
is full criminalization.

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:56.076
Half the world,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.594
including Russia, South Africa
and most of the US,

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.545
regulates sex work by criminalizing
everyone involved.
