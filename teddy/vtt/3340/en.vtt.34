00:16:57.655 --> 00:17:00.710
and complicated responses
to those experiences.

00:17:01.651 --> 00:17:04.427
But our demands are not complicated.

00:17:04.451 --> 00:17:07.248
You can ask expensive
escorts in New York City,

00:17:07.272 --> 00:17:10.210
brothel workers in Cambodia,
street workers in South Africa

00:17:10.234 --> 00:17:13.353
and every girl on the roster
at my old job in Soho,

00:17:13.377 --> 00:17:15.717
and they will all tell you the same thing.

00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:17.982
You can speak to millions of sex workers

00:17:18.006 --> 00:17:20.463
and countless sex work-led organizations.

00:17:20.487 --> 00:17:24.457
We want full decriminalization
and labor rights as workers.

00:17:24.985 --> 00:17:27.301
I'm just one sex worker
on the stage today,

00:17:27.325 --> 00:17:29.895
but I'm bringing a message
from all over the world.

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:31.087
Thank you.
