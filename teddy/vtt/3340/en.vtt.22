00:10:57.738 --> 00:11:01.959
implies that all undocumented
migration into prostitution is forced.

00:11:02.423 --> 00:11:05.429
In fact, many migrants
have made a decision,

00:11:05.453 --> 00:11:06.707
out of economic need,

00:11:06.731 --> 00:11:09.514
to place themselves into the hands
of people smugglers.

00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:11.320
Many do this with the full knowledge

00:11:11.344 --> 00:11:14.547
that they'll be selling sex
when they reach their destination.

00:11:14.571 --> 00:11:16.324
And yes, it can often be the case

00:11:16.348 --> 00:11:19.593
that these people smugglers
demand exorbitant fees,

00:11:19.617 --> 00:11:22.521
coerce migrants into work
they don't want to do

00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:24.432
and abuse them when they're vulnerable.

00:11:24.456 --> 00:11:25.959
That's true of prostitution,

00:11:25.983 --> 00:11:27.930
but it's also true of agricultural work,

00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:30.105
hospitality work and domestic work.
