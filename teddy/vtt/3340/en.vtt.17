00:08:27.702 --> 00:08:30.156
for someone who's desperate
and needs money tonight.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.222
They might be a refugee
or fleeing domestic abuse.

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:34.785
In this two-tiered system,

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.046
the most vulnerable people
are forced to work illegally,

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.086

00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:55.839
and allows clients and even cops

00:08:55.863 --> 00:08:58.632
to get abusive in the knowledge
they'll get away with it.

00:08:58.656 --> 00:09:01.817
Fines and criminal records force
people to keep selling sex,
