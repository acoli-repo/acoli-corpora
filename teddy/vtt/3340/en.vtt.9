00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:30.387
we had another guy turn nasty.

00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:33.139
I told the guy to leave
or I'd call the police.

00:04:33.163 --> 00:04:35.754
And he looked at the two of us and said,

00:04:35.778 --> 00:04:37.888
"You girls can't call the cops.

00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:40.660
You're working together,
this place is illegal."

00:04:40.684 --> 00:04:41.847
He was right.

00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:44.454
He eventually left
without getting physically violent,

00:04:44.478 --> 00:04:46.702
but the knowledge
that we were breaking the law

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:48.416
empowered that man to threaten us.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.441
He felt confident he'd get away with it.

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:53.744
The prohibition of street prostitution
also causes more harm

00:04:53.768 --> 00:04:54.920
than it prevents.

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:56.936
Firstly, to avoid getting arrested,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.223
street workers take risks
to avoid detection,

00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:00.610
and that means working alone
