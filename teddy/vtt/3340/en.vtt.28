00:13:58.542 --> 00:14:00.406
How safe is she at work tonight?

00:14:01.155 --> 00:14:02.684
Why isn't she safer?

00:14:04.497 --> 00:14:07.418
So we've looked at full criminalization,

00:14:07.442 --> 00:14:10.445
partial criminalization,
the Swedish or Nordic Model

00:14:10.469 --> 00:14:11.659
and legalization,

00:14:11.683 --> 00:14:13.335
and how they all cause harm.

00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:16.311
Something I never hear asked is:

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:18.509
"What do sex workers want?"

00:14:19.573 --> 00:14:22.241
After all, we're the ones
most affected by these laws.

00:14:23.115 --> 00:14:25.995
New Zealand decriminalized
sex work in 2003.

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.433
It's crucial to remember

00:14:28.457 --> 00:14:31.908
that decriminalization and legalization
are not the same thing.
