WEBVTT

00:15:27.805 --> 00:15:31.265
demanding decriminalization
and self-determination.

00:15:31.653 --> 00:15:34.393
The universal symbol of our movement
is the red umbrella.

00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:37.518
We're supported in our demands
by global bodies like UNAIDS,

00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:39.142
the World Health Organization

00:15:39.166 --> 00:15:40.552
and Amnesty International.

00:15:40.924 --> 00:15:42.762
But we need more allies.

00:15:43.181 --> 00:15:45.517
If you care about gender equality

00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:48.337
or poverty or migration or public health,

00:15:48.361 --> 00:15:50.865
then sex worker rights matter to you.

00:15:51.355 --> 00:15:53.378
Make space for us in your movements.

00:15:53.402 --> 00:15:56.638
That means not only listening
to sex workers when we speak

00:15:56.662 --> 00:15:58.663
but amplifying our voices.

00:15:59.219 --> 00:16:01.340
Resist those who silence us,
