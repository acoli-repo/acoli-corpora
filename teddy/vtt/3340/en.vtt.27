00:13:29.454 --> 00:13:30.913
when it comes to sex.

00:13:31.546 --> 00:13:34.791
But we can't make policy
on the basis of mere feelings,

00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:36.877
especially not over
the heads of the people

00:13:36.901 --> 00:13:38.639
actually effected by those policies.

00:13:38.663 --> 00:13:41.282
If we get fixated on
the abolition of sex work,

00:13:41.306 --> 00:13:43.970
we end up worrying more
about a particular manifestation

00:13:43.994 --> 00:13:45.407
of gender inequality,

00:13:45.431 --> 00:13:47.753
rather than about the underlying causes.

00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:50.764
People get really hung up on the question,

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:53.256
"Well, would you want
your daughter doing it?"

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.790
That's the wrong question.

00:13:55.217 --> 00:13:57.885
Instead, imagine she is doing it.

00:13:58.542 --> 00:14:00.406
How safe is she at work tonight?
