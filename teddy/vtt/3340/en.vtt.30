00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.051
in the amount of people doing sex work,

00:15:00.075 --> 00:15:02.699
but decriminalizing it
has made it a lot safer.

00:15:03.274 --> 00:15:04.851
But the lesson from New Zealand

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:07.272
isn't just that its particular
legislation is good,

00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:08.447
but that crucially,

00:15:08.471 --> 00:15:10.790
it was written in collaboration
with sex workers;

00:15:10.814 --> 00:15:13.123
namely, the New Zealand
Prostitutes' Collective.

00:15:13.147 --> 00:15:15.476
When it came to making sex work safer,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.689
they were ready to hear it straight
from sex workers themselves.

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:20.401
Here in the UK,

00:15:20.425 --> 00:15:23.843
I'm part of sex worker-led groups
like the Sex Worker Open University

00:15:23.867 --> 00:15:25.962
and the English Collective of Prostitutes.

00:15:25.986 --> 00:15:27.781
And we form part of a global movement

00:15:27.805 --> 00:15:31.265
demanding decriminalization
and self-determination.
