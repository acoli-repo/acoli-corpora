00:00:59.108 --> 00:01:01.183
and then I want to describe the scale

00:01:01.183 --> 00:01:03.046
of the problem I think we face

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:05.472
and then suggest the ways that I believe cities

00:01:05.472 --> 00:01:07.992
can be the seat of the solution.

00:01:07.992 --> 00:01:11.780
So let me start with some definitions.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.557
By civics, I simply mean the art

00:01:13.557 --> 00:01:16.808
of being a pro-social, problem-solving contributor

00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:18.935
in a self-governing community.

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:21.364
Civics is the art of citizenship,

00:01:21.364 --> 00:01:23.479
what Bill Gates Sr. calls simply

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.571
showing up for life,

00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:27.956
and it encompasses three things:

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:31.500
a foundation of values,
