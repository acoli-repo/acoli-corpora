00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.452
Now, part of the art of practicing power

00:07:31.452 --> 00:07:33.512
means being awake and having a voice,

00:07:33.512 --> 00:07:35.897
but it also is about having an arena

00:07:35.897 --> 00:07:39.959
where you can plausibly practice deciding.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.141
All of civics boils down to the simple question

00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:43.899
of who decides,

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:45.661
and you have to play that out

00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:47.694
in a place, in an arena.

00:07:47.694 --> 00:07:50.622
And this brings me to the third
point that I want to make today,

00:07:50.622 --> 00:07:54.233
which is simply that there is no better arena

00:07:54.233 --> 00:07:57.282
in our time for the practicing of power

00:07:57.282 --> 00:08:00.174
than the city.
