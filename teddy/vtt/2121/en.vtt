I'm a teacher and a practitioner

00:00:02.014 --> 00:00:04.499
of civics in America.

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:07.571
Now, I will kindly ask those of
you who have just fallen asleep

00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:09.683
to please wake up. (Laughter)

00:00:09.683 --> 00:00:11.974
Why is it that the very word "civics"

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:14.865
has such a soporific, 
even a narcoleptic effect

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:16.171
on us?

00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:20.312
I think it's because the very 
word signifies something

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:23.420
exceedingly virtuous, 
exceedingly important,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.830
and exceedingly boring.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.883
Well, I think it's the responsibility of people like us,

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:30.637
people who show up for gatherings like this
