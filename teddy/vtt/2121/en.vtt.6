00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:03.617

those who understand

00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:12.134

00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:16.289

or how a bias becomes a policy,

00:03:19.694 --> 00:03:22.629
or how a slogan becomes a movement,

the people who understand those things

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.180
wield disproportionate influence,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.660
and they're perfectly happy

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.740
to fill the vacuum created by the ignorance
