00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.696
Now, as I say, these are just two examples

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:33.400
drawn almost at random from the headlines.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.600
Every day, there are thousands more like them.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.364
And you may like or dislike

00:10:38.364 --> 00:10:40.269
the efforts I'm describing here

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:41.598
in Boulder or in Tuscaloosa,

00:10:41.598 --> 00:10:44.240
but you cannot help but admire

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.311
the power literacy of the players involved,

00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:48.486
their skill.

00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:51.462
You cannot help but reckon with and recognize

00:10:51.462 --> 00:10:53.073
the command they have

00:10:53.073 --> 00:10:55.608
of the elemental questions

00:10:55.608 --> 00:10:57.484
of civic power —

00:10:57.484 --> 00:11:01.522
what objective, what strategy, what tactics,
