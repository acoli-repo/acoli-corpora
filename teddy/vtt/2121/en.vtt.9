00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.510
stop-and-frisk, for instance,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.166
became over time a bureaucratic numbers game.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:38.271
How does a slogan become a movement?

00:04:38.271 --> 00:04:41.252
Virally, in the way that the Tea Party, for instance,

00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:44.718
was able to take the "Don't Tread on Me" flag

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:46.465
from the American Revolution,

00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:48.315
or how, on the other side,

00:04:48.315 --> 00:04:51.279
a band of activists could take a magazine headline,

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:53.216
"Occupy Wall Street,"

00:04:53.216 --> 00:04:56.132
and turn that into a global meme and movement.

00:04:56.132 --> 00:04:58.638
The thing is, though, most people

00:04:58.638 --> 00:05:01.890
aren't looking for and don't
want to see these realities.
