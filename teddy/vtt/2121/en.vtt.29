00:14:29.458 --> 00:14:31.885
with the stories and the experiences

00:14:31.885 --> 00:14:35.142
and the challenges that each of you lives and faces,

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:38.146
to create something powerfully collective.

00:14:38.146 --> 00:14:40.557
And I want to invite you in particular to try

00:14:40.557 --> 00:14:42.656
a simple exercise drawn

00:14:42.656 --> 00:14:45.199
from the early frameworks of this curriculum.

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:47.630
I want you to write a narrative,

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.680
a narrative from the future of your city,

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.221
and you can date it, set it out one year from now,

00:14:54.221 --> 00:14:55.965
five years from now, a decade from now,

00:14:55.965 --> 00:14:57.766
a generation from now,

00:14:57.766 --> 00:15:01.611
and write it as a case study looking back,
