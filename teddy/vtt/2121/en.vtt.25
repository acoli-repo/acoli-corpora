The localism of our time is networked powerfully.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:32.873
And so, for instance,

00:12:32.873 --> 00:12:35.036
consider the ways that strategies

00:12:35.036 --> 00:12:37.470
for making cities more bike-friendly

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.016
have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen

00:12:40.016 --> 00:12:45.138
to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle.

00:12:45.138 --> 00:12:48.702
Think about how experiments
in participatory budgeting,

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:50.175
where everyday citizens get a chance

00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:52.976
to allocate and decide upon

00:12:52.976 --> 00:12:55.910
the allocation of city funds.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.490
Those experiments have
spread from Porto Alegre, Brazil

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.840
to here in New York City, 
to the wards of Chicago.
