WEBVTT

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:31.500
a foundation of values,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.266
an understanding of the systems
that make the world go round,

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.620
and a set of skills

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.104
that allow you to pursue goals

00:01:39.104 --> 00:01:42.777
and to have others join in that pursuit.

00:01:42.777 --> 00:01:45.036
And that brings me to my definition of power,

00:01:45.036 --> 00:01:47.204
which is simply this:

00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:49.870
the capacity to make others do

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.631
what you would have them do.

00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:55.312
It sounds menacing, doesn't it?

00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:57.653
We don't like to talk about power.

00:01:57.653 --> 00:02:03.347
We find it scary. We find it somehow evil.
