00:10:57.484 --> 00:11:01.522
what objective, what strategy, what tactics,

00:11:01.522 --> 00:11:04.500
what is the terrain, who are your enemies,

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.650
who are your allies?

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.395
Now I want you to return

00:11:08.395 --> 00:11:11.790
to thinking about that problem or that opportunity

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.951
or that challenge in your city,

00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:15.824
and the thing it was that you want to fix

00:11:15.824 --> 00:11:17.635
or create in your city,

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.950
and ask yourself,

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.600
do you have command of these
elemental questions of power?

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.650
Could you put into practice effectively

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.664
what it is that you know?

00:11:29.664 --> 00:11:34.061
This is the challenge and the opportunity for us.
