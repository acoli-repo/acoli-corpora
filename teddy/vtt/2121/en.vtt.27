00:13:28.733 --> 00:13:32.288
of anti-corruption activists all around the world.

00:13:32.288 --> 00:13:34.223
In Seattle, where I'm from,

00:13:34.223 --> 00:13:36.669
we've become part of a great global array of cities

00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:38.228
that are now working together

00:13:38.228 --> 00:13:39.758
bypassing government altogether,

00:13:39.758 --> 00:13:42.138
national government altogether,

00:13:42.138 --> 00:13:44.487
in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals

00:13:44.487 --> 00:13:46.627
of the Kyoto Protocol.

00:13:46.627 --> 00:13:49.670
All of these citizens, united,

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.345
are forming a web,

00:13:51.345 --> 00:13:53.358
a great archipelago of power

00:13:53.358 --> 00:13:55.765
that allows us to bypass

00:13:55.765 --> 00:13:59.669
brokenness and monopolies of control.

00:13:59.669 --> 00:14:02.550
And our task now is to accelerate this work.
