00:11:29.664 --> 00:11:34.061
This is the challenge and the opportunity for us.

00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:36.577
We live in a time right now

00:11:36.577 --> 00:11:39.564
where in spite of globalization

00:11:39.564 --> 00:11:41.724
or perhaps because of globalization,

00:11:41.724 --> 00:11:43.760
all citizenship is ever more resonantly,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.540
powerfully local.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.248
Indeed, power in our time is flowing

00:11:48.248 --> 00:11:50.610
ever faster to the city.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.258
Here in the United States, the national government

00:11:52.258 --> 00:11:55.259
has tied itself up in partisan knots.

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:58.181
Civic imagination and innovation and creativity

00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:00.798
are emerging from local ecosystems now
