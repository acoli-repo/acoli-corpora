than the city.

00:08:00.174 --> 00:08:02.028
Think about the city where you live,

00:08:02.028 --> 00:08:03.885

00:08:03.885 --> 00:08:07.136
Think about a problem in

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:08.169
It can be something small,

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:10.676

like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be

00:08:20.502 --> 00:08:23.437
turned into a highway or a greenway,

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:25.135
or whether all the businesses in your town

00:08:25.135 --> 00:08:29.185
should be required to pay a living wage.

00:08:29.185 --> 00:08:31.536
Think about the change that you want in your city,
