00:09:58.342 --> 00:10:00.278
there's an organization on campus

00:10:00.278 --> 00:10:04.151
called, kind of menacingly, the Machine,

00:10:04.151 --> 00:10:07.522
and it draws from largely white sororities

00:10:07.522 --> 00:10:08.962
and fraternities on campus,

00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:11.381
and for decades, the Machine has dominated

00:10:11.381 --> 00:10:13.234
student government elections.

00:10:13.234 --> 00:10:15.630
Well now, recently, the Machine

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.927
has started to get involved

00:10:16.927 --> 00:10:18.610
in actual city politics,

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.268
and they've engineered the election

00:10:20.268 --> 00:10:21.640
of a former Machine member,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.346
a young, pro-business recent graduate

00:10:24.346 --> 00:10:27.860
to the Tuscaloosa city school board.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.696
Now, as I say, these are just two examples
