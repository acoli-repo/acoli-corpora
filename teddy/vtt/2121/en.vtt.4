00:01:57.653 --> 00:02:03.347
We find it scary. We find it somehow evil.

00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:05.129
We feel uncomfortable naming it.

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:07.542
In the culture and mythology of democracy,

00:02:07.542 --> 00:02:09.285
power resides with the people.

00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:11.078
Period. End of story.

00:02:11.078 --> 00:02:12.653
Any further inquiry not necessary

00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:14.633
and not really that welcome.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:18.691
Power has a negative moral valence.

00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:21.473
It sounds Machiavellian inherently.

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:24.107
It seems inherently evil.

00:02:24.107 --> 00:02:27.912
But in fact power is no more inherently good or evil

00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:31.030
than fire or physics.
