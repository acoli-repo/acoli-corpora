00:09:28.182 --> 00:09:30.494
literally the power company,
the electric company Xcel,

00:09:30.494 --> 00:09:32.790
with a publicly owned utility

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.136
that would forego profits

00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:37.845
and attend far more to climate change.

00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:39.970
Well, Xcel fought back,

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.330
and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.226
that would undermine or undo

00:09:44.226 --> 00:09:46.022
this municipalization.

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:48.636
And so the citizen activists in
Boulder who have been pushing this

00:09:48.636 --> 00:09:51.370

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.969
in order to fight for power.

00:09:53.969 --> 00:09:58.342
In Tuscaloosa, at the University of Alabama,

00:09:58.342 --> 00:10:00.278
there's an organization on campus
