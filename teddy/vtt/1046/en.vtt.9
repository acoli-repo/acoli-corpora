00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
because of the voices of the public.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
People who were inspired to go down to the streets

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and to raise their voices,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
they tried to kill.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
They found something called Facebook.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
They found something called Twitter.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And they said,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
"These kids are misled."

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Therefore, they asked their parents

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to go down to the streets

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and collect them, bring them back home.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.
