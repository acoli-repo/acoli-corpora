00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Always, we believed

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that change will spring from within,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that change should be a reconciliation

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
with culture, cultural diversity,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
with our faith in our tradition

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and in our history,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
but at the same time,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
open to universal values, connected with the world,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
tolerant to the outside.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And this is the moment

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that is happening right now in the Arab world.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that we see all of these meanings meet together
