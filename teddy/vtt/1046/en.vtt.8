Just step out of your house,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
raise your voice

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and say, "We would like to see the end of the regime."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
This is what happened in Tunisia.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000

in maintaining, trying to maintain,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
its prisons,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
collapsed, disappeared,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
because of the voices of the public.
