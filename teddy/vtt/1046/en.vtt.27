00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
How would you characterize the historical significance

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
of what's happened?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Is this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
or something more?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Wadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
We have covered many wars.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
a lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
because we were centered at the middle of it.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But this is a story -- it is a great story; it is beautiful.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
It is not something that you only cover

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
because you have to cover a great incident.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
You are witnessing change in history.
