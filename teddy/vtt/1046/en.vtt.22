00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
to phone our correspondents there

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and to phone our newsroom

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and to tell them, "Make your best

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
not to switch off the cameras at night,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
because the guys there really feel confident

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
when someone is reporting their story --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and they feel protected as well."

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So we have a chance

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
to create a new future

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
in that part of the world.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
We have a chance

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
to go and to think of the future

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
as something which is open to the world.
