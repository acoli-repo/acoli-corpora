00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
to report what happened in Tahrir Square.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
For 18 days,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
our cameras were broadcasting, live,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the voices of the people in Tahrir Square.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I remember one night

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
when someone phoned me on my cellphone --

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
ordinary person who I don't know -- from Tahrir Square.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
He told me, "We appeal to you

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
not to switch off the cameras.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
If you switch off the cameras tonight,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
there will be a genocide.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
You are protecting us

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square."

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I felt the responsibility

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
to phone our correspondents there
