00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
for kings and presidents ruling us --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
old, aged, authoritarian,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
corrupt situations --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
regimes that we have seen around us.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And for a moment I was wondering,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
are we going to live in order to see

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
real change happening on the ground,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
a change that does not come through foreign intervention,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
through the misery of occupation,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
through nations invading our land

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein,
