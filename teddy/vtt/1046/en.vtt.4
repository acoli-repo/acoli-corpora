00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000

their land occupied by foreign forces

they felt very sad,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
they felt that their dignity had suffered.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And this is why they revolted.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is why they did not accept.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000

"Would you like to see the situation of Iraq?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Would you like to see destruction?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Would you like to see foreign troops on your land?"
