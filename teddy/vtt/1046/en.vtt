00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Ten years ago exactly,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I was in Afghanistan.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I was covering the war in Afghanistan,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the amount of suffering and destruction

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that emerged out of a war like that.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Then, two years later,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I covered another war -- the war in Iraq.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I was placed at the center of that war

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because I was covering the war

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
from the northern part of Iraq.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And the war ended
