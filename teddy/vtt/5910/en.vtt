A cat’s bladder can only store 
a golf ball’s worth of urine.

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:16.786
For humans, it’s a coffee mug 
and for elephants, a kitchen trash can.

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:20.959
An elephant’s bladder is 400 times 
the size of a cat’s,

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:24.789
but it doesn’t take an elephant 400 times
longer to pee.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.109
So, how does this work?

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.516
The answer lies in what scientists call
the “Other Golden Rule.”
