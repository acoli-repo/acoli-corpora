Helen Walters: Hi Esther Perel,
thank you so much for joining us

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.563
and I want to get right to it.

00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:08.897
So we're more than a year
into this pandemic now.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.797
And I think one constant,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.963
whether we're really
acknowledging it or not,

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:16.563
has been heightened
stress levels, shall we say.

00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:19.563
So I'm sure you've seen this
in your practice and in your work.

00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:22.063
And I'm curious, what are you
recommending to people

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:26.763
who are coming to you wanting to know
how to regulate stress effectively?

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:29.897
Esther Perel:
So, hello, Helen, here it is.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.130
You know, we're living in a time
of existential anguish, of isolation,
