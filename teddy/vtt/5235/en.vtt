If you sucked all of the moisture
out of your brain

00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:13.663
and broke it down to its constituent
nutritional content,

00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:16.329
what would it look like?

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:21.038
Most of the weight of your dehydrated
brain would come from fats,

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.204
also known as “lipids”.

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:27.913
In the remaining brain matter,
you would find proteins and amino acids,

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:29.579
traces of micronutrients,

00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:31.496
and glucose.
