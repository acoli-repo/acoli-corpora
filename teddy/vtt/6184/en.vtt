00:00:00.924 --> 00:00:03.259
Tiq Milan: Our first conversation
was on Facebook,

00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:05.233
and it was three days long.

00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:06.681
(Laughter)

00:00:07.127 --> 00:00:09.837
We shared over 3,000 messages between us,

00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:13.516
and it was during those 72 hours
that I knew she was going to be my wife.

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:17.234
We didn't wait any prerequisite
amount of time for our courtship;

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:19.613
we told each other
the vulnerable truths up front:

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:21.881
I am a transgender man,

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:25.315
which means the F on my birth
certificate should have stood for "False,"

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.519
instead of "Female."

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:27.878
(Laughter)

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:29.786
Walking around as a woman in the world

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.132
felt like walking with
pebbles in my shoes.
