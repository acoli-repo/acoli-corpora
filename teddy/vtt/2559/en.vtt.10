00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:01.463
But now imagine that this LED lamp
is a street light, and there's fog.

00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:04.409
And so I want to simulate fog,

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:07.176
and that's why I brought
a handkerchief with me.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.632
(Laughter)

00:05:08.656 --> 00:05:12.616
And let me put the handkerchief
over the solar cell.

00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:15.533
First you notice

00:05:15.557 --> 00:05:19.754
the energy harvested drops, as expected,

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:22.356
but now the video still continues.

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:25.388
This means, despite the blockage,

00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:29.293
there's sufficient light coming through
the handkerchief to the solar cell,

00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:34.832
so that the solar cell is able to decode
and stream that information,
