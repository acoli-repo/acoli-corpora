00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:30.198
This is because the solar cell already
harvests light from the ambient light.

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:33.942
Now what I would like to do first
is switch on the light,

00:03:33.966 --> 00:03:36.072
and I'll simply, only switch on the light,

00:03:36.096 --> 00:03:38.204
for a moment,

00:03:38.228 --> 00:03:42.222
and what you'll notice is that
the instrument jumps to the right.

00:03:42.904 --> 00:03:44.594
So the solar cell, for a moment,

00:03:44.618 --> 00:03:48.140
is harvesting energy
from this artificial light source.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.818
If I turn it off, we see it drops.

00:03:51.842 --> 00:03:53.025
I turn it on ...

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.768
So we harvest energy with the solar cell.

00:03:56.586 --> 00:04:01.909
But next I would like to activate
the streaming of the video.
