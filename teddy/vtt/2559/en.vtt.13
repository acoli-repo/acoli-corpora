00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.562
we don't want to charge
these devices regularly,

00:06:30.586 --> 00:06:33.561
or worse, replace the batteries
every few months.

00:06:34.418 --> 00:06:36.148
As I said to you,

00:06:36.172 --> 00:06:38.490
this is the first time
I've shown this in public.

00:06:38.514 --> 00:06:40.569
It's very much a lab demonstration,

00:06:40.593 --> 00:06:41.796
a prototype.

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:45.570
But my team and I are confident
that we can take this to market

00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:47.585
within the next two to three years.

00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:53.544
And we hope we will be able to contribute
to closing the digital divide,

00:06:53.568 --> 00:06:54.766
and also contribute

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.735
to connecting all these billions
of devices to the Internet.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.895
And all of this without causing

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.371
a massive explosion
of energy consumption --
