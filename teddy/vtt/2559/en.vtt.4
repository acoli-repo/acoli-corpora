00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.535
This is why we can use a solar cell
to charge our mobile phone.

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:02.965
But now we need to remember

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:09.220
that the data is encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness of the LED,

00:02:09.244 --> 00:02:12.593
so if the incoming light fluctuates,

00:02:12.617 --> 00:02:15.548
so does the energy harvested
from the solar cell.

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.088
This means we have
a principal mechanism in place

00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:26.222
to receive information from the light
and by the solar cell,

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:29.021
because the fluctuations
of the energy harvested

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:31.163
correspond to the data transmitted.
