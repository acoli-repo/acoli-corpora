Now let me show you in practice.

00:03:05.095 --> 00:03:09.483
In this box is a standard,
off-the-shelf LED lamp.

00:03:11.193 --> 00:03:13.768
This is a standard,
off-the-shelf solar cell;

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.975
it is connected to the laptop.

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.269
And also we have an instrument here

00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:23.071
to visualize the energy
we harvest from the solar cell.

00:03:23.095 --> 00:03:25.893
And this instrument shows
something at the moment.

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:30.198
This is because the solar cell already
harvests light from the ambient light.
