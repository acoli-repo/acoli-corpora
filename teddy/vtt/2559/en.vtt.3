00:01:29.393 --> 00:01:34.632
But so far, we have been using
special devices -- small photo detectors,

00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:38.338
to receive the information
encoded in the data.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.832
I wanted to find a way to also use
existing infrastructure

00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:45.862
to receive data from our Li-Fi lights.

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:50.540
And this is why I have been looking into
solar cells and solar panels.

00:01:51.016 --> 00:01:56.144
A solar cell absorbs light
and converts it into electrical energy.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.535
This is why we can use a solar cell
to charge our mobile phone.
