at TED in 2011,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.274
Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity.

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:09.776
Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs
to transmit data incredibly fast,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.092
and also in a safe and secure manner.

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:16.283
Data is transported by the light,

00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:19.432
encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.954
If we look around,
we have many LEDs around us,

00:01:23.978 --> 00:01:28.639
so there's a rich infrastructure
of Li-Fi transmitters around us.

00:01:29.393 --> 00:01:34.632
But so far, we have been using
special devices -- small photo detectors,
