00:04:28.087 --> 00:04:31.310
So first you notice
the energy harvesting drops

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:33.026
and the video stops as well.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.706
If I remove the blockage,
the video will restart.

00:04:37.357 --> 00:04:43.586
(Applause)

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.943
And I can repeat that.

00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:51.218
So we stop the transmission of the video
and energy harvesting stops as well.

00:04:51.242 --> 00:04:55.650
So that is to show that the solar cell
acts as a receiver.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:01.463
But now imagine that this LED lamp
is a street light, and there's fog.
