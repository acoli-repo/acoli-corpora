00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:31.163
correspond to the data transmitted.

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:34.060
Of course the question is:

00:02:34.084 --> 00:02:38.244
can we receive very fast and subtle
changes of the brightness,

00:02:38.268 --> 00:02:42.078
such as the ones transmitted
by our LED lights?

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:46.145
And the answer to that is yes, we can.

00:02:46.637 --> 00:02:48.416
We have shown in the lab

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.922
that we can receive up to 50
megabytes per second

00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:54.381
from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.

00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:58.548
And this is faster than most
broadband connections these days.

00:02:59.437 --> 00:03:02.747
Now let me show you in practice.
