00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.024
I would like to demonstrate
for the first time in public

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:08.119
that it is possible to transmit a video

00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:12.452
from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:17.636
to a solar cell with a laptop
acting as a receiver.

00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:21.069
There is no Wi-Fi involved,
it's just light.

00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:23.927
And you may wonder, what's the point?

00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:25.695
And the point is this:

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.075
There will be a massive
extension of the Internet

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.909
to close the digital divide,
