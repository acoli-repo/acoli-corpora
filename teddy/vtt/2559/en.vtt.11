00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:34.832
so that the solar cell is able to decode
and stream that information,

00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:37.460
in this case, a high-definition video.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.603
What's really important here is that
a solar cell has become a receiver

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:48.442
for high-speed wireless signals
encoded in light,

00:05:48.466 --> 00:05:53.282
while it maintains its primary function
as an energy-harvesting device.

00:05:53.872 --> 00:05:56.291
That's why it is possible

00:05:56.315 --> 00:06:00.172
to use existing solar cells
on the roof of a hut
