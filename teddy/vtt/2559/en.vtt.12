00:05:56.315 --> 00:06:00.172
to use existing solar cells
on the roof of a hut

00:06:00.196 --> 00:06:02.689
to act as a broadband receiver

00:06:02.713 --> 00:06:07.089
from a laser station on a close by hill,
or indeed, lamp post.

00:06:07.605 --> 00:06:11.300
And It really doesn't matter
where the beam hits the solar cell.

00:06:11.647 --> 00:06:12.825
And the same is true

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.642
for translucent solar cells
integrated into windows,

00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:20.198
solar cells integrated
into street furniture,

00:06:20.222 --> 00:06:24.765
or indeed, solar cells integrated
into these billions of devices

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.865
that will form the Internet of Things.

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.047
Because simply,

00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.562
we don't want to charge
these devices regularly,
