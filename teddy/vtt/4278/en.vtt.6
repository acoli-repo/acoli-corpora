The answer is going to be yes,
but it depends which country you are in.

00:03:03.403 --> 00:03:05.441
So let's start in the United Kingdom,

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:07.757
since that's where we are today.

00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.126
The energy consumption
of the United Kingdom,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.837
the total energy consumption --
not just transport, but everything --

00:03:14.558 --> 00:03:16.364
I like to quantify it in lightbulbs.

00:03:16.388 --> 00:03:19.870
It's as if we've all got
125 lightbulbs on all the time,

00:03:19.894 --> 00:03:23.570
125 kilowatt-hours per day per person

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:26.284
is the energy consumption of the UK.

00:03:26.688 --> 00:03:29.454
So there's 40 lightbulbs'
worth for transport,

00:03:29.478 --> 00:03:31.130
40 lightbulbs' worth for heating,
