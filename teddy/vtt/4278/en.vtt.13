00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:31.892
I've also added in this diagram
now some pink lines

00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:33.805
that go down and to the right.

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:37.670
Those are lines of equal
power consumption per unit area,

00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:39.765
which I measure in watts per square meter.

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.636
So, for example, the middle line there,
0.1 watts per square meter,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.512
is the energy consumption
per unit area of Saudi Arabia,

00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:51.717
Norway, Mexico in purple,
and Bangladesh 15 years ago.

00:06:52.637 --> 00:06:55.826
Half of the world's population
lives in countries

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.955
that are already above that line.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.902
The United Kingdom is consuming
1.25 watts per square meter.
