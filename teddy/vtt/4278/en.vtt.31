00:15:28.074 --> 00:15:30.396
That was when I was reading
the meter every week.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.586
And my life changed,

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.965
because I started doing experiments
and seeing what made a difference.

00:15:34.989 --> 00:15:36.394
My gas consumption plummeted,

00:15:36.418 --> 00:15:38.637
because I started tinkering
with the thermostat

00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:40.460
and the timing on the heating system,

00:15:40.484 --> 00:15:42.697
and I knocked more than half
off my gas bills.

00:15:42.721 --> 00:15:45.604
There's a similar story
for my electricity consumption,

00:15:45.628 --> 00:15:49.190
where switching off the DVD
players, the stereos,

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:52.008
the computer peripherals
that were on all the time,

00:15:52.032 --> 00:15:54.227
and just switching them on
when I needed them,

00:15:54.251 --> 00:15:56.876
knocked another third
off my electricity bills, too.

00:15:58.142 --> 00:15:59.908
So we need a plan that adds up.

00:15:59.932 --> 00:16:02.522
I've described for you six big levers.
