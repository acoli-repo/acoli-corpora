00:01:57.274 --> 00:02:01.487
How wide would the verge
have to be for that to work out?

00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:03.159
OK, so let's put in some numbers.

00:02:03.183 --> 00:02:05.893
Let's have our cars go
at 60 miles per hour.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.727
Let's say they do 30 miles per gallon.

00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:10.586
That's the European average for new cars.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.263
Let's say the productivity
of biofuel plantations

00:02:13.287 --> 00:02:16.387
is 1,200 liters of biofuel
per hectare per year.

00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:18.982
That's true of European biofuels.

00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:22.891
And let's imagine the cars are spaced
80 meters apart from each other,

00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:25.091
and they're perpetually
going along this road.

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:26.955
The length of the road doesn't matter,

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.710
because the longer the road,
the more biofuel plantation.

00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:31.322
What do we do with these numbers?
