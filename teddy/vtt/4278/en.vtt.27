00:13:28.778 --> 00:13:30.676
Next, there's the heating lever.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.191
Heating is a third of our energy
consumption in Britain,

00:13:34.215 --> 00:13:36.288
and quite a lot of that
is going into homes

00:13:36.312 --> 00:13:37.695
and other buildings,

00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:39.696
doing space heating and water heating.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.004
So here's a typical crappy British house.

00:13:42.028 --> 00:13:44.747
It's my house, with a Ferrari out front.

00:13:44.771 --> 00:13:45.836
(Laughter)

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.013
What can we do to it?

00:13:47.037 --> 00:13:50.698
Well, the laws of physics
are written up there,

00:13:50.722 --> 00:13:55.970
which describe how the power
consumption for heating

00:13:55.994 --> 00:13:57.902
is driven by the things you can control.

00:13:57.926 --> 00:14:00.820
The things you can control
are the temperature difference
