00:09:27.202 --> 00:09:30.406
So, this facility delivers
14 watts per square meter;

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.141
this one 10 watts per square meter;

00:09:32.165 --> 00:09:34.921
and this one in Spain,
5 watts per square meter.

00:09:34.945 --> 00:09:37.119
Being generous
to concentrating solar power,

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:40.807
I think it's perfectly credible it could
deliver 20 watts per square meter.

00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:41.997
So that's nice.

00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:44.573
Of course, Britain
doesn't have any deserts.

00:09:44.955 --> 00:09:46.111
Yet.

00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:47.820
(Laughter)

00:09:47.844 --> 00:09:50.209
So here's a summary so far:

00:09:51.035 --> 00:09:53.659
All renewables, much
as I love them, are diffuse.

00:09:53.683 --> 00:09:55.722
They all have a small power per unit area,

00:09:55.746 --> 00:09:57.541
and we have to live with that fact.

00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:03.563
And that means, if you do want renewables
to make a substantial difference
