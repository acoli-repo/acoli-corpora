00:10:59.501 --> 00:11:00.660
So --

00:11:00.684 --> 00:11:01.734
(Laughter)

00:11:01.758 --> 00:11:03.087
People are anti-everything,

00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:05.769
and we've got to keep
all the options on the table.

00:11:06.328 --> 00:11:09.967
What can a country like the UK
do on the supply side?

00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:12.910
Well, the options are,
I'd say, these three:

00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:14.112
power renewables,

00:11:14.136 --> 00:11:17.847
and recognizing that they need
to be close to country-sized;

00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:19.117
other people's renewables,

00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:21.268
so we could go back and talk very politely

00:11:21.292 --> 00:11:24.329
to the people in the top left-hand side
of the diagram and say,

00:11:24.353 --> 00:11:26.604
"Uh, we don't want
renewables in our backyard,

00:11:26.628 --> 00:11:29.222
but, um, please could we put
them in yours instead?"

00:11:29.246 --> 00:11:31.211
And that's a serious option.
