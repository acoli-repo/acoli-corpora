Another motivation,
of course, is climate change.

00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:04.815
And when people talk
about life after fossil fuels

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.710
and climate change action,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.280
I think there's a lot of fluff,

00:01:09.304 --> 00:01:12.168
a lot of greenwash,
a lot of misleading advertising,

00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:16.681
and I feel a duty as a physicist to try
to guide people around the claptrap

00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:20.479
and help people understand the actions
that really make a difference,

00:01:20.503 --> 00:01:23.153
and to focus on ideas that do add up.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.589
Let me illustrate this

00:01:26.613 --> 00:01:29.796
with what physicists call
a back-of-envelope calculation.
