00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:31.898
Energy crops deliver
half a watt per square meter

00:07:31.922 --> 00:07:33.279
in European climates.

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:35.860
What does that mean?

00:07:35.884 --> 00:07:37.866
You might have anticipated that result,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.078
given what I told you about the biofuel
plantation a moment ago.

00:07:41.102 --> 00:07:44.098
Well, we consume 1.25 watts
per square meter.

00:07:44.122 --> 00:07:45.279
What this means is,

00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:48.690
even if you covered the whole
of the United Kingdom with energy crops,

00:07:48.714 --> 00:07:51.522
you couldn't match
today's energy consumption.

00:07:52.636 --> 00:07:56.470
Wind power produces a bit more --
2.5 watts per square meter.

00:07:56.494 --> 00:08:00.507
But that's only twice as big
as 1.25 watts per square meter.
