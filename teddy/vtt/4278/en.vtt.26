00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.587
We could persuade her to take a train,
still a lot more efficient than a car,

00:13:02.611 --> 00:13:04.386
but that might be a lifestyle change.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.994
Or there's the EcoCAR, top-left.

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:09.753
It comfortably accommodates one teenager
and it's shorter than a traffic cone,

00:13:09.777 --> 00:13:11.813
and it's almost as efficient as a bicycle,

00:13:11.837 --> 00:13:14.877
as long as you drive it
at 15 miles per hour.

00:13:15.299 --> 00:13:17.526
In between, perhaps
some more realistic options

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.515
on the transport lever
are electric vehicles,

00:13:20.539 --> 00:13:22.918
so electric bikes
and electric cars in the middle,

00:13:22.942 --> 00:13:27.968
perhaps four times as energy efficient
as the standard petrol-powered tank.

00:13:28.778 --> 00:13:30.676
Next, there's the heating lever.
