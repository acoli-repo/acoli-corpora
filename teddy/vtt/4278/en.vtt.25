00:12:29.558 --> 00:12:32.982
is 80 kilowatt hours
per hundred person kilometers.

00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:36.801
That's the average European car.

00:12:37.347 --> 00:12:38.498
Eighty kilowatt hours.

00:12:38.522 --> 00:12:40.610
Can we make something 100 times better

00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:42.947
by applying the physics
principles I just listed?

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:44.614
Yes. Here it is. It's the bicycle.

00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:47.284
It's 80 times better
in energy consumption,

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.532
and it's powered by biofuel, by Weetabix.

00:12:49.556 --> 00:12:51.694
(Laughter)

00:12:51.718 --> 00:12:53.585
And there are other options in between,

00:12:53.609 --> 00:12:55.736
because maybe the lady
in the tank would say,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.916
"No, that's a lifestyle change.
Don't change my lifestyle, please."

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.587
We could persuade her to take a train,
still a lot more efficient than a car,
