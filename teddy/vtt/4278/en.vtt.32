00:15:59.932 --> 00:16:02.522
I've described for you six big levers.

00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:03.712
We need big action,

00:16:03.736 --> 00:16:06.498
because we get 90 percent
of our energy from fossil fuels,

00:16:06.522 --> 00:16:10.568
and so you need to push hard
on most, if not all, of these levers.

00:16:11.288 --> 00:16:13.574
Most of these levers
have popularity problems,

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:17.264
and if there is a lever
you don't like the use of,

00:16:17.288 --> 00:16:21.105
well, please do bear in mind
that means you need even stronger effort

00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:23.010
on the other levers.

00:16:23.456 --> 00:16:26.607
So I'm a strong advocate
of having grown-up conversations

00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:28.892
that are based on numbers and facts.

00:16:28.916 --> 00:16:32.692
And I want to close with this map
that just visualizes for you
