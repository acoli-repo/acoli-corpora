The United Kingdom is consuming
1.25 watts per square meter.

00:07:04.926 --> 00:07:07.948
So is Germany, and Japan
is consuming a bit more.

00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:13.188
So, let's now say why this is relevant.

00:07:13.212 --> 00:07:14.599
Why is it relevant?

00:07:14.623 --> 00:07:17.489
Well, we can measure
renewables in the same units

00:07:17.513 --> 00:07:20.318
and other forms of power
production in the same units.

00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:23.471
Renewables is one of the leading ideas

00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:27.469
for how we could get off
our 90 percent fossil-fuel habit.

00:07:27.802 --> 00:07:29.214
So here come some renewables.

00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:31.898
Energy crops deliver
half a watt per square meter
