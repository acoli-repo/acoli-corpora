We love back-of-envelope calculations.

00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:34.168
You ask a question,
write down some numbers,

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:35.355
and get an answer.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:38.579
It may not be very accurate,
but it may make you say, "Hmm."

00:01:38.603 --> 00:01:40.025
So here's a question:

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.252
Imagine if we said, "Oh yes,
we can get off fossil fuels.

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:44.944
We'll use biofuels. Problem solved.

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:47.248
Transport ... We don't need oil anymore."

00:01:47.272 --> 00:01:53.706
Well, what if we grew
the biofuels for a road

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.504
on the grass verge
at the edge of the road?

00:01:57.274 --> 00:02:01.487
How wide would the verge
have to be for that to work out?
