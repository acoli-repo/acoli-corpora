the message is, whatever mix
of those renewables you're using,

00:09:01.924 --> 00:09:04.105
if you want to power the UK on them,

00:09:04.129 --> 00:09:06.230
you're going to need
to cover something like

00:09:18.942 --> 00:09:20.647
(Laughter)

00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:24.803
Concentrating solar power in deserts
delivers larger powers per unit area,

00:09:24.827 --> 00:09:27.178
because you don't have
the problem of clouds.

00:09:27.202 --> 00:09:30.406
So, this facility delivers
14 watts per square meter;
