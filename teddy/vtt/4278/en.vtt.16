00:07:56.494 --> 00:08:00.507
But that's only twice as big
as 1.25 watts per square meter.

00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:05.165
So that means if you wanted, literally,
to produce total energy consumption

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:07.420
in all forms, on average, from wind farms,

00:08:07.444 --> 00:08:10.076
you need wind farms
half the area of the UK.

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:15.000
I've got data to back up
all these assertions, by the way.

00:08:15.643 --> 00:08:17.552
Next, let's look at solar power.

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:20.137
Solar panels, when you put them on a roof,

00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:24.476
deliver about 20 watts
per square meter in England.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.282
If you really want to get
a lot from solar panels,

00:08:28.306 --> 00:08:31.110
you need to adopt the traditional
Bavarian farming method,
