00:05:58.594 --> 00:06:01.467
most countries are going to the right,
and they're going up.

00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:03.638
Up and to the right:
bigger population density

00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:05.602
and higher per capita consumption.

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:09.581
So, we may be off in the top
right-hand corner, slightly unusual,

00:06:09.605 --> 00:06:11.992
the United Kingdom accompanied by Germany,

00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:13.986
Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands,

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.375
and a bunch of other
slightly odd countries,

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:20.704
but many other countries are coming
up and to the right to join us.

00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:22.771
So we're a picture, if you like,

00:06:22.795 --> 00:06:24.770
of what the future energy consumption

00:06:24.794 --> 00:06:27.566
might be looking
like in other countries, too.

00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:31.892
I've also added in this diagram
now some pink lines
