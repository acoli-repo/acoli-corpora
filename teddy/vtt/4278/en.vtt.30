00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.216
the third way to reduce energy
consumption is: read your meters.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.069
People talk a lot about smart meters,

00:15:04.093 --> 00:15:05.440
but you can do it yourself.

00:15:05.464 --> 00:15:07.389
Use your own eyes and be smart.

00:15:07.413 --> 00:15:11.076
Read your meter, and if you're anything
like me, it'll change your life.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.532
Here's a graph I made.

00:15:12.556 --> 00:15:14.700
I was writing a book
about sustainable energy,

00:15:14.724 --> 00:15:15.878
and a friend asked me,

00:15:15.902 --> 00:15:17.716
"How much energy do you use at home?"

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.760
I was embarrassed; I didn't actually know.

00:15:19.784 --> 00:15:21.985
And so I started reading
the meter every week.

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:25.801
The old meter readings are shown
in the top half of the graph,

00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:28.050
and then 2007 is shown
in green at the bottom.

00:15:28.074 --> 00:15:30.396
That was when I was reading
the meter every week.
