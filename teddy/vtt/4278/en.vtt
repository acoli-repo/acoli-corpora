When the Industrial Revolution started,

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:07.073
the amount of carbon sitting
underneath Britain in the form of coal

00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:11.083
was as big as the amount of carbon
sitting under Saudi Arabia

00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:12.445
in the form of oil.

00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:15.966
This carbon powered
the Industrial Revolution,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.705

00:00:17.729 --> 00:00:21.013
and led to Britain's temporary
world domination.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:26.506
And then, in 1918,
coal production in Britain peaked,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.297
and has declined ever since.

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:33.056
In due course, Britain started using
oil and gas from the North Sea,
