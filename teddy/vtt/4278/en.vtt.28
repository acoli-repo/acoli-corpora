00:13:57.926 --> 00:14:00.820
The things you can control
are the temperature difference

00:14:00.844 --> 00:14:02.527
between the inside and the outside.

00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:05.165
There's this remarkable technology
called a thermostat:

00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:06.925
you grasp it, rotate it to the left,

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:09.478
and your energy consumption
in the home will decrease.

00:14:09.502 --> 00:14:12.605
I've tried it. It works.
Some people call it a lifestyle change.

00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:13.713
(Laughter)

00:14:13.737 --> 00:14:17.217
You can also get the fluff men
in to reduce the leakiness

00:14:17.241 --> 00:14:20.210
of your building -- put fluff
in the walls, fluff in the roof,

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:22.028
a new front door, and so forth.

00:14:23.452 --> 00:14:26.037
The sad truth is,
this will save you money.

00:14:26.061 --> 00:14:27.401
That's not sad, that's good.

00:14:27.425 --> 00:14:28.603
But the sad truth is,

00:14:28.627 --> 00:14:31.826
it'll only get about 25 percent
of the leakiness of your building
