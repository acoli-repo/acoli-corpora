00:03:58.823 --> 00:04:04.044
The population density of the UK
is 250 people per square kilometer.

00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:07.330
I'm now going to show you other countries
by these same two measures.

00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:10.490
On the vertical axis, I'm going
to show you how many lightbulbs --

00:04:10.514 --> 00:04:12.954
what our energy consumption per person is.

00:04:12.978 --> 00:04:15.097
We're at 125 lightbulbs per person,

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:18.735
and that little blue dot there
is showing you the land area

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.449
of the United Kingdom.

00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:23.262
The population density
is on the horizontal axis,

00:04:23.286 --> 00:04:26.009
and we're 250 people per square kilometer.

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.602
Let's add European countries in blue,

00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:31.127
and you can see there's quite a variety.
