00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:33.056
In due course, Britain started using
oil and gas from the North Sea,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.991
and in the year 2000,

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:38.514
oil and gas production
from the North Sea also peaked,

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.684
and they're now on the decline.

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:44.799
These observations about the finiteness

00:00:44.823 --> 00:00:48.690
of easily accessible, local,
secure fossil fuels,

00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:52.377
is a motivation for saying,
"Well, what's next?

00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:55.324
What is life after fossil fuels
going to be like?

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:58.814
Shouldn't we be thinking hard
about how to get off fossil fuels?"

00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:01.802
Another motivation,
of course, is climate change.
