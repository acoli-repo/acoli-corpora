00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:31.127
and you can see there's quite a variety.

00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:34.228
I should emphasize,
both of these axes are logarithmic;

00:04:34.252 --> 00:04:36.807
as you go from one gray bar
to the next gray bar,

00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:38.586
you're going up a factor of 10.

00:04:39.547 --> 00:04:41.888
Next, let's add Asia in red,

00:04:41.912 --> 00:04:44.398
the Middle East and North Africa in green,

00:04:45.413 --> 00:04:47.806
sub-Saharan Africa in blue,

00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:50.847
black is South America,

00:04:52.394 --> 00:04:54.239
purple is Central America,

00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:57.788
and then in pukey-yellow,
we have North America,

00:04:57.812 --> 00:04:59.529
Australia and New Zealand.
