00:08:28.306 --> 00:08:31.110
you need to adopt the traditional
Bavarian farming method,

00:08:31.134 --> 00:08:32.485
where you leap off the roof,

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:35.013
and coat the countryside
with solar panels, too.

00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:38.233
Solar parks, because of the gaps
between the panels, deliver less.

00:08:38.257 --> 00:08:41.664
They deliver about 5 watts
per square meter of land area.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.990
And here's a solar park
in Vermont, with real data,

00:08:45.014 --> 00:08:47.538
delivering 4.2 watts per square meter.

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:50.968
Remember where we are,
1.25 watts per square meter,

00:08:50.992 --> 00:08:54.043
wind farms 2.5, solar parks about five.

00:08:54.897 --> 00:08:58.327
So whichever of those renewables you pick,

00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:01.900
the message is, whatever mix
of those renewables you're using,
