00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:03.563
And that means, if you do want renewables
to make a substantial difference

00:10:03.587 --> 00:10:05.375
for a country like the United Kingdom

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:07.491
on the scale of today's consumption,

00:10:07.515 --> 00:10:11.916
you need to be imagining renewable
facilities that are country-sized.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.253
Not the entire country,

00:10:13.277 --> 00:10:16.644
but a fraction of the country,
a substantial fraction.

00:10:17.684 --> 00:10:20.231
There are other options
for generating power as well,

00:10:20.255 --> 00:10:21.939
which don't involve fossil fuels.

00:10:21.963 --> 00:10:25.118
So there's nuclear power,
and on this ordinance survey map,

00:10:25.142 --> 00:10:28.881
you can see there's a Sizewell B
inside a blue square kilometer.

00:10:28.905 --> 00:10:30.908
That's one gigawatt in a square kilometer,
