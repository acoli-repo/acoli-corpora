00:11:57.966 --> 00:12:01.017
we could talk about other ways
of solving this issue.

00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:04.437
Namely, we could reduce demand,
and that means reducing population --

00:12:04.461 --> 00:12:06.276
I'm not sure how to do that --

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.112
or reducing per capita consumption.

00:12:09.136 --> 00:12:11.599
So let's talk about three more big levers

00:12:11.623 --> 00:12:13.949
that could really help
on the consumption side.

00:12:13.973 --> 00:12:15.127
First, transport.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.694
Here are the physics principles

00:12:16.718 --> 00:12:19.768
that tell you how to reduce
the energy consumption of transport.

00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:22.238
People often say,
"Technology can answer everything.

00:12:22.262 --> 00:12:25.038
We can make vehicles
that are 100 times more efficient."

00:12:25.062 --> 00:12:27.042
And that's almost true. Let me show you.

00:12:27.066 --> 00:12:29.534
The energy consumption
of this typical tank here

00:12:29.558 --> 00:12:32.982
is 80 kilowatt hours
per hundred person kilometers.
