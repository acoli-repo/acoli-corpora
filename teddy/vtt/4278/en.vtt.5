00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:31.322
What do we do with these numbers?

00:02:31.346 --> 00:02:35.375
Take the first number, divide by the other
three, and get eight kilometers.

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:36.555
And that's the answer.

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.939
That's how wide the plantation
would have to be,

00:02:38.963 --> 00:02:40.814
given these assumptions.

00:02:41.296 --> 00:02:44.029
And maybe that makes you say, "Hmm.

00:02:44.053 --> 00:02:46.484
Maybe this isn't going
to be quite so easy."

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.384
And it might make you think,

00:02:50.862 --> 00:02:53.267
perhaps there's an issue to do with areas.

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:57.188
And in this talk, I'd like to talk
about land areas, and ask:

00:02:57.212 --> 00:02:58.695
Is there an issue about areas?

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:03.379
The answer is going to be yes,
but it depends which country you are in.
