00:03:29.478 --> 00:03:31.130
40 lightbulbs' worth for heating,

00:03:31.154 --> 00:03:33.682
and 40 lightbulbs' worth
for making electricity,

00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:35.620
and other things are relatively small,

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:38.277
compared to those three big fish.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:41.031
It's actually a bigger footprint
if we take into account

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:44.677
the embodied energy in the stuff
we import into our country as well.

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:49.435
And 90 percent of this energy, today,
still comes from fossil fuels,

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.137
and 10 percent, only, from other,
greener -- possibly greener -- sources,

00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:55.134
like nuclear power and renewables.

00:03:56.233 --> 00:03:57.518
So.

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:58.799
That's the UK.

00:03:58.823 --> 00:04:04.044
The population density of the UK
is 250 people per square kilometer.
