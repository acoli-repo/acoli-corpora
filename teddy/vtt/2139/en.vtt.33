How many people have their BlackBerry?

00:16:30.451 --> 00:16:32.241
We're plugged in; we're connected.

00:16:32.265 --> 00:16:34.528

00:16:34.552 --> 00:16:37.523
that something bad
has come out of the tech revolution.

00:16:37.547 --> 00:16:39.142
Good grief, not to this crowd.

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:41.297
(Laughter)

00:16:41.321 --> 00:16:42.604

is a complete waste of time.

00:16:47.972 --> 00:16:50.445

00:16:54.235 --> 00:16:57.647
Your iPhone without those people
making the same interface,

00:16:57.671 --> 00:17:00.131
the same circuitry,
the same board, over and over --
