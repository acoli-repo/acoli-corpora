00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:30.976
I say, "Time out. Stop."

00:03:31.617 --> 00:03:34.545
You guys know the show, we use take one;
we don't do take two.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.487
There's no writing, there's no scripting,
there's no nonsense.

00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:39.664
We don't fool around, we don't rehearse --

00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:41.086
we shoot what we get!

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.231
I said, "Stop. This is nuts."

And I'm like, "I don't know
what just happened,

00:03:52.736 --> 00:03:54.668
but there are testicles in this bucket,

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:56.108
and that's not how we do it."

00:03:56.132 --> 00:03:57.890
He said "Well, that's how we do it."

00:03:57.914 --> 00:03:59.857
I said, "Why would you do it this way?"

00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:01.548
