Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.

00:02:01.937 --> 00:02:03.111
Alright. Great.

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:05.782
Albert goes in, I follow Albert,
the crew is around.

00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:09.281
I always watch the process done
the first time before I try it.

00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:11.592
Being an apprentice,
you know, you do that.

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:15.194
Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out,
you know, this black rubber band,

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.218
but what comes out instead is a knife.

00:02:18.412 --> 00:02:21.053
And I'm like, "Hmm, that's not
rubber at all," you know?

00:02:21.077 --> 00:02:22.266
(Laughter)

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.084
And he kind of flicked it open
in a way that caught the sun

00:02:25.108 --> 00:02:27.646
that was just coming
over the Rockies, it was very --

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.186
(Laughter)

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.397
It was ... it was impressive.
