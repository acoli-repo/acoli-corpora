00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.096
a week later the parts
in question fall off.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.272
"Great -- got it."

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:34.879
OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this.

00:01:34.903 --> 00:01:36.070
They confirm it.

00:01:36.094 --> 00:01:37.560
I also call PETA just for fun,

00:01:37.584 --> 00:01:39.730
and they don't like it,
but they confirm it.

00:01:39.754 --> 00:01:41.441
OK, that's basically how you do it.

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:42.853
So the next day I go out.

00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:45.222
And I'm given a horse
and we go get the lambs

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:47.282
and we take them to a pen that we built,

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:50.976
and we go about the business
of animal husbandry.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.445
Melanie is the wife of Albert.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.166
Albert is the shepherd in question.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.273
Melanie picks up the lamb,
one hand on both legs on the right,

00:01:58.297 --> 00:01:59.710
likewise on the left.

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.913
Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.
