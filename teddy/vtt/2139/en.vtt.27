00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:30.680
And I'll never forget,
up in the Bering Sea,

00:13:30.704 --> 00:13:33.438
I was on a crab boat
with the "Deadliest Catch" guys --

00:13:33.462 --> 00:13:35.754
which I also work on in the first season.

00:13:35.778 --> 00:13:38.454
We were about 100 miles
off the coast of Russia:

00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:42.875
50-foot seas, big waves, green water
coming over the wheelhouse, right?

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:44.976
Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.898
and I was back with a guy,
lashing the pots down.

00:13:47.922 --> 00:13:50.078
So I'm 40 feet off the deck,

00:13:50.102 --> 00:13:53.000
which is like looking down
at the top of your shoe, you know,

00:13:53.024 --> 00:13:54.631
and it's doing this in the ocean.

00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:55.811
Unspeakably dangerous.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.769
I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse

00:13:57.793 --> 00:14:00.546
and I say, with some level of incredulity,
