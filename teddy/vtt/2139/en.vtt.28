00:13:57.793 --> 00:14:00.546
and I say, with some level of incredulity,

00:14:01.138 --> 00:14:02.951
"Captain -- OSHA?"

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.047
And he says, "OSHA? Ocean."

00:14:05.556 --> 00:14:06.976
And he points out there.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.331
(Laughter)

00:14:10.355 --> 00:14:15.306
But in that moment, what he said next
can't be repeated in the Lower 48.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.931
It can't be repeated on any factory floor
or any construction site.

00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:20.840
But he looked at me and said, "Son," --

00:14:20.864 --> 00:14:23.611
he's my age, by the way,
he calls me "son," I love that --

00:14:23.635 --> 00:14:25.810
he says, "Son, I'm the captain
of a crab boat.

00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:28.403
My responsibility
is not to get you home alive.

00:14:28.427 --> 00:14:30.773
My responsibility
is to get you home rich."
