00:04:55.448 --> 00:05:00.806
Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just done
his little procedure on

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.900
is, you know, he's just prancing
around, bleeding stopped.

00:05:04.924 --> 00:05:07.672
He's, you know, nibbling
on some grass, frolicking.

00:05:08.212 --> 00:05:13.202
And I was just so blown away
at how completely wrong I was,

00:05:13.226 --> 00:05:14.841
in that second.

00:05:14.865 --> 00:05:18.960
And I was reminded how utterly wrong
I am, so much of the time.

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:20.080
(Laughter)

00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:21.896
And I was especially reminded

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.192
of what a ridiculously
short straw I had that day,

00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:27.683
because now I had to do
what Albert had just done,

00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:30.362
and there are like 100
of these lambs in the pen.
