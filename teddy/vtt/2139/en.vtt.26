00:12:59.325 --> 00:13:01.672
I mean -- this is heresy,
what I'm about to say --

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:04.115
but what if it's really safety third?

00:13:04.523 --> 00:13:05.693
Right?

00:13:05.717 --> 00:13:07.143
(Laughter)

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:09.269
No, I mean, really.

00:13:09.404 --> 00:13:11.212
What I mean to say is:

00:13:11.236 --> 00:13:13.700
I value my safety on these crazy jobs

00:13:13.724 --> 00:13:16.286
as much as the people
that I'm working with,

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.586
but the ones who really get it done --

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.430
they're not out there
talking about safety first.

00:13:21.954 --> 00:13:23.976
They know that other things come first --

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.048
the business of doing
the work comes first,

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:27.895
the business of getting it done.

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:30.680
And I'll never forget,
