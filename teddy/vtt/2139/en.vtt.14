00:06:59.458 --> 00:07:02.610
And now I can't get --
I can't shake the metaphor.

00:07:02.634 --> 00:07:06.276
I'm still in "Poetics," in Aristotle,
and I'm thinking --

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.775
out of nowhere, two terms come crashing
into my head, that I hadn't heard

00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:12.915
since my classics professor in college
drilled them there.

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:15.608
And they are "anagnorisis"
and "peripeteia."

00:07:15.632 --> 00:07:17.959
Anagnorisis and peripeteia.

00:07:17.983 --> 00:07:21.890
Anagnorisis is the Greek
word for discovery.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.346
Literally, the transition from ignorance
to knowledge is anagnorisis.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.712
It's what our network does;
it's what "Dirty Jobs" is.
