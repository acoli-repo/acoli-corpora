00:15:59.524 --> 00:16:00.977
what's really being said?

00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:03.783
"Your life would be better
if you could work a little less,

00:16:03.807 --> 00:16:06.640
didn't have to work so hard,
got home a little earlier,

00:16:06.664 --> 00:16:09.353
could retire a little faster,
punch out a little sooner."

00:16:09.377 --> 00:16:12.001
It's all in there,
over and over, again and again.

00:16:12.025 --> 00:16:13.176
Washington?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.231
I can't even begin to talk
about the deals and policies in place

00:16:16.255 --> 00:16:19.764
that affect the bottom-line reality
of the available jobs,

00:16:19.788 --> 00:16:23.351
because I don't really know; I just know
that that's a front in this war.

00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:25.470
And right here, guys -- Silicon Valley.

00:16:25.494 --> 00:16:28.560
I mean -- how many people have
an iPhone on them right now?

00:16:28.584 --> 00:16:30.427
How many people have their BlackBerry?
