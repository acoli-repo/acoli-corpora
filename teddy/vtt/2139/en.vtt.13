You know, Aristotle says
a tragedy is that moment

00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:35.091
when the hero comes face to face
with his true identity.

00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:36.460
(Laughter)

00:06:36.484 --> 00:06:38.766
And I'm like, "What is this
jacked-up metaphor?

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.838
I don't like what I'm thinking right now."

00:06:40.862 --> 00:06:42.955
And I can't get this thought
out of my head,

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.087
and I can't get that vision
out of my sight,

00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:47.440
so I did what I had to do.

00:06:47.464 --> 00:06:49.465
I went in and I took them.

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:50.850
I took them like this,

00:06:50.874 --> 00:06:52.647
and I yanked my head back.

00:06:53.692 --> 00:06:57.489
And I'm standing there
with two testicles on my chin.

00:06:57.513 --> 00:06:59.434
(Laughter)

00:06:59.458 --> 00:07:02.610
And now I can't get --
I can't shake the metaphor.
