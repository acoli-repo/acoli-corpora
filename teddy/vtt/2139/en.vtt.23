00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:32.309
who collects the uneaten scraps
of food from the casinos

00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:34.020
and feeds them to his swine.

00:11:34.044 --> 00:11:35.195
Why?

00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:37.993
Because there's so much protein
in the stuff we don't eat,

00:11:38.017 --> 00:11:41.334
his pigs grow at twice the normal speed,
and he's one rich pig farmer.

00:11:41.358 --> 00:11:42.795
He's good for the environment,

00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:45.123
he spends his days
doing this incredible service,

00:11:45.147 --> 00:11:47.155
and he smells like hell,
but God bless him.

00:11:47.179 --> 00:11:48.477
He's making a great living.

00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:50.770
You ask him, "Did you follow
your passion here?"

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:51.949
and he'd laugh at you.

00:11:51.973 --> 00:11:56.218
The guy's worth -- he just got offered
like 60 million dollars for his farm

00:11:56.242 --> 00:11:58.448
and turned it down, outside of Vegas.

00:11:58.472 --> 00:11:59.893
He didn't follow his passion.

00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:02.863
He stepped back and he watched
where everybody was going,
