00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:02.863
He stepped back and he watched
where everybody was going,

00:12:02.887 --> 00:12:05.072
and he went the other way.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.116
And I hear that story over and over.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.712
Matt Freund, a dairy farmer
in New Canaan, Connecticut,

00:12:10.736 --> 00:12:12.462
who woke up one day and realized

00:12:12.486 --> 00:12:15.199
the crap from his cows
was worth more than their milk,

00:12:15.223 --> 00:12:19.105
if he could use it to make
these biodegradable flowerpots.

00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:22.279
Now he's selling them to Walmart, right?

00:12:22.429 --> 00:12:25.131
Follow his passion? The guy's -- come on.

00:12:25.486 --> 00:12:27.693
So I started to look at passion,

00:12:27.717 --> 00:12:31.815
I started to look
at efficiency vs. effectiveness.
