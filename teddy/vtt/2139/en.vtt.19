You've worked in mining,
you've worked in fishing,

00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:35.343
you've worked in steel,
you've worked in every major industry.

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:38.422
You've had your back
shoulder to shoulder with these guys

00:09:38.446 --> 00:09:42.052
that our politicians are desperate
to relate to every four years, right?"

00:09:42.076 --> 00:09:44.692
I can still see Hillary
doing the shots of rye,

00:09:44.716 --> 00:09:47.016
dribbling down her chin,
with the steel workers.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.239
I mean, these are the people
that I work with every single day.

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:54.647

about their thoughts, collectively,

00:09:54.671 --> 00:09:56.585
it might be time to think about it.

00:09:56.609 --> 00:10:00.176
Because, dude, you know, four years."
