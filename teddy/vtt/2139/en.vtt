00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:03.064
The "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:05.858
to a little town
in Colorado, called Craig.

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:07.699
It's only a couple dozen square miles.

00:00:07.723 --> 00:00:08.961
It's in the Rockies.

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:11.529
And the job in question was sheep rancher.

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:15.336
My role on the show, for those of you
who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.546
I'm an apprentice,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.294
and I work with the people
who do the jobs in question.

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:22.294
And my responsibilities
are to simply try and keep up,

00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:25.516
and give an honest account
of what it's like to be these people

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.976
for one day in their life.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.574
The job in question: herding sheep.

00:00:29.598 --> 00:00:30.751
Great.
