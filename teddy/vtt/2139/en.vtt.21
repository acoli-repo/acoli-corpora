00:10:29.988 --> 00:10:33.174
that I've just been assuming
are sacrosanct,

00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:35.045
and they're not.

00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:37.976
People with dirty jobs
are happier than you think.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.011
As a group, they're
the happiest people I know.

00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:44.017
And I don't want to start whistling
"Look for the Union Label,"

00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:45.525
and all that happy-worker crap.

00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:47.946
I'm just telling you
that these are balanced people

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.125
who do unthinkable work.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:52.250
Roadkill picker-uppers whistle
while they work, I swear to God --

00:10:52.274 --> 00:10:53.428
I did it with them.

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:57.657
They've got this amazing
sort of symmetry to their life.

00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:00.310
And I see it over and over and over again.
