00:00:29.598 --> 00:00:30.751
Great.

00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:34.086
We go to Craig and we check into a hotel,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.226
and I realize the next day

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.251
that castration is going to be
an absolute part of this work.

00:00:40.364 --> 00:00:42.976
Normally, I never do any research at all.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.487
But this is a touchy subject,
and I work for the Discovery Channel,

00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:51.118
and we want to portray accurately
whatever it is we do.

00:00:51.142 --> 00:00:55.976
And we certainly want to do it
with a lot of respect for the animals.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.064
So I call the Humane Society and I say,

00:00:58.088 --> 00:01:01.502
"Look, I'm going to be castrating
some lambs. Can you tell me the deal?"
