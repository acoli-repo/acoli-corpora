00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.321
(Laughter)

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.291
Imagine showing up for work

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:35.805
with your salary just written
across your chest for all to see.

00:02:37.573 --> 00:02:40.843
But why would a company even want
to discourage salary discussions?

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:44.199
Why do some people go along with it,
while others revolt against it?

00:02:45.906 --> 00:02:48.950
It turns out that in addition
to the assumed reasons,

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:52.277
pay secrecy is actually a way
to save a lot of money.

00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:54.212
You see, keeping salaries secret

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:57.187
leads to what economists call
"information asymmetry."

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.482
This is a situation where,
in a negotiation,

00:02:59.506 --> 00:03:02.504
one party has loads more
information than the other.
