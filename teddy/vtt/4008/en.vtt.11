Dane is a serial entrepreneur
who started many companies

00:05:30.852 --> 00:05:32.434
in a pay secrecy condition

00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:35.811
and even used that condition
to pay two equally qualified people

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.531
dramatically different salaries,

00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:39.724
depending on how well
they could negotiate.

00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:43.422
And Dane saw the strife
that happened as a result of this.

00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:46.115
So when he started
his newest company, SumAll,

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.249
he committed to salary transparency
from the beginning.

00:05:49.821 --> 00:05:51.559
And the results have been amazing.

00:05:52.424 --> 00:05:54.046
And in study after study,

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.946
when people know
how they're being paid

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.999
and how that pay compares to their peers',

00:05:58.023 --> 00:06:00.956
they're more likely to work hard
to improve their performance,
