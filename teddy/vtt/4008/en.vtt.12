they're more likely to work hard
to improve their performance,

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.829
more likely to be engaged,
and they're less likely to quit.

00:06:03.853 --> 00:06:05.255
That's why Dane's not alone.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.450
From technology start-ups like Buffer,

00:06:07.915 --> 00:06:11.261
to the tens of thousands
of employees at Whole Foods,

00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:14.452
where not only is your salary
available for everyone to see,

00:06:14.476 --> 00:06:17.476
but the performance data
for the store and for your department

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.419
is available on the company intranet

00:06:19.443 --> 00:06:20.665
for all to see.

00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:24.447
Now, pay transparency
takes a lot of forms.

00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:26.069
It's not one size fits all.

00:06:26.093 --> 00:06:28.589
Some post their salaries for all to see.

00:06:28.613 --> 00:06:30.914
Some only keep it inside the company.
