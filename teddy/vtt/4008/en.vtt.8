00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:01.804
regardless of where they were --
underpaid, overpaid

00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:03.407
or right at the market rate.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.660
If you were part of this survey,
what would you say?

00:04:06.684 --> 00:04:07.960
Are you underpaid?

00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:10.309
Well, wait -- how do you even know,

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.466
because you're not allowed
to talk about it?

00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:16.510
Next, information asymmetry, pay secrecy,

00:04:16.534 --> 00:04:19.313
makes it easier to ignore
the discrimination

00:04:19.337 --> 00:04:21.804
that's already present
in the market today.

00:04:22.217 --> 00:04:25.914
In a 2011 report from the Institute
for Women's Policy Research,

00:04:25.938 --> 00:04:28.062
the gender wage gap
between men and women

00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:29.824
was 23 percent.
