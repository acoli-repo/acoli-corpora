00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:33.070
This is where that 77 cents
on the dollar comes from.

00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:35.104
But in the Federal Government,

00:04:35.128 --> 00:04:37.191
where salaries are pinned
to certain levels

00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:39.255
and everybody knows
what those levels are,

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.364
the gender wage gap
shrinks to 11 percent --

00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:43.964
and this is before controlling
for any of the factors

00:04:43.988 --> 00:04:46.881
that economists argue over
whether or not to control for.

00:04:47.264 --> 00:04:49.936
If we really want to close
the gender wage gap,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.448
maybe we should start
by opening up the payroll.

00:04:52.864 --> 00:04:56.086
If this is what total
market failure looks like,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.378
then openness remains
the only way to ensure fairness.
