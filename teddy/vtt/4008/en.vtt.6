00:02:59.506 --> 00:03:02.504
one party has loads more
information than the other.

00:03:02.887 --> 00:03:06.297
And in hiring or promotion
or annual raise discussions,

00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:09.979
an employer can use that secrecy
to save a lot of money.

00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:13.142
Imagine how much better
you could negotiate for a raise

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:14.973
if you knew everybody's salary.

00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:20.053
Economists warn that information asymmetry

00:03:20.077 --> 00:03:21.724
can cause markets to go awry.

00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:23.654
Someone leaves a pay stub on the copier,

00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:26.096
and suddenly everybody
is shouting at each other.

00:03:26.866 --> 00:03:28.572
In fact, they even warn

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:33.413
that information asymmetry
can lead to a total market failure.
