00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:02.775
Now, I realize that letting people
know what you make

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:04.445
might feel uncomfortable,

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:05.984
but isn't it less uncomfortable

00:05:06.008 --> 00:05:08.888
than always wondering
if you're being discriminated against,

00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:12.674
or if your wife or your daughter
or your sister is being paid unfairly?

00:05:13.353 --> 00:05:17.293
Openness remains the best way
to ensure fairness,

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.230
and pay transparency does that.

00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:22.671
That's why entrepreneurial leaders
and corporate leaders

00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:25.488
have been experimenting
with sharing salaries for years.

00:05:25.512 --> 00:05:26.925
Like Dane Atkinson.
