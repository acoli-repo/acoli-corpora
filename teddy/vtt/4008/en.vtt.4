00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:01.975
In one famous example from decades ago,

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.105
the management of Vanity Fair magazine

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:06.249
actually circulated a memo entitled:

00:02:06.273 --> 00:02:09.478
"Forbidding Discussion Among
Employees of Salary Received."

00:02:09.502 --> 00:02:12.824
"Forbidding" discussion among
employees of salary received.

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:15.629
Now that memo didn't sit well
with everybody.

00:02:15.653 --> 00:02:17.699
New York literary figures
Dorothy Parker,

00:02:17.723 --> 00:02:19.485
Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood,

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.950
all writers in the Algonquin Round Table,

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.755
decided to stand up for transparency

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.511
and showed up for work the next day

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:28.749
with their salary written on signs
hanging from their neck.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.321
(Laughter)
