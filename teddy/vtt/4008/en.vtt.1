00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:30.938
Notice, it's a little uncomfortable for me
to even ask you those questions.

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:34.112
But admit it -- you kind of want to know.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:38.518
Most of us are uncomfortable with the idea
of broadcasting our salary.

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:40.691
We're not supposed to tell our neighbors,

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.907
and we're definitely not supposed
to tell our office neighbors.

00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:47.445
The assumed reason is that if everybody
knew what everybody got paid,

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.259
then all hell would break loose.

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:51.384
There'd be arguments, there'd be fights,

00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:53.597
there might even be a few people who quit.

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:57.400
But what if secrecy is actually
the reason for all that strife?

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.042
And what would happen
if we removed that secrecy?
