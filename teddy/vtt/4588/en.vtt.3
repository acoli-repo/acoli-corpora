00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:30.916
the intensity of the light
in the colors on the canvas.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.608
The more primitive part
of our visual cortex,

00:01:33.632 --> 00:01:37.554
which sees light contrast
and motion, but not color,

00:01:37.578 --> 00:01:40.603
will blend two differently
colored areas together

00:01:40.627 --> 00:01:42.949
if they have the same luminance.

00:01:42.973 --> 00:01:45.328
But our brains' primate subdivision

00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:48.482
will see the contrasting colors
without blending.

00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:51.433
With these two interpretations
happening at once,

00:01:51.457 --> 00:01:57.005
the light in many Impressionist works
seems to pulse, flicker and radiate oddly.

00:01:57.898 --> 00:02:00.200
That's how this
and other Impressionist works
