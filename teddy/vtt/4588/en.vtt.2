In "The Starry Night,"
his circular brushstrokes

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:07.803
create a night sky filled
with swirling clouds and eddies of stars.

00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:11.724
Van Gogh and other Impressionists
represented light in a different way

00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:12.955
than their predecessors,

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.749
seeming to capture
its motion, for instance,

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:17.836
across sun-dappled waters,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.506
or here in star light
that twinkles and melts

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.919
through milky waves of blue night sky.

00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:27.391
The effect is caused by luminance,

00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:30.916
the intensity of the light
in the colors on the canvas.
