00:01:57.898 --> 00:02:00.200
That's how this
and other Impressionist works

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:03.042
use quickly executed
prominent brushstrokes

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:06.733
to capture something strikingly real
about how light moves.

00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:11.182
Sixty years later, Russian
mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov

00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:13.763
furthered our mathematical
understanding of turbulence

00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:18.133
when he proposed that energy
in a turbulent fluid at length R

00:02:18.157 --> 00:02:22.467
varies in proportion to
the 5/3rds power of R.

00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:24.444
Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.632
was remarkably close
to the way turbulent flow works,

00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:29.788
although a complete description
of turbulence

00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:32.576
remains one of the unsolved
problems in physics.
