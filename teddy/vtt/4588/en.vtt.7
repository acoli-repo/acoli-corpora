00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:34.431

Van Gogh's period of psychotic agitation

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:37.137
behave remarkably similar
to fluid turbulence.

00:03:37.987 --> 00:03:41.974
His self-portrait with a pipe, from
a calmer period in Van Gogh's life,

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.860
showed no sign of this correspondence.

00:03:44.313 --> 00:03:46.787
And neither did other artists' work

00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:49.337
that seemed equally
turbulent at first glance,

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.977
like Munch's "The Scream."

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:54.672

enabled him to depict turbulence,

00:03:57.092 --> 00:04:02.002
it's also far too difficult to accurately
express the rousing beauty of the fact
