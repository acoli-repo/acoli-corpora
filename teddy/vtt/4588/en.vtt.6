00:02:59.931 --> 00:03:02.857
and it reminded them
of Van Gogh's "Starry Night."

00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:07.169
This motivated scientists
from Mexico, Spain and England

00:03:07.193 --> 00:03:10.570
to study the luminance
in Van Gogh's paintings in detail.

00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:15.676
They discovered that there is a distinct
pattern of turbulent fluid structures

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.014
close to Kolmogorov's equation
hidden in many of Van Gogh's paintings.

00:03:20.998 --> 00:03:23.200
The researchers digitized the paintings,

00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:26.946
and measured how brightness varies
between any two pixels.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.665
From the curves measured
for pixel separations,

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:34.431
they concluded that paintings from
Van Gogh's period of psychotic agitation
