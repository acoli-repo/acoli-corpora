Among the hardest patterns
we've tried to understand

00:00:16.355 --> 00:00:20.765
is the concept of
turbulent flow in fluid dynamics.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.272
The German physicist
Werner Heisenberg said,

00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:27.357
"When I meet God,

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:30.818
why relativity and why turbulence?
