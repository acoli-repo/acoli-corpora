00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:32.576
remains one of the unsolved
problems in physics.

00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:37.491
A turbulent flow is self-similar
if there is an energy cascade.

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:41.099
In other words, big eddies
transfer their energy to smaller eddies,

00:02:41.123 --> 00:02:43.174
which do likewise at other scales.

00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:47.204
Examples of this include
Jupiter's Great Red Spot,

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:50.568
cloud formations
and interstellar dust particles.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.885
In 2004, using the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.907
scientists saw the eddies of a distant
cloud of dust and gas around a star,

00:02:59.931 --> 00:03:02.857
and it reminded them
of Van Gogh's "Starry Night."
