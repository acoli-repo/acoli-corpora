00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:30.065
happiness, sadness, fear,
disgust, anger, surprise --

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:33.628
are expressed by everyone across the globe
in exactly the same way,

00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:36.335
and therefore represent
the building blocks

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.018
of our entire emotional lives.

00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:41.209
Well, if you look at an emotion like this,

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:43.362
then it looks like a simple reflex:

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:45.622
it's triggered by an external predicament,

00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:47.427
it's hardwired,

00:03:47.451 --> 00:03:50.049
it's there to protect us from harm.

00:03:50.073 --> 00:03:52.537
So you see a bear,
your heart rate quickens,

00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:56.762
your pupils dilate, you feel frightened,
you run very, very fast.

00:03:57.878 --> 00:03:59.965
The problem with this picture is,

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.087
it doesn't entirely capture
what an emotion is.
