Happiness is supposed
to make us better workers

00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:45.448
and parents and partners;

00:09:45.472 --> 00:09:47.948
it's supposed to make us live longer.

which try to encourage sadness in readers

00:09:58.712 --> 00:10:01.678
by giving them lists of reasons
to be disappointed.
