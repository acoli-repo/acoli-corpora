00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:32.810
when knowledge of emotions
is an extremely important commodity,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.552
where emotions are used
to explain many things,

00:02:37.192 --> 00:02:39.109
exploited by our politicians,

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.264
manipulated by algorithms.

00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:46.138
Emotional intelligence, which is the skill
of being able to recognize and name

00:02:46.162 --> 00:02:48.638
your own emotions
and those of other people,

00:02:48.662 --> 00:02:52.849
is considered so important, that this
is taught in our schools and businesses

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:55.200
and encouraged by our health services.

00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:57.785
But despite all of this,

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:58.988
I sometimes wonder

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.895
if the way we think about emotions
is becoming impoverished.
