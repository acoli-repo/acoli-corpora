00:10:59.072 --> 00:11:00.248
to absorb this air,

00:11:00.272 --> 00:11:03.648
and then very early the next morning,
they wake up and have a ceremony

00:11:03.672 --> 00:11:04.896
and throw the water away.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.183
Now, here's a good example

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:10.244
of spiritual practices
and geographical realities combining

00:11:10.268 --> 00:11:12.722
to bring a distinct emotion into life

00:11:12.746 --> 00:11:14.506
and make it disappear again.

00:11:15.836 --> 00:11:20.469
One of my favorite emotions
is a Japanese word, "amae."

00:11:21.425 --> 00:11:23.757
Amae is a very common word in Japan,

00:11:23.781 --> 00:11:25.809
but it is actually quite
hard to translate.

00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:28.372
It means something like
the pleasure that you get

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:32.390
when you're able to temporarily
hand over responsibility for your life
