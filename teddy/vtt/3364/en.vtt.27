00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:33.558
I want to end with an emotion I often feel

00:13:33.582 --> 00:13:35.566
when I'm working as a historian.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.051
It's a French word, "dépaysement."

00:13:38.495 --> 00:13:43.304
It evokes the giddy disorientation
that you feel in an unfamiliar place.

00:13:43.328 --> 00:13:45.424
One of my favorite parts
of being a historian

00:13:45.448 --> 00:13:47.932
is when something
I've completely taken for granted,

00:13:47.956 --> 00:13:50.527
some very familiar part of my life,

00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:52.635
is suddenly made strange again.

00:13:53.262 --> 00:13:56.079
Dépaysement is unsettling,

00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:57.958
but it's exciting, too.

00:13:57.982 --> 00:14:01.516
And I hope you might be having
just a little glimpse of it right now.
