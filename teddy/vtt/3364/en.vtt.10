00:04:59.394 --> 00:05:02.421
was first really only felt
by the Victorians,

00:05:02.445 --> 00:05:07.621
in response to new ideas
about leisure time and self-improvement?

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.070
What if we were to think again

00:05:10.094 --> 00:05:12.912
about those odd,
untranslatable words for emotions

00:05:12.936 --> 00:05:17.166
and wonder whether some cultures
might feel an emotion more intensely

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.986
just because they've bothered
to name and talk about it,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.479
like the Russian "toska,"

00:05:23.503 --> 00:05:26.210
a feeling of maddening dissatisfaction

00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:28.768
said to blow in from the great plains.
