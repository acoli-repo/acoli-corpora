00:08:31.363 --> 00:08:34.932
How is it possible
that you could die from nostalgia

00:08:34.956 --> 00:08:36.768
less than a hundred years ago?

00:08:36.792 --> 00:08:39.864
But today, not only does the word
mean something different --

00:08:39.888 --> 00:08:43.324
a sickening for a lost time
rather than a lost place --

00:08:43.348 --> 00:08:46.646
but homesickness itself
is seen as less serious,

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.211
sort of downgraded from something
you could die from

00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:52.484
to something you're mainly worried
your kid might be suffering from

00:08:52.508 --> 00:08:53.676
at a sleepover.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.818
This change seems to have happened
in the early 20th century.

00:08:57.842 --> 00:08:59.061
But why?

00:08:59.085 --> 00:09:03.317
Was it the invention of telephones
or the expansion of the railways?
