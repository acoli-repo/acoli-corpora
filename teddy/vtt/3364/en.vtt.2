00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:00.320
in big groups of people like this;

00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:02.512
the Welsh called it "hwyl,"

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:04.886
from the word for boat sails.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.314
Or maybe you felt all of these things.

00:01:08.338 --> 00:01:11.763
There are some emotions
which wash the world in a single color,

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:14.796
like the terror felt as a car skids.

00:01:15.344 --> 00:01:17.942
But more often, our emotions
crowd and jostle together

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.803
until it is actually quite hard
to tell them apart.

00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:25.142
Some slide past so quickly
you'd hardly even notice them,

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.594
like the nostalgia
that will make you reach out

00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:30.208
to grab a familiar brand
in the supermarket.
