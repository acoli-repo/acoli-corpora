and what ideas about how
we ought to live and behave

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:04.251
they are smuggling along with them.

00:07:05.753 --> 00:07:07.558
Let me tell you a story.

00:07:07.582 --> 00:07:11.712
It begins in a garret
in the late 17th century,

00:07:11.736 --> 00:07:14.262
in the Swiss university town of Basel.

00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:19.951
Inside, there's a dedicated student
living some 60 miles away from home.

00:07:19.975 --> 00:07:21.767
He stops turning up to his lectures,

00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:26.511
and his friends come to visit
and they find him dejected and feverish,

00:07:26.535 --> 00:07:28.401
having heart palpitations,

00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:30.890
strange sores breaking out on his body.
