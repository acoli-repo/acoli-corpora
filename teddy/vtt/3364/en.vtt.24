00:11:59.563 --> 00:12:01.317
but it is tantalizing.

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:07.263
What might our emotional languages
tell us not just about what we feel,

00:12:07.287 --> 00:12:10.194
but about what we value most?

00:12:12.877 --> 00:12:16.981
Most people who tell us
to pay attention to our well-being

00:12:17.005 --> 00:12:20.714
talk of the importance
of naming our emotions.

00:12:20.738 --> 00:12:23.971
But these names aren't neutral labels.

00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:27.220
They are freighted with our culture's
values and expectations,

00:12:27.244 --> 00:12:30.570
and they transmit ideas
about who we think we are.
