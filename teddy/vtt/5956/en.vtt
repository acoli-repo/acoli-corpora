00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:11.454
As the space telescope prepares
to snap a photo,

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:14.371
the light of the nearby
star blocks its view.

00:00:14.996 --> 00:00:17.746
But the telescope 
has a trick up its sleeve:

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:21.079
a massive shield to block the glare.

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.704
This starshade has a diameter 
of about 35 metersâ€”

00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:29.371
that folds down to just under 2.5 meters,

00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:32.454
small enough to carry 
on the end of a rocket.
