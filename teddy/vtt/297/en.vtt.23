00:11:26.297 --> 00:11:30.982
has ever stopped even the bravest,

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:35.031
wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband

00:11:35.031 --> 00:11:39.224
from dying when it was his time to go.

00:11:39.224 --> 00:11:41.537
People did mention hospice,

00:11:41.537 --> 00:11:44.908
but I wouldn't listen.

00:11:44.908 --> 00:11:48.833
Hospice was for people who were dying,

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.606
and Terence wasn't dying.

00:11:51.606 --> 00:11:54.516
As a result, he spent just four days in hospice,

00:11:54.516 --> 00:11:56.333
which I'm sure, as you all know,

00:11:56.333 --> 00:11:58.423
is a pretty typical outcome,

00:11:58.423 --> 00:11:59.935
and we never said goodbye

00:11:59.935 --> 00:12:02.990
because we were unprepared for the end.
