00:05:58.615 --> 00:06:01.692
"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."

00:06:01.692 --> 00:06:04.180
We never got the chance to say goodbye.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.459
We never thought it was the end.

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:11.638
We always had hope.

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:15.502
So what do we make of all of this?

00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:19.080
Being a journalist, after Terence died,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.369
I wrote a book, "The Cost Of Hope."

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:24.519
I wrote it because I wanted to know

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:26.205
why I did what I did,

00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:28.006
why he did what he did,

00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:30.561
why everyone around us did what they did.
