00:00:28.615 --> 00:00:32.179
there in China specifically to study

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.270
Sino-Soviet relations.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.670
What a gift it was to the eager,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.428
young foreign correspondent that I was then.

00:00:39.428 --> 00:00:41.436
I'd pump him for information,

00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:43.093
I'm mentally scribbling notes

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:45.402
for the stories I plan to write.

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:47.887
I talk to him for hours.

00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:51.398
Only months later,

00:00:51.398 --> 00:00:53.772
I discover who he really was.

00:00:53.772 --> 00:00:56.545
He was the China representative

00:00:56.545 --> 00:01:00.774
for the American Soybean Association.
