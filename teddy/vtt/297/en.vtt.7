00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.911
I'm looking for a cure.

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.988
So a year goes by

00:03:32.988 --> 00:03:36.194
before the cancer, as cancers do,

00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:38.194
reappears,

00:03:38.194 --> 00:03:40.270
and with it comes another death sentence,

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.463
this time nine months.

00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:46.477
So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.

00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:48.297
It makes him so sick, he has to quit it,

00:03:48.297 --> 00:03:51.314
yet still he lives on.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:53.210
Then another year goes by.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.760
Two years go by.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.249
More specialists.

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.169
We take the kids to Italy.

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.638
We take the kids to Australia.
