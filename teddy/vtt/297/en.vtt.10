00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:07.264

00:05:07.264 --> 00:05:10.620

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.135
And Terence died six days later.

00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:18.183

00:05:18.183 --> 00:05:19.979
It was an exhilarating fight,

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.696
and I'd repeat the fight today

00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:27.296
We fought together, we lived together.

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:29.400
