00:07:28.109 --> 00:07:30.320
so many people and have talked to so many people

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.994
who have felt exactly the same way.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:36.928
Right up until days before his death,

00:07:36.928 --> 00:07:40.254
I felt strongly

00:07:40.254 --> 00:07:44.297
and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally,

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:49.544
that I could keep him from dying ever.

00:07:49.544 --> 00:07:52.779
Now, what do the experts call this?

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:55.126
They say it's denial.

00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:57.317
It's a strong word, isn't it?

00:07:57.317 --> 00:07:59.714
Yet I will tell you that denial

00:07:59.714 --> 00:08:04.828
isn't even close to a strong enough word
