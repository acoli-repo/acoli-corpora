00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.462
Then there was a setback when the pathologists

00:03:00.462 --> 00:03:02.835
looked at the kidney cancer closely.

00:03:02.835 --> 00:03:04.464
It turned out to be a rare,

00:03:04.464 --> 00:03:06.273
exceedingly aggressive type,

00:03:06.273 --> 00:03:09.355
with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.746
in several weeks at most.

00:03:11.746 --> 00:03:15.456
And yet, he did not die.

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:18.966
Mysteriously, he lived on.

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:21.050
He coached Little League for our son.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.602
He built a playhouse for our daughter.

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:26.676
And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet

00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:28.350
looking for specialists.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.911
I'm looking for a cure.
