00:07:59.714 --> 00:08:04.828
isn't even close to a strong enough word

00:08:04.828 --> 00:08:07.474
to describe what those of us

00:08:07.474 --> 00:08:11.112
facing the death of our loved ones go through.

00:08:11.112 --> 00:08:13.453
And I hear the medical professionals say,

00:08:13.453 --> 00:08:15.536
"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such,

00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:17.987
but the family's in denial.

00:08:17.987 --> 00:08:20.163
The family won't listen to reason.

00:08:20.163 --> 00:08:22.185
They're in denial.

00:08:22.185 --> 00:08:24.537
How can they insist on this treatment at the end?

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:27.841
It's so clear, yet they're in denial."

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.848
Now, I think this maybe isn't

00:08:29.848 --> 00:08:32.852
a very useful way of thinking.
