00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.134
seven of the grimmest years of our life

00:05:32.134 --> 00:05:35.745
into seven of the most glorious.

00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:38.520
It was also an expensive fight.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.481
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices

00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:42.115
that everyone here agrees

00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:44.520
pump up the cost of end-of-life care,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.806
and of healthcare for all of us.

00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:49.888
And for me, for us,

00:05:49.888 --> 00:05:51.970
we pushed the fight right over the edge,

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.195
and I never got the chance to say to him

00:05:55.195 --> 00:05:58.615
what I say to him now almost every day:

00:05:58.615 --> 00:06:01.692
"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."
