00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:30.561
why everyone around us did what they did.

00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:32.197
And what did I discover?

00:06:32.197 --> 00:06:33.771
Well, one of the things I discovered is that

00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:36.848
experts think that one answer to

00:06:36.848 --> 00:06:39.598
what I did at the end was a piece of paper,

00:06:39.598 --> 00:06:41.756
the advance directive,

00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:46.096
to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.

00:06:46.096 --> 00:06:50.210
Yet I had that piece of paper.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.263
We both did.

00:06:52.263 --> 00:06:53.953
And they were readily available.

00:06:53.953 --> 00:06:55.892
I had them right at hand.

00:06:55.892 --> 00:06:58.251
Both of them said the same thing:

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:02.752
Do nothing if there is no further hope.
