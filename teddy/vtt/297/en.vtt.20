00:09:57.955 --> 00:10:00.132
and yet our system and our thinking

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:03.301
isn't built to accommodate it.

00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:06.356
So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night,

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.261
and I believed it.

00:10:08.261 --> 00:10:11.375
Maybe I wanted to believe it.

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:16.704
And during Terence's illness, I, we,

00:10:16.704 --> 00:10:18.426
we wanted to believe the story

00:10:18.426 --> 00:10:21.021
of our fight together too.

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:24.757
Giving up the fight -- for that's how it felt,

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.696
it felt like giving up --

00:10:26.696 --> 00:10:29.413
meant giving up not only his life

00:10:29.413 --> 00:10:33.120
but also our story,
