00:04:28.607 --> 00:04:30.996
how do I feel

00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:33.510
when the time finally comes

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.016
and there's another dark night,

00:04:36.016 --> 00:04:38.517
sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?

00:04:38.517 --> 00:04:41.491
This time it's on the intensive care ward

00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:43.329
when a twentysomething resident

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:45.532
that I've never met before

00:04:45.532 --> 00:04:48.125
tells me that Terence is dying,

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:50.324
perhaps tonight.

00:04:50.324 --> 00:04:53.117
So what do I say when he says,

00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:55.931
"What do you want me to do?"

00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:57.943
There's another drug out there.

00:04:57.943 --> 00:04:59.631
It's newer. It's more powerful.

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:02.200
He started it just two weeks ago.
