00:14:28.517 --> 00:14:30.027
about their loved ones

00:14:30.027 --> 00:14:33.956
are often based strongly, powerfully,

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.808
many times irrationally,

00:14:36.808 --> 00:14:39.152
on the slimmest of hopes?

00:14:39.152 --> 00:14:42.174
The overwhelming presence of hope

00:14:42.174 --> 00:14:43.597
isn't denial.

00:14:43.597 --> 00:14:46.417
It's part of our DNA as humans,

00:14:46.417 --> 00:14:48.735
and maybe it's time our healthcare system --

00:14:48.735 --> 00:14:53.219
doctors, patients, insurance companies, us,

00:14:53.219 --> 00:14:57.193
started accounting for the power of that hope.

00:14:57.193 --> 00:14:59.493
Hope isn't a bug.

00:14:59.493 --> 00:15:01.862
It's a feature.
