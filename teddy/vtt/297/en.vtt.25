00:12:26.623 --> 00:12:30.741
So maybe we need a narrative

00:12:30.741 --> 00:12:34.217
for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye,

00:12:34.217 --> 00:12:36.779
and maybe our new story will be

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:41.385
about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:43.852
Terence loved poetry,

00:12:43.852 --> 00:12:47.079
and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy

00:12:47.079 --> 00:12:49.508
is one of my favorite poets.

00:12:49.508 --> 00:12:52.392
So I'll give you a couple lines from him.

00:12:52.392 --> 00:12:54.608
This is a poem about Mark Antony.

00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:57.301
You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero,

00:12:57.301 --> 00:12:59.166
Cleopatra's guy?

00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:01.703
Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys.
