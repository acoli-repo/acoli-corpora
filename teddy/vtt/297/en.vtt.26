00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:01.703
Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys.

00:13:01.703 --> 00:13:04.128
And he's been a pretty good general.

00:13:04.128 --> 00:13:05.188
He's won all the fights,

00:13:05.188 --> 00:13:07.643
he's eluded all the people that are out to get him,

00:13:07.643 --> 00:13:09.431
and yet this time, finally,

00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:11.180
he's come to the city of Alexandria

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.862
and realized he's lost.

00:13:12.862 --> 00:13:14.578
The people are leaving. They're playing instruments.

00:13:14.578 --> 00:13:15.901
They're singing.

00:13:15.901 --> 00:13:18.501
And suddenly he knows he's been defeated.

00:13:18.501 --> 00:13:20.680
And he suddenly knows

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.205
he's been deserted by the gods,

00:13:23.205 --> 00:13:25.145
and it's time to let go.

00:13:25.145 --> 00:13:27.112
And the poet tells him what to do.

00:13:27.112 --> 00:13:30.378
He tells him how to say a noble goodbye,
