for the American Soybean Association.

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:04.044
"I don't understand. Soybeans?

00:01:04.044 --> 00:01:06.799
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar."

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.687
"Well, how long would you have talked to me

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:10.729
if I told you we're in soybeans?"

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.210
(Laughter)

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.502
I said, "You jerk."

00:01:16.502 --> 00:01:20.255
Only jerk wasn't the word I used.

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:24.402
I said, "You could've gotten me fired."

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:27.939
And he said, "Let's get married."

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.226
(Laughter)

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:32.122
"Travel the world and have lots of kids."
