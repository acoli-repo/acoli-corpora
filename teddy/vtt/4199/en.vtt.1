Sugata Mitra: 
What is the need for education?

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.776
We can think about our mind

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.976
like an empty suitcase that gets
filled for sixteen years.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.776
It is packed well,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.936
so that we carry that suitcase
in our journey of life
