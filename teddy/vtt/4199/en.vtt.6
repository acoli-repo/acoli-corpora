00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.280
I gave the children a computer, 
asked them a question and left them.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.656
Then I noticed that repeatedly,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.680
however tough the question,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.061
if the kids were working together,
they would come up with the answer.

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:12.565
How did they understand? No idea.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.986
Then I asked myself about schools
where there is not a single teacher.

00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:18.240
What can we do there?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.936
We thought, maybe
through Skype or WhatsApp,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.816
we can send someone there.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.416
Whom shall we send?

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.576
So we made a cloud. 
It’s called Granny cloud,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.280
meaning the grandparents cloud.
