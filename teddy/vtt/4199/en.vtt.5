He said, “One of them is quoting

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.176
I said, "In which language?"

He replied, “In English, sir.”

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.816
I was amazed. How was this possible?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.616

There is a city on the banks

I gave the children a computer, 
asked them a question and left them.
