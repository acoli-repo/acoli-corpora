00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.850
There was an underprivileged 
community in Kalkaji.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.540
There were a lot of children there.


00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.800
In those days, there were many children

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.000
who had never seen a computer, 
never heard of the internet.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.176
So I thought what will happen
if I give them a computer?

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.736
So in a wall we made a slot,

00:01:54.826 --> 00:01:58.296
like an ATM machine 
and fixed a computer in it.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.136
In a few hours, I saw 
that the children were surfing the net.
