However, not only are people
interested in doing this,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.093
but the citizen scientists
that work with Planet Hunters

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:07.009
have actually found planets in the data

00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:09.366
that would have gone
undiscovered otherwise.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.378
This is an author list
from the paper that they published

00:08:12.402 --> 00:08:13.974
of the planet they discovered.

00:08:13.998 --> 00:08:17.072
You'll see that all the people
who contributed are listed below,

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:20.261
and it's sort of an odd amalgam
of people's real names

00:08:20.285 --> 00:08:22.029
and their log-in names.

00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:25.799
You'll notice if you look carefully,
this is the first academic acknowledgment

00:08:25.823 --> 00:08:29.052
of the importance of Irish coffee
in the discovery process.

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:30.788
