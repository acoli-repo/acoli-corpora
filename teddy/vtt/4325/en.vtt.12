These are called
"citizen science projects."

00:06:02.556 --> 00:06:07.096
Citizen science is when large
research projects put their data online,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.716
teach ordinary people, like you,
to go and interact with that data

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.747
and actually contribute to the research

00:06:13.771 --> 00:06:17.431
by making interesting or necessary
characterizations about it.

00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:21.706
One such example of this is what
I'm showing here, called "Galaxy Zoo."

00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:24.397
Galaxy Zoo is a project

00:06:24.421 --> 00:06:29.724
where people get a 20-minute --
even less than that, actually -- tutorial

00:06:29.748 --> 00:06:32.126
on how to interact
with these images of galaxies.
