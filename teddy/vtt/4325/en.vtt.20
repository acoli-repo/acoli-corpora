00:09:59.084 --> 00:10:02.292
and to experience the larger context,

00:10:02.824 --> 00:10:08.543
this feeling that just as we go out
and try to find planets in the universe

00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:10.400
that might be like ours,

00:10:10.424 --> 00:10:15.010
it always reminds me
of how precious what we have here is.

00:10:15.752 --> 00:10:18.772
Our night sky is like a natural resource,

00:10:18.796 --> 00:10:21.579
it's as though it's a park
that you can visit

00:10:21.603 --> 00:10:23.490
without ever having to travel there.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.131
But like any natural resource,

00:10:26.155 --> 00:10:29.438
if we don't protect it,
if we don't preserve it and treasure it,

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.599
it will slip away from us and be gone.
