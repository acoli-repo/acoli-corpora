00:04:29.657 --> 00:04:31.708
and becomes what we call
"light pollution."

00:04:31.732 --> 00:04:36.389
Even if you don't care anything
about stargazing, this should worry you,

00:04:36.413 --> 00:04:41.272
because it means that 60-70% of the energy
we use to light the outdoors

00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:43.921
is wasted by blotting out the stars.

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.449
Now, like I said,
I'm a big fan of technology.

00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:51.591
Obviously, I use technology
every day; I'm a scientist.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:55.417
And there's this tendency
to say that it's progress that --

00:04:55.441 --> 00:05:00.541
you know, I'm not suggesting
we're going to all go live by candlelight.
