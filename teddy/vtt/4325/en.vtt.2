I was here, in Arizona.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.915
I was on a road trip;
I pulled over somewhere.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.726
I have no idea where I was,
except I know what state.

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:09.736
And I looked up,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.023
and the sky was just filled
with an impossible number of stars.

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:16.952
You see, I'm from New York City,

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:22.043
and in New York, you can see the moon,
you can see a couple of stars.

00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:25.236
More often than not, they turn out
to be airplanes when they land.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.269
(Laughter)

00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:27.899
But there's really not much else.

00:01:27.923 --> 00:01:31.478
As a result, most of my colleagues
who are astronomers
