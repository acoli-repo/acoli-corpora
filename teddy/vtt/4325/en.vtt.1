00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:30.306
And honestly, we rarely
even take the trouble

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.678
to look up enough to see each other,

00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:36.641
let alone taking that next step
to looking up at the actual sky.

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:42.639
Now, there's a tendency to think
that the loss of our dark night skies

00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:46.208
is the inevitable outcome
of progress, change, technology.

00:00:46.637 --> 00:00:48.710
And you know, that's just simply not true.

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:50.462
Later on, I'll tell you why.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:54.615
But first, I want to tell you
about my experience of the dark night sky.

00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:59.201
I never saw a truly dark night
sky until I was 15.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.943
I was here, in Arizona.
