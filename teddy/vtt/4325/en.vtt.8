An individual light bulb can light up
your whole room, more or less.

00:04:01.367 --> 00:04:04.461
Now, that's great
if you're lighting the indoors,

00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:07.255
but in its application
in outdoor lighting,

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.259
that traditional shape of the light bulb,

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:12.285
the sort of globe that spreads
light everywhere,

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.013
is actually very inefficient.

00:04:14.037 --> 00:04:16.419
When you're outdoors,
mostly what you care about

00:04:16.443 --> 00:04:20.520
is lighting the ground beneath you
and your immediate surroundings.

00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:24.542
All of that light that gets scattered
outwards and upwards

00:04:24.566 --> 00:04:26.996
doesn't actually help you
light the area around you.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.633
What it does is scatters up into the sky

00:04:29.657 --> 00:04:31.708
and becomes what we call
"light pollution."
