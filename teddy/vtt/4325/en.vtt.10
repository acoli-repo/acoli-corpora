you know, I'm not suggesting
we're going to all go live by candlelight.

00:05:00.565 --> 00:05:04.374
Indeed, technology is allowing us
to access the sky

00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:06.850
in ways that are impossible otherwise.

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:11.179
One of the greatest examples of this is,
of course, the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:05:11.203 --> 00:05:15.160
The Hubble went up into space,
it returns pictures daily,

00:05:15.184 --> 00:05:16.735
and it allows us to see things

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.976
that we are incapable of seeing
with our naked eye,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.985
in ways that we've never been able
to do before in all of human history.

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:28.028
Other examples of this
would be planetarium shows.

00:05:28.052 --> 00:05:32.224
In the past couple of years, planetarium
shows have become more high-tech
