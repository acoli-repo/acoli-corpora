00:01:27.923 --> 00:01:31.478
As a result, most of my colleagues
who are astronomers

00:01:31.502 --> 00:01:35.571
spent at least part of their youth
looking up at the sky in their backyard.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.560
I never really had that experience,

00:01:37.584 --> 00:01:41.380
and, as a result, I'm really
disappointing on camping trips.

00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:44.287
I don't really know many constellations.

00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.166
The ones I do know,
you probably know them, too.

00:01:47.926 --> 00:01:50.257
But I'll never forget that experience

00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.910
of the first time I saw
the dark night sky.

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:57.012
And I was just flabbergasted
at how many stars there were.

00:01:57.036 --> 00:01:58.829
And I felt tiny.

00:01:59.923 --> 00:02:05.255
Then I also felt like,
"Where's this been hiding this whole time?
