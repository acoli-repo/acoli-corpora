it will slip away from us and be gone.

00:10:32.407 --> 00:10:34.704
So if you're interested in this,

00:10:34.728 --> 00:10:37.414
and this is something
you want to learn more about,

00:10:37.438 --> 00:10:40.790
I encourage you in particular
to visit darksky.org

00:10:40.814 --> 00:10:43.171
and to learn more
about the choices you can make

00:10:43.195 --> 00:10:45.461
that can protect the dark night sky,

00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:48.718
because it belongs to everyone,
it belongs to all of us,

00:10:48.742 --> 00:10:51.657
and therefore, it's ours
to experience as we wish.

00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:53.321
And it's also ours to lose.

00:10:53.345 --> 00:10:54.596
Thank you.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.586
