In the past couple of years, planetarium
shows have become more high-tech

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.184
with these great visualizations,

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.732
and even though this isn't access
directly to the sky,

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:39.671
it's at least access
to our knowledge about the sky.

00:05:39.695 --> 00:05:42.447
And indeed, we can experience
the sky in a planetarium

00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:45.160
in a way that is impossible for us to do

00:05:45.184 --> 00:05:47.368
just sitting out and looking in the dark.

00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:52.261
All of you have heard of the Hubble
Space Telescope and of planetariums.

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:56.254
But there are also ways
for technology to enable participation

00:05:56.278 --> 00:05:58.153
in people's experience of the sky

00:05:58.177 --> 00:05:59.871
that you may not be familiar with.

00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:02.532
These are called
"citizen science projects."
