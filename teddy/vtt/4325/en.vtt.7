00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:31.051
of very extreme examples --
Times Square, the Vegas Strip.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.745
But really what that picture shows you

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.299
is that it's not just
these extreme examples,

00:03:36.323 --> 00:03:39.049
it's anywhere that uses outdoor lighting.

00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:42.025
This tends to be a really
dramatic effect on the ground.

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:43.890
To understand why,

00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:47.136
all you really have to do
is think about the shape of a lightbulb.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.463
The lightbulb, for all practical purposes,

00:03:49.487 --> 00:03:50.854
is more or less round.

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:55.388
This is great for its original intended
purpose of lighting up the indoors.

00:03:55.412 --> 00:03:57.556
You turn it on, light goes everywhere.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.343
An individual light bulb can light up
your whole room, more or less.
