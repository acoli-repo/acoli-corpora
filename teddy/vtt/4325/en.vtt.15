Planet Hunters gives you,
like Galaxy Zoo, a short tutorial,

00:07:34.598 --> 00:07:37.163
and within a couple of minutes,
you're up and running;

00:07:37.187 --> 00:07:39.492
you're looking at data
from the Kepler Mission

00:07:39.516 --> 00:07:41.570
and looking for planets.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.841
The idea behind this
is an easy sell, right?

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:49.734
But the actual process of planet-hunting
involves a lot of looking at graphs,

00:07:49.758 --> 00:07:52.649
like the one I'm showing you here,
and annotating them.

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:56.086
I do this all day and that doesn't even
sound that interesting to me.

00:07:56.915 --> 00:08:00.826
However, not only are people
interested in doing this,
