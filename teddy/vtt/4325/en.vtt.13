on how to interact
with these images of galaxies.

00:06:32.864 --> 00:06:34.922
They learn to annotate the images,

00:06:34.946 --> 00:06:37.558
and within a couple of minutes,
they're up and running,

00:06:37.582 --> 00:06:39.864
and they're making really
useful categorizations

00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:41.888
and classifications of these galaxies.

00:06:41.912 --> 00:06:43.421
Now, it's easy to understand

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:47.634
why Galaxy Zoo would be an easy sell
for people to be involved with:

00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:49.048
it involves pretty pictures;

00:06:49.072 --> 00:06:52.049
galaxies are, generally
speaking, pretty attractive.

00:06:52.073 --> 00:06:55.388
However, there are many other flavors
of citizen science projects

00:06:55.412 --> 00:06:57.064
that people have delved into

00:06:57.088 --> 00:07:00.456
that have varying levels of abstraction,
