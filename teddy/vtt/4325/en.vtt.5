Unlike stars, which are hot and glow
invisible light so we can see them,

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.885
our planet is, astronomically
speaking, pretty cold.

00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:39.238
So it doesn't really glow.

00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:43.457
When you see the planet looking
like a blue-green marble

00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:45.035
the way it does in this picture,

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.319
you're seeing it because the sunlight
is reflecting off of it,

00:02:48.343 --> 00:02:51.926
and that's why you can see
the oceans, the clouds, the land.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.853
So if the sun wasn't shining on it,

00:02:53.877 --> 00:02:56.137
we wouldn't be able
to see the earth, right?

00:02:57.016 --> 00:02:58.455
Or would we?

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:01.268
This is our earth at night,
