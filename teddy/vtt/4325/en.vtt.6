00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:01.268
This is our earth at night,

00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:03.403
and it is one of the most
striking examples

00:03:03.427 --> 00:03:06.689
of how we have affected
our planet on a global scale.

00:03:06.713 --> 00:03:11.280
You can see light spidering out
across the globe everywhere.

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:14.708
Now, of course, there are broad expanses
of ocean that are still dark,

00:03:14.732 --> 00:03:18.646
and in many underdeveloped areas
there's still darkness.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.773
But you'll notice
that this is a pretty global effect.

00:03:24.163 --> 00:03:27.199
We tend to think, when we think
of places being lit up,

00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:31.051
of very extreme examples --
Times Square, the Vegas Strip.
