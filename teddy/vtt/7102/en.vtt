When it comes to toothpaste commercials,

00:00:02.196 --> 00:00:03.836
you've probably heard claims like,

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:06.356
nine out of 10 dentists
recommend "Brighter, Whiter."

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:08.796
Or maybe it's four

00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:12.836

00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:15.076
trust their authority
and think no further.

00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:19.236
Now that approach is basically BS,
and you probably know it's BS,

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:22.036

How can you trust your BS radar?

Well, when I'm faced
with suspicious statistics,

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:29.396
I tend to ask myself three questions.

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:32.436
First, what were people actually asked?
