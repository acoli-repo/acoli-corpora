Every day, the sands of the Sahara Desert
reach temperatures up to 80° Celsius.

00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:15.663
Stretching over roughly
nine million square kilometers,

00:00:15.663 --> 00:00:21.038
this massive desert receives about 
22 million terawatt hours of energy

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:23.079
from the Sun every year.

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.871
That’s well over 100 times more energy 
than humanity consumes annually.

00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:35.287
So, could covering the desert with solar 
panels solve our energy problems for good?
