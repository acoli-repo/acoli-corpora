00:00:28.723 --> 00:00:30.365
thanks to modern inventions

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:35.452
that those medieval alchemists
missed by a few centuries.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.431
But to understand how this precious metal

00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:40.226
became embedded 
in our planet to start with,

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:43.797
we have to gaze upwards at the stars.

00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:45.462
Gold is extraterrestrial.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:48.231
Instead of arising 
from the planet's rocky crust,

00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:51.013
it was actually cooked up in space

00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:55.551
and is present on Earth 
because of cataclysmic stellar explosions

00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:57.993
called supernovae.

00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:02.202
Stars are mostly made up of hydrogen,
the simplest and lightest element.
