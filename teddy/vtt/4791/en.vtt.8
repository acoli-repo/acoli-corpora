00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.237
but at extremely miniscule concentrations
making its recovery too costly at present.

00:04:01.237 --> 00:04:05.021
Perhaps one day, we'll see gold rushes
to tap the mineral wealth

00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:07.885
of the other planets of our solar system.

00:04:07.885 --> 00:04:09.044
And who knows?

00:04:09.044 --> 00:04:11.876
Maybe some future supernova 
will occur close enough

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.794
to shower us with its treasure

00:04:13.794 --> 00:04:17.204
and hopefully not eradicate 
all life on Earth in the process.
