00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:30.977
But what becomes of the gold
after the explosion?

00:02:30.977 --> 00:02:35.505
The expanding supernova shockwave
propels its elemental debris

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:37.653
through the interstellar medium,

00:02:37.653 --> 00:02:41.031
triggering a swirling dance 
of gas and dust

00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:44.305
that condenses into new stars and planets.

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:47.230
Earth's gold was likely delivered this way

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.819
before being kneaded into veins
by geothermal activity.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.345
Billions of years later, we now extract
this precious product by mining it,

00:02:57.345 --> 00:03:01.043
an expensive process that's compounded
by gold's rarity.
