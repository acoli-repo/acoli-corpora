00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:04.107
so they're easily captured 
by the iron group elements.

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:08.225
Multiple neutron captures enable
the formation of heavier elements

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:11.855
that a star under 
normal circumstances can't form,

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:13.299
from silver to gold,

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.158
past lead and on to uranium.

00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:21.300
In extreme contrast to the million year
transformation of hydrogen to helium,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.287
the creation of the heaviest 
elements in a supernova

00:02:24.287 --> 00:02:27.601
takes place in only seconds.

00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:30.977
But what becomes of the gold
after the explosion?
