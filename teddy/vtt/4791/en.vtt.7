00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:32.374
But these machines can only construct gold
atom by atom.

00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:36.745
So it would take almost the age 
of the universe to produce one gram

00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:40.471
at a cost vastly exceeding 
the current value of gold.

00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:42.469
So that's not a very good solution.

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.709
But if we were to reach 
a hypothetical point

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.576
where we'd mined 
all of the Earth's buried gold,

00:03:47.576 --> 00:03:50.237
there are other places we could look.

00:03:50.237 --> 00:03:55.319
The ocean holds an estimated 
20 million tons of dissolved gold

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.237
but at extremely miniscule concentrations
making its recovery too costly at present.
