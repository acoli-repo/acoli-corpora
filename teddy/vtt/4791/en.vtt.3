00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:32.822
However, at that point nuclear fusion
no longer releases enough energy,

00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:36.357
and the pressure from the core peters out.

00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:38.676
The outer layers collapse into the center,

00:01:38.676 --> 00:01:41.782
and bouncing back from this sudden
injection of energy,

00:01:41.782 --> 00:01:46.411
the star explodes forming a supernova.

00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:49.879
The extreme pressure
of a collapsing star is so high,

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:55.116
that subatomic protons and electrons
are forced together in the core,

00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:57.074
forming neutrons.

00:01:57.074 --> 00:01:59.645
Neutrons have no repelling electric charge

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:04.107
so they're easily captured 
by the iron group elements.
