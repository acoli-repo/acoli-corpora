00:02:57.345 --> 00:03:01.043
an expensive process that's compounded
by gold's rarity.

00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:03.967
In fact, all of the gold 
that we've mined in history

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:08.081
could be piled into 
just three Olympic-size swimming pools,

00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:10.394
although this represents a lot of mass

00:03:10.394 --> 00:03:15.186
because gold is about 20 times 
denser than water.

00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:19.490
So, can we produce more 
of this coveted commodity?

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.031
Actually, yes.

00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:25.719
Using particle accelerators, we can mimic
the complex nuclear reactions

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.321
that create gold in stars.

00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:32.374
But these machines can only construct gold
atom by atom.
