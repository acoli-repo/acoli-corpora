00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:02.202
Stars are mostly made up of hydrogen,
the simplest and lightest element.

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:05.350
The enormous gravitational pressure
of so much material

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.144
compresses and triggers nuclear fusion
in the star's core.

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:12.744
This process releases energy
from the hydrogen,

00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:14.870
making the star shine.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.347
Over many millions of years,

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:20.494
fusion transforms hydrogen 
into heavier elements:

00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:23.476
helium, carbon, and oxygen,

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:28.551
burning subsequent elements faster
and faster to reach iron and nickel.

00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:32.822
However, at that point nuclear fusion
no longer releases enough energy,
