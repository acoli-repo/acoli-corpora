In medieval times,

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:12.978
alchemists tried to achieve 
the seemingly impossible.

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:17.411
They wanted to transform lowly lead
into gleaming gold.

00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:20.811
History portrays these people
as aged eccentrics,

00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:25.024
but if only they'd known that their
dreams were actually achievable.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:28.723
Indeed, today we can 
manufacture gold on Earth
