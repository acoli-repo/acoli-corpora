00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.136
this prevention was not believed
to extend to psychiatric diseases.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.336
Until 2014, when my colleague and I
accidentally discovered

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.560
the first drugs that might prevent
depression and PTSD.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.176
We discovered the drugs in mice,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.016
and we're currently studying
whether they work in humans.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.936
And these preventative
psychopharmaceuticals

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.776
are not antidepressants.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.816
They are a whole new class of drug.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.136
And they work by increasing
stress resilience,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.656
so let's call them resilience enhancers.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.496
So think back to a stressful time
that you've since recovered from.
