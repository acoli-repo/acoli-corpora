00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.856
And from what we've seen so far in mice,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.976
resilience enhancers can protect
against purely biological stressors,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.736
like stress hormones,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.840
and social and psychological stressors,
like bullying and isolation.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.696
So here is an example where we gave mice

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.240
three weeks of high levels
of stress hormones.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.896
So, in other words, a biological stressor
without a psychological component.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.136
And this causes depressive behavior.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.496
And if we give three weeks
of antidepressant treatment beforehand,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.400
it has no beneficial effects.
