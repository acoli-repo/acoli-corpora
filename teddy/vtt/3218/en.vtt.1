And yet, despite how commonplace
these disorders are,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.496
our current treatments,
if they work at all,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.200
only suppress symptoms.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.696
In 1798, when Edward Jenner
discovered the first vaccine --

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.416
it happened to be for smallpox --

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.136
he didn't just discover
a prophylactic for a disease,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.256
but a whole new way of thinking:

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.976
that medicine could prevent disease.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.096
However, for over 200 years,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.136
this prevention was not believed
to extend to psychiatric diseases.
