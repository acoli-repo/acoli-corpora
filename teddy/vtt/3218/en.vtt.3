00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.496
So think back to a stressful time
that you've since recovered from.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.616
Maybe a breakup or an exam,
you missed a flight.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.056
Stress resilience
is the active biological process

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.016
that allows us
to bounce back after stress.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.496
Similar to if you have a cold
and your immune system fights it off.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.336
And insufficient resilience

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.976
in the face of a significant
enough stressor,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.696
can result in a psychiatric disorder,
such as depression.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.576
In fact, most cases
of major depressive disorder

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.680
are initially triggered by stress.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.856
And from what we've seen so far in mice,
