00:02:29.562 --> 00:02:31.302
Not an easy question!

00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:33.494
Everything written down by the Romans

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:36.180
that we have today was written by men.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.913
This makes constructing the lives of women difficult.

00:02:39.913 --> 00:02:44.008
However, we can't have a history of just Roman men,

00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:45.600
so here it goes.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.774
We can begin in the atrium.

00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:48.746
There is a massive loom,

00:02:48.746 --> 00:02:52.686
on which Dad's latest wife is working on a new toga.

00:02:52.686 --> 00:02:55.326
Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia are tasked

00:02:55.326 --> 00:02:56.525
with spinning the wool

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:59.834
that will be used to weave this mighty garment,

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:03.749
30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape.
