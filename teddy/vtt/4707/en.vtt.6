00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:03.749
30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape.

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.108
Romans loved the idea

00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:07.329
that their wives work wool.

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.739
We know that because it's written

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.099
on the gravestones of so many Roman women.

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.003
Unlike women in Greece,

00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:15.801
Roman women go out the house

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:17.721
and move about the city.

00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:20.849
They go to the baths in the morning to avoid the men

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.383
or to separate baths that are for women only.

00:03:24.383 --> 00:03:28.272
Some do go in for the latest fad of the AD 70s:

00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:32.312
nude bathing with men present.
