00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:31.198
The litters are placed on the ground

00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:32.623
and the girls get out

00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:34.997
and arm in arm, two by two,

00:05:34.997 --> 00:05:36.293
they ascend the steps

00:05:36.293 --> 00:05:39.623
into the enclosed garden with many columns.

00:05:39.623 --> 00:05:43.618
Domitia III shot off and is drawing on a column.

00:05:43.618 --> 00:05:45.585
Domitia II joins her

00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:49.603
but seeks to read the graffiti higher up on the column.

00:05:49.603 --> 00:05:52.535
She spots a drawing of gladiators

00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:54.928
and tries to imagine seeing them fighting,

00:05:54.928 --> 00:05:56.936
something she will never be permitted to do,

00:05:56.936 --> 00:06:00.463
except from the very rear of the Coliseum.
