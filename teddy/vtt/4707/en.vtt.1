00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:31.405
She has an older brother who is fourteen,

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:34.598
Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus,

00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:36.487
named after her dad.

00:00:36.487 --> 00:00:39.738
Girls don't get these long names that boys have.

00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:41.856
What is worse is that Dad insists

00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:44.702
on calling all his daughters Domitia.

00:00:44.702 --> 00:00:45.513
"Domitia!"

00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:47.783
His call to Domitia drawing on the column,

00:00:47.783 --> 00:00:49.232
Domitia III.

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:53.119
She has an older sister, Domitia II, who is 7 years old.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.038
And then there's Domitia I, who is ten.

00:00:56.038 --> 00:00:58.154
There would have been a Domitia IV,

00:00:58.154 --> 00:01:01.893
but mom died trying to give birth to her three years ago.
