00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:01.064
but Domitia I, who is betrothed to be married

00:04:01.064 --> 00:04:03.945
in two years to darling Philatus,

00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:05.154
isn't ready.

00:04:05.154 --> 00:04:08.346
She's not slow, she just has more to do.

00:04:08.346 --> 00:04:12.784
Being betrothed means she wears the insignia of betrothal:

00:04:12.784 --> 00:04:14.092
engagement rings

00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:16.926
and all the gifts Pilatus has given her -

00:04:16.926 --> 00:04:17.791
jewels,

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:18.628
earrings,

00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:19.709
necklaces,

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.294
and the pendants.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.659
She may even wear her myrtle crown.

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.041
All this bling shouts,

00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:27.617
"I'm getting married to that 19 year old

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:30.178
who gave me all this stuff I'm wearing!"
