00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I want to talk to you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about one of the biggest myths in medicine,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and that is the idea

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that all we need are more medical breakthroughs

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then all of our problems will be solved.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Our society loves to romanticize

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the idea of the single, solo inventor

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
who, working late in the lab one night,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
makes an earthshaking discovery,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and voila, overnight everything's changed.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That's a very appealing picture,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
however, it's just not true.
