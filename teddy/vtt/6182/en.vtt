00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:03.057
I grew up

00:00:03.057 --> 00:00:07.860
diagnosed as phobically shy,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.514
and, like at least 20 other people

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:12.938
in a room of this size,

00:00:12.938 --> 00:00:14.558
I was a stutterer.

00:00:14.558 --> 00:00:17.218
Do you dare raise your hand?

00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:21.274
And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us,

00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:26.126
because when we are treated that way,

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:29.190
we feel invisible sometimes,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.823
or talked around and at.
