00:06:29.726 --> 00:06:31.921
but they're also building
their growth mindset,

00:06:31.945 --> 00:06:33.742

00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:38.370

To appreciate what we're talking about

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.287
and the tragedy of lost potential here,

00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:58.454
I'd like to give a little bit
of a thought experiment.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:04.051
If we were to go 400 years
into the past to Western Europe,
