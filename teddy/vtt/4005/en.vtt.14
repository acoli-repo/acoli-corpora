00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:04.051
If we were to go 400 years
into the past to Western Europe,

00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:07.239
which even then, was one of the more
literate parts of the planet,

00:07:07.263 --> 00:07:10.990
you would see that about 15 percent
of the population knew how to read.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:15.194
And I suspect that if you asked someone
who did know how to read,

00:07:15.218 --> 00:07:17.114
say a member of the clergy,

00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:20.750
"What percentage of the population
do you think is even capable of reading?"

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:24.335
They might say, "Well,
with a great education system,

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:26.603
maybe 20 or 30 percent."

00:07:27.424 --> 00:07:29.011
But if you fast forward to today,

00:07:29.035 --> 00:07:32.050
we know that that prediction
would have been wildly pessimistic,
