00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:00.783
They're a little edgier than that.

00:01:00.807 --> 00:01:03.238
But then the comments
got a little more intense,

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:07.718
student after student saying
that they had grown up not liking math.

00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:10.941
It was getting difficult as they got
into more advanced math topics.

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:12.493
By the time they got to algebra,

00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:15.845
they had so many gaps in their knowledge
they couldn't engage with it.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.942
They thought they didn't
have the math gene.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.446
But when they were a bit older,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.713
they took a little agency
and decided to engage.

00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:23.589
They found resources like Khan Academy

00:01:23.613 --> 00:01:26.763
and they were able to fill in those gaps
and master those concepts,

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:29.377
and that reinforced their mindset
that it wasn't fixed;

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.966
that they actually were capable
of learning mathematics.
