00:02:58.922 --> 00:03:01.953
And that process continues,
and you immediately start to realize

00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:03.152
how strange this is.

00:03:03.176 --> 00:03:05.947
I didn't know 25 percent
of the more foundational thing,

00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:08.416
and now I'm being pushed
to the more advanced thing.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.152
And this will continue for months, years,
all the way until at some point,

00:03:12.176 --> 00:03:14.616
I might be in an algebra class
or trigonometry class

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.897
and I hit a wall.

00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:18.575
And it's not because algebra
is fundamentally difficult

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.591
or because the student isn't bright.

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:25.926
It's because I'm seeing an equation
and they're dealing with exponents

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.679
and that 30 percent
that I didn't know is showing up.

00:03:28.703 --> 00:03:31.532
And then I start to disengage.
