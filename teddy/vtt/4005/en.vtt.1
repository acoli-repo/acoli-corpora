00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:32.361
and because of that, they thought
they didn't have the math gene.

00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:34.048
Or they'd get to a calculus class,

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:36.834
and they'd be a little bit
shaky on the algebra.

00:00:36.858 --> 00:00:38.428
I saw it in the early days

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:41.980
when I was uploading
some of those videos on YouTube,

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:45.281
and I realized that people
who were not my cousins were watching.

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:47.170
(Laughter)

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:51.060
And at first, those comments
were just simple thank-yous.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.053
I thought that was a pretty big deal.

00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:55.529
I don't know how much time
you all spend on YouTube.

00:00:55.553 --> 00:00:57.640
Most of the comments are not "Thank you."

00:00:57.664 --> 00:00:59.121
(Laughter)

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:00.783
They're a little edgier than that.
