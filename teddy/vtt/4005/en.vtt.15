00:07:29.035 --> 00:07:32.050
we know that that prediction
would have been wildly pessimistic,

00:07:32.074 --> 00:07:36.199
that pretty close to 100 percent
of the population is capable of reading.

00:07:36.223 --> 00:07:38.774
But if I were to ask you
a similar question:

00:07:39.494 --> 00:07:43.033
"What percentage of the population
do you think is capable

00:07:43.057 --> 00:07:45.930
of truly mastering calculus,

00:07:45.954 --> 00:07:48.967
or understanding organic chemistry,

00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:52.277
or being able to contribute
to cancer research?"

00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:55.198
A lot of you might say, "Well,
with a great education system,

00:07:55.222 --> 00:07:57.244
maybe 20, 30 percent."

00:07:57.778 --> 00:07:59.091
But what if that estimate

00:07:59.115 --> 00:08:02.502
is just based on your own experience
in a non-mastery framework,
