00:08:28.536 --> 00:08:31.953
if you were allowed to really
take agency over your learning,

00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:33.573
and when you get something wrong,

00:08:33.597 --> 00:08:36.389
embrace it -- view that failure
as a moment of learning --

00:08:36.413 --> 00:08:40.370
that number, the percent
that could really master calculus

00:08:40.394 --> 00:08:42.154
or understand organic chemistry,

00:08:42.178 --> 00:08:44.680
is actually a lot closer to 100 percent.

00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:48.458
And this isn't even just a "nice to have."

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:51.082
I think it's a social imperative.

00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:55.362
We're exiting what you could call
the industrial age

00:08:55.386 --> 00:08:59.190
and we're going into
this information revolution.

00:08:59.646 --> 00:09:01.820
And it's clear that some
things are happening.
