You should have grit;
you should have perseverance;

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.471
you should take agency over your learning.

00:05:33.908 --> 00:05:36.898
Now, a lot of skeptics might say,
well, hey, this is all great,

00:05:36.922 --> 00:05:39.643
philosophically, this whole idea
of mastery-based learning

00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:41.103
and its connection to mindset,

00:05:41.127 --> 00:05:43.226
students taking agency
over their learning.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.385
It makes a lot of sense,
but it seems impractical.

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:49.806
To actually do it, every student
would be on their own track.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.454
It would have to be personalized,

00:05:51.478 --> 00:05:54.660
you'd have to have private tutors
and worksheets for every student.

00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:56.183
And these aren't new ideas --

00:05:56.207 --> 00:05:59.033
there were experiments
in Winnetka, Illinois, 100 years ago,

00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:01.875
where they did mastery-based learning
and saw great results,
