And if your reaction is the reaction
you typically have in education,

00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:31.474
or that a lot of folks have,

00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:33.604
you might say, maybe
we had a bad contractor,

00:04:33.628 --> 00:04:36.721
or maybe we needed better inspection
or more frequent inspection.

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:38.994
But what was really broken
was the process.

00:04:39.018 --> 00:04:42.047
We were artificially constraining
how long we had to something,

00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:44.444
pretty much ensuring a variable outcome,

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:47.992
and we took the trouble of inspecting
and identifying those gaps,

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:49.949
but then we built right on top of it.

00:04:49.973 --> 00:04:52.910
So the idea of mastery learning
is to do the exact opposite.

00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:55.402
Instead of artificially
constraining, fixing

00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:57.414
when and how long you work on something,

00:04:57.438 --> 00:04:59.656
pretty much ensuring
that variable outcome,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.353
the A, B, C, D, F --
