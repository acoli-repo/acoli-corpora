00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:31.936
That will continue for about
two or three weeks,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.135
and then we get a test.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.477
On that test, maybe I get a 75 percent,

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:37.918
maybe you get a 90 percent,

00:02:37.942 --> 00:02:39.926
maybe you get a 95 percent.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.697
And even though the test identified
gaps in our knowledge,

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:44.680
I didn't know 25 percent of the material.

00:02:44.704 --> 00:02:47.676
Even the A student, what was
the five percent they didn't know?

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.513
Even though we've identified the gaps,

00:02:49.537 --> 00:02:52.075
the whole class will then
move on to the next subject,

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.501
probably a more advanced subject
that's going to build on those gaps.

00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:58.898
It might be logarithms
or negative exponents.

00:02:58.922 --> 00:03:01.953
And that process continues,
and you immediately start to realize
