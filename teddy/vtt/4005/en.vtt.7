00:03:28.703 --> 00:03:31.532

To appreciate how absurd that is,

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.664

in our life that way.

00:03:39.124 --> 00:03:40.578

(Laughter)

00:03:44.878 --> 00:03:48.272

00:03:57.981 --> 00:03:59.950
Maybe some of the supplies don't show up.

00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:03.284

the inspector comes, looks around,
