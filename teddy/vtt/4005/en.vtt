00:00:00.954 --> 00:00:03.880
I'm here today to talk about
the two ideas that,

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.262
at least based on
my observations at Khan Academy,

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:10.164
are kind of the core,
or the key leverage points for learning.

00:00:10.188 --> 00:00:12.204
And it's the idea of mastery

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:14.013
and the idea of mindset.

00:00:14.037 --> 00:00:16.871
I saw this in the early days
working with my cousins.

00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:19.375
A lot of them were having trouble
with math at first,

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:22.453
because they had all of these gaps
accumulated in their learning.

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:25.466
And because of that, at some point
they got to an algebra class

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.892
and they might have been a little bit
shaky on some of the pre-algebra,

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:32.361
and because of that, they thought
they didn't have the math gene.
