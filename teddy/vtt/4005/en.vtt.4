00:01:56.835 --> 00:02:01.320
this is not the way a traditional
academic model is structured,

00:02:01.344 --> 00:02:04.679
the type of academic model
that most of us grew up in.

00:02:04.703 --> 00:02:06.245
In a traditional academic model,

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:08.688
we group students together,
usually by age,

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:09.991
and around middle school,

00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:11.861
by age and perceived ability,

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:14.443
and we shepherd them all
together at the same pace.

00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:16.335
And what typically happens,

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.860
let's say we're in a middle school
pre-algebra class,

00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:20.678
and the current unit is on exponents,

00:02:20.702 --> 00:02:22.892
the teacher will give
a lecture on exponents,

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:25.201
then we'll go home, do some homework.

00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:27.279
The next morning,
we'll review the homework,

00:02:27.303 --> 00:02:29.651
then another lecture, homework,
lecture, homework.

00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:31.936
That will continue for about
two or three weeks,
