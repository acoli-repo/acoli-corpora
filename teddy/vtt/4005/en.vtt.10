00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.353
the A, B, C, D, F --

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.464
do it the other way around.

00:05:03.844 --> 00:05:05.636
What's variable is when and how long

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.754
a student actually has
to work on something,

00:05:07.778 --> 00:05:11.025
and what's fixed is that
they actually master the material.

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:13.096
And it's important to realize

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.485
that not only will this make the student
learn their exponents better,

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.467
but it'll reinforce
the right mindset muscles.

00:05:19.491 --> 00:05:22.919
It makes them realize that if you got
20 percent wrong on something,

00:05:22.943 --> 00:05:26.332
it doesn't mean that you have
a C branded in your DNA somehow.

00:05:26.356 --> 00:05:28.790
It means that you should just
keep working on it.

00:05:28.814 --> 00:05:31.306
You should have grit;
you should have perseverance;
