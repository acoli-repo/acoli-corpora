00:07:59.115 --> 00:08:02.502
is just based on your own experience
in a non-mastery framework,

00:08:02.526 --> 00:08:05.358
your own experience with yourself
or observing your peers,

00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:08.171
where you're being pushed
at this set pace through classes,

00:08:08.195 --> 00:08:09.534
accumulating all these gaps?

00:08:09.558 --> 00:08:11.199
Even when you got that 95 percent,

00:08:11.223 --> 00:08:13.035
what was that five percent you missed?

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:15.786
And it keeps accumulating --
you get to an advanced class,

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.682
all of a sudden you hit a wall and say,

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.709
"I'm not meant to be a cancer researcher;

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:22.661
not meant to be a physicist;
not meant to be a mathematician."

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:24.662
I suspect that that actually is the case,

00:08:24.686 --> 00:08:28.512
but if you were allowed to be operating
in a mastery framework,

00:08:28.536 --> 00:08:31.953
if you were allowed to really
take agency over your learning,
