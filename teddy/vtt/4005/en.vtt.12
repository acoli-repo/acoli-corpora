00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:01.875
where they did mastery-based learning
and saw great results,

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:05.196
but they said it wouldn't scale
because it was logistically difficult.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.127
The teacher had to give different
worksheets to every student,

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:09.439
give on-demand assessments.

00:06:09.463 --> 00:06:11.724
But now today, it's no longer impractical.

00:06:11.748 --> 00:06:13.114
We have the tools to do it.

00:06:13.138 --> 00:06:15.733
Students see an explanation
at their own time and pace?

00:06:15.757 --> 00:06:17.352
There's on-demand video for that.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:19.448
They need practice? They need feedback?

00:06:19.472 --> 00:06:23.912
There's adaptive exercises
readily available for students.

00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:26.905
And when that happens,
all sorts of neat things happen.

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:29.702
One, the students can actually
master the concepts,

00:06:29.726 --> 00:06:31.921
but they're also building
their growth mindset,
