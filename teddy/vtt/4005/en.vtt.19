Even that middle tier,
information processing,

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:32.715
that's what computers are good at.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.486
So as a society, we have a question:

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.628
All this new productivity is happening
because of this technology,

00:09:37.652 --> 00:09:38.982
but who participates in it?

00:09:39.006 --> 00:09:42.201
Is it just going to be that very top
of the pyramid, in which case,

00:09:42.225 --> 00:09:43.566
what does everyone else do?

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.756
How do they operate?

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.200
Or do we do something
that's more aspirational?

00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:50.691
Do we actually attempt
to invert the pyramid,

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.716
where you have a large creative class,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.421
where almost everyone
can participate as an entrepreneur,

00:09:56.445 --> 00:09:58.390
an artist, as a researcher?

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.780
And I don't think that this is utopian.
