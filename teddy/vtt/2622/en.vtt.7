00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:34.372
And what can we gain by the right to marry

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:37.539
if we are not able to cross the acrimony

00:03:37.563 --> 00:03:42.089
and emotional distance
that so often separates us from our love?

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:44.581
And not just in marriage.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.024
I have seen the most hurtful, destructive,

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:56.429
tragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS

00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.849
and breast cancer and non-profit activism,

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:01.437
all in the name of love.
