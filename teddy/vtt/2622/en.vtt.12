but our capacity for compassion
and humanity and serenity and love

00:06:02.806 --> 00:06:04.884
is somehow limited

00:06:04.908 --> 00:06:07.874
is a false and suffocating choice.

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:12.049
Now, I'm not suggesting

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:17.701
simply the uninspiring idea
of more work-life balance.

00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:22.454
What good is it for me to spend
more time with my kids at home

00:06:22.478 --> 00:06:25.263
if my mind is always somewhere else
while I'm doing it?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.565
I'm not even talking about mindfulness.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:32.961
Mindfulness is all of a sudden becoming
a tool for improving productivity.
