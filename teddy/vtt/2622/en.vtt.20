00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.599
(Applause)

00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:06.179
Maybe it's "I want to stay sober"

00:10:06.203 --> 00:10:08.869
or "I want to build
a tree house with my kid."

00:10:09.512 --> 00:10:12.704
You know, instead of going up
to the person everybody wants to meet,

00:10:12.728 --> 00:10:14.485
go up to the person who is all alone

00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:17.196
and ask them if they want
to grab a cup of coffee.

00:10:18.544 --> 00:10:21.020
I think what we fear most

00:10:21.044 --> 00:10:25.400
is that we will be denied the opportunity
to fulfill our true potential,

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:28.035
that we are born to dream

00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:31.671
and we might die
without ever having the chance.
