00:08:29.513 --> 00:08:30.665
Right?

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:33.806
(Laughter)

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.306
Years ago, once upon a time,
I had this beautiful company

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.290
that created these long journeys
for heroic civic engagement.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.694
And we had this mantra:

00:08:44.718 --> 00:08:48.535
"Human. Kind. Be Both."

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:55.075
And we encouraged people to experiment
outrageously with kindness.

00:08:55.599 --> 00:08:58.360
Like, "Go help everybody
set up their tents."

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.971
And there were a lot of tents.
