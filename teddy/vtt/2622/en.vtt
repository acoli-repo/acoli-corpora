00:00:02.014 --> 00:00:03.976
When I think about dreams,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.876
like many of you,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.585
I think about this picture.

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:12.875
I was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.113
step off the Lunar Module
onto the surface of the Moon.

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:20.684
I had never seen anything like it before,

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:22.946
and I've never seen
anything like it since.

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.613
We got to the Moon for one simple reason:

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:31.943
John Kennedy committed us to a deadline.
