Thomas Merton also wrote
about wars among saints

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.668
and that "there is a pervasive form
of contemporary violence

00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:18.041
to which the idealist
most easily succumbs:

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:20.906
activism and overwork.

00:04:21.414 --> 00:04:26.191
The frenzy of our activism
neutralizes our work for peace.

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:30.533
It destroys our own
inner capacity for peace."
