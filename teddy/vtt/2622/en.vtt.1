John Kennedy committed us to a deadline.

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:35.470
And in the absence of that deadline,

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.501
we would still be dreaming about it.

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:43.877
Leonard Bernstein said two things
are necessary for great achievement:

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:47.366
a plan and not quite enough time.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.520
(Laughter)

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:56.345
Deadlines and commitments

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:01.382
are the great and fading
lessons of Apollo.
