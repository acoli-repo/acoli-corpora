In 2016, it is the dimension
of our being itself

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:09.147
that cries out for its fair share
of our imagination.

00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:14.107
Now, we're all here to dream,

00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:15.799
but maybe if we're honest about it,

00:08:15.823 --> 00:08:18.512
each of us chasing our own dream.

00:08:18.536 --> 00:08:22.306
You know, looking at the name tags
to see who can help me with my dream,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.426
sometimes looking right through
one another's humanity.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.156
I can't be bothered with you right now.
I have an idea for saving the world.

00:08:29.513 --> 00:08:30.665
Right?
