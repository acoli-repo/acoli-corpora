Here's a photo of Abraham Lincoln,
and here's one upside down.

00:01:02.168 --> 00:01:03.866
Nothing weird going on here.

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:09.827
Wait, turn that upside down one right side up.
What have they done to Abe?

00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:13.491
Those are just three optical illusions,
images that seem to trick us.

00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:15.175
How do they work?

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.389
Are magical things happening
in the images themselves?

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:20.942
While we could certainly be
sneaking flashes of grey

00:01:20.942 --> 00:01:24.123
into the peripheral white spots
of our animated grid,

00:01:24.123 --> 00:01:26.417
first off, we promise we aren't.

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:30.333
You'll see the same effect with a grid
printed on a plain old piece of paper.
