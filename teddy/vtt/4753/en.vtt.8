00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:01.819
But when we flipped the whole image over,
the most important parts of the face,

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.617
the eyes and mouth, were now upside down,
and you realized something fishy was up.

00:04:06.617 --> 00:04:10.770
You realized your brain had taken
a short cut and missed something.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.938
But your brain wasn't really being lazy,
it's just very busy.

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:18.454
So it spends cognitive energy
as efficiently as possible,

00:04:18.454 --> 00:04:24.595
using assumptions about visual information
to create a tailored, edited vision of the world.

00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:27.641
Imagine your brain
calling out these edits on the fly:

00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:29.732
"Okay, those squares could be objects.

00:04:29.732 --> 00:04:33.724
Let's enhance that black-white contrast
on the sides with lateral inhibition.
