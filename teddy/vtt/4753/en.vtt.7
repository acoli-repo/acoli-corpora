Like the fusiform face area and others
in the occipital and temporal lobes.

with highly complex ways of
interacting with each other.

When we see faces,
we have to recognize they are faces

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:44.475
and figure out what

That's how we figure out if someone
is mad at us or wants to be our friend.

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.085

00:03:56.104 --> 00:03:58.302
so you didn't notice anything was off.

00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:01.819
But when we flipped the whole image over,
the most important parts of the face,
