00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:03.573
And so these shading patterns could only
have been caused by light shining down

00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:07.131
on the sloping sides of a dome,
or the bottom of a hole.

00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:10.547
If we carefully recreate these clues
by drawing shading patterns,

00:03:10.547 --> 00:03:12.652
even on a flat piece of paper,

00:03:12.652 --> 00:03:17.319
our brain reflexively creates
the 3D concave or convex shape.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.195
Now for that creepy Lincoln
upside down face.

00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:23.185
Faces trigger activity
in areas of the brain


00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:27.152
that have specifically evolved
to help us recognize faces.

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:31.944
Like the fusiform face area and others
in the occipital and temporal lobes.
