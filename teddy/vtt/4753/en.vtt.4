Your retinal ganglion cells don't
respond as much at the crossings

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:15.847
because there is more lateral inhibition
for more white spots nearby

00:02:15.847 --> 00:02:20.041
compared to the lines, 
which are surrounded by black.

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:22.307
This isn't just a defect in your eyes;

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:26.503
if you can see, then optical illusions
can trick you with your glasses on
