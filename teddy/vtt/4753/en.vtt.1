But keep looking.
Get weird and stare at it.

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:33.742
Now, keeping your gaze
fixed on this white spot,

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.689
check what's happening
in your peripheral vision.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:43.697
The other spots, are they still white?
Or do they show weird flashes of grey?

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:46.654
Now look at this pan for baking muffins.

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:50.865
Oh, sorry, one of the cups is inverted.
It pops up instead of dipping down.

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:54.994
Wait, no spin the pan.
The other five are domed now?


00:00:54.994 --> 00:00:58.475
Whichever it is, this pan's defective.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:02.168
Here's a photo of Abraham Lincoln,
and here's one upside down.
