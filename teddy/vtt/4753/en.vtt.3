You'll see the same effect with a grid
printed on a plain old piece of paper.

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:35.855
In reality, this grid really is just a grid.
But not to your brain's visual system.

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:40.615
Here's how it interprets the light
information you call this grid.

00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:46.170
The white intersections are surrounded by 
relatively more white on all four sides

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.437
than any white point along a line segment.

00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:54.231
Your retinal ganglion cells notice that
there is more white around the intersections

00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:59.632
because they are organized to
increase contrast with lateral inhibition.

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:03.389
Better contrast means it's easier
to see the edge of something.
