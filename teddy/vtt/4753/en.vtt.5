00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:32.355
What optical illusions show us

00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:37.025
is the way your photo receptors and brain
assemble visual information

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:39.895
into the three-dimensional world
you see around you,

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:42.169
where edges should get extra attention

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.789
because things with edges
can help you or kill you.

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:49.316
Look at that muffin pan again.
You know what causes confusion here?

00:02:49.316 --> 00:02:54.812
Your brain's visual cortex operates on
assumptions about the lighting of this image.

00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:59.222
It expects light to come from
a single source, shining down from above.

00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:03.573
And so these shading patterns could only
have been caused by light shining down
