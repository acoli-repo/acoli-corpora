Check this out:

00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:14.769
Here's a grid, nothing special,
just a basic grid, very grid-y.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.546
But look closer, 
into this white spot at the center

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:22.824
where the two central vertical
and horizontal lines intersect.

00:00:22.824 --> 00:00:26.545
Look very closely.
Notice anything funny about this spot?

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:27.915
Yeah, nothing.

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:30.686
But keep looking.
Get weird and stare at it.
