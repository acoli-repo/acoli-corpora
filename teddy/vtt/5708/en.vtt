People say that a long, long time ago,

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:05.537
everybody on earth spoke the same language

00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:07.480
and belonged to the same tribe.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.950
And I guess people had
a little too much time on their hands,

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:13.516
because they decided
they were going to work together

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.823
to become as great as God.

00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:18.573
So they started to build a tower
up into the heavens.

00:00:19.293 --> 00:00:21.195
God saw this and was angry,

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.356
and to punish the people
for their arrogance,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.782
God destroyed the tower

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:27.529
and scattered the people
to the ends of the earth

00:00:27.553 --> 00:00:29.709
and made them all
speak different languages.
