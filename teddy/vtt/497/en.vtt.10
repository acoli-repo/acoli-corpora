00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:01.689
I said, "You're right."

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:04.387
But the next day, I called him again,

00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:07.553
and I said, "Mario, really,
I really want to buy this place."

00:05:07.577 --> 00:05:09.276
He said, "Hamdi, you have no money.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.323
(Laughter)

00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:12.260
You haven't even paid me in six months."

00:05:12.284 --> 00:05:13.291
(Laughter)

00:05:13.315 --> 00:05:14.474
Which was true.

00:05:14.498 --> 00:05:15.648
(Laughter)

00:05:16.268 --> 00:05:18.334
But I got a loan, another loan.

00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:23.115
By August 2005,
I had the keys for this factory.

00:05:24.093 --> 00:05:27.730
The first thing I did was to hire four
of the original 55 people.

00:05:28.215 --> 00:05:30.350
I had Maria, the office manager.
