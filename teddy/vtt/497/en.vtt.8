00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:03.061
I was so angry

00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:06.355
that the CEO was far away,

00:04:08.522 --> 00:04:10.816
in a tower or somewhere,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.045
looking at the spreadsheets

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.579
and closing the factory.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.528
Spreadsheets are lazy.

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:22.517
They don't tell you about people,
they don't tell you about communities.

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.152
But unfortunately,

00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:27.564
this is how too many
business decisions are made today.
