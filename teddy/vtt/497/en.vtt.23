00:11:28.985 --> 00:11:31.319
Idaho was on nobody's radar screen.

00:11:31.784 --> 00:11:35.566
It was too rural, too far away,
didn't have much incentives.

00:11:35.974 --> 00:11:37.124
So I went there.

00:11:38.014 --> 00:11:41.439
I met with the local people,
I met with the farmers.

00:11:41.463 --> 00:11:43.724
We shook hands, we broke bread.

00:11:43.748 --> 00:11:46.448
I said, "I want to build it right here."

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:48.513
I don't need to see financial studies.

00:11:49.732 --> 00:11:51.061
And the result --

00:11:53.236 --> 00:11:55.180
its community is thriving.

00:11:55.204 --> 00:11:57.260
There's new schools that open every year.

00:11:58.101 --> 00:12:00.910
New food companies
are coming up every year.
