00:00:56.576 --> 00:01:00.778
But the hills and the roads
and the smells are all familiar.

00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:06.247
I grew up in Turkey,
in a similar environment,

00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:07.704
near the Kurdish mountains.

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:10.561
My family made cheese and yogurt;

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:12.604
I grew up listening to shepherd's stories.

00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:15.720
We didn't have much,

00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:19.680
but we had the moon and the stars,
simple food, each other.

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:23.101
Eventually, I came to America.

00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:25.844
I didn't even know New York had farms.

00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:29.874
I made it to upstate, and I never left.
