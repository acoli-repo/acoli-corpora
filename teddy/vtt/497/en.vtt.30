00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:03.610
In the end, this is all
in our responsibility.

00:15:03.956 --> 00:15:05.265
The new way of business --

00:15:05.289 --> 00:15:08.376
it's the consumer we report to,
not to the corporate boards.

00:15:09.019 --> 00:15:10.298
You see,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.329
if you are right with your people,

00:15:15.276 --> 00:15:17.959
if you are right with your community,

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:20.610
if you are right with your product,

00:15:20.634 --> 00:15:22.943
you will be more profitable,

00:15:22.967 --> 00:15:24.999
you will be more innovative,

00:15:25.023 --> 00:15:27.531
you will have more passionate
people working for you

00:15:27.555 --> 00:15:29.537
and a community that supports you.

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:32.643
And that's what the anti-CEO
playbook is all about.
