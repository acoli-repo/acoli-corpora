WEBVTT

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:01.221
and then 1,000 more after that."

00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:04.014
But if I told them,
"You see that town over there?

00:07:04.038 --> 00:07:07.657
Every person we hire,
10 more local jobs will be created.

00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:11.196
The town will come back to life,
the trucks will be all over the roads.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.752
And the first money we make,

00:07:12.776 --> 00:07:16.439
we're going to build one of the best
Little League baseball fields

00:07:16.463 --> 00:07:17.663
for our children.

00:07:18.323 --> 00:07:20.058
And five years after that,

00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:23.393
we're going to be the number one
Greek yogurt brand in the country."

00:07:24.096 --> 00:07:25.460
Would they have believed me?

00:07:26.556 --> 00:07:27.706
Of course not.

00:07:29.104 --> 00:07:31.109
But that's exactly what happened.
