A cold January day of 2005,

00:00:06.063 --> 00:00:09.853
I took one of my most important
drives of my life.

00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:14.880
I was on this road in upstate New York,

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:18.163
trying to find this old factory.

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.941
The day before,
I received a flyer in the mail

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:26.325
that said, "Fully equipped
yogurt plant for sale."

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:28.897
I threw it in the garbage can.
