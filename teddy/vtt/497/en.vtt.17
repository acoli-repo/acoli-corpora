00:08:28.913 --> 00:08:32.150
you see, I'm not a businessman,
I don't come from that tradition --

00:08:32.174 --> 00:08:35.754
I just kept wondering:
What is this all about?

00:08:37.287 --> 00:08:40.198
Corporate America says it's about profits.

00:08:40.222 --> 00:08:42.580
Mainstream business says it's about money.

00:08:42.604 --> 00:08:45.490
The CEO playbook says
it's about shareholders.

00:08:45.514 --> 00:08:50.236
And so much is sacrificed for it --
it's factories, communities, jobs.

00:08:51.093 --> 00:08:52.680
But not by CEOs.

00:08:53.956 --> 00:08:56.358
CEOs have their employees suffer for them.

00:08:57.011 --> 00:09:00.552
But yet, the CEOs's pay
goes up and up and up.
