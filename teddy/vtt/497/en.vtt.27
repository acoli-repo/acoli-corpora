00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:30.196
in one of America's rural areas,

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.535
30 percent of the Chobani workforce
are immigrants and refugees.

And it changed us for better.

00:13:43.188 --> 00:13:45.164
The new way of business --

00:13:45.188 --> 00:13:49.522
it's business, not government,
in the best position to make a change

00:13:49.546 --> 00:13:50.712
in today's world:

00:13:50.736 --> 00:13:53.990
in gun violence, in climate change,

00:13:54.014 --> 00:13:57.717
in income inequality,
in refugees, in race.

00:13:57.741 --> 00:13:59.902
It's business that must take a side.
