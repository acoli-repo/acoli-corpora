00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:12.621
Waddling along the parched
Australian earth,

00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:15.996
this female platypus is searching
for fresh water.

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:20.996
Over the past year, a severe drought 
turned rivers and streams

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:22.329
to mere trickles.

00:00:22.413 --> 00:00:26.163
She barely survived 
and was unable to reproduce.

00:00:26.413 --> 00:00:29.121
Could the next year bring
a change in luck?
