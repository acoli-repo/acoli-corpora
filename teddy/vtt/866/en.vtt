Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Shortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
with the family. The conversation turned to global warming,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and everybody agreed, there's a real problem.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We've got a climate crisis.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, we went around the table to talk about what we should do.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary.
