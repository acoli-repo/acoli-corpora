00:00:00.676 --> 00:00:04.076
When I was a kid,
I lived in a pretty analog world.

00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:06.236
But then, that all started
to quickly change.

00:00:06.236 --> 00:00:09.356
My music, my communications,
my social networks --

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:11.836
everything started to become digital.

00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:15.156
And the force behind it all
was this thing that seemed,

00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:17.436
at least to me
at the time, almost magical.

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:19.836
This thing called "software."

00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:21.476
But then, over time,

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:24.116
I realized that software
isn't magic, it's just logic.

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:28.756
It's code that tells the computer
what to do and how to do it.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:32.796
And that early realization
really still sits at the core
