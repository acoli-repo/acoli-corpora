00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
By the end of this year,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that actively use social networking sites.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The one thing that all of them have in common

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is that they're going to die.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I think it has some really profound implications

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that are worth exploring.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What first got me thinking about this

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
who was a science and technology journalist

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
who died of cancer.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post
