00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I'm going to try to do is explain to you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
quickly how to predict,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and illustrate it with some predictions

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In order to predict effectively,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we need to use science.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And the reason that we need to use science

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is because then we can reproduce what we're doing;

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
it's not just wisdom or guesswork.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And if we can predict,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
then we can engineer the future.
