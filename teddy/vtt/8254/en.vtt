00:00:01.706 --> 00:00:04.083
Creating intelligence on a computer.

00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:07.462
This has been the Holy Grail
for artificial intelligence

00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:08.880
for quite some time.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:11.132
But how do we get there?

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:15.303
So we view ourselves as highly
intelligent beings.

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:18.139
So it's logical to study our own brains,

00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:22.393
the substrate of our cognition,
for creating artificial intelligence.

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:27.774
Imagine if we could replicate
how our own brains work on a computer.

00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:31.611
But now consider the journey
that would be required.
