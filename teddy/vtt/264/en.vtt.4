rationally and without reservations,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.508
a penalty of death?"

00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:08.716
My answer was an astounding "yes,"

00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:12.279
and I was selected as Juror Number 2.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.936
The trial started.

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:18.883
From the evidence being presented

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.926
and from the pictures of the victim,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.909
my first response was,
"Yes, this man is a monster,

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:30.388
and he deserves the death penalty."
