00:13:57.812 --> 00:14:00.483
So I turned around
and I looked at her, and I said,

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:02.202
"Are you gonna wear this?"

00:14:02.726 --> 00:14:06.126
So she turned and she looked
at her dad, and she said,

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.436
"Dad, I know how you feel,

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.473
but I don't believe in the death penalty."

00:14:12.337 --> 00:14:15.448
My son looked at me,

00:14:15.472 --> 00:14:18.096
shook his head, and said,

00:14:19.719 --> 00:14:21.371
"Thanks, Mom."

00:14:22.124 --> 00:14:25.485
And I knew it wasn't a nice "Thanks, Mom."

00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:26.659
(Laughter)

00:14:27.964 --> 00:14:32.492
So I learned that life
had taught me some lessons.
