00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:30.829
in my mind,

00:06:30.853 --> 00:06:33.215
Bobby was going to be manic.

00:06:33.975 --> 00:06:38.331
But, surprisingly, he was very calm.

00:06:38.967 --> 00:06:44.139
And for two hours, he and I sat there
and talked about life,

00:06:44.753 --> 00:06:51.195
and I got to ask him to forgive me
for my hand in his death.

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:54.080
His words to me were:

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.972
"You don't have to apologize.

00:06:56.996 --> 00:06:58.926
You didn't put me here.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.215
I did this myself.
