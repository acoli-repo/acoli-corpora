00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.522
It was a Thursday,

00:00:03.546 --> 00:00:07.414
June the 23rd, 1994.

00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:12.245
(Sighs)

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.117
"Collect your belongings.
You are free to go.

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:20.909
When escorted outside,
go directly to your car.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.717
Do not talk to reporters."

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.527
My head is spinning,

00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:28.030
my heart is racing,

00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:29.700
I can't get a breath.
