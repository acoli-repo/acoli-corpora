00:04:28.608 --> 00:04:30.008
And there it was:

00:04:30.754 --> 00:04:34.948
our broken judicial system at work.

00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:40.386
So here I am in my car,

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.017
and I'm wondering:

00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:46.147
How is my life ever going to be the same?

00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:52.497
My life was kids, work,
church, ball games --

00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:55.967
just your average, normal, everyday life.

00:04:56.998 --> 00:04:59.442
Now everything felt trivial.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.723
I was going down this rabbit hole.
