it was apparent that he was deeply
saddened by what we were required to do.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:07.890
He relived the day
that he left the courthouse

00:11:07.914 --> 00:11:09.744
and he drove home

00:11:09.768 --> 00:11:12.854
and he went to put his key
in his door and unlock it,

00:11:12.878 --> 00:11:16.268
and he said he literally broke down.

00:11:18.237 --> 00:11:21.389
He said he knew that Bobby was guilty,

00:11:21.413 --> 00:11:23.508
but the decision he made,

00:11:23.532 --> 00:11:27.445
he did not know
if it was the right decision.

00:11:28.098 --> 00:11:31.320
And he said that he played it
over and over in his head.
