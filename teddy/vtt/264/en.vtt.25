Now, through this storm in my life,
I did find some inspiration,

00:12:34.612 --> 00:12:37.268
and it came in the form
of my granddaughters.

00:12:38.669 --> 00:12:41.029
My 14-year-old granddaughter, Maddie,

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.147
was writing an essay
on the death penalty for school,

00:12:45.171 --> 00:12:47.194
and she was asking me questions.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.196
Well, it dawned on me
that this child was being raised

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.247
in the same eye-for-an-eye culture

00:12:56.003 --> 00:12:57.568
as I was,

00:12:57.592 --> 00:12:59.070
or had been.
