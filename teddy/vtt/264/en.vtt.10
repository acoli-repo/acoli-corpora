00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.723
I was going down this rabbit hole.

00:05:02.978 --> 00:05:06.350
The anger, the anxiety,

00:05:06.374 --> 00:05:09.208
the guilt, the depression ...

00:05:09.232 --> 00:05:10.867
it just clung to me.

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:15.737
I knew that my life had to resume,

00:05:17.038 --> 00:05:18.680
so I sought counseling.

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:22.539
The counselor diagnosed me with PTSD

00:05:23.217 --> 00:05:27.825
and told me that the best way
to overcome the PTSD

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:30.370
was to talk about the trauma.
