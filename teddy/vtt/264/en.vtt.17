00:08:30.587 --> 00:08:32.525
and I actually found most of them.

00:08:33.117 --> 00:08:34.874
The first juror I met

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.757
thought that Bobby got what he deserved.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.030
Another juror --

00:08:41.339 --> 00:08:45.052
well, they just kind of regretted
that it took so long

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:46.773
to carry the sentence out.

00:08:47.371 --> 00:08:50.115
Then one juror, and I don't know
what was wrong with him,

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:52.502
but he didn't remember
anything about the trial.

00:08:52.526 --> 00:08:54.425
(Laughter)

00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:55.671
Well,

00:08:56.902 --> 00:08:58.602
I'm thinking in my mind,

00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:02.743
"Jeez, is this the response
I'm gonna get from everybody else?"
