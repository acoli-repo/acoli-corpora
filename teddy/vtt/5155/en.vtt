Hello, I'm Chris Anderson.
Welcome to The TED Interview.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.825
We're gearing up for season four
with some extraordinary guests,

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.319
but I don't want to wait for that
for today's episode,

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:17.263
because we're in the middle of a pandemic,

00:00:17.287 --> 00:00:20.642
and there's a guest
I really wanted to talk to now.

00:00:21.514 --> 00:00:23.593
He is Adam Kucharski,

00:00:23.617 --> 00:00:26.053
an infectious diseases scientist

00:00:26.077 --> 00:00:29.466
who focuses on the mathematical
modeling of pandemics.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.316
He's an associate professor
