00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Today I'd like to show you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the future of the way we make things.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I believe that soon our buildings and machines

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
will be self-assembling,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
replicating and repairing themselves.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So I'm going to show you

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
what I believe is the current state of manufacturing,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then compare that to some natural systems.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
two and a half years [of assembly time],

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
500,000 to a million parts,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
fairly complex,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We have exciting machines
