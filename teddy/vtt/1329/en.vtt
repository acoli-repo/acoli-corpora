Why do so many people reach success and then fail?

00:00:04.997 --> 00:00:08.997
One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.

00:00:08.997 --> 00:00:10.997
So we do everything that leads up to success,

00:00:10.997 --> 00:00:12.997
but then we get there. We figure we've made it,

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:14.997
we sit back in our comfort zone,

00:00:14.997 --> 00:00:17.997
and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.997
And it doesn't take long to go downhill.

00:00:19.997 --> 00:00:21.997
And I can tell you this happens,

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:24.997
because it happened to me.

00:00:24.997 --> 00:00:27.997
Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.

00:00:27.997 --> 00:00:30.997
But then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it.
