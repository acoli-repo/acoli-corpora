Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because of their tall stature, their complex structure,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I used to climb trees for fun all the time

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding trees

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and forests, through the medium of science.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And Dr. Terry Erwin, in 1983,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
called the canopy, "the last biotic frontier."
