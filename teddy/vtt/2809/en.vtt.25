00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.296
who wasn't going to live
for another baseball season

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.880
to Game 5 of the World Series.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.176
That's why we have a talent show
put on by the staff and kids

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.816
for family and friends.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.896
Who wouldn't be enchanted by a young boy
playing a piano piece with his feet,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.440
because his arms are atrophied?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.040
That's why we have a prom every year.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.200
It's pretty magical.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.656
We started the prom

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.296
after hearing a dad lament

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.800
that he would never pin
a boutonniere on his son's tuxedo lapel.
