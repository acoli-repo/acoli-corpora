00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.120
impossible.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.576
But what I've learned is this:

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.616
children don't stop dying

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.616
just because we the adults

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.320
can't comprehend
the injustice of losing them.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.280
And what's more,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.296
if we can be brave enough

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.176
to face the possibility of death,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.120
even among the most innocent,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.800
we gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.840
Take Crystal, for example.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.936
She was one of the first children
to come for care

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.360
after we opened our doors.
