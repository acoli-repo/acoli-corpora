00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.176
They moved into
one of our family apartments

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.616
and treasured each day that they had,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.120
which were far too few.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.856
Lars's life was brief, to be sure,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.496
mere weeks,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.056
but it was calm and comfortable.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.280
He went on hikes with his parents.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.896
The time that he spent in the pool
with our aquatic therapist

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.096
lessened the seizures he was experiencing

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.800
and helped him to sleep at night.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.376
His family had a peaceful place

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.776
in which to both celebrate his life

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.240
and mourn his death.
