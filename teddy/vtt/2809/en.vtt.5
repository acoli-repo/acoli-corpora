many of whom are there for respite stays,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.576
some with repeated visits
over a span of many years.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.160
We call those kids our frequent flyers.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.776
Rather than the bright,
noisy quarters of the hospital,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.616
their rooms are calm and comfortable,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.896
with actual living spaces
for the families,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.696
a sanctuary of gardens

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.216
and a wonderful outdoor playground

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.760
with special structures
for children with physical limitations.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.376
This sweet baby Lars

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.360
came to us directly
from a hospital intensive care unit.
