00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.096
There are only two freestanding
pediatric hospices in the United States,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.816
although I'm happy to report
that based on our model,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.896
there are 18 others
under various stages of development.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.080
(Applause)

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.456
Still, most of the children
who die in the United States every year

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.496
die in hospital rooms,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.936
surrounded by beeping machines

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.056
and anxious, exhausted adults

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.056
who have no other option

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.896
but to say goodbye
under those harsh, institutional lights

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.960
and among virtual strangers.
