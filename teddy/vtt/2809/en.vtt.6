00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.360
came to us directly
from a hospital intensive care unit.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.576
Imagine hearing the heartbreaking news

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.760
that none of us would ever want to hear.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.096
His parents had been told
that Lars had a brain anomaly

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.936
that would keep him from ever swallowing,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.856
walking, talking

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.560

his parents chose
to focus on the quality of time

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.040
that they could spend together.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.176
They moved into
one of our family apartments
