She was nine when she arrived,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.296
and her neurologist expected
that she might live another two weeks.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.816
She had an inoperable brain tumor,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.576
and her decline had really accelerated

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.520
in the week before she came to us.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.216
After settling into her room,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.976
dressed entirely in pink and lavender,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.096

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.856
she spent the next several days

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.440
winning over the hearts
of every staff member.
