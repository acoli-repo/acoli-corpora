00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.240
and mourn his death.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.256
It has been five years
since Lars was with us,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.176
and in that time,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.536
his family has welcomed

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.720
a daughter and another son.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.216
They are such a powerful testament

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.399
to the positive outcome that specialized
children's hospice care can create.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.296
Their baby's physical discomfort
was well managed,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.080
giving all of them the gift of time
to be together in a beautiful place.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.296
I'm going to talk to you now
