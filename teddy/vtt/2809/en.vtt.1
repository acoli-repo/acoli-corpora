John is an out-of-the-box thinker,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.616
which explains why the two of us
have been such good friends

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.840
all of our lives.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.336
Over the years, I've convinced him
to shuttle those sweet furry beasts

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.320
up to hang out with our sick kids
from time to time.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.856
Talking to John, I was surprised to learn

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.080
that camels have an average
life expectancy of 40 to 50 years.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.096
The life expectancy of many
of the children with whom I work

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.440
is less than a year.
