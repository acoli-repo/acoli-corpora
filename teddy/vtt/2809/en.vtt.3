00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.136
As I sat with families whose children
were at the end of their lives,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.816
I was acutely aware of our surroundings.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.856
While the elevated train
rumbled overhead on its track,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.640
quite literally the room reverberated
with each passing train car.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.856
The lights on the ward
were fluorescent and too bright.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.096
Monitors beeped, as did the elevator,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.120
noisily announcing its arrival.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.856
These families were experiencing

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.496
some of the most excruciating
moments of their lives,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.096
and I so wanted them
to have a more peaceful place
