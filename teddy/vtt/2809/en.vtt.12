Bit by bit, her condition stabilized,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.376
and then to our astonishment,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.040
she actually improved.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.816
There were a variety of factors

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.416
that contributed to Crystal's improvement

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.000
which we later came to call
the "George Mark bump,"

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.976
a lovely, not uncommon phenomenon

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.896
where children outlive
the prognoses of their illnesses

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.600
if they're outside of the hospital.
