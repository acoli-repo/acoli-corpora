My best guess is that Americans,
with our positive can-do attitude

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.616
hold the expectation
that our medical care system will fix it,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.120
even though it may be a childhood illness
for which there is no cure.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.856
We go to extraordinary measures
to keep children alive

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.256
when in fact the greatest kindness
that we might give them

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.016
would be a peaceful, pain-free

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.240
end of life.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.216
The transition from cure to care

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.456
remains a challenging one
for many hospital physicians
