expanding territories,

00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:39.298
but not so good at 
what we call zhì guó ān bāng,

00:03:39.322 --> 00:03:41.727
converting individual best practices

00:03:41.751 --> 00:03:44.457

The nature of Gāo's approach,

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:51.491
such as having tolerance
for frontline managers

00:03:51.515 --> 00:03:53.102

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:56.804
or having some new ideas
not coming from the top,

00:03:56.828 --> 00:03:59.724
is not common in China.
