The catch was, they had to do it

Keep in mind that these people
had no formal training

00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:09.942
or related experience in this field.

00:02:10.307 --> 00:02:13.379
What they did have, though,
was natural strengths

00:02:13.403 --> 00:02:15.347
and a growth mindset.

00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:19.609
When Gāo first told me the idea, I said,

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:20.878
"Are you sure?

00:02:20.902 --> 00:02:23.823
I have seldom seen companies
as large as yours

00:02:23.847 --> 00:02:26.314
having part-time senior executives."

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.315
But Gāo smiled.

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.073
"This is my dumpling way."
