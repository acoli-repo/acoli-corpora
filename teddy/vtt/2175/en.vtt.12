"I will just focus on my job
and not cross any lines,"

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:03.687
which is totally the opposite
to Qu's thinking.

00:06:04.487 --> 00:06:09.160
So Qu created a unique initiative
called "Signature Program."

00:06:10.098 --> 00:06:11.368
In the program,

00:06:11.392 --> 00:06:14.530
each employee chooses an avatar character

00:06:14.554 --> 00:06:18.066
that pops up alongside
digital communication channels.

00:06:18.395 --> 00:06:22.474
Some common ideas include
Captain Hook, Harry Potter

00:06:22.498 --> 00:06:26.098
and many well-known characters
in Chinese literature.

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:31.541
The way these characters interact
proved to be the answer to Qu's problem.
