00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:30.482
hiring venture managers,

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:34.260
providing training on how to integrate
online-offline sales,

00:01:34.284 --> 00:01:38.299
or having some high potentials
fully dedicated to the new job,

00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:40.672
such as a Chief Digital Officer.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.653
But Gāo did something totally different.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.886
He invented a two-hat model.

00:01:48.514 --> 00:01:51.005
Instead of recruiting new executives,

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:54.259
he invited five successful regional heads

00:01:54.283 --> 00:01:57.199
to take on a second role at headquarters.

00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:02.936
The catch was, they had to do it
while still being the frontline managers.
