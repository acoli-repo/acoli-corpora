00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.656
I love learning foreign languages.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.736
In fact, I love it so much that I like
to learn a new language every two years,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.856
currently working on my eighth one.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.496
When people find that out about me,
they always ask me,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.616
"How do you do that? What's your secret?"

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.656
And to be honest, for many years,
my answer would be,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.000
"I don't know. I simply
love learning languages."

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.976
But people were never
happy with that answer.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.976
They wanted to know why they are spending
years trying to learn even one language,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.536
never achieving fluency,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.616
and here I come, learning
one language after another.
