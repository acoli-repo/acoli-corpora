00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.576
It's six o'clock in the morning,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.920
pitch black outside.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.856
My 14-year-old son
is fast asleep in his bed,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.960
sleeping the reckless,
deep sleep of a teenager.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.976
I flip on the light and physically
shake the poor boy awake,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.616
because I know that,
like ripping off a Band-Aid,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.576
it's better to get it over with quickly.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.256
(Laughter)

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.016
I have a friend who yells "Fire!"
just to rouse her sleeping teen.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.016
And another who got so fed up

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.896
that she had to dump cold water
on her son's head
