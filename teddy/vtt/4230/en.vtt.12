00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
so it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and you can see some of the features on it,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
like the Grand Canyon on Mars,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth, except a hell of a lot larger.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So it's about the size, you know, of the United States.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And if you look at the height of it

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you
