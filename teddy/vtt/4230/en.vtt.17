00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Now, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
down a slope like this.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But we really made sure we tested those Rovers

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
before we got them down -- or that Rover --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and made sure that it's all working well.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Now, when I came last time, shortly after the landing --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I told you I was surprised that those Rovers

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
are lasting even a hundred days.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Well, here we are four years later, and they're still working.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Now you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered,
