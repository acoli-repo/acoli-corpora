00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And what these layers -- that's what the surface used to be

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
a million years ago, 10 million years ago,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
100 million years ago, and you get deposits on top of them.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So if you can read the layers it's like reading your book,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and you can learn the history of what happened in the past

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
in that location.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
of that crater, and the Rover is going down now, measuring, you know,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
the properties and analyzing the rocks

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
as it's going down, you know, that canyon.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Now, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
down a slope like this.
