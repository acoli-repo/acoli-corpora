00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
an idea of how large that Mount Olympus, you know, is,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
relative to Mount Everest.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
which have happened on that planet.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Recently from one of our satellites, this shows that it's Earth-like --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So it is a dynamic planet,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and activity is going on as we speak today.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And these Rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today,
