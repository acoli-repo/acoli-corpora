00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and that's literally why they have lasted so long.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And now we designed them reasonably well,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
but that's exactly why they are lasting that long

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and still providing all the science data.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Now, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
You know, one of them, one of the wheels is stuck, is not working,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
one of the front wheels, so what we are doing,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
we are driving it backwards.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint, you know,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
it's not working very well, so it's walking like this,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and we can move the arm, you know, that way.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
But still they are producing a lot of scientific data.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Now, during that whole period, a number of people got excited,
