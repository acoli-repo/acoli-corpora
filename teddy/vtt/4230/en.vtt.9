00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Somehow, 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang, and you've heard

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
a little bit about, you know, the origin of the universe.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But somehow what strikes everybody's imagination --

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
or lots of people's imagination -- somehow from that original Big Bang

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
we have this beautiful world that we live in today.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You look outside: you have all that beauty that you see,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
all that life that you see around you,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and here we have intelligent people like you and I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
who are having a conversation here.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
All that started from that Big Bang. So, the question is:

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
How did that happen? How did that evolve? How did the universe form?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
How did the galaxies form? How did the planets form?
