90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
would start accumulating on the surface, and after a while

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
we wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Well, I always say it's important that you are smart,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but every once in a while it's good to be lucky.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
there are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
It is like a brand new car that you have,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and that's literally why they have lasted so long.
