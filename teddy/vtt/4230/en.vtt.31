00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
LC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
how far Phoenix really is from the ground.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
BC: We've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
So, we're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
But that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
EB: Now the spacecraft actually has to decide

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
when it's going to get rid of its parachute.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
BC: We separate from the lander going 125 miles an hour

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars: 3,200 feet.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
That's like taking two Empire State Buildings
