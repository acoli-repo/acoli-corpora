00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
called Phoenix, and that spacecraft will land

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
17 days, seven hours and 20 seconds from now,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
so you can adjust your watch.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
on the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
in 17 days, I'll show you, kind of,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
a little bit of what's going to happen.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Video: That's what we call the seven minutes of terror.
