And these Rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
This is one very large crater. Geologists love craters,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
without really working at it,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and you can see what's below the surface.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So, this is called Victoria Crater,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
which is about a few football fields in size.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
If I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and we actually saw the Rover on the surface.
