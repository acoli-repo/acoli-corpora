00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
How did the galaxies form? How did the planets form?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Is that very common?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So we literally are all made out of stardust.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
We started from those stars; we are made of stardust.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So, next time you are really depressed, look in the mirror

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and you can look and say, hi, I'm looking at a star here.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
You can skip the dust part.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But literally, we are all made of stardust.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So, what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
write the book of how things have came about as they are today.
