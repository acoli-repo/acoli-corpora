00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and we actually saw the Rover on the surface.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And we actually used the combination of the satellite images

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and the Rover to actually conduct science,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
because we can observe large areas

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and then you can get those Rovers to move around

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and basically go to a certain location.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So, specifically what we are doing now is

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that Rover is going down in that crater.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
As I told you, geologists love craters.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And the reason is, many of you went to the Grand Canyon,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And what these layers -- that's what the surface used to be
