00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And that's my recommendation to all of you:

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
look what everybody is doing, what they are doing;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
go do something completely different.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
because that doesn't get you very far.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but we also used to have a lot of parties, you know.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
As you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But then a big difference happened about 50 years ago,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and that's the one you see on the left in there.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And here we made 180 degrees change:

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house.
