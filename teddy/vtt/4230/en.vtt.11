00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
write the book of how things have came about as they are today.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And one of the first, or the easiest, places we can go

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and explore that is to go towards Mars.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And the reason Mars takes particular attention:

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
it's not very far from us.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
You know, it'll take us only six months to get there.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Six to nine months at the right time of the year.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
but the land mass on Mars is about the same

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
as the land mass on Earth, you know,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
if you don't take the oceans into account.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
so it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent,
