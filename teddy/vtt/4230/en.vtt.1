As I said, they were adventurous people.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
As a matter of fact, one of them, who was, kind of, part of a cult

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which was not too far from here on Orange Grove,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So, that gives you a kind of flavor

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
of the kind of people we have there.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We try to avoid blowing ourselves up.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This one I thought I'd show you.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I tried to come like him this morning,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but as I walked out, then it was too cold,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and I said, I'd better put my shirt back on.
