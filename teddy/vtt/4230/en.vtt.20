00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
But still they are producing a lot of scientific data.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Now, during that whole period, a number of people got excited,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
you know, outside the science community about these Rovers,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
about how these Rovers are being viewed by people

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
other than the science community.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So let me go on the next short video.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
By the way, this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place, you know,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
about four years ago.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Video: Okay, we have parachute aligned.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Okay, deploy the airbags. Open.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Camera. We have a picture right now.
