00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
EB: If you fire the 'chute too early, the parachute itself could fail.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And that would be bad.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
BC: In the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
we'll decelerate from 900 miles an hour

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
to a relatively slow 250 miles an hour.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
We no longer need the heat shield to protect us

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
from the force of atmospheric entry, so we jettison the heat shield,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
LC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed,
