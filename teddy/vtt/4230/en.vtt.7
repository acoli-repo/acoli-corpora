It branches on more the experimental side.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
There's the improvisational side of jazz.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
There's the heavy-hitting sound of rock.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Being able to treat sound as an instrument, and be able to dig

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
for more abstract sounds and things to play live,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
mixing electronics and acoustics.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The music's half of me, but the other half --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I landed probably the best gig of all.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Some of the most brilliant engineers I know

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them.
