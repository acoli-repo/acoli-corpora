00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And that was done over a period of a couple of years,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and now we are the leading organization, you know,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
exploring space on all of your behalf.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
sometimes there are setbacks.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward;

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
somehow it ended going sideways.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So that's what we call the misguided missile.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But then also, just to celebrate that,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
we started an event at JPL for "Miss Guided Missile."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So, we used to have a celebration every year and select --
