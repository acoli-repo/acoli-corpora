00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and I said, I'd better put my shirt back on.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But more importantly, the reason I wanted to show this picture:

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
look where the other people are looking,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and look where he is looking.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and it says, "Do not go where the path may lead.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Go instead where there is no path, and leave a trail."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And that's my recommendation to all of you:

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
look what everybody is doing, what they are doing;
