00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So, we used to have a celebration every year and select --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
there used to be competition and parades and so on.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it;

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So, we do something a little bit more serious.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
when we entered one of the floats.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
That's more on the play side. And on the right side,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that's the Rover just before we finished its testing

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
to take it to the Cape to launch it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things,
