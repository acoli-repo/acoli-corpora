00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.111
This is Charley Williams.

00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:05.387
He was 94 when this photograph was taken.

00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:08.444
In the 1930s, Roosevelt put

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:10.424
thousands and thousands of Americans back to work

00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:12.950
by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.365
but he also did something interesting,

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:16.677
which was to hire a few hundred writers

00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:20.638
to scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans.

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:22.799
Charley Williams, a poor sharecropper,

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:25.461
wouldn't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview,

00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:27.889
but Charley had actually been a slave

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:30.447
until he was 22 years old.
