00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:01.727
that because giraffes spent their lives

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:05.114
stretching to reach leaves
on higher branches,

00:01:05.138 --> 00:01:07.887
their children would be
born with longer necks.

00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:11.527
But we know now that's not
how genetic inheritance works.

00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:15.912
In fact, individual organisms
don't evolve at all.

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:18.858
Instead, random genetic mutations cause

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:21.667
some giraffes to be
born with longer necks,

00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:23.905
and that gives them
a better chance to survive

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.038
than the ones who weren't so lucky,

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:27.990
which brings us to

00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:31.034
"survival of the fittest".
