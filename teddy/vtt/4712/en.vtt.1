00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:30.765
and you think you have a pretty
good understanding of evolution,

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.170
chances are you still believe
some things about it

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:35.194
that aren't entirely right,

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:36.603
things like,

00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:41.377
"Evolution is organisms
adapting to their environment."

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:42.464
This was an earlier,

now discredited,

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:45.533
theory of evolution.

00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:48.968
Almost 60 years before Darwin
published his book,

00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:50.523
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed

00:00:50.547 --> 00:00:52.346
that creatures evolve by developing

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.771
certain traits over their lifetimes

00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:57.881
and then passing those
on to their offspring.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:00:59.778
For example, he thought

00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:01.727
that because giraffes spent their lives
