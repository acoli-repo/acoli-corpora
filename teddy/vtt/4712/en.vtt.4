00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:00.821
reproduction is.

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:02.465
And the world if full of creatures

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.241
like the male anglerfish,

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:07.119
which is so small and ill-suited
for survival at birth

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:10.783
that it has to quickly find
a mate before it dies.

00:02:10.807 --> 00:02:11.733
But at least we can say

00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:14.034
that if an organism dies
without reproducing,

00:02:14.058 --> 00:02:16.670
it's evolutionarily useless, right?

00:02:16.694 --> 00:02:17.918
Wrong!

00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:20.081
Remember, natural selection happens

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.748
not at the organism level,

00:02:21.772 --> 00:02:23.200
but at the genetic level,

00:02:23.224 --> 00:02:25.657
and the same gene
that exists in one organism

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:28.003
will also exist in its relatives.

00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:31.411
So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself
