00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:31.411
So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself

00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:34.261
to help the survival
and future reproduction

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:35.793
of its siblings or cousins,

00:02:35.817 --> 00:02:37.303
can become more widespread

00:02:37.327 --> 00:02:40.929
than one that is solely concerned
with self-preservation.

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:43.205
Anything that lets more copies of the gene

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.658
pass on to the next generation

00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:47.223
will serve its purpose,

00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:49.005
except

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.613
evolutionary purpose.

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:55.231
One of the most difficult things
to keep in mind about evolution

00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:57.086
is that when we say things like,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.527
"Genes want to make more
copies of themselves,"
