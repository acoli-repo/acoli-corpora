00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:31.034
"survival of the fittest".

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:34.282
This makes it sound
like evolution always favors

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:35.198
the biggest,

00:01:35.222 --> 00:01:36.245
strongest,

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:37.580
or fastest creatures,

00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:39.642
which is not really the case.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:43.279
For one thing, evolutionary
fitness is just a matter

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:46.939
of how well-suited
they are to their current environment.

00:01:46.963 --> 00:01:48.821
If all the tall trees suddenly died out

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:50.721
and only short grass was left,

00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:52.340
all those long-necked giraffes

00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:54.641
would be at a disadvantage.

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:58.730
Secondly, survival is not
how evolution occurs,

00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:00.821
reproduction is.
