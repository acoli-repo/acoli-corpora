00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.527
"Genes want to make more
copies of themselves,"

00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:01.394
or even,

00:03:01.418 --> 00:03:03.386
"natural selection,"

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.011
we're actually using metaphors.

00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:08.474
A gene doesn't want anything,

00:03:08.498 --> 00:03:10.192
and there's no outside mechanism

00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:14.096
that selects which genes
are best to preserve.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.955
All that happens is that random
genetic mutations

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.650
cause the organisms carrying them

00:03:18.674 --> 00:03:20.777
to behave or develop in different ways.

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.736
Some of those ways result in more copies

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.691
of the mutated gene being passed on,

00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:25.741
and so forth.

00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:27.432
Nor is there any predetermined plan

00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:30.871
progressing towards an ideal form.
