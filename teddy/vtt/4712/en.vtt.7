00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:30.871
progressing towards an ideal form.

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:33.419
It's not ideal for the human
eye to have a blind spot

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.321
where the optic nerve exits the retina,

00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:37.496
but that's how it developed,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.298
starting from a simple photoreceptor cell.

00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:41.894
In retrospect, it would have been

00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:43.918
much more advantageous for humans to crave

00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:45.176
nutrients and vitamins

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.188
rather than just calories.

00:03:47.212 --> 00:03:48.310
But over the millenia,

00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:50.001
during which our ancestors evolved,

00:03:50.025 --> 00:03:51.423
calories were scarce,

00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:53.114
and there was nothing to anticipate

00:03:53.138 --> 00:03:56.080
that this would later change so quickly.

00:03:56.104 --> 00:03:58.706
So, evolution proceeds blindly,

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.863
step

00:03:59.887 --> 00:04:01.504
by step
