00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.543
And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters

00:01:30.543 --> 00:01:33.305
is going to produce a subtle, understated,

00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:35.734
we could say camouflaged, bending

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:38.925
to keep the Lesters happy.

00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:42.194
Okay, so we have a democracy, no doubt,

00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:43.870
but it's dependent upon the Lesters

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.880
and dependent upon the people.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.522
It has competing dependencies,

00:01:48.522 --> 00:01:50.932
we could say conflicting dependencies,

00:01:50.932 --> 00:01:55.202
depending upon who the Lesters are.

00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:57.546
Okay. That's Lesterland.

00:01:57.546 --> 00:02:00.305
Now there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland.
