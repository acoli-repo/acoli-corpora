The framers gave us what they called a republic,

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:04.551
but by a republic they meant a representative democracy,

00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:07.738
and by a representative democracy, they meant a government,

00:07:07.738 --> 00:07:10.717
as Madison put it in Federalist 52, that would have a branch

00:07:10.717 --> 00:07:15.662
that would be dependent upon the people alone.

00:07:15.662 --> 00:07:16.677
So here's the model of government.

00:07:16.677 --> 00:07:19.282
They have the people and the government

00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:21.715
with this exclusive dependency,

00:07:21.715 --> 00:07:25.818
but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence,

00:07:25.818 --> 00:07:28.491
no longer a dependence upon the people alone,

00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:30.920
increasingly a dependence upon the funders.
