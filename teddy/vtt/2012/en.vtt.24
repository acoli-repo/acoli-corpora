00:11:59.369 --> 00:12:01.465
and there's any number of these proposals out there:

00:12:01.465 --> 00:12:02.911
Fair Elections Now Act,

00:12:02.911 --> 00:12:05.337
the American Anti-Corruption Act,

00:12:05.337 --> 00:12:08.427
an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:10.761
to give vouchers to people to fund elections,

00:12:10.761 --> 00:12:13.956
an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act.

00:12:13.956 --> 00:12:18.060
Each of these would fix this corruption

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.409
by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:25.067
The analytics are easy here.

00:12:25.067 --> 00:12:30.580
It's the politics that's hard, indeed impossibly hard,
