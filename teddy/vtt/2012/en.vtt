00:00:00.643 --> 00:00:03.535
Once upon a time,

00:00:03.535 --> 00:00:06.975
there was a place called Lesterland.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:09.930
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.667
Like the United States, it has about 311 million people,

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.005
and of that 311 million people,

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:21.888
it turns out 144,000 are called Lester.

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:23.016
If Matt's in the audience,

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:25.706
I just borrowed that, I'll return it in a second,

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:28.371
this character from your series.

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:30.794
So 144,000 are called Lester,
