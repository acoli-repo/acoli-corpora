00:01:57.546 --> 00:02:00.305
Now there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland.

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:03.546
Number one, the United States is Lesterland.

00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:05.422
The United States is Lesterland.

00:02:05.422 --> 00:02:07.803
The United States also looks like this, also has two elections,

00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:10.942
one we called the general election,

00:02:10.942 --> 00:02:14.186
the second we should call the money election.

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:16.352
In the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,

00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:18.946
if you're over 18, in some states if you have an ID.

00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:22.162
In the money election, it's the funders who get to vote,

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:24.922
the funders who get to vote, and just like in Lesterland,

00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:27.081
the trick is, to run in the general election,

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:29.901
you must do extremely well in the money election.

00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:32.522
You don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown.
