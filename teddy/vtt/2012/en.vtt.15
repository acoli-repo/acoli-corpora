00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:30.920
increasingly a dependence upon the funders.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.058
Now this is a dependence too,

00:07:34.058 --> 00:07:37.922
but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone

00:07:37.922 --> 00:07:42.228
so long as the funders are not the people.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:44.491
This is a corruption.

00:07:44.491 --> 00:07:46.991
Now, there's good news and bad news about this corruption.

00:07:46.991 --> 00:07:49.355
One bit of good news is that it's bipartisan,

00:07:49.355 --> 00:07:51.525
equal-opportunity corruption.

00:07:51.525 --> 00:07:56.178
It blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about.

00:07:56.178 --> 00:07:58.650
It blocks the right too, as it makes

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.570
principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible.
