00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.570
principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.762
So the right wants smaller government.

00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:07.458
When Al Gore was Vice President, his team had an idea

00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:11.370
for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.050
The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill,

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.083
and as he reported back to me,

00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:18.282
the response was, "Hell no!

00:08:18.282 --> 00:08:20.058
If we deregulate these guys,

00:08:20.058 --> 00:08:23.816
how are we going to raise money from them?"

00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:27.623
This is a system that's designed to save the status quo,

00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:31.256
including the status quo of big and invasive government.
