00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:32.688
because there is no sensible reform possible

00:10:32.688 --> 00:10:35.217
until we end this corruption.

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:39.402
So I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about.

00:10:39.402 --> 00:10:41.962
Climate change is mine, but it might be financial reform

00:10:41.962 --> 00:10:44.330
or a simpler tax system or inequality.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.518
Grab that issue, sit it down in front of you,

00:10:46.518 --> 00:10:50.359
look straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:52.185
There will never be a Christmas.

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:54.897
We will never get your issue solved

00:10:54.897 --> 00:10:57.863
until we fix this issue first.

00:10:57.863 --> 00:11:01.193
So it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not.
