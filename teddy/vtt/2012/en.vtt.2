00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:01.107
you must do extremely well

00:01:01.107 --> 00:01:02.480
in the Lester election.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.581

Now, what can we say about democracy in Lesterland?

00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:10.924

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:13.560

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.838

00:01:17.838 --> 00:01:20.486

with the candidates who wish to run in the general election.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.543
And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters
