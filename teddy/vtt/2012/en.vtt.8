00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.763
And number two, obviously,

00:04:00.763 --> 00:04:03.035
this dependence upon the funders

00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:06.967
produces a subtle, understated, camouflaged bending

00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:09.604
to keep the funders happy.

00:04:09.604 --> 00:04:12.648
Candidates for Congress and members of Congress

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:16.931
spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time

00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:19.107
raising money to get back to Congress

00:04:19.107 --> 00:04:20.882
or to get their party back into power,

00:04:20.882 --> 00:04:24.307
and the question we need to ask is, what does it do to them,

00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:26.424
these humans, as they spend their time

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:29.843
behind the telephone, calling people they've never met,

00:04:29.843 --> 00:04:33.311
but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent?
