00:13:56.107 --> 00:14:00.418
It takes generations to tear that intuition, that DNA,

00:14:00.418 --> 00:14:02.863
out of the soul of a people.

00:14:02.863 --> 00:14:06.108
But this is a problem of just incentives, just incentives.

00:14:06.108 --> 00:14:08.651
Change the incentives, and the behavior changes,

00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:11.338
and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems

00:14:11.338 --> 00:14:14.468
have seen overnight a change in the practice.

00:14:14.468 --> 00:14:16.449
When Connecticut adopted this system,

00:14:16.449 --> 00:14:20.639
in the very first year, 78 percent of elected representatives

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:24.886
gave up large contributions and took small contributions only.

00:14:24.886 --> 00:14:26.865
It's solvable,

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:29.675
not by being a Democrat,

00:14:29.675 --> 00:14:31.470
not by being a Republican.
