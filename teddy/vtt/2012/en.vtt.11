00:05:27.253 --> 00:05:30.035
The United States is worse than Lesterland,

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:32.916
worse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.268
if we Lesters got a letter from the government that said,

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:38.532
"Hey, you get to pick who gets to run in the general election,"

00:05:38.532 --> 00:05:42.683
we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters.

00:05:42.683 --> 00:05:44.972
You know, there are Lesters from every part of social society.

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:47.620
There are rich Lesters, poor Lesters, black Lesters, white Lesters,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.348
not many women Lesters, but put that to the side for one second.

00:05:50.348 --> 00:05:52.476
We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think,

00:05:52.476 --> 00:05:55.484
"What could we do to make Lesterland better?"

00:05:55.484 --> 00:06:00.259
It's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland.
