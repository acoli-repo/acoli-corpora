00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:31.256
including the status quo of big and invasive government.

00:08:31.256 --> 00:08:33.706
It works against the left and the right,

00:08:33.706 --> 00:08:35.252
and that, you might say, is good news.

00:08:35.252 --> 00:08:37.041
But here's the bad news.

00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:40.944
It's a pathological, democracy-destroying corruption,

00:08:40.944 --> 00:08:43.200
because in any system

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.100
where the members are dependent upon

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.272
the tiniest fraction of us for their election,

00:08:48.272 --> 00:08:51.064
that means the tiniest number of us,

00:08:51.064 --> 00:08:53.344
the tiniest, tiniest number of us,

00:08:53.344 --> 00:08:55.055
can block reform.

00:08:55.055 --> 00:08:57.953
I know that should have been, like, a rock or something.

00:08:57.953 --> 00:08:59.990
I can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.384
Block reform.
