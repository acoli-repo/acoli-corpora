00:02:57.168 --> 00:03:01.131
my father was diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia,

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:04.870
and he couldn't hold a job
in spite of his brilliance.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.947
Our lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest,"

00:03:08.971 --> 00:03:11.037
one part "Awakenings"

00:03:11.061 --> 00:03:13.485
and one part "A Beautiful Mind."

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:15.599
(Laughter)

00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:20.434
I'm the fourth of five children
raised by a single mother

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:23.282
in a rough neighborhood
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:28.062
We never owned a home,
a car, a washing machine,

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:32.408
and for most of my childhood,
we didn't even have a telephone.
