Eleven years later, when
the political landscape changed,

00:07:01.367 --> 00:07:05.633
he heard about a highly selective
university admissions test.

00:07:06.383 --> 00:07:10.263
He had three months to learn
the entire curriculum

00:07:10.287 --> 00:07:11.898
of middle and high school.

00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:16.762
So, every day he came home
from the factory,

00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:21.475
took a nap, studied until 4am,
went back to work

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:25.362
and repeated this cycle
every day for three months.

00:07:26.394 --> 00:07:29.016
He did it, he succeeded.

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:34.699
His commitment to his education
was unwavering, and he never lost hope.
