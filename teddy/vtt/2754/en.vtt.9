00:04:26.415 --> 00:04:30.247
A remarkable and counterintuitive
phenomenon has been discovered,

00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:34.651
which scientists call
Post Traumatic Growth.

00:04:35.494 --> 00:04:38.670
In one study designed to measure
the effects of adversity

00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:40.652
on children at risk,

00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:45.249
among a subset of 698 children

00:04:45.273 --> 00:04:49.558
who experienced the most severe
and extreme conditions,

00:04:49.582 --> 00:04:56.452
fully one-third grew up to lead healthy,
successful and productive lives.

00:04:56.476 --> 00:05:01.641
In spite of everything and against
tremendous odds, they succeeded.
