00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:02.162
To be clear,

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:05.439
I don't hold anything
against the Silver Spoon;

00:02:05.463 --> 00:02:08.929
getting into and graduating
from an elite university

00:02:08.953 --> 00:02:11.723
takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice.

00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:16.364
But if your whole life has been
engineered toward success,

00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:18.517
how will you handle the tough times?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.624
One person I hired felt that
because he attended an elite university,

00:02:23.648 --> 00:02:26.511
there were certain assignments
that were beneath him,

00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:31.640
like temporarily doing manual labor
to better understand an operation.
