00:01:29.087 --> 00:01:32.417
And over the years, I've learned
something about people

00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:35.660
whose experiences read
like a patchwork quilt,

00:01:35.684 --> 00:01:39.160
that makes me stop and fully consider them

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:41.794
before tossing their resumes away.

00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:45.115
A series of odd jobs may indicate

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:49.558
inconsistency, lack of focus,
unpredictability.

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:55.431
Or it may signal a committed
struggle against obstacles.

00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:59.704
At the very least, the Scrapper
deserves an interview.
