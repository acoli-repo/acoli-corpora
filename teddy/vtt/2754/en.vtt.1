and odd jobs like cashier
and singing waitress.

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:37.238
But remember -- both are qualified.

00:00:37.648 --> 00:00:39.164
So I ask you:

00:00:39.188 --> 00:00:41.218
who are you going to pick?

00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:45.551
My colleagues and I created
very official terms

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:49.142
to describe two distinct
categories of candidates.

00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:53.314

the one who clearly had advantages
and was destined for success.

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:01.838
And we call B "the Scrapper,"
