00:00:00.965 --> 00:00:04.468
I was born and raised in North Korea.

00:00:04.468 --> 00:00:09.268
Although my family constantly struggled against poverty,

00:00:09.268 --> 00:00:12.796
I was always loved and cared for first,

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:14.947
because I was the only son

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:18.117
and the youngest of two in the family.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:21.724
But then the great famine began in 1994.

00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:24.183
I was four years old.

00:00:24.183 --> 00:00:27.980
My sister and I would go searching for firewood

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.956
starting at 5 in the morning

00:00:29.956 --> 00:00:32.762
and come back after midnight.
