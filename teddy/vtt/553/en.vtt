I'm a storyteller,

00:00:02.715 --> 00:00:04.900
but I'm also a troublemaker.

00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:05.972
(Laughter)

00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:09.067
And I have a habit
of asking difficult questions.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.848
It started when I was 10 years old,

00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:16.126
and my mother, who was raising
six children, had no time for them.

00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:21.475
At 14, fed up with my increasingly
annoying questions,

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:26.026
she recommended that I begin writing
for the local English-language newspaper

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.087
in Pakistan,

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.484
to put my questions out
to the entire country, she said.
