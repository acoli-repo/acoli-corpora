00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:02.955
The great texts of the ancient world

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:06.270
don't survive to us in their original form.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.789
They survive because medieval scribes copied them

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.788
and copied them and copied them.

00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:14.438
And so it is with Archimedes,

00:00:14.438 --> 00:00:16.204
the great Greek mathematician.

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:19.206
Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.904
we know about because of just three books,

00:00:21.904 --> 00:00:23.820
and they're called A, B and C.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.653
And A was lost by an Italian humanist in 1564.

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:31.456
And B was last heard of in the Pope's Library
