00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:12.288
Baritone thunder. Snarling winds. 
Consuming downpours.

00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:16.871
Okeechobee, the disastrous hurricane 
of 1928,

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:21.788
tore through the North Atlantic basin,
laying waste to entire communities.

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.871
In Eatonville, Florida, 
the storm forced many to flee.

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.204
But for Janie Crawford, 
it inspired an unexpected homecoming.
