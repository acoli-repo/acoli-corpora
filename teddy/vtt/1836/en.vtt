00:00:00.605 --> 00:00:02.359
I essentially drag sledges for a living,

00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:05.543
so it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually,

00:00:05.543 --> 00:00:07.085
but I'm going to read this question

00:00:07.085 --> 00:00:09.552
from an interview earlier this year:

00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:12.944
"Philosophically, does the constant supply of information

00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:15.679
steal our ability to imagine

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.495
or replace our dreams of achieving?

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:21.281
After all, if it is being done somewhere by someone,

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.584
and we can participate virtually,

00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:27.085
then why bother leaving the house?"

00:00:27.085 --> 00:00:29.734
I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:32.035
I'm not sure that's the most progressive or 21st-century
