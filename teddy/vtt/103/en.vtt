00:00:01.254 --> 00:00:05.206
When my 91-year-old mother, Elia,
moved in with me,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.630
I thought I was doing her a service.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.071
In fact, it was the other way around.

00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:16.084
You see, Mom was having issues
with memory loss and accepting her age.

00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:19.016
She looked defeated.

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:23.329
I tried to make her
as comfortable as possible,

00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:25.749
but when I was at my easel, painting,

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:29.368
I would peek over
and see her just ... there.

00:00:29.836 --> 00:00:32.857
She'd be staring at nothing in particular.
