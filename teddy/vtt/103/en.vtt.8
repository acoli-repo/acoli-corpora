She'd tell me about her early childhood
and how she was feeling now.

00:04:01.952 --> 00:04:03.952
We had each other's attention.

00:04:05.404 --> 00:04:07.396
Mom was losing her short-term memory,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.353
but was better recalling
her younger years.

00:04:11.023 --> 00:04:13.521
I'd ask, and she would tell me stories.

00:04:13.884 --> 00:04:16.995
I listened, and I was her audience.

00:04:17.932 --> 00:04:19.353
I got ideas.

00:04:19.377 --> 00:04:22.433
I wrote them down,
and I sketched them out.

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:26.736
I showed her what to do
by acting out the scenarios myself.

00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:29.672
We would then stage them.
