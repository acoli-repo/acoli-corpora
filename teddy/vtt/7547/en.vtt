Avocados.

00:00:02.457 --> 00:00:04.542
Americans love them.

00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:07.754
For what other food
would you pay 15 dollars

00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:11.132
to have someone bring it to your table
and mash it up in front of you?

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:13.593
There's probably a hipster
in Brooklyn right now

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:17.013
ordering a 15-dollar
avocado toast as we speak.

00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:18.890
And that's on the cheap side.

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:20.308
Give me, like, 25 dollars.

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:22.393
I mean, that's insanity, honestly.

00:00:23.102 --> 00:00:25.146
So I have a question.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:30.818
Why would people pay seemingly
absurd prices for something so simple?
