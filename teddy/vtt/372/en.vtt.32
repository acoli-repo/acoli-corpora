00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And those can be environmental bonds.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And before you know it, any social cause

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000

But let's take the idea further.
