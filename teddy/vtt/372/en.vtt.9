00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.

The big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Because I thought, I still maintain,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that serious and independent media companies are great business.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And I thought that B92 will survive and be a great company

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
once Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
media company in the country.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.
