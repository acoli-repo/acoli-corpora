00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And I could spend hours talking about them,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
because they're all kind of heroes.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and depending on time I may give you two examples

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
who we work with.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and moved to Russia.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
In the south of Russia there's a guy called

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
an independent newspaper there.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The city was closed until early '90s

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
because, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.
