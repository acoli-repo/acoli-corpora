00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And we said, that's fine; let's meet;

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
you'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
We start the meeting.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
so it's much bigger.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But however you put it, you know, the numbers

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
do not make any sense.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And that's the best they could do.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We were the best that they could do.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So that is how we understood what our method is.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It's not a bank. We had to actually

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
go into these companies and earn our return
