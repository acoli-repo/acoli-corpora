00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I knew two things after that meeting.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
First, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And second, that I have no idea how to make it work.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
But it's one thing to have a concept;

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Had the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
You see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world.
