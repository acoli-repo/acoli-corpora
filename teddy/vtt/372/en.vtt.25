00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
The governor says, "We will close you."

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Boris Nikolayevich says, "No, you cannot do it."

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Six months later the newspaper was closed.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Luckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
to get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So what the governor got was an empty shell.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and if you are a banker for independent media.
