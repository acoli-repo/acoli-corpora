00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It was still 1991.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
He was running a media systems organization

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
which is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And what did I know at that time about media systems?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I would think media systems were organizations,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
which means they should help you.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans:

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the small one and the big one.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
The small one was, I just wanted him

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
to help us get those damn tapes,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.
