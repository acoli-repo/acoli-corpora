00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and you are the most respected newspaper in our district.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And I want to offer you a deal.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
because I have elections --

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
there are elections coming up in nine months.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I will not run, but it's very important for me

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
who is going to succeed me.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I have no interest in being in media business.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
How much would that cost?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Boris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale."

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
The governor says, "We will close you."
