trying for the third time to convince him that

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
his foundation should invest in something that should

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
operate like a media bank.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And basically what I was saying is very simple.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
You know, forget about charity; it doesn't work.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Forget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
It's business anywhere.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Media business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And what these guys need, actually, is access to capital.
