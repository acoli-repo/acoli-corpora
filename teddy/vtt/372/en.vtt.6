00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
no matter how much does it make sense for them --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
do not want to come and advertise.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And you have a problem making ends meet.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
which was, you know, survival below one side,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
but what was really painful for me was,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in a slow-motion downfall.
