00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
from this side of the room

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
with people of that side of the room.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
to reform, to totally rethink fundraising.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
You know, instead of people running in this dark,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
trying to find their own match, who will be willing,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
who has the same goals.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Instead of all of that we thought there is --

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
something new needs to be invented.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
press freedom bonds.
