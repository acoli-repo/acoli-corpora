00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the power of, and importance of, independent media

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
than I could say in an hour.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So I thought that it will be good to start with it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And also start with a little bit of statistics.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
According to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
lives in the societies without independent press.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
does not really know what is going on in their countries.
