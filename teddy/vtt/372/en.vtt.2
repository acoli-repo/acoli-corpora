00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
who either twists that information, or colors that information,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
does something with it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So they're deprived of understanding their reality.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That is just to understand how big and important this problem is.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
