00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke --

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
is, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
of Michael Jackson?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
That was really the only question he had.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
because I thought there must be an institution in the world

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
that is providing loans to media companies.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It's so obvious, straight in your face,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and somebody must have thought of it.
