00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:04.166
For over 40 years, I've been
a clinical social worker

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.964
and a developmental psychologist.

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:10.261
And it seemed almost natural
for me to go into the helping professions.

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:13.745
My parents had taught me
to do good for others.

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:17.048
And so I devoted my career

00:00:17.072 --> 00:00:20.828
to working with families
in some of the toughest circumstances:

00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:23.026
poverty, mental illness,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.514
immigration, refugees.

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:30.087
And for all those years,
I've worked with hope and with optimism.
