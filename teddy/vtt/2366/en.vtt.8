00:03:58.046 --> 00:04:01.715
in more complicated ways
about the reshaping of cities.

00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:04.733
And so I bought a building.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:07.473
The building was really affordable.

00:04:07.473 --> 00:04:09.185
We tricked it out.

00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:13.620
We made it as beautiful as we could
to try to just get some activity happening

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.872
on my block.

00:04:15.872 --> 00:04:18.310
Once I bought the building
for about 18,000 dollars,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.330
I didn't have any money left.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.509
So I started sweeping the building
as a kind of performance.

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.341
This is performance art,
and people would come over,

00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:29.897
and I would start sweeping.

00:04:29.897 --> 00:04:32.544
Because the broom was free
and sweeping was free.
