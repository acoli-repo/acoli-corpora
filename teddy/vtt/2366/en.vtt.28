00:13:58.686 --> 00:14:00.450
when those people get together,

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.586
I think really amazing things can happen.

00:14:02.586 --> 00:14:04.072
JC: So interesting.

00:14:04.072 --> 00:14:06.394
And how can you make sure
that the projects you're creating

00:14:06.394 --> 00:14:08.159
are actually for the disadvantaged

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:12.199
and not just for the sort of
vegetarian indie movie crowd

00:14:12.199 --> 00:14:14.318
that might move in
to take advantage of them.

00:14:14.318 --> 00:14:19.359
TG: Right on. So I think this is where
it starts to get into the thick weeds.

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.996
JC: Let's go there.
TG: Right now, Grand Crossing

00:14:21.996 --> 00:14:24.993
is 99 percent black, or at least living,

00:14:24.993 --> 00:14:28.313
and we know that maybe
who owns property in a place

00:14:28.313 --> 00:14:30.774
is different from who walks
the streets every day.
