00:02:58.204 --> 00:03:01.153
The neighborhood that I live in
is Grand Crossing.

00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:04.195
It's a neighborhood
that has seen better days.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:09.071
It is not a gated community by far.

00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:12.205
There is lots of abandonment
in my neighborhood,

00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:15.711
and while I was kind of busy
making pots and busy making art

00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:17.662
and having a good art career,

00:03:17.662 --> 00:03:19.807
there was all of this stuff
that was happening

00:03:19.807 --> 00:03:21.600
just outside my studio.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.748
All of us know about
failing housing markets

00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:27.580
and the challenges of blight,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.057
and I feel like we talk about it
with some of our cities more than others,
