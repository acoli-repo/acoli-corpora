There have been times
in my artistic capacity

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:05.041
that I wanted to reflect

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.704
on other really important moments

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:11.814
in the history of the U.S.,
the history of the world

00:01:11.814 --> 00:01:13.405
where tough things happened,

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:16.086
but how do you talk about tough ideas

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:20.196
without separating people
from that content?

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:25.792
Could I use art like these old,
discontinued firehoses from Alabama,

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:31.946
to talk about the complexities of a moment
of civil rights in the '60s?
