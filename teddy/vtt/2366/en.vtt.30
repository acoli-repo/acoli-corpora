00:14:59.055 --> 00:15:02.143
but entities that are interested
in the stabilization piece,

00:15:02.143 --> 00:15:05.649
and I feel like often the developer piece
is really motivated,

00:15:05.649 --> 00:15:09.016
but the other work of a kind
of neighborhood consciousness,

00:15:09.016 --> 00:15:10.990
that part doesn't live anymore.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:15.796
So how do you start to grow up
important watchdogs

00:15:15.796 --> 00:15:18.518
that ensure that the resources
that are made available

00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:19.954
to new folk that are coming in

00:15:19.954 --> 00:15:23.346
are also distributed to folk
who have lived in a place for a long time.

00:15:23.346 --> 00:15:25.955
JC: That makes so much sense.
One more question:

00:15:25.955 --> 00:15:30.002
You make such a compelling case for beauty
and the importance of beauty and the arts.
