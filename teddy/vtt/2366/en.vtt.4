00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.732
if we could reimagine this kind
of nothing material

00:02:03.732 --> 00:02:06.217
as something very special.

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:09.607
And by elevating the material
and my dad's skill,

00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:14.625
could we start to think about tar
just like clay, in a new way,

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:20.017
shaping it differently,
helping us to imagine what was possible?

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:25.790
After clay, I was then kind of turned on
to lots of different kinds of materials,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.762
and my studio grew a lot
because I thought, well,

00:02:28.762 --> 00:02:32.849
it's not really about the material,
it's about our capacity to shape things.
