But are there ways to think about
housing trusts or land trusts

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.518
or a mission-based development

00:14:48.281 --> 00:14:52.600
because when you have
7,500 empty lots in a city,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.551

00:14:54.551 --> 00:14:59.055
but you need entities that are not
just interested in the development piece,

00:14:59.055 --> 00:15:02.143
but entities that are interested
in the stabilization piece,
