00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.057
and I feel like we talk about it
with some of our cities more than others,

00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:33.991
but I think a lot of our
U.S. cities and beyond

00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:36.011
have the challenge of blight,

00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:40.237
abandoned buildings that people
no longer know what to do anything with.

00:03:40.237 --> 00:03:43.093
And so I thought, is there a way
that I could start to think

00:03:43.093 --> 00:03:48.479
about these buildings as an extension
or an expansion of my artistic practice?

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.498
And that if I was thinking
along with other creatives --

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:55.166
architects, engineers,
real estate finance people --

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:58.046
that us together might be able
to kind of think

00:03:58.046 --> 00:04:01.715
in more complicated ways
about the reshaping of cities.
