00:06:55.488 --> 00:07:02.779
had to grow into a much larger
piece of clay, which is now my studio.

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:06.588
What I realized was that
for those of you who are zoning junkies,

00:07:06.588 --> 00:07:08.582
that some of the things that I was doing

00:07:08.582 --> 00:07:11.881
in these buildings
that had been left behind,

00:07:11.881 --> 00:07:15.713
they were not the uses by which
the buildings were built,

00:07:15.713 --> 00:07:17.941
and that there are city policies that say,

00:07:17.941 --> 00:07:21.260
"Hey, a house that is residential
needs to stay residential."

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:26.067
But what do you do in neighborhoods when
ain't nobody interested in living there?

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:30.011
That the people who have
the means to leave have already left?
