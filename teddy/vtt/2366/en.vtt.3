00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:31.946
to talk about the complexities of a moment
of civil rights in the '60s?

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:36.797
Is it possible to talk about my father
and I doing labor projects?

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:40.954
My dad was a roofer, construction guy,
he owned small businesses,

00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:46.470
and at 80, he was ready to retire
and his tar kettle was my inheritance.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.659
Now, a tar kettle doesn't sound
like much of an inheritance. It wasn't.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.606
It was stinky and it took up
a lot of space in my studio,

00:01:55.606 --> 00:01:59.901
but I asked my dad if he would be willing
to make some art with me,

00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.732
if we could reimagine this kind
of nothing material
