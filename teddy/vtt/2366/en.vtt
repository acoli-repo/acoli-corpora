00:00:02.206 --> 00:00:05.224
I'm a potter,

00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:09.749
which seems like a fairly humble vocation.

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.629
I know a lot about pots.

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.309
I've spent about 15 years making them.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.339
One of the things that really
excites me in my artistic practice

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.056
and being trained as a potter

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:27.500
is that you very quickly learn
how to make great things out of nothing;

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.283
that I spent a lot of time at my wheel
with mounds of clay trying stuff;
