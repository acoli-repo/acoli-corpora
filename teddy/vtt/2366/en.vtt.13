00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:33.419
Black Cinema House was an opportunity
in the hood to screen films

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.633
that were important and relevant
to the folk who lived around me,

00:06:37.633 --> 00:06:41.348
that if we wanted to show
an old Melvin Van Peebles film, we could.

00:06:41.348 --> 00:06:44.018
If we wanted to show "Car Wash," we could.

00:06:44.018 --> 00:06:45.991
That would be awesome.

00:06:45.991 --> 00:06:48.546
The building we soon outgrew,

00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:51.053
and we had to move to a larger space.

00:06:51.053 --> 00:06:55.488
Black Cinema House, which was made
from just a small piece of clay,

00:06:55.488 --> 00:07:02.779
had to grow into a much larger
piece of clay, which is now my studio.
