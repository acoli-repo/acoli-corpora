00:11:59.965 --> 00:12:04.052
is giving thought to not just
the kind of individual project,

00:12:04.052 --> 00:12:06.846
like an old house,

00:12:06.846 --> 00:12:09.717
but what's the relationship
between an old house,

00:12:09.717 --> 00:12:12.875
a local school, a small bodega,

00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:15.871
and is there some kind of synergy
between those things?

00:12:15.871 --> 00:12:18.169
Can you get those folk talking?

00:12:18.169 --> 00:12:22.720
I've found that in cases
where neighborhoods have failed,

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.903
they still often have a pulse.

00:12:24.903 --> 00:12:28.362
How do you identify the pulse
in that place, the passionate people,

00:12:28.362 --> 00:12:31.367
and then how do you get folk
who have been fighting,
