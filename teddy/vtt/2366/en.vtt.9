00:04:29.897 --> 00:04:32.544
Because the broom was free
and sweeping was free.

00:04:32.544 --> 00:04:34.703
It worked out.

00:04:34.703 --> 00:04:36.938
(Laughter)

00:04:36.938 --> 00:04:42.389
But we would use the building, then,
to stage exhibitions, small dinners,

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.336
and we found that that building
on my block, Dorchester --

00:04:46.336 --> 00:04:49.052
we now referred to the block
as Dorchester projects --

00:04:49.052 --> 00:04:52.535
that in a way that building
became a kind of gathering site

00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:54.769
for lots of different kinds of activity.

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:59.222
We turned the building into
what we called now the Archive House.

00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:02.403
The Archive House would do
all of these amazing things.
