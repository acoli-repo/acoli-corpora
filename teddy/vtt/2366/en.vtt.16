because banks weren't interested
in the neighborhood

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:04.641
because people weren't interested
in the neighborhood

00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.742
because nothing had happened there.

00:08:06.742 --> 00:08:10.724
It was dirt. It was nothing.
It was nowhere.

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:16.381
And so we just started imagining,
what else could happen in this building?

00:08:16.381 --> 00:08:21.846
(Applause)

00:08:21.846 --> 00:08:24.615
And so now that the rumor
of my block has spread,

00:08:24.615 --> 00:08:26.595
and lots of people are starting to visit,

00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:28.696
we've found that the bank
can now be a center

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:31.908
for exhibition, archives,
music performance,
