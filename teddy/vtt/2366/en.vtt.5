it's not really about the material,
it's about our capacity to shape things.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.705
I became more and more interested in ideas

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:40.537
and more and more things that 
were happening just outside my studio.

00:02:41.897 --> 00:02:45.096
Just to give you a little bit of context,
I live in Chicago.

00:02:45.104 --> 00:02:48.359
I live on the South Side now.
I'm a West Sider.

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.773
For those of you who are not Chicagoans,
that won't mean anything,

00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:54.025
but if I didn't mention
that I was a West Sider,

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:58.204
there would be a lot of people
in the city that would be very upset.

00:02:58.204 --> 00:03:01.153
The neighborhood that I live in
is Grand Crossing.
