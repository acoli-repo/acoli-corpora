00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:03.038
and that often, those people
who are passionate about a place

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:07.450
are disconnected from the resources
necessary to make cool things happen,

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.027
or disconnected from
a contingency of people

00:11:10.027 --> 00:11:11.908
that could help make things happen.

00:11:11.908 --> 00:11:16.200
So now, we're starting to give advice
around the country

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.345
on how to start with what you got,

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.140
how to start with the things
that are in front of you,

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.517
how to make something out of nothing,

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:28.045
how to reshape your world
at a wheel or at your block

00:11:28.045 --> 00:11:30.530
or at the scale of the city.
