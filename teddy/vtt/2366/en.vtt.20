00:09:56.812 --> 00:10:00.225
that we tackle the things
that are at our wheel,

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.488
we try with the skill that we have

00:10:02.488 --> 00:10:07.028
to think about this next bowl
that I want to make.

00:10:07.028 --> 00:10:11.927
And it went from a bowl to a singular
house to a block to a neighborhood

00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:14.621
to a cultural district
to thinking about the city,

00:10:14.621 --> 00:10:18.707
and at every point, there were things
that I didn't know that I had to learn.

00:10:18.707 --> 00:10:21.749
I've never learned so much
about zoning law in my life.

00:10:21.749 --> 00:10:23.529
I never thought I'd have to.

00:10:23.529 --> 00:10:26.486
But as a result of that, I'm finding
that there's not just room

00:10:26.486 --> 00:10:28.227
for my own artistic practice,

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:30.763
there's room for a lot of other
artistic practices.
