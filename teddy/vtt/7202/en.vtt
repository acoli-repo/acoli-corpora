When I’m out at the grocery store
or maybe a restaurant

00:00:06.197 --> 00:00:10.697
or the park with my son --
he’s six and a half --

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.397
people will stop us and mention
that they think that he’s handsome.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.763
I agree.

00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:19.463
They'll use that opportunity
to chop it up with him,

00:00:19.497 --> 00:00:21.630
and often when they're done
talking with him,

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:25.497
they’ll mention that they think
he’s a smart and engaging little guy.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.263
When those people walk away,
the thought that comes to my mind

00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:32.663
is that I hope they remember
meeting him as a child
