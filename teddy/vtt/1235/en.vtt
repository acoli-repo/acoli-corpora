00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
of about eight of my projects,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We call ourselves Pors and Rao,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and we live and work in India.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'd like to begin with my very first object,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which I call "The Uncle Phone."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of constantly asking me to do things for him,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
almost like I were an extension of his body --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a pack of cigarettes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And as I grew up, it became worse and worse,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And I started to think of it as a form of control.
