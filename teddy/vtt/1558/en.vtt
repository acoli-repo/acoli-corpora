00:00:00.586 --> 00:00:02.649
I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.823
and its relationship with technology.

00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:09.718
We tend to think of business strategy

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:11.681
as being a rather abstract body

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:13.396
of essentially economic thought,

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:15.026
perhaps rather timeless.

00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:16.966
I'm going to argue that, in fact,

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.521
business strategy has always been premised

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.940
on assumptions about technology,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.913
that those assumptions are changing,

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:26.630
and, in fact, changing quite dramatically,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.702
and that therefore what that will drive us to

00:00:29.702 --> 00:00:32.605
is a different concept of what we mean
