(Voice-over) Andrew Youn:
I have incredible belief

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:09.704
in the strength and power
of African farmers.

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:12.204
The farmers I get to serve
are incredibly inspiring,

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:14.329
hardworking and confident, mostly women,

00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.413
that earn a better life
for their families.

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:23.579
They have an incredible amount of power.

00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:26.163
They're just not always equipped
with the right tools.

00:00:26.163 --> 00:00:28.329
So my organization makes
a few little tweaks

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:31.371
and enables farm families to succeed
at a whole nother level.
