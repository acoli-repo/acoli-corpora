00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:32.094
and it's not about saving Jews.
It's not about saving Muslims.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.666
It's not about saving Christians.
It's about saving people.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.079
So I went ahead, full force --

00:07:38.103 --> 00:07:42.670
(Applause) —

00:07:42.694 --> 00:07:46.337
and I started United
Hatzalah in east Jerusalem,

00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:48.156
and that's why the names United

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.236
and Hatzalah match so well.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.088
We started hand in hand
saving Jews and Arabs.

00:07:54.112 --> 00:07:56.351
Arabs were saving Jews.
Jews were saving Arabs.

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.352
Something special happened.

00:07:58.376 --> 00:08:01.017
Arabs and Jews, they don't
always get along together,
