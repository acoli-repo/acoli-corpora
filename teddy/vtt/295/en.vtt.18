00:08:58.088 --> 00:09:01.132
and this last year we started
in Panama and Brazil.

00:09:01.156 --> 00:09:04.514
All I need is a partner
who is a little meshugenah like me,

00:09:04.538 --> 00:09:07.904
passionate about saving
lives, and willing to do it.

00:09:07.928 --> 00:09:11.413
And I'm actually starting
it in India very soon

00:09:11.437 --> 00:09:15.066
with a friend who I met
in Harvard just a while back.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.934
Hatzalah actually started
in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.212
years before us in Williamsburg,

00:09:21.236 --> 00:09:23.935
and now it's all over the Jewish
community in New York,

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:27.195
even Australia and Mexico
and many other Jewish communities.

00:09:27.219 --> 00:09:28.789
But it could spread everywhere.

00:09:28.813 --> 00:09:31.345
It's very easy to adopt.
