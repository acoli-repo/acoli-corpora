00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.633
When the ambulance arrived
15 minutes later,

00:04:30.657 --> 00:04:33.220
I gave them over a patient who was alive.

00:04:33.244 --> 00:04:41.200
(Applause)

00:04:41.224 --> 00:04:43.362
When I went to visit him two days later,

00:04:43.386 --> 00:04:45.697
he gave me a hug and was crying

00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:48.719
and thanking me for saving his life.

00:04:48.743 --> 00:04:51.740
At that moment, when I realized
this is the first person

00:04:51.764 --> 00:04:55.050
I ever saved in my life after two years
volunteering in an ambulance,

00:04:55.074 --> 00:04:57.742
I knew this is my life's mission.

00:04:57.766 --> 00:05:01.907
So today, 22 years later,
we have United Hatzalah.
