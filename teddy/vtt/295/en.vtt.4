00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.257
that this child died for nothing.

00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:05.812
If this doctor, who lived
one block away from there,

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:07.503
would have come 20 minutes earlier,

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:10.529

I said to myself, there
must be a better way.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.934
Together with 15 of my friends --

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.705
we were all EMTs —

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.777
we decided, let's protect
our neighborhood,

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:30.801
so when something like that happens again,
