When I was six years old,
I was walking back from school

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:37.356
on a Friday afternoon
with my older brother.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.608
We were passing by a bus stop.

00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:43.651
We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes.

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:48.696
The bus was on fire, and many people
were hurt and killed.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.628
I remembered an old man

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:54.096
yelling to us and crying
to help us get him up.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.559
He just needed someone helping him.

00:00:56.583 --> 00:01:00.093
We were so scared and we just ran away.
