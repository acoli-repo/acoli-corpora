00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.787
One day, we received a call
about a seven-year-old child

00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:33.370
choking from a hot dog.

00:01:33.394 --> 00:01:35.537
Traffic was horrific,
and we were coming from

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:39.148
the other side of town
in the north part of Jerusalem.

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:41.434
When we got there, 20 minutes later,

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:43.952
we started CPR on the kid.

00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:47.436
A doctor comes in from a block away,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.632
stop us, checks the kid,
and tells us to stop CPR.

00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:56.389
That second he declared this child dead.

00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:59.386
At that moment, I understood

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.257
that this child died for nothing.
