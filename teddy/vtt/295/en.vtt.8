00:03:59.214 --> 00:04:02.800
hurt by a car only one block away from me

00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:05.491
on the main street of my neighborhood.

00:04:05.515 --> 00:04:08.194
I ran there by foot. I had
no medical equipment.

00:04:08.218 --> 00:04:11.144
When I got there, the 70-year-old man

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:14.058
was lying on the floor, blood
was gushing out of his neck.

00:04:14.082 --> 00:04:15.271
He was on Coumadin.

00:04:15.295 --> 00:04:20.265
I knew I had to stop his bleeding
or else he would die.

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.208
I took off my yarmulke,
because I had no medical equipment,

00:04:23.232 --> 00:04:25.661
and with a lot of pressure,
I stopped his bleeding.

00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:27.176
He was bleeding from his neck.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.633
When the ambulance arrived
15 minutes later,
