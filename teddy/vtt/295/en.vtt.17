00:08:29.566 --> 00:08:31.307
to arrive to save my father

00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:33.903
was one of these Muslim
volunteers from east Jerusalem

00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:37.448
who was in the first
course to join Hatzalah.

00:08:37.472 --> 00:08:38.525
And he saved my father.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:43.032
Could you imagine
how I felt in that moment?

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:46.141
When I started this organization,
I was 17 years old.

00:08:46.165 --> 00:08:49.551
I never imagined that one day
I'd be speaking at TEDMED.

00:08:49.575 --> 00:08:51.433
I never even knew what TEDMED was then.

00:08:51.457 --> 00:08:54.577
I don't think it existed,
but I never imagined,

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:56.982
I never imagined that it's going
to go all around,

00:08:57.006 --> 00:08:58.064
it's going to spread around,

00:08:58.088 --> 00:09:01.132
and this last year we started
in Panama and Brazil.
