00:07:58.376 --> 00:08:01.017
Arabs and Jews, they don't
always get along together,

00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:02.327
but here in this situation,

00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:04.120
the communities, literally,

00:08:04.144 --> 00:08:06.287
it's an unbelievable
situation that happened,

00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:08.881
the diversities, all of a sudden
they had a common interest:

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.323
Let's save lives together.

00:08:10.347 --> 00:08:13.109
Settlers were saving Arabs
and Arabs were saving settlers.

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:15.229
It's an unbelievable
concept that could work

00:08:15.253 --> 00:08:17.984
only when you have such a great cause.

00:08:18.008 --> 00:08:19.857
And these are all volunteers.

00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:20.976
No one is getting money.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.852
They're all doing it
for the purpose of saving lives.

00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:27.137
When my own father
collapsed a few years ago

00:08:27.161 --> 00:08:29.542
from a cardiac arrest,
one of the first volunteers

00:08:29.566 --> 00:08:31.307
to arrive to save my father
