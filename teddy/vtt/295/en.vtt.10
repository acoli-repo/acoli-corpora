00:04:57.766 --> 00:05:01.907
So today, 22 years later,
we have United Hatzalah.

00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:08.297
(Applause)

00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:11.369
"Hatzalah" means "rescue,"
for all of you who don't know Hebrew.

00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:13.321
I forgot I'm not in Israel.

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:16.256
So we have thousands of volunteers

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.175
who are passionate about saving lives,

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.009
and they're spread all around,
so whenever a call comes in,

00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:26.405
they just stop everything
and go and run and save a life.

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:28.962
Our average response time today

00:05:28.986 --> 00:05:32.676
went down to less
than three minutes in Israel.
