00:06:59.224 --> 00:07:01.682
A few years after I started
this organization,

00:07:01.706 --> 00:07:03.427
in a Jewish community,

00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:06.230
two Muslims from east
Jerusalem called me up.

00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:08.928
They ask me to meet. They
wanted to meet with me.

00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:11.419
Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan.

00:07:11.443 --> 00:07:13.396
When Muhammad told me his personal story,

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.251
how his father, 55 years
old, collapsed at home,

00:07:16.275 --> 00:07:17.507
had a cardiac arrest,

00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:19.927
and it took over an hour
for an ambulance arrive,

00:07:19.951 --> 00:07:22.190
and he saw his father die
in front of his eyes,

00:07:22.214 --> 00:07:24.985
he asked me, "Please start
this in east Jerusalem."

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:28.810
I said to myself, I saw so
much tragedy, so much hate,

00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:32.094
and it's not about saving Jews.
It's not about saving Muslims.
