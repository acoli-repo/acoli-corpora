Well, he was laughing. I was 17 years old.
I was a kid.

00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:03.846
And he said to me — I remember
this like yesterday —

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.203
he was a great guy, but he said to me,

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:10.639
"Kid, go to school, or go
open a falafel stand.

00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:14.640
We're not really interested
in these kinds of new adventures.

00:03:14.664 --> 00:03:18.255
We're not interested in your help."
And he threw me out of the room.

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.914
"I don't need your help," he said.

00:03:20.938 --> 00:03:24.493
I was a very stubborn kid.

00:03:24.517 --> 00:03:27.911
As you see now, I'm walking
around like crazy, meshugenah.

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:32.883
(Laughter) (Applause)
