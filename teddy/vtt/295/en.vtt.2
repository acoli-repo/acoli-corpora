00:00:56.583 --> 00:01:00.093
We were so scared and we just ran away.

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:03.883
Growing up, I decided I wanted
to become a doctor and save lives.

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:06.884
Maybe that was because of what I saw
when I was a child.

00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:10.176
When I was 15, I took an EMT course,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.236
and I went to volunteer on an ambulance.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.653

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:18.505

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:26.271

distance, and everything.

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:29.096
We never got there when
somebody really needed us.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.787
One day, we received a call
about a seven-year-old child
