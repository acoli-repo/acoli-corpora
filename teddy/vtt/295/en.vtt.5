00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:30.801
so when something like that happens again,

00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:34.215
we will be there running to the scene
a lot before the ambulance.

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.188
So I went over to the manager
of the ambulance company

00:02:37.212 --> 00:02:39.546
and I told him, "Please,
whenever you have a call

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.207
coming into our neighborhood,

00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:43.112
we have 15 great guys who are willing

00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:45.803
to stop everything they're
doing and run and save lives.

00:02:45.827 --> 00:02:47.231
Just alert us by beeper.

00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:49.572
We'll buy these beepers,
just tell your dispatch

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:53.483
to send us the beeper,
and we will run and save lives."

00:02:53.507 --> 00:03:00.460
Well, he was laughing. I was 17 years old.
I was a kid.
