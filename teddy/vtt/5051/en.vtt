00:00:06.742 --> 00:00:12.052
There are currently hundreds of thousands 
of people on transplant lists,

00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:16.399
waiting for critical organs like kidneys, 
hearts, and livers

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.449
that could save their lives.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.609
Unfortunately,

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.619
there arenâ€™t nearly enough donor organs 
available to fill that demand.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.583
What if instead of waiting,

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:31.123
we could create brand-new, customized 
organs from scratch?
