00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.120
Two possible outcomes to this experiment.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.296
If you can get a mouse

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.936
that is functional,

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.160
then you can see,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.640
is the new brain a blank slate?

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.320
And boy, does that have implications.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.320
Second option:

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.920
the new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.856
The new mouse
remembers what it's afraid of,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.576
remembers how to navigate the maze,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.800
and if that is true,

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.360
then you can transplant
memory and consciousness.
