00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.496
and where is it not ethical
to enhance a human body?

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.416
And all of a sudden, what we're doing

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.376
is we've got this
multidimensional chess board

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.656
where we can change
human genetics by using viruses

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.120
to attack things like AIDS,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.536
or we can change the gene code
through gene therapy

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.496
to do away with some hereditary diseases,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.136
or we can change the environment,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.827
and change the expression
of those genes in the epigenome

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.811
and pass that on to the next generations.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.456
And all of a sudden,
it's not just one little bit,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.336
it's all these stacked little bits
