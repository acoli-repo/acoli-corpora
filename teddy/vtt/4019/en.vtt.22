00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.400
of instruments that might
take us even that far.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.576
And let me give you two examples.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.553
So this is the wonderful Floyd Romesberg,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.336
and one of the things
that Floyd's been doing

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.896
is he's been playing
with the basic chemistry of life.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.776
So all life on this planet
is made in ATCGs, the four letters of DNA.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.936
All bacteria, all plants,
all animals, all humans, all cows,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.160
everything else.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.616
And what Floyd did is he changed out
two of those base pairs,

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.160
so it's ATXY.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.456
And that means that you now have
a parallel system to make life,
