00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.336
You can have all types of controls,
and as you're thinking about that,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.376
there are wonderful people like Hugh Herr

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.239
who have been building
absolutely extraordinary prosthetics.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.536
So the wonderful Aimee Mullins
will go out and say,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.240
how tall do I want to be tonight?

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.936
Or Hugh will say what type of cliff
do I want to climb?

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.456
Or does somebody want to run a marathon,
or does somebody want to ballroom dance?

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.456
And as you adapt these things,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.616
the interesting thing about prosthetics
is they've been coming inside the body.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.616
So these external prosthetics
have now become artificial knees.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.696
They've become artificial hips.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.936
And then they've evolved further
