00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.280
Here's a question that matters.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.856
[Is it ethical to evolve the human body?]

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.376
Because we're beginning to get all
the tools together to evolve ourselves.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.816
And we can evolve bacteria
and we can evolve plants

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.256
and we can evolve animals,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.096
and we're now reaching a point
where we really have to ask,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.960
is it really ethical
and do we want to evolve human beings?

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.336
And as you're thinking about that,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.096
let me talk about that
in the context of prosthetics,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.800
prosthetics past, present, future.
