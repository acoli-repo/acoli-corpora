00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.000
to get from here
to the nearest solar system.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.680
So if you want to start exploring
beaches somewhere else,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.800
or you want to see two-sun sunsets,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.976
then you're talking
about something that is very different,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.056
because you have to change
the timescale and the body of humans

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.000
in ways which may be
absolutely unrecognizable.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.840
And that's a Life Four civilization.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.656
Now, we can't even begin
to imagine what that might look like,

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.016
but we're beginning to get glimpses

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.400
of instruments that might
take us even that far.
