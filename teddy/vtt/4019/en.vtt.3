00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.936
And then they've evolved further

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.976
to become not just nice to have

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.200

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.776
So when you're talking
about a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.496
you're talking about something
that isn't just, "I'm missing my leg,"

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.936
it's, "if I don't have this, I can die."

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.056
And at that point, a prosthetic
becomes a symbiotic relationship

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.280

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.376
Ed Boyden, Hugh Herr,
Joe Jacobson, Bob Lander --
