00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.696
So you put human growth hormone in,
the person grows taller,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.656
or you put x in and the person
gets fatter or loses metabolism

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.296
or does a whole series of things,

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.016
but you're altering the functions
in a fundamental way.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.656
To become an intrasolar civilization,

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.400
we're going to have to create
a Life Three civilization,

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.320
and that looks very different
from what we've got here.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.056
Maybe you splice in
Deinococcus radiodurans

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.200
so that the cells can resplice
after a lot of exposure to radiation.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.336
Maybe you breathe by having oxygen
flow through your blood
