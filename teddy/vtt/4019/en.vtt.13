astronomer royal of Great Britain.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.376
And one of his favorite sayings
is the universe is 100 percent malevolent.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.616
So what does that mean?

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.536
It means if you take
any one of your bodies at random,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.456
drop it anywhere in the universe,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.200
drop it in space, you die.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.096
Drop it on the Sun, you die.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.136
Drop it on the surface
of Mercury, you die.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.800
Drop it near a supernova, you die.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.360
But fortunately, it's only
about 80 percent effective.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.680
So as a great physicist once said,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.136
there's these little
upstream eddies of biology
