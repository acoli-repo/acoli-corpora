These are Phonak hearing aids,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.416
and the reason
why these are so interesting

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.856
is because they cross the threshold
from where prosthetics are something

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.309
for somebody who is "disabled"

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.616
and they become something
that somebody who is "normal"

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.536
might want to actually have,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.536
because what this prosthetic does,
which is really interesting,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.216
is not only does it help you hear,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.576
you can focus your hearing,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.056
so it can hear the conversation
going on over there.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.336
You can have superhearing.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.296
You can have hearing in 360 degrees.
You can have white noise.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.520
You can record, and oh, by the way,
they also put a phone into this.
