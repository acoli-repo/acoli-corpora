00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.096
And over the last few weeks,
George Church has been in the news a lot

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.416
because he's been talking about taking
one of these programmable cells

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.176
and inserting an entire human genome

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.400
into that cell.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.296
And once you can insert
an entire human genome into a cell,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.456
then you begin to ask the question,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.160
would you want
to enhance any of that genome?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.776
Do you want to enhance a human body?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.096
How would you want
to enhance a human body?

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.216
Where is it ethical
to enhance a human body

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.496
and where is it not ethical
to enhance a human body?
