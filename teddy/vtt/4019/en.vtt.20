Maybe you breathe by having oxygen
flow through your blood

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.800
instead of through your lungs.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.320
But you're talking about
really radical redesigns,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.696
and one of the interesting things
that's happened in the last decade

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.456
is we've discovered
a whole lot of planets out there.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.160
And some of them may be Earth-like.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.056
The problem is, if we ever
want to get to these planets,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.736
the fastest human objects --

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.336
Juno and Voyager
and the rest of this stuff --

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.856
take tens of thousands of years

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.000
to get from here
to the nearest solar system.
