You can record, and oh, by the way,
they also put a phone into this.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.320
So this functions as your hearing aid
and also as your phone.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.080
And at that point, somebody might actually
want to have a prosthetic voluntarily.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.096
All of these thousands
of loosely connected little pieces

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.320
are coming together,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.056
and it's about time we ask the question,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.240
how do we want to evolve human beings
over the next century or two?

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.680
And for that we turn
to a great philosopher

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.976
who was a very smart man
despite being a Yankee fan.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.880
