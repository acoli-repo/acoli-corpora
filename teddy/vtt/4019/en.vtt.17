00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.376
We don't know, if you change
the gravity substantially,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.880
if the same thing will happen
to create your body.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.216
We do know that if you expose
our bodies as they currently are

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.360
to a lot of radiation, we will die.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.096
So as you're thinking of that,
you have to really redesign things

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.376
just to get to Mars.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.320
Forget about the moons
of Neptune or Jupiter.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.456
And to borrow from Nikolai Kardashev,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.656
let's think about life
in a series of scales.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.176
So Life One civilization
