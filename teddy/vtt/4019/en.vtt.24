00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.976
that could be chemistries
adaptable to a very different planet

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.360
that could create life and heredity.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.360
The second experiment,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.560
or the other implication
of this experiment,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.576
is that all of you, all life
is based on 20 amino acids.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.056
If you don't substitute two amino acids,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.656
if you don't say ATXY,
if you say ATCG + XY,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.440
then you go from
20 building blocks to 172,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.656
and all of a sudden you've got
172 building blocks of amino acids
