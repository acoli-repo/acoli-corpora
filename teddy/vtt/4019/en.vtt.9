00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.520
because that's a whole lot more effective
than any kind of a prosthetic.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.456
But while you're at it, then you can take
the work of Craig Venter and Ham Smith.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.536
And one of the things
that we've been doing

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.120
is trying to figure out
how to reprogram cells.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.856
And if you can reprogram a cell,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.120
then you can change the cells
in those organs.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.616
So if you can change
the cells in those organs,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.136
maybe you make those organs
more radiation-resistant.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.056
Maybe you make them absorb more oxygen.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.736
Maybe you make them more efficient

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.240
to filter out stuff
that you don't want in your body.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.096
And over the last few weeks,
George Church has been in the news a lot
