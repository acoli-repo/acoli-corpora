00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.336
it's all these stacked little bits

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.440
that allow you
to take little portions of it

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.280
until all the portions coming together

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.240
lead you to something
that's very different.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.336
And a lot of people
are very scared by this stuff.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.280
And it does sound scary,
and there are risks to this stuff.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.736
So why in the world would you
ever want to do this stuff?

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.776
Why would we really want
to alter the human body

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.000
in a fundamental way?

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.336
The answer lies in part

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.560
with Lord Rees,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.920
astronomer royal of Great Britain.
