Ed Boyden, Hugh Herr,
Joe Jacobson, Bob Lander --

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.976
are working on a Center
for Extreme Bionics.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.616
And the interesting thing
of what you're seeing here is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.056
these prosthetics
now get integrated into the bone.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.735
They get integrated into the skin.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.475
They get integrated into the muscle.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.336
And one of the other sides of Ed

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.256
is he's been thinking
about how to connect the brain

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.976
using light or other mechanisms

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.280
directly to things like these prosthetics.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.776
And if you can do that,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.000
then you can begin changing
fundamental aspects of humanity.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.840
So how quickly you react to something
depends on the diameter of a nerve.
