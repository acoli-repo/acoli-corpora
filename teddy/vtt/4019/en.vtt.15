00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.496
when the Earth gets hit by an asteroid,
when you have supervolcanoes,

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.376
when you have solar flares,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.736
when you have potentially
extinction-level events

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.976
like the next election --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.160
(Laughter)

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.680
then all of a sudden,
you can have periodic extinctions.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.840
And by the way, that's happened
five times on Earth,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.456
and therefore it is very likely

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.520
that the human species on Earth
is going to go extinct someday.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.936
Not next week,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.776
not next month,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.680
maybe in November,
but maybe 10,000 years after that.
