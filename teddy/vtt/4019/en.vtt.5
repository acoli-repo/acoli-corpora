00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.840
So how quickly you react to something
depends on the diameter of a nerve.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.800
And of course, if you have nerves
that are external or prosthetic,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.480
say with light or liquid metal,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.976
then you can increase that diameter

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.056
and you could even increase it
theoretically to the point where,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.120
as long as you could see the muzzle flash,
you could step out of the way of a bullet.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.960
Those are the order of magnitude
of changes you're talking about.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.776
This is a fourth
sort of level of prosthetics.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.336
