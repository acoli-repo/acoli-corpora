00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.456
And that means that you now have
a parallel system to make life,

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.776
to make babies, to reproduce, to evolve,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.976
that doesn't mate
with most things on Earth

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.880
or in fact maybe with nothing on Earth.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.416
Maybe you make plants
that are immune to all bacteria.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.936
Maybe you make plants
that are immune to all viruses.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.496
But why is that so interesting?

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.680
It means that we
are not a unique solution.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.136
It means you can create
alternate chemistries to us

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.976
that could be chemistries
adaptable to a very different planet
