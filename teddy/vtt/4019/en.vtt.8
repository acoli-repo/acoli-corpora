(Laughter)

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.616
And Yogi Berra used to say, of course,
that it's very tough to make predictions,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.016
especially about the future.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.136
(Laughter)

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.216
So instead of making a prediction
about the future to begin with,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.576
let's take what's happening in the present
with people like Tony Atala,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.839
who is redesigning 30-some-odd organs.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.776
And maybe the ultimate prosthetic
isn't having something external, titanium.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.496
Maybe the ultimate prosthetic
is take your own gene code,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.840
remake your own body parts,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.520
because that's a whole lot more effective
than any kind of a prosthetic.
