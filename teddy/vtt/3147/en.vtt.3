00:01:29.847 --> 00:01:33.140
Along here, we're going
to put the last 200 years.

00:01:33.164 --> 00:01:36.180
Up here, we're going to put
the number of democracies.

00:01:36.204 --> 00:01:38.132
And the graph does this,

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.395
the important point of which,

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:43.672
is this extraordinary increase over time,

00:01:43.696 --> 00:01:45.474
which is why the 20th century

00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:48.641
has been called the century
of democracy's triumph,

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:52.093
and why, as Francis Fukuyama said in 1989,

00:01:52.117 --> 00:01:55.122
some believe that we have reached
the end of history,

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:58.808
that the question of how to live together
has been answered,

00:01:58.832 --> 00:02:01.312
and that answer is liberal democracy.
