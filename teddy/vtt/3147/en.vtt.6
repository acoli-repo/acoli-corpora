00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.323
Our politics is broken,
our politicians aren't trusted,

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:04.487
and the political system is distorted
by powerful vested interests.

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
I think there's two ways
to resolve this paradox.

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:11.935
One is to give up on democracy;
it doesn't work.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.656
Let's elect a populist demagogue
who will ignore democratic norms,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.182
trample on liberal freedoms

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:18.839
and just get things done.

00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:22.760
The other option, I think,
is to fix this broken system,

00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:25.641
to bring the practice closer to the ideal

00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:29.149
and put the diverse voices of society
in our parliaments

00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:32.157
and get them to make considered,
evidence-based laws
