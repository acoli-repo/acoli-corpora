00:01:58.832 --> 00:02:01.312
and that answer is liberal democracy.

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:03.776
Let's explore that assertion, though.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.656
I want to find out what you think.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.569
So I'm going to ask you two questions,

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:09.338
and I want you to put your hands up

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:10.513
if you agree.

00:02:10.537 --> 00:02:14.815
The first question is: Who thinks
living in a democracy is a good thing?

00:02:15.246 --> 00:02:16.708
Who likes democracy?

00:02:16.732 --> 00:02:19.732
If you can think of a better system,
keep your hands down.

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:22.248
Don't worry about those
who didn't raise their hands,

00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:23.672
I'm sure they mean very well.

00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:25.205
The second question is:

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.509
Who thinks our democracies
are functioning well?

00:02:29.908 --> 00:02:32.953
Come on, there must be one politician
in the audience somewhere.
