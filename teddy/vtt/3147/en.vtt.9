00:04:29.807 --> 00:04:33.789
but most of them would be
ordinary people like you and me.

00:04:34.396 --> 00:04:38.095
This would be a microcosm of society.

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:42.331
And this microcosm would simulate
how we would all think,

00:04:42.355 --> 00:04:45.399
if we had the time, the information

00:04:45.423 --> 00:04:50.000
and a good process to come to
the moral crux of political decisions.

00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:52.087
And although you may not be in that group,

00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:54.262
someone of your age,
someone of your gender,

00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:57.159
someone from your location
and someone with your background

00:04:57.183 --> 00:04:58.649
would be in that room.

00:04:59.743 --> 00:05:03.863
The decisions made by these people
would build on the wisdom of crowds.
