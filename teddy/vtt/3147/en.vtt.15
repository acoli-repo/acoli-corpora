00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.228
And the answer to that question,
to me at least, is obviously yes.

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:36.467
Which gets us back
to our original question:

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.951
How should we live together?

00:07:38.975 --> 00:07:40.729
And now we have an answer:

00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:44.114
with a parliament that uses sortition.

00:07:44.745 --> 00:07:47.593
But how would we get from here to there?

00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:49.958
How could we fix our broken system

00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:53.257
and remake democracy for the 21st century?

00:07:53.784 --> 00:07:57.006
Well, there are several
things that we can do,

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.101
and that are, in fact,
happening right now.
