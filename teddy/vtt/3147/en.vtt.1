00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:31.481
if we want to address rising inequality,
climate change, the refugee crisis,

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:34.085
just to name a few major issues.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.815
It's also a very old question.

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:39.237
Humans have been asking
themselves this question

00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:42.196
ever since we lived
in organized societies.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.358
Like this guy, Plato.

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:46.911
He thought we needed benevolent guardians

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:50.671
who could make decisions
for the greater good of everyone.

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:54.274
Kings and queens thought
they could be those guardians,

00:00:54.298 --> 00:00:57.918
but during various revolutions,
they tended to lose their heads.

00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:00.871
And this guy, you probably know.
