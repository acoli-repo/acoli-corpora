However, there would be

00:05:42.724 --> 00:05:45.556
if we replaced elections with sortition

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.268
and made our parliament
truly representative of society,

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:52.141
it would mean the end of politicians.

00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:54.664

00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:02.235
random selection was a key part
of how democracy was done
