00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:02.235
random selection was a key part
of how democracy was done

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.125
in ancient Athens.

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:07.522
This machine, this device,
is called a kleroteria.

00:06:07.546 --> 00:06:11.029
It's an ancient Athenian
random-selection device.

00:06:11.053 --> 00:06:14.276
The ancient Athenians
randomly selected citizens

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.400
to fill the vast majority
of their political posts.

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:22.903
They knew that elections
were aristocratic devices.

00:06:22.927 --> 00:06:27.133
They knew that career politicians
were a thing to be avoided.

00:06:27.157 --> 00:06:29.664
And I think we know these things as well.

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:33.481
But more interesting than
the ancient use of random selection
