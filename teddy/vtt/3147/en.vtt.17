00:08:28.062 --> 00:08:30.482
And at some point, we should institute it.

00:08:30.506 --> 00:08:34.784
Perhaps the first step would be
a second chamber in our parliament,

00:08:34.808 --> 00:08:36.982
full of randomly selected people --

00:08:37.006 --> 00:08:39.300
a citizens' senate, if you will.

00:08:39.324 --> 00:08:42.433
There's a campaign
for a citizens' senate in France

00:08:42.457 --> 00:08:44.704
and another campaign in Scotland,

00:08:44.728 --> 00:08:47.807
and it could, of course, be done
right here in Hungary.

00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:52.771
That would be kind of like a Trojan horse
right into the heart of government.

00:08:53.136 --> 00:08:55.117
And then, when it becomes impossible

00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:57.696
to patch over the cracks
in the current system,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.943
we must step up and replace
elections with sortition.
