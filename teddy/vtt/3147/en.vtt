00:00:00.532 --> 00:00:04.054
I want to talk about
one of the big questions,

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:06.612
perhaps the biggest question:

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:08.476
How should we live together?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.951
How should a group of people,
who perhaps live in a city

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:14.134
or in the continent

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:15.442
or even the whole globe,

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.236
share and manage common resources?

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.212
How should we make
the rules that govern us?

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:23.537
This has always been
an important question.

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:26.347
And today, I think
it's even more important than ever

00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:31.481
if we want to address rising inequality,
climate change, the refugee crisis,
