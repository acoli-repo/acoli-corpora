00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.101
and that are, in fact,
happening right now.

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:01.967
We can experiment with sortition.

00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:06.220
We can introduce it to schools
and workplaces and other institutions,

00:08:06.244 --> 00:08:09.331
like Democracy In Practice
is doing in Bolivia.

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:12.553
We can hold policy juries
and citizens' assemblies,

00:08:12.577 --> 00:08:15.611
like the newDemocracy Foundation
is doing in Australia,

00:08:15.635 --> 00:08:18.047
like the Jefferson Center
is doing in the US

00:08:18.071 --> 00:08:21.051
and like the Irish government
is doing right now.

00:08:21.508 --> 00:08:24.404
We could build a social movement
demanding change,

00:08:24.428 --> 00:08:27.635
which is what the Sortition Foundation
is doing in the UK.

00:08:28.062 --> 00:08:30.482
And at some point, we should institute it.
