The fool can't even
separate his recycling."

00:07:01.331 --> 00:07:06.077
But the perhaps surprising
but overwhelming and compelling evidence

00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.022
from all these modern examples

00:07:08.046 --> 00:07:09.990
is that it does work.

00:07:10.014 --> 00:07:14.138
If you give people responsibility,
they act responsibly.

00:07:14.678 --> 00:07:16.934
Don't get me wrong -- it's not a panacea.

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.966
The question is not:
Would this be perfect?

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.141
Of course not.

00:07:21.165 --> 00:07:22.530
People are fallibly human,

00:07:22.554 --> 00:07:25.494
and distorting influences
will continue to exist.

00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:28.576
The question is: Would it be better?

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.228
And the answer to that question,
to me at least, is obviously yes.
