00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:32.157
and get them to make considered,
evidence-based laws

00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:34.221
for the long-term good of everyone.

00:03:34.245 --> 00:03:36.538
Which brings me to my epiphany,

00:03:36.562 --> 00:03:38.197
my moment of enlightenment.

00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:39.753
And I want you to get critical.

00:03:39.777 --> 00:03:42.576
I want you to ask yourselves,
"Why wouldn't this work?"

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.933

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:53.973
And the idea is actually very simple:

00:03:54.537 --> 00:03:57.743
we randomly select people
and put them in parliament.

00:03:58.148 --> 00:03:59.299
(Laughter)

00:03:59.323 --> 00:04:02.006
Let's think about that
for a few more minutes, shall we?
