Come on, there must be one politician
in the audience somewhere.

00:02:32.977 --> 00:02:34.077
(Laughter)

00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:35.251
No.

00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:39.979
But my point is, if liberal democracy
is the end of history,

00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:43.614
then there's a massive paradox
or contradiction here.

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:45.119
Why is that?

00:02:45.143 --> 00:02:48.994
Well, the first question
is about the ideal of democracy,

00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:51.868
and all these qualities
are very appealing.

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:54.361
But in practice, it's not working.

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:56.115
And that's the second question.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.323
Our politics is broken,
our politicians aren't trusted,
