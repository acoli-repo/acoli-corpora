And this guy, you probably know.

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:02.966
Here in Hungary, you lived for many years

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.067
under one attempt to implement
his answer of how to live together.

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:10.965
His answer was brutal, cruel and inhumane.

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:14.498
But a different answer,
a different kind of answer,

00:01:14.522 --> 00:01:18.387
which went more or less
into hibernation for 2,000 years,

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.528
has had profound recent success.

00:01:21.552 --> 00:01:24.036
That answer is, of course, democracy.

00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:28.164
If we take a quick look
at the modern history of democracy,

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:29.823
it goes something like this.

00:01:29.847 --> 00:01:33.140
Along here, we're going
to put the last 200 years.
