00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:33.481
But more interesting than
the ancient use of random selection

00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:35.677
is its modern resurgence.

00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:40.431
The rediscovery of the legitimacy
of random selection in politics

00:06:40.455 --> 00:06:42.319
has become so common lately,

00:06:42.343 --> 00:06:45.029
that there's simply
too many examples to talk about.

00:06:45.053 --> 00:06:47.839
Of course, I'm very aware
that it's going to be difficult

00:06:47.863 --> 00:06:50.490
to institute this in our parliaments.

00:06:50.514 --> 00:06:52.228
Try this -- say to your friend,

00:06:52.252 --> 00:06:56.061
"I think we should populate our parliament
with randomly selected people."

00:06:56.085 --> 00:06:57.250
"Are you joking?

00:06:57.274 --> 00:06:58.808
What if my neighbor gets chosen?

00:06:58.832 --> 00:07:01.307
The fool can't even
separate his recycling."
