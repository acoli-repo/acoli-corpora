00:03:59.323 --> 00:04:02.006
Let's think about that
for a few more minutes, shall we?

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.474
Imagine we chose you and you
and you and you and you down there

00:04:06.498 --> 00:04:08.529
and a bunch of other random people,

00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:11.695
and we put you in our parliament
for the next couple of years.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.988
Of course, we could stratify the selection
to make sure that it matched

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:19.592
the socioeconomic and demographic
profile of the country

00:04:19.616 --> 00:04:22.998
and was a truly representative
sample of people.

00:04:23.022 --> 00:04:25.600
Fifty percent of them would be women.

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:28.434
Many of them would be young,
some would be old,

00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:29.783
a few would be rich,

00:04:29.807 --> 00:04:33.789
but most of them would be
ordinary people like you and me.
