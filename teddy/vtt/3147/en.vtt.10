00:04:59.743 --> 00:05:03.863
The decisions made by these people
would build on the wisdom of crowds.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:06.283
They would become more
than the sum of their parts.

00:05:06.307 --> 00:05:08.331
They would become critical thinkers

00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:10.175
with access to experts,

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.331
who would be on tap but not on top.

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:16.863
And they could prove
that diversity can trump ability

00:05:16.887 --> 00:05:21.747
when confronting the wide array
of societal questions and problems.

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:26.321
It would not be government
by public opinion poll.

00:05:26.855 --> 00:05:30.045
It would not be government by referendum.
