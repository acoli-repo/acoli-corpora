00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.348
It's actually the positive information

00:02:01.348 --> 00:02:03.631
that gets weighted more heavily.

00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.128
Let's go back to that football game.

00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:06.624
If a player scores a goal,

00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:08.292
it ultimately has a stronger impact

00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:10.200
on your impression of their skills

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.959
than if they miss the net.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.902
The two sides of the updating story

00:02:13.902 --> 00:02:16.209
are ultimately quite consistent.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.310
Overall, behaviors that are perceived

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.542
as being less frequent are also the ones

00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:23.379
that people tend to weigh more heavily

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.627
when forming and updating impressions,

00:02:25.627 --> 00:02:26.914
highly immoral actions

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:29.293
and highly competent actions.

00:02:29.293 --> 00:02:32.004
So, what's happening at the level of the brain
