00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.782
pretty much anyone would lend someone their umbrella,

00:03:31.782 --> 00:03:34.452
but the way this guy acted at the football game,

00:03:34.452 --> 00:03:36.297
that was unusual."

00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:39.247
And so, you decide to go with your first impression.

00:03:39.247 --> 00:03:40.985
There's a good moral in this data:

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:43.412
your brain, and by extension you,

00:03:43.412 --> 00:03:44.794
might care more about

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:46.548
the very negative, immoral things

00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:47.792
another person has done

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:50.665
compared to the very positive, moral things,

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:52.194
but it's a direct result

00:03:52.194 --> 00:03:55.693
of the comparative rarity of those bad behaviors.

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:58.329
We're more used to people being basically good,

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.671
like taking time to help a stranger in need.
