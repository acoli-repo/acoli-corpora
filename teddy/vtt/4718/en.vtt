00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.722
Imagine you're at a football game

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:11.206
when this obnoxious guy sits next to you.

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:11.906
He's loud,

00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:13.240
he spills his drink on you,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.995
and he makes fun of your team.

00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:17.226
Days later, you're walking in the park

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:19.823
when suddenly it starts to pour rain.

00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:21.130
Who should show up at your side

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.417
to offer you an umbrella?

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:25.052
The same guy from the football game.

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:26.489
Do you change your mind about him

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.213
based on this second encounter,

00:00:28.213 --> 00:00:29.709
or do you go with your first impression

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:31.907
and write him off?
