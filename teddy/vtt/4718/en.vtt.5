00:02:29.293 --> 00:02:32.004
So, what's happening at the level of the brain

00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:33.874
when we're updating our impressions?

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:35.257
Using fMRI,

00:02:35.257 --> 00:02:37.878
or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging,

00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:39.294
researchers have identified

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:41.478
an extended network of brain regions

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:43.213
that respond to new information

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:46.104
that's inconsistent with initial impressions.

00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:48.296
These include areas typically associated

00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:49.574
with social cognition,

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:50.652
attention,

00:02:50.652 --> 00:02:52.465
and cognitive control.

00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:54.568
Moreover, when updating impressions

00:02:54.568 --> 00:02:56.570
based on people's behaviors,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.709
activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.061
and the superior temporal sulcus
