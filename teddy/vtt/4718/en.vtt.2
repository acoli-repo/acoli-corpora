00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.674
If so, you might choose to avoid him

00:01:01.674 --> 00:01:03.009
the next time you see him.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.293
That said, we can change our impressions

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:07.337
in light of new information.

00:01:07.337 --> 00:01:09.873
Behavioral researchers have identified

00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:12.210
consistent patterns that seem to guide

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.627
this process of impression updating.

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:17.014
On one hand, learning very negative,

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:19.714
highly immoral information about someone

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:21.435
typically has a stronger impact

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:25.521
than learning very positive, highly moral information.

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:27.796
So, unfortunately for our new friend

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:28.821
from the football game,

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.243
his bad behavior at the game
