00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.803
but only because good is more plentiful.

00:04:06.803 --> 00:04:08.828
Think about the last time you judged someone

00:04:08.828 --> 00:04:10.135
based on their behavior,

00:04:10.135 --> 00:04:11.843
especially a time when you really feel

00:04:11.843 --> 00:04:14.270
like you changed your mind about someone.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.720
Was the behavior that caused you

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.899
to update your impression

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.203
something you'd expect anyone to do,

00:04:19.203 --> 00:04:22.398
or was it something totally out of the ordinary?
