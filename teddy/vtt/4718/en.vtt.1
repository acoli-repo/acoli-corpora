00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:31.907
and write him off?

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:34.298
Research in social psychology suggests

00:00:34.298 --> 00:00:37.112
that we're quick to form lasting impressions of others

00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:39.020
based on their behaviors.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.314
We manage to do this with little effort,

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:43.310
inferring stable character traits

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.647
from a single behavior,

00:00:44.647 --> 00:00:45.481
like a harsh word

00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:46.974
or a clumsy step.

00:00:46.974 --> 00:00:48.733
Using our impressions as guides,

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.040
we can accurately predict

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.187
how people are going to behave in the future.

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:54.075
Armed with the knowledge

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:55.462
the guy from the football game

00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:57.293
was a jerk the first time you met him,

00:00:57.293 --> 00:00:59.793
you might expect more of the same down the road.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.674
If so, you might choose to avoid him
