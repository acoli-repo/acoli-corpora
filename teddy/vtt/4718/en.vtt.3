00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.243
his bad behavior at the game

00:01:30.243 --> 00:01:33.070
might outweigh his good behavior at the park.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.628
Research suggests that this bias occurs

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:38.828
because immoral behaviors are more diagnostic,

00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:39.875
or revealing,

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.043
of a person's true character.

00:01:42.043 --> 00:01:43.877
Okay, so by this logic,

00:01:43.877 --> 00:01:46.253
bad is always stronger than good

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:47.923
when it comes to updating.

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:49.754
Well, not necessarily.

00:01:49.754 --> 00:01:51.882
Certain types of learning don't seem to lead

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:54.208
to this sort of negativity bias.

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:57.431
When learning about another person's abilities and competencies,

00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:58.297
for instance,

00:01:58.297 --> 00:01:59.880
this bias flips.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.348
It's actually the positive information
