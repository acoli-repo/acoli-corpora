00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:08.129
The Black Death.

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.214
The 1918 Flu Pandemic.

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:11.507
COVID-19.

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:15.428
We tend to think of these catastrophic, 
world-changing pandemics

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:17.722
as very unlikely events.

00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:20.892
But between 1980 and 2020,

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:24.729
at least three diseases emerged 
that caused global pandemics.

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:29.650
COVID-19, yes, but also 
the 2009 swine flu and HIV/AIDS.

00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:32.320
Disease outbreaks are surprisingly common.
