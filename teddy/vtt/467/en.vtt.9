00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:31.518
and how they can tame them.

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:33.143
Now, to be sure, China and the US

00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:35.434
have very, very different
systems of government,

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.768
which affects what
they're able to do or not.

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:40.601
And many of the root causes
for their economic problems

00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:41.976
are totally different.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.601
But it's no secret
that both countries have problems

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:49.583
with debt, with inequality
and with economic productivity.

00:04:51.042 --> 00:04:53.250
So how come the conversations
are so different?

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:56.018
You could actually ask this question,

00:04:56.042 --> 00:04:58.351
not just about countries,

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:00.684
but about just about everyone.
