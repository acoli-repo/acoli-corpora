00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:32.184
to correct those blind spots.

00:07:32.208 --> 00:07:35.476
I spend a lot of time
talking with people of all walks of life

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.518
about the gray rhinos in their life
and their attitudes.

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:40.101
And you might think

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:42.601
that the people
who are more afraid of risk,

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.309
who are more sensitive to them,

00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:47.768
would be the ones
who would be less open to change.

00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:49.809
But the opposite is actually true.

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:51.143
I've found that the people

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:53.643
who are wiling to recognize
the problems around them

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:55.018
and make plans

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:58.601
are the ones who are able
to tolerate more risk, good risk,

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:01.268
and deal with the bad risk.
