00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:31.184
So we didn't know exactly
what the crisis was going to look like,

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:33.226
not the exact parameters,

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.101
but we could all tell

00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:41.476
that the thing coming at us
was as dangerous, visible and predictable

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.708
as a giant gray rhino
charging right at us.

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:47.809
The black swan lends itself

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:51.708
to the idea that we don't have
power over our futures.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.559
And unfortunately, the less control
that we think we have,

00:02:57.583 --> 00:03:00.684
the more likely we are to downplay it
