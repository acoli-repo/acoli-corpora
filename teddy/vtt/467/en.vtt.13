00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:31.375
So the US has a very
individualist culture -- go it alone.

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.726
And paradoxically,

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.476
this makes many Americans
much less open to change

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.059
and taking good risks.

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:41.018
In China, by contrast,

00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:44.768
people believe that the government
is going to keep problems from happening,

00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:48.226
which might not always be what happens,
but people believe it.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.351
They believe they can rely
on their families,

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:53.393
so that makes them more likely
to take certain risks.

00:06:53.417 --> 00:06:55.018
Like buying Beijing real estate,

00:06:55.042 --> 00:06:58.934
or like being more open about the fact
that they need to change direction,

00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.833
and in fact, the pace of change in China
is absolutely amazing.
