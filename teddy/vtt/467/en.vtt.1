00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:31.309
And in fact,

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:35.059
we're sometimes most likely
to turn away from things

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:39.726
precisely because of the threat
that they represent to us,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.875
in business, life and the world.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:47.417
So I want to give you an example
from my world, economic policy.

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:52.018
So when Alan Greenspan
was head of the Federal Reserve,

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:57.518
his entire job was to watch out
for problems in the US economy

00:00:57.542 --> 00:01:00.268
and to make sure that they
didn't spin out of control.
