00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:01.268
and deal with the bad risk.

00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:04.268
And it's because as we seek information,

00:08:04.292 --> 00:08:08.875
we increase our power to do something
about the things that we're afraid of.

00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:11.809
And that brings me to my third point.

00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:15.226
How much control do you feel that you have

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.208
over the gray rhinos in your life?

00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:20.309
One of the reasons we don't act

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.101
is that we often feel too helpless.

00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:26.059
Think of climate change,
it can feel so big,

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:30.101
that not a single one of us
could make a difference.
