00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:30.101
that not a single one of us
could make a difference.

00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:32.768
So some people go about life denying it.

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:35.976
Other people blame everyone
except themselves.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.933
Like my friend who says
he's not ever going to give up his SUV

00:08:38.957 --> 00:08:41.143
until they stop building
coal plants in China.

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:44.559
But we have an opportunity to change.

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:46.726
No two of us are the same.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.643
Every single one of us has the opportunity
to change our attitudes,

00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:54.393
our own and those of people around us.

00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:57.643
So today, I want to invite all of you

00:08:57.667 --> 00:09:02.351
to join me in helping to spark
an open and honest conversation
