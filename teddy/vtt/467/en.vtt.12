00:06:00.917 --> 00:06:03.601
If you think that someone around you

00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:06.393
is going to help
pick you up when you fall,

00:06:06.417 --> 00:06:09.625
you're much more likely
to see a danger as being smaller.

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:15.226
And that allows us to take
good chances, not just the bad ones.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.643
For example, like risking criticism

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:21.184
when you talk about the danger
that nobody wants you to talk about.

00:06:21.208 --> 00:06:24.101
Or taking the opportunities
that are kind of scary,

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:27.393
so in their own way are gray rhinos.

00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:31.375
So the US has a very
individualist culture -- go it alone.
