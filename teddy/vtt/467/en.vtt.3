00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:30.518
millions and millions of people
lost their homes to foreclosure.

00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:31.809
And at the bottom,

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:35.208
nearly one in 10 Americans
was out of work.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.226
So after things calmed down a little bit,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.976
Greenspan and many others
came out with a postmortem and said,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.042
"Nobody could have predicted that crisis."

00:01:46.792 --> 00:01:49.268
They called it "a black swan."

00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:52.101
Something that was unimaginable,

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:56.125
unforeseeable and completely improbable.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.518
A total surprise.

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:03.434
Except it wasn't always such a surprise.
