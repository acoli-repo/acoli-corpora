And I wonder if we've learned anything
in the last 10 years.

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:03.726
So if you listen
to Washington or Wall Street,

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.542
you could almost be forgiven for thinking
that only smooth sailing laid ahead.

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:14.476
But in China, where I spend a lot of time,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.392
the conversation is totally different.

00:04:17.416 --> 00:04:19.642
The entire economic team,

00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:22.643
all the way up to president
Xi Jinping himself,

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:25.393
talk very specifically and clearly

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:29.268
about financial risks as gray rhinos,

00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:31.518
and how they can tame them.
