00:02:57.583 --> 00:03:00.684
the more likely we are to downplay it

00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:02.708
or ignore it entirely.

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:08.309
And this dangerous dynamic
masks another problem:

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.518
that most of the problems
that we're facing

00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:13.143
are so probable and obvious,

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:16.625
they're things that we can see,
but we still don't do anything about.

00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:20.268
So I created the gray rhino metaphor

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:23.351
to meet what I felt was an urgent need.

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.893
To help us to take a fresh look,

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:28.601
with the same passion
that people had for the black swan,

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:32.476
but this time, for the things
that were highly obvious,
