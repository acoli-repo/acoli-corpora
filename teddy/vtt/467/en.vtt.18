00:08:57.667 --> 00:09:02.351
to join me in helping to spark
an open and honest conversation

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.851
with the people around you,

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:07.226
about the gray rhinos in our world,

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.184
and be brutally honest
about how well we're dealing with them.

00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:13.851
I hear so many times in the States,

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:16.559
"Well, of course we should
deal with obvious problems,

00:09:16.583 --> 00:09:18.643
but if you don't see
what's in front of you,

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:20.809
you're either dumb or ignorant."

00:09:20.833 --> 00:09:24.601
That's what they say,
and I could not disagree more.

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:27.309
If you don't see what's in front of you,

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:30.601
you're not dumb, you're not ignorant,
