00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:32.476
but this time, for the things
that were highly obvious,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.458
highly probable, but still neglected.

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:41.351
Those are the gray rhinos.

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:43.684
Once you start looking for gray rhinos,

00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:46.417
you see them in the headlines every day.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.976
And so what I see in the headlines
is another big gray rhino,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.167
a new highly probable financial crisis.

00:03:56.458 --> 00:04:00.309
And I wonder if we've learned anything
in the last 10 years.
