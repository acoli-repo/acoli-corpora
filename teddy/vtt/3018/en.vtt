00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.481
The one conversation that uplifted me
more than any other in my life

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:08.925
was with a woman who told me

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:10.694
how, a few days earlier,

00:00:10.718 --> 00:00:14.823
she drove her Jeep Wrangler
to the edge of the Grand Canyon

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:17.604
and sat there, revving the engine,

00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:19.365
thinking about driving over.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.377
Even though I had severe social anxiety,

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:26.035
in that conversation,
I was totally at ease.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.560
(Laughter)

00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:30.267
She told me what was going on in her life
