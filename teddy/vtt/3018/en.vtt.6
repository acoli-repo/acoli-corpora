Not, like, Facebook-selfie-with-Lady-Gaga-
at-an-underground-party fun --

00:03:05.174 --> 00:03:07.190
I'm talking about the kind of fun

00:03:07.214 --> 00:03:10.370
where people enjoy
each other's company effortlessly.

00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:12.587
Nobody feels awkward,

00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:17.039
and no one accuses the sad person
of ruining the holidays.

00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:21.971
Why does this chasm even exist?

00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:23.228
On the one side,

00:03:23.252 --> 00:03:25.260

00:03:25.284 --> 00:03:28.545
who may act in off-putting
or confusing ways

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.242
because they're fighting
a war in their head
