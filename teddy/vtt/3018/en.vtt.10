You might fear seeing your shadow.

00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:03.583
Hey, if you have been
successfully outrunning

00:05:03.607 --> 00:05:06.070
your personal emotional demons,

00:05:06.094 --> 00:05:07.865
that's awesome.

00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:10.393
May the wind be at your back.

00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:11.432
(Laughter)

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:15.169
You can be the least
woo-woo person in the world

00:05:15.193 --> 00:05:17.209
and still connect with depressed people.

00:05:18.477 --> 00:05:21.318
Maybe you've heard
that depression is contagious,

00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:23.323
and you're afraid of catching it.

00:05:23.347 --> 00:05:25.359
Bring some hand sanitizer.

00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:26.384
(Laughter)

00:05:26.408 --> 00:05:30.896
You're much more likely to catch
the joy of human bonding.
