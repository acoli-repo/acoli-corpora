00:02:29.793 --> 00:02:31.813
without explaining that they need it

00:02:31.837 --> 00:02:35.906
because they're trapped
in the infinite darkness of their soul

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.962
and they've lost all hope of escape --

00:02:37.986 --> 00:02:38.987
(Laughter)

00:02:39.011 --> 00:02:40.162
again.

00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:43.251
(Laughter)

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:46.405
Depression doesn't diminish
a person's desire

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:48.271
to connect with other people,

00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:49.663
just their ability.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.272
So in spite of what you might think,

00:02:53.296 --> 00:02:55.766
talking to friends and family
living with depression

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.257
can be really easy and maybe even fun.

00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:05.150
