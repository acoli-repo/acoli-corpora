Just be friendly --

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.713
more like Ellen.

00:04:31.737 --> 00:04:35.213
(Laughter)

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:38.540
You may worry that you won't
know what to say,

00:04:38.564 --> 00:04:42.984
and every attempt
at conversation will be awkward,

00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:45.404
and the only time you'll feel comfortable

00:04:45.428 --> 00:04:47.333
is when you both just give up on talking

00:04:47.357 --> 00:04:49.022
and stare at your phones.

00:04:50.304 --> 00:04:54.545
Words are not the most important
thing to focus on.

00:04:55.931 --> 00:05:00.193
You might fear seeing your shadow.
