You don't need to put on a sad voice
because we're depressed --

00:10:00.115 --> 00:10:03.048
you don't sneeze when you're talking
to somebody with a cold.

00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:06.282
(Laughter)

00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:08.848
It's not rude to be upbeat.

00:10:08.872 --> 00:10:11.456
You can be you, OK?

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.377
If you make an offer to be there for us,

00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:17.162
clearly state what you can and can't do.

00:10:17.907 --> 00:10:20.381
I have told people,
"Hey, call or text any time,

00:10:20.405 --> 00:10:23.391
but I might not be able
to get back to you that same day."

00:10:24.221 --> 00:10:27.465
It's totally cool to not make an offer,

00:10:27.489 --> 00:10:31.776
or to make a narrow offer
with really clear boundaries around it.
