00:05:58.518 --> 00:06:02.143
I did eventually stop
discriminating against happy people --

00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:05.271
(Laughter)

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:09.339
I began battling depression
when I was eight,

00:06:09.363 --> 00:06:11.510
and decades later, to my surprise,

00:06:11.534 --> 00:06:13.108
I started winning.

00:06:13.132 --> 00:06:17.097
I shifted from being miserable
much of the time

00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:19.231
to enjoying life.

00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:22.425
I live pretty well
with my bipolar condition,

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.928
and I've overcome some other
mental health conditions

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:28.253
like overeating, addiction
and social anxiety.

00:06:28.634 --> 00:06:32.297
So I live on both sides of this chasm.
