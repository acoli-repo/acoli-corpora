People can be sad and OK at the same time.

00:09:33.819 --> 00:09:36.939
So some of these things may apply
to you personally, some may not.

00:09:36.963 --> 00:09:38.113
Take what's useful.

00:09:38.728 --> 00:09:42.105
And remember, you don't have to connect.

00:09:43.609 --> 00:09:45.119
If you want to,

00:09:45.143 --> 00:09:47.229
here are some suggestions that may help --

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.403
some "dos."

00:09:49.484 --> 00:09:52.358
Talk to us in your natural voice, right?

00:09:52.382 --> 00:09:54.813
(Laughter)

00:09:54.837 --> 00:10:00.091
You don't need to put on a sad voice
because we're depressed --
