affecting 350 million people.

00:02:02.146 --> 00:02:04.042
The National Institute of Mental Health

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:08.717
reports seven percent of Americans
experiencing depression in a year.

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:11.822
So depression is super common,

00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:14.523
yet in my experience,

00:02:14.547 --> 00:02:17.513
most folks don't want
to talk to depressed people

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.378
unless we pretend to be happy.

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:25.031
A cheerful facade is appropriate
for casual interactions.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:29.769
A depressed person can ask for extra syrup
in their pumpkin spice latte

00:02:29.793 --> 00:02:31.813
without explaining that they need it
