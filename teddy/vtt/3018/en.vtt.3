00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:30.145
I identified as somebody
living with depression,

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:31.877
and I felt good about it --

00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:34.019
like I wasn't a bad person for it.

00:01:34.918 --> 00:01:39.069
Now imagine one of the people
at that table was a member of your family

00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:41.003
or a close friend.

00:01:41.027 --> 00:01:43.003
Would you be comfortable talking to them?

00:01:43.447 --> 00:01:45.526
What if instead of the hospital,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.077
they were at your kitchen table

00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:49.016
and told you they were really depressed?

00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:52.622
The World Health Organization

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:59.020
says that depression is the leading cause
of ill health and disability worldwide,

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:02.122
affecting 350 million people.
