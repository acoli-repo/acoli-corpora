00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.308
So I let my friend know I cared,

00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:02.610
and I didn't take it personally.

00:09:03.956 --> 00:09:09.242
Don't let a lack of bubbly
happiness freak you out.

00:09:09.594 --> 00:09:11.175
It's not a shark attack.

00:09:11.648 --> 00:09:14.592
"Call the coast guard, my friend is sad!"

00:09:14.616 --> 00:09:16.278
(Laughter)

00:09:16.302 --> 00:09:20.055
We can be sad and OK at the same time.

00:09:20.835 --> 00:09:22.169
I'm going to say that again,

00:09:22.193 --> 00:09:25.794
because in our society,
we're taught the opposite,

00:09:25.818 --> 00:09:27.933
and so it's counterintuitive.

00:09:28.556 --> 00:09:32.834
People can be sad and OK at the same time.
