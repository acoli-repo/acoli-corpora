And my last suggestion is:

00:11:05.562 --> 00:11:08.403
interact about not depression,

00:11:08.427 --> 00:11:10.553
aka, normal stuff.

00:11:10.577 --> 00:11:14.314
I have a friend who,
when people were worried about him,

00:11:14.338 --> 00:11:17.030
they would call and ask
if he wanted to go shopping

00:11:17.054 --> 00:11:19.385
or help them clean out their garage.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.880
Your depressed friends
