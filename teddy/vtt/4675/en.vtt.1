00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:30.152
To psychologists, learning is a long-term change in behavior

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:32.283
that's based on experience.

00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:34.379
Two of the main types of learning are called

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.021
classical conditioning

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:39.066
and operant, or instrumental, conditioning.

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.969
Let's talk about classical conditioning first.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.505
In the 1890's, a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:48.404
did some really famous experiments on dogs.

00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:49.736
He showed dogs some food

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:51.780
and rang a bell at the same time.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.290
After a while, the dogs would associate the bell with the food.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.942
They would learn that when they heard the bell,

00:00:56.942 --> 00:00:58.420
they would get fed.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.454
Eventually, just ringing the bell
