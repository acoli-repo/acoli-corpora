00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:31.080
We even see operant conditioning

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.121
in some extraordinary situations.

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:36.461
One group of scientists showed the power

00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:37.501
of operant conditioning

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:40.390
by teaching pigeons to be art connoisseurs.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.725
Using food as a positive reinforcer,

00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:44.142
scientists have taught pigeons

00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:46.392
to select paintings by Monet

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.388
over those by Picasso.

00:03:48.388 --> 00:03:50.644
When showed works of other artists,

00:03:50.644 --> 00:03:53.436
scientists observed stimulus generalization

00:03:53.436 --> 00:03:55.229
as the pigeons chose the Impressionists

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.754
over the Cubists.

00:03:56.754 --> 00:03:58.609
Maybe next they'll condition the pigeons

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.535
to paint their own masterpieces.
