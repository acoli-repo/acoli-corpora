00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.454
Eventually, just ringing the bell

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:01.915
made the dogs salivate.

00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:05.461
They learned to expect food at the sound of a bell.

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:07.564
You see, under normal conditions,

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:11.015
the sight and smell of food causes a dog to salivate.

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:13.565
We call the food an unconditioned stimulus,

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:17.564
and we call salivation the unconditioned response.

00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:21.032
Nobody trains a dog to salivate over some steak.

00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:24.313
However, when we pair an unconditioned stimulus like food

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:26.634
with something that was previously neutral,

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:28.202
like the sound of a bell,

00:01:28.202 --> 00:01:31.458
that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus.
