that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:35.086
And so classical conditioning was discovered.

00:01:35.086 --> 00:01:37.463
We see how this works with animals,

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.588
but how does it work with humans?

00:01:39.588 --> 00:01:41.405
In exactly the same way.

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:44.811
Let's say that one day you go to the doctor to get a shot.

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:47.766
She says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit,"

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:51.935

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:54.856
A few weeks later you go to the dentist for a check-up.

00:01:54.856 --> 00:01:56.408
He starts to put a mirror in your mouth

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:57.859
to examine your teeth,

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.324
and he says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit."
