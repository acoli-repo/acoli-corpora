00:02:29.142 --> 00:02:31.478
So how does operant conditioning work?

00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:34.730
There are two main components in operant conditioning:

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.989
reinforcement and punishment.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.777
Reinforcers make it more likely

00:02:38.777 --> 00:02:40.525
that you'll do something again,

00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:42.708
while punishers make it less likely.

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:45.869
Reinforcement and punishment can be positive or negative,

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.134
but this doesn't mean good and bad.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.490
Positive means the addition of a stimulus,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.951
like getting dessert after you finish your veggies,

00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:55.264
and negative means the removal of a stimulus,

00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:56.965
like getting a night of no homework

00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:59.469
because you did well on an exam.

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.176
Let's look at an example of operant conditioning.
