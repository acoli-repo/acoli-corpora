00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.176
Let's look at an example of operant conditioning.

00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:03.995
After eating dinner with your family,

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:06.522
you clear the table and wash the dishes.

00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:08.724
When you're done, your mom gives you a big hug

00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:11.108
and says, "Thank you for helping me."

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.267
In this situation, your mom's response

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:15.896
is positive reinforcement if it makes you more likely

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.689
to repeat the operant response,

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.611
which is to clear the table and wash the dishes.

00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:24.038
Operant conditioning is everywhere in our daily lives.

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:25.533
There aren't many things we do

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:27.473
that haven't been influenced at some point

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.308
by operant conditioning.

00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:31.080
We even see operant conditioning
