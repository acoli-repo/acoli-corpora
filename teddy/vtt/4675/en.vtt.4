00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.324
and he says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit."

00:02:01.324 --> 00:02:03.747
Even though you know the mirror won't hurt,

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:05.195
you jump out of the chair and run,

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:06.924
screaming from the room.

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:08.604
When you went to get a shot,

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:10.852
the words, "This won't hurt a bit,"

00:02:10.852 --> 00:02:12.467
became a conditioned stimulus

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.628
when they were paired with pain of the shot,

00:02:14.628 --> 00:02:16.637
the unconditioned stimulus,

00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:18.798
which was followed by your conditioned response

00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:21.270
of getting the heck out of there.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.008
Classical conditioning in action.

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:26.267
Operant conditioning explains how consequences

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:29.142
lead to changes in voluntary behavior.

00:02:29.142 --> 00:02:31.478
So how does operant conditioning work?
