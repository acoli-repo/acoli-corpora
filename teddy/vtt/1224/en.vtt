The north coast of California has rainforests --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
temperate rainforests -- where it can rain more than 100 inches a year.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The range of the species goes up to as much as 380 feet tall.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's 38 stories tall.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan.
