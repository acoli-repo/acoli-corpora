00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:01.530
and we'll use that tablecloth
to examine it.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.348
As you scan its squares,

00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:06.267
a distant memory swims up
from deep within your brain.

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:07.487
According to the theory,

00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:09.202
this is because memories are stored

00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:10.604
in the form of holograms,

00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:11.719
and in holograms,

00:02:11.743 --> 00:02:14.200
you only need one fragment
to see the whole picture.

00:02:14.224 --> 00:02:17.252
Your brain has identified the tablecloth
with one from the past,

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:18.991
maybe from your grandmother's house.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:22.837
However, instead of remembering
that you've seen it at your grandmother's,

00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:24.830
your brain has summoned up the old memory

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:26.448
without identifying it.

00:02:26.472 --> 00:02:29.796
This leaves you stuck with familiarity,
but no recollection.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.968
Although you've never been
in this restaurant,
