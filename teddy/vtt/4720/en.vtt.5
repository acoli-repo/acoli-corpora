00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.968
Although you've never been
in this restaurant,

00:02:31.992 --> 00:02:35.306
you've seen that tablecloth
but are just failing to identify it.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.601
Now, look at this fork.

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:38.015
Are you paying attention?

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.144
Our last theory is divided attention,

00:02:40.168 --> 00:02:41.988
and it states that déjà vu occurs

00:02:42.012 --> 00:02:44.430
when our brain subliminally
takes in an environment

00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:47.180
while we're distracted
by one particular object.

00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:48.490
When our attention returns,

00:02:48.514 --> 00:02:50.324
we feel as if we've been here before.

00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:52.452
For example, just now
you focused on the fork

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:55.112
and didn't observe the tablecloth
or the falling waiter.

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:57.430
Although your brain has been
recording everything

00:02:57.454 --> 00:02:58.694
in your peripheral vision,

00:02:58.718 --> 00:03:00.933
it's been doing so
below conscious awareness.
