00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:00.441
more than 40 theories attempt
to explain this phenomenon.

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:04.738
Still, recent advancements in neuroimaging
and cognitive psychology

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:06.641
narrow down the field of prospects.

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:09.704
Let's walk through three of today's
more prevalent theories,

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:11.806
using the same
restaurant setting for each.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.734
First up is dual processing.

00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:14.762
We'll need an action.

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:17.371
Let's go with a waiter
dropping a tray of dishes.

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:18.587
As the scene unfolds,

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.691
your brain's hemispheres process
a flurry of information:

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:23.207
the waiter's flailing arms,

00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:24.249
his cry for help,

00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:25.751
the smell of pasta.

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:28.870
Within milliseconds, this information
zips through pathways

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:31.289
and is processed into a single moment.
