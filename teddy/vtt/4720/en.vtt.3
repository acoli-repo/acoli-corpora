WEBVTT

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:31.289
and is processed into a single moment.

00:01:31.313 --> 00:01:33.866
Most of the time,
everything is recorded in-sync.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.250
However, this theory asserts

00:01:35.274 --> 00:01:37.996
that déjà vu occurs
when there's a slight delay

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.297
in information from one of these pathways.

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:41.798
The difference in arrival times

00:01:41.822 --> 00:01:44.179
causes the brain to interpret
the late information

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:45.742
as a separate event.

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:48.018
When it plays
over the already-recorded moment,

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.759
it feels as if it's happened before

00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:51.980
because, in a sense, it has.

00:01:52.908 --> 00:01:55.349
Our next theory deals
with a confusion of the past

00:01:55.373 --> 00:01:57.403
rather than a mistake in the present.

00:01:57.427 --> 00:01:59.237
This is the hologram theory,

00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:01.530
and we'll use that tablecloth
to examine it.
