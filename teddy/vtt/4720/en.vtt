00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:08.266
Have you experienced déjà vu?

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.540
It's that shadowy feeling you get
when a situation seems familiar.

00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:15.527
A scene in a restaurant plays out
exactly as you remember.

00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:18.335
The world moves like a ballet
you've choreographed,

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.836
but the sequence can't be based
on a past experience

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.376
because you've never eaten here before.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.305
This is the first time you've had clams,

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.737
so what's going on?

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:30.462
Unfortunately, there isn't
one single explanation for déjà vu.
