00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:30.462
Unfortunately, there isn't
one single explanation for déjà vu.

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:33.112
The experience is brief
and occurs without notice,

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:36.686
making it nearly impossible
for scientists to record and study it.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.069
Scientists can't simply sit around
and wait for it to happen to them --

00:00:40.093 --> 00:00:41.199
this could take years.

00:00:41.223 --> 00:00:43.341
It has no physical manifestations

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:44.553
and in studies,

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.543
it's described by the subject
as a sensation or feeling.

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.389
Because of this lack of hard evidence,

00:00:49.413 --> 00:00:52.382
there's been a surplus
of speculation over the years.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:54.724
Since Emile Boirac introduced déjà vu

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:57.059
as a French term meaning "already seen,"

00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:00.441
more than 40 theories attempt
to explain this phenomenon.
