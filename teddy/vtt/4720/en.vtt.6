00:02:58.718 --> 00:03:00.933
it's been doing so
below conscious awareness.

00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:03.300
When you finally pull yourself
away from the fork,

00:03:03.324 --> 00:03:05.707
you think you've been here before
because you have,

00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:07.355
you just weren't paying attention.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.729
While all three of these theories
share the common features of déjà vu,

00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:13.005
none of them propose to be
the conclusive source

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:14.142
of the phenomenon.

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:16.546
Still, while we wait
for researchers and inventers

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.348
to come up with new ways
to capture this fleeting moment,

00:03:19.372 --> 00:03:21.403
we can study the moment ourselves.

00:03:21.998 --> 00:03:25.480
After all, most studies of déjà vu
are based on first-hand accounts,

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:27.319
so why can't one be yours?

00:03:27.343 --> 00:03:30.703
The next time you get déjà vu,
take a moment to think about it.
