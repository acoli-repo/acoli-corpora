I mean, Taiwan did it so beautifully,

00:09:31.077 --> 00:09:33.149
Iceland did it so beautifully, Germany,

00:09:33.173 --> 00:09:34.649
all with different strategies,

00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:36.109
South Korea.

00:09:36.133 --> 00:09:39.672
It really requires competent governance,

00:09:39.696 --> 00:09:42.100
a sense of seriousness,

00:09:42.124 --> 00:09:46.671
and listening to the scientists,
not the politicians following the virus.

00:09:46.695 --> 00:09:48.712
Of course we can do this.

00:09:48.736 --> 00:09:49.998
Let me remind everybody --

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:51.998
this is not the zombie apocalypse,

00:09:52.022 --> 00:09:54.760
it's not a mass extinction event.

00:09:54.784 --> 00:10:00.820
You know, 98, 99 percent of us
are going to get out of this alive.
