00:06:58.324 --> 00:07:00.855
But so many of the patients
have blood in their urine

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.045
from kidney disease,

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:03.911
they have gastroenteritis,

00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:06.847
they certainly have
heart failure very often,

00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:10.864
we know that it affects taste and smell,
the olfactory nerves,

00:07:10.888 --> 00:07:13.283
we know, of course, about the lung.

00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:14.514
The question I have:

00:07:14.538 --> 00:07:17.537
is there any organ
that it does not affect?

00:07:17.887 --> 00:07:19.363
And in that sense,

00:07:19.387 --> 00:07:22.053
it reminds me all too much of smallpox.

00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:26.442
CA: So we're in a mess.

00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:28.666
What's the way forward from here?

00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:31.846
LB: Well, the way forward
is still the same.
