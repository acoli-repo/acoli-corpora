may not give us the long-term immunity --

00:13:31.012 --> 00:13:32.948
that something like smallpox would do.

00:13:32.972 --> 00:13:36.895

where we add adjuvants

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:42.355
that actually make the vaccine
create better immunity

00:13:42.379 --> 00:13:43.585
than the disease,

00:13:43.609 --> 00:13:46.680
so that we can confer immunity
for many years.

00:13:46.704 --> 00:13:48.728
That's going to take a little longer.

we granted you a wish,

00:13:56.716 --> 00:14:00.398
and you wished the world would create
this pandemic preparedness system
