00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:01.273
We need to slow down
the speed of this virus,

00:08:01.297 --> 00:08:03.480
which is why we do social distancing.

00:08:03.504 --> 00:08:04.654
Just to be clear --

00:08:04.678 --> 00:08:06.997
flattening the curve, social distancing,

00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:10.791
it doesn't change
the absolute number of cases,

00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:14.688
but it changes what could be
a Mount Fuji-like peak

00:08:14.712 --> 00:08:16.165
into a pulse,

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:20.885
and then we won't also lose people
because of competition for hospital beds,

00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:24.823
people who have heart attacks,
need chemotherapy, difficult births,

00:08:24.847 --> 00:08:26.792
can get into the hospital,

00:08:26.816 --> 00:08:29.522
and we can use the scarce
resources we have,

00:08:29.546 --> 00:08:31.514
especially in the developing world,
