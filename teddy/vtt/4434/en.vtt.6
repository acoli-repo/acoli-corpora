00:02:55.046 --> 00:03:00.220
I'd give a B to South Korea
and to Germany.

00:03:00.244 --> 00:03:01.394
And in between ...

00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:05.085
So it's a very heterogeneous
response, I think.

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.974
The world as a whole is faltering.

00:03:07.998 --> 00:03:11.960
We shouldn't be proud
of what's happening right now.

00:03:12.974 --> 00:03:15.752
CA: I mean, we got
the detection pretty early,

00:03:15.776 --> 00:03:19.873
or at least some doctors in China
got the detection pretty early.

00:03:21.048 --> 00:03:24.493
LB: Earlier than the 2002 SARS,
which took six months.

00:03:24.517 --> 00:03:27.164
This took about six weeks.

00:03:27.188 --> 00:03:29.410
And detection means not only finding it,

00:03:29.434 --> 00:03:30.664
but knowing what it is.
