00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.073
people talk about it being 2.2, 2.4.

00:05:00.097 --> 00:05:02.819
But a really important paper
three weeks ago,

00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:07.946
in the "Emerging Infectious
Diseases" journal came out,

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.406
suggesting that looking back
on the Wuhan data,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.136
it's really 5.7.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.359
So for argument's sake,

00:05:13.383 --> 00:05:16.437
let's say that the virus is moving
at exponential speed

00:05:16.461 --> 00:05:20.279
and the exponent
is somewhere between 2.2 and 5.7.

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:22.268
The other two factors that matter

00:05:22.292 --> 00:05:25.347
are the incubation period
or the generation time.

00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:26.530
The longer that is,

00:05:26.554 --> 00:05:29.918
the slower the pandemic appears to us.

00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:33.037
When it's really short,
like six days, it moves like lightning.
