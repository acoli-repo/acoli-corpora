00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:00.270
CA: I mean, none of the numbers
that you've mentioned so far

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:05.277
are in themselves different
from any other infections in recent years.

00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.441
What is the combination
that has made this so deadly?

00:06:09.464 --> 00:06:11.380
LB: Well, it is exactly the combination

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:15.337
of the short incubation period
and the high transmissibility.

00:06:15.648 --> 00:06:21.585
But you know, everybody on this call
has known somebody who has the disease.

00:06:21.609 --> 00:06:24.982
Sadly, many have lost a loved one.

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:28.602
This is a terrible disease
when it is serious.

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:31.891
And I get calls from doctors
in emergency rooms
