00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:31.838
Larry, so good to see you.

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:34.037
Larry Brilliant: Thank you,
nice to see you.

00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:37.092
CA: Larry, in that talk,

00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:39.863
you showed a video clip
that was a simulation

00:00:39.887 --> 00:00:42.578
of what a pandemic might look like.

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:45.902
I would like to play it --
this gave me chills.

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:49.728
Larry Brilliant (TED2006):
Let me show you a simulation

00:00:49.752 --> 00:00:52.493
of what a pandemic looks like,

00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:54.496
so we know what we're talking about.

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:58.838
Let's assume, for example,
that the first case occurs in South Asia.
