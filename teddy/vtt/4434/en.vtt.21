00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:31.466
LB: Well, smallpox
had an R0 of 3.5 to 4.5,

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.500
so that's probably about what I think
this COVID will be.

00:10:35.524 --> 00:10:38.072
But it killed a third of the people.

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:39.445
But we had a vaccine.

00:10:39.469 --> 00:10:43.190
So those are the different
sets that you have.

00:10:43.214 --> 00:10:44.907
But what I'm mostly worried about,

00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:46.796
and the reason that we made "Contagion"

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.868
and that was a fictional virus --

00:10:48.892 --> 00:10:51.125
I repeat, for those of you watching,

00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:52.315
that's fiction.

00:10:52.339 --> 00:10:56.172
We created a virus that killed
a lot more than this one did.

00:10:56.196 --> 00:10:58.561
CA: You're talking
about the movie "Contagion"

00:10:58.585 --> 00:11:00.863
that's been trending on Netflix.
