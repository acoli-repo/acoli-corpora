You know, when you have a pandemic,

00:02:00.764 --> 00:02:04.851
something moving at exponential speed,

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:08.077
if you miss the first two weeks,
if you're late the first two weeks,

00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:11.553
it's not the deaths and the illness
from the first two weeks you lose,

00:02:11.577 --> 00:02:13.577
it's the two weeks at the peak.

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.593
Those are prevented if you act early.

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:20.220
Early response is critical,

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:22.822
early detection is a condition precedent.

00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:25.840
CA: And how would you grade the world

00:02:25.864 --> 00:02:29.543
on its early detection,
early response to COVID-19?
