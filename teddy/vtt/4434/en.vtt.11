00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:33.037
When it's really short,
like six days, it moves like lightning.

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:35.110
And then the last,
and the most important --

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:36.546
and it's often overlooked --

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.712
is the density of susceptibles.

00:05:38.736 --> 00:05:40.434
This is a novel virus,

00:05:40.458 --> 00:05:44.069
so we want to know how many customers
could it potentially have.

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:47.244
And as it's novel,
that's eight billion of us.

00:05:47.268 --> 00:05:49.037
The world is facing a virus

00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:52.093
that looks at all of us
like equally susceptible.

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:54.149
Doesn't matter our color, our race,

00:05:54.173 --> 00:05:55.640
or how wealthy we are.

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:00.270
CA: I mean, none of the numbers
that you've mentioned so far
