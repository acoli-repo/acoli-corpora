00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:31.891
And I get calls from doctors
in emergency rooms

00:06:31.915 --> 00:06:35.848
and treating people in ICUs
all over the world,

00:06:35.872 --> 00:06:37.410
and they all say the same thing:

00:06:37.434 --> 00:06:41.442
"How do I choose who is going to live
and who is going to die?

00:06:41.466 --> 00:06:44.925
I have so few tools to deal with."

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:46.913
It's a terrifying disease,

00:06:46.937 --> 00:06:50.132
to die alone with a ventilator
in your lungs,

00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:53.211
and it's a disease
that affects all of our organs.

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:55.283
It's a respiratory disease --

00:06:55.307 --> 00:06:56.680
perhaps misleading.

00:06:56.704 --> 00:06:58.300
Makes you think of a flu.

00:06:58.324 --> 00:07:00.855
But so many of the patients
have blood in their urine
