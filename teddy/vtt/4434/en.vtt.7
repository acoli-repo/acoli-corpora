00:03:29.434 --> 00:03:30.664
but knowing what it is.

00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:34.204
So I would give us
a pretty good score on that.

00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:37.170
The transparency, the communication --
those are other issues.

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.607
CA: So what was the key mistake

00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:45.868
that you think the countries
you gave an F to made?

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.521
LB: I think fear,

00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:52.656
political incompetence, interference,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.014
not taking it seriously soon enough --

00:03:55.038 --> 00:03:57.260
it's pretty human.

00:03:57.284 --> 00:03:58.706
I think throughout history,

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.933
pretty much every pandemic
is first viewed with denial and doubt.
