00:14:57.465 --> 00:15:01.663
We're in our nationalistic
kind of barricades.

00:15:01.687 --> 00:15:05.346
We will not be able to conquer a pandemic

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.752
unless we believe
we're all in it together.

00:15:07.776 --> 00:15:11.903
This is not some Age of Aquarius,
or Kumbaya statement,

00:15:11.927 --> 00:15:15.160
this is what a pandemic
forces us to realize.

00:15:15.184 --> 00:15:16.938
We are all in it together,

00:15:16.962 --> 00:15:20.391
we need a global solution
to a global problem.

00:15:20.415 --> 00:15:23.015
Anything less than that is unthinkable.

00:15:24.153 --> 00:15:26.293
