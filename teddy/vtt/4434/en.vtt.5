LB: Of course, you gave me
this question earlier,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.029
so I've been thinking a lot about it.

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:37.014
I think I would go through the countries,

00:02:37.038 --> 00:02:38.911
and I've actually made a list.

00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:44.641
I think the island republics of Taiwan,
Iceland and certainly New Zealand

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:45.815
would get an A.

00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:49.807
The island republic of the UK
and the United States --

00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:53.545
which is not an island,
no matter how much we may think we are --

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.022
would get a failing grade.

00:02:55.046 --> 00:03:00.220
I'd give a B to South Korea
and to Germany.
