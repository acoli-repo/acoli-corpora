00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:09.426
Then there will be secondary outbreaks.

00:01:09.942 --> 00:01:13.450
And the disease will spread
from country to country so fast

00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:15.674
that you won't know what hit you.

00:01:16.228 --> 00:01:19.635
Within three weeks,
it will be everywhere in the world.

00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.969
Now if we had an undo button,

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:24.937

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.484
if we could find it early
and we had early detection
