00:08:29.546 --> 00:08:31.514
especially in the developing world,

00:08:31.538 --> 00:08:32.713
to treat people.

00:08:32.737 --> 00:08:34.728
So slow down,

00:08:34.752 --> 00:08:37.141
slow down the speed of the epidemic,

00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:40.720
and then in the troughs, in between waves,

00:08:40.744 --> 00:08:43.766
jump on, double down, step on it,

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.639
and find every case,

00:08:45.663 --> 00:08:46.989
trace every contact,

00:08:47.013 --> 00:08:48.251
test every case,

00:08:48.275 --> 00:08:51.902
and then only quarantine
the ones who need to be quarantined,

00:08:51.926 --> 00:08:54.622
and do that until we have a vaccine.

00:08:56.232 --> 00:08:59.859
CA: So it sounds like we have to get
past the stage of just mitigation,

00:08:59.883 --> 00:09:03.144
where we're just trying
to take a general shutdown,
