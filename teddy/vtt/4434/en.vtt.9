What do you think the scientific consensus
is going to likely end up being

00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:35.553
on, like, the two key numbers

00:04:35.577 --> 00:04:39.579
of its infectiousness
and its fatality rate?

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:44.422
LB: So I think the kind of
equation to keep in mind

00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:48.260
is that the virus moves
dependent on three major issues.

00:04:48.284 --> 00:04:50.156
One is the R0,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.728
the first number of secondary cases
that there are when the virus emerges.

00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:56.736
In this case,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.073
people talk about it being 2.2, 2.4.
