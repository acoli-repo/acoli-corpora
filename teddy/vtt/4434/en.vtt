Helen Walters: So, Chris, who's up first?

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.357
Chris Anderson: Well, we have a man
who's worried about pandemics

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.181
pretty much his whole life.

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:11.474
He played an absolutely key role,
more than 40 years ago,

00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:15.458
in helping the world get rid
of the scourge of smallpox.

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.474
And in 2006,

00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:20.831
he came to TED to warn the world

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:24.871
of the dire risk of a global pandemic,

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:26.440
and what we might do about it.

00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:29.265
So please welcome here
Dr. Larry Brilliant.
