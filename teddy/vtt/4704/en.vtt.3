00:01:29.618 --> 00:01:31.978
Arms closer, spin faster.

00:01:31.978 --> 00:01:34.710
Arms farther, spin slower.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.784
Spin causes other effects, too.

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:38.451
If you are riding on a spinning merry-go-round

00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:40.176
and you toss a ball to a friend,

00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:42.514
it will appear to follow a curving path.

00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:44.628
It doesn't actually curve, though.

00:01:44.628 --> 00:01:46.601
It really goes in a straight line.

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.049
You were the one who was following a curving path,

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.582
but, from your point of view,

00:01:50.582 --> 00:01:52.477
the ball appears to curve.

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:54.934
We call this the coriolis effect.

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:57.156
Oh, and you are riding on a speeding merry-go-round

00:01:57.156 --> 00:01:59.175
right now at this very moment.

00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:00.676
We call it the Earth.
