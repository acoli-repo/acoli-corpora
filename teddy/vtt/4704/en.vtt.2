00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:01.954
If an ice skater is gliding across the ice

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:04.552
in straight-line motion and she pulls her arms in,

00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:06.930
she keeps on gliding at the same speed.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.559
But if she is spinning on the ice

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:09.849
and she pulls her arms in,

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:11.679
you know what happens next.

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:13.420
She spins faster.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.024
This is called the conservation of angular momentum.

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:20.614
Mathematically, angular momentum is a product of two numbers,

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:21.949
one that gives the spin rate

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:24.911
and one that gives the distance of the mass from the axis.

00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:26.665
If something is freely spinning,

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:28.095
as one number gets bigger,

00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:29.618
the other gets smaller.

00:01:29.618 --> 00:01:31.978
Arms closer, spin faster.
