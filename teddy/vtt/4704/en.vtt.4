00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:00.676
We call it the Earth.

00:02:00.676 --> 00:02:03.578
The Earth spins on its axis once each day.

00:02:03.578 --> 00:02:05.024
But why does the Earth spin?

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:08.118
Now, that's a story that starts billions of years ago.

00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:09.856
A cloud of dust and gas that form

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:11.070
the Sun and the Earth and the planets

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.113
and you and me

00:02:12.113 --> 00:02:15.032
started to collapse as gravity pulled it all together.

00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:16.678
Before it started to collapse,

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:19.175
this cloud had a very gentle spin.

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:20.490
And, as it collapsed,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.619
like that ice skater pulling her arms in,

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.631
the spin got faster and faster.

00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:26.680
And everything that formed out of the cloud,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.308
the Sun

00:02:27.308 --> 00:02:28.820
and the planets around the Sun

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.503
and the moons around the planets,
