00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.213
If there's a region of low pressure in the atmosphere,

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:02.243
air is pushed toward it,

00:03:02.243 --> 00:03:04.106
like water going down a drain.

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:06.227
But the air curves to the right as it goes,

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.496
and this gives it a spin.

00:03:08.496 --> 00:03:10.594
With the dramatic low pressure in a storm,

00:03:10.594 --> 00:03:12.517
the air gets pulled in tighter and tighter,

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:14.433
so it gets going faster and faster,

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:18.325
and this is how we get the high winds of a hurricane.

00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:20.466
So, when you see a spinning storm on a weather report,

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:21.816
think about this:

00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:24.856
The spin ultimately came from the spin of the Earth,

00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:26.350
and the Earth's spin is a remnant,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.529
a fossil relic,

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.283
of the gentle spin of the cloud of dust and gas
