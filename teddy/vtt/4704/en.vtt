00:00:15.173 --> 00:00:17.464
The next time you see a news report of a hurricane

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:18.674
or a tropical storm

00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:21.281
showing high winds battering trees and houses,

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:24.555
ask yourself, "How did the wind get going so fast?"

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:26.849
Amazingly enough, this is a motion that started

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.934
more than five billion years ago.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:32.331
But, to understand why, we need to understand spin.
