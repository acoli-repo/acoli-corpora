00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:32.331
But, to understand why, we need to understand spin.

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.665
In physics, we talk about two types of motion.

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:36.441
The first is straight-line motion.

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:38.735
You push on something, and it moves forward.

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:42.072
The second type, spin, involves an object rotating,

00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:44.534
or turning on its axis in place.

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:46.918
An object in straight-line motion will move forever

00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:47.869
unless something,

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:49.755
like the friction of the ground beneath it,

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:52.040
causes it to slow down and stop.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.576
The same thing happens when you get something spinning.

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:57.587
It will keep on spinning until something stops it.

00:00:57.587 --> 00:00:59.673
But the spin can speed up.

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:01.954
