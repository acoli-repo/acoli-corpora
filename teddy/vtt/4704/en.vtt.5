00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.503
and the moons around the planets,

00:02:30.503 --> 00:02:32.592
all inherited this spin.

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:35.635
And this inherited spin is what gives us night and day.

00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:38.638
And this day-night cycle is what drives our weather.

00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:40.442
The Earth is warm on the daytime side,

00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:42.108
cool on the nighttime side,

00:02:42.108 --> 00:02:44.563
and it's warmer at the equator than at the poles.

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:46.022
The differences in temperature

00:02:46.022 --> 00:02:47.778
make differences in air pressure,

00:02:47.778 --> 00:02:49.003
and the differences in air pressure

00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:50.313
make air move.

00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:51.652
They make the wind blow.

00:02:51.652 --> 00:02:53.027
But, because the Earth spins,

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:54.571
the moving air curves to the right

00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:55.908
in the Northern Hemisphere

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:58.840
because of the coriolis effect.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.213
If there's a region of low pressure in the atmosphere,
