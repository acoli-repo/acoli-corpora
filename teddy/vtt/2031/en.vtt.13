00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It turns out that a lot of dolphins

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
are being sold as meat

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
in the whale meat market around the world.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
That's a tragedy for those populations,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but it's also a tragedy

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
for the people eating them

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
because they don't know that that's toxic meat.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
We had these data a few years ago.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I remember sitting at my desk

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
being about the only person in the world

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
ever allowed by the EPA.
