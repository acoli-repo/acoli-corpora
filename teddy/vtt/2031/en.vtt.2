00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We piled enormous amounts of pollution

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
into the air and into the water.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Rolf Bolin, who was a professor

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
wrote in the 1940s that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
"The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
were so bad they turned

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
lead-based paints black."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
People working in these canneries

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
could barely stay there all day because of the smell,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but you know what they came out saying?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
They say, "You know what you smell?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You smell money."

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That pollution was money to that community,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and those people dealt with the pollution
