00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
ever allowed by the EPA.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
"Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery,"

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
but it was so awful.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And for the very first time in my scientific career,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I broke scientific protocol,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and then begin to talk about them.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
We sent a very polite letter

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to the Minister of Health in Japan

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and simply pointed out that

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
this is an intolerable situation, not for us,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but for the people of Japan
