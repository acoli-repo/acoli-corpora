00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and overfill onto our beaches.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Often what jams us up is sewage.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
where you had a big sign at the front saying,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000

being swamped by human sewage,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000

They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
It's not just a question of cleanliness;
