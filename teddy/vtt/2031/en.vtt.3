00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and those people dealt with the pollution

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
because they needed the money.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and we made them unhealthy.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The connection between ocean health and human health

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is actually based upon another couple simple adages,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and I want to call that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
"pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The pyramid of ocean life ...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
we look at the ocean in a very different way,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean
