00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
to lock into people's notion

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
that the ocean

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and the health of the ocean ecosystem

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
were just as important to the economy of this area

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000

Well, I want to leave you with the thought that

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
what we're really trying to do here

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
is protect this ocean pyramid,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and that ocean pyramid

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
connects to our own pyramid of life.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
It's an ocean planet,
