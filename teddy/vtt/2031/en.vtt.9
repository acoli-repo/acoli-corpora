00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that have PCBs from the plankton,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and those PCBs, being fat-soluble,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
accumulate in these dolphins.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Now, a dolphin,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
mother dolphin, any dolphin --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
there's only one way

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that a PCB can get out of a dolphin.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And what's that?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
In mother's milk.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Here's a diagram of the PCB load

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
of dolphins in Sarasota Bay.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Adult males: a huge load.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Juveniles: a huge load.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Females after their first calf is already weaned:

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
a lower load.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Those females, they're not trying to.
