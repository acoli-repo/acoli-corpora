00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
their breast milk

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
because of the accumulation of these toxins

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
in their food chain,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
in their part of the world's

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
ocean pyramid.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
That means their immune systems are compromised.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It means that their children's development

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
can be compromised.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And the world's attention on this over the last decade

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
has reduced the problem

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
for these women,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
not by changing the pyramid,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
but by changing what they particularly eat out of it.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
We've taken them out of their natural pyramid

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
in order to solve this problem.
