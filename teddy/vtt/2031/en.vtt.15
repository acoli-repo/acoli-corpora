00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but for the people of Japan

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
because mothers who may be breastfeeding,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
who may have young children,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
would be buying something that they thought was healthy,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
but it was really toxic.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and I'm really proud to say that at this point,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that's labeled incorrectly,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
even though they're still selling whale meat,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
which I believe they shouldn't.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
But at least it's labeled correctly,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and you're no longer going to be buying

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
toxic dolphin meat instead.
