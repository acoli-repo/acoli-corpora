00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
in order to solve this problem.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
That's a good thing for this particular acute problem,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in the base of that food pyramid,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
it can back up all through it.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We end up with things we've heard about before:

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
red tides, for example,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
which are blooms of toxic algae

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
floating through the oceans

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
causing neurological damage.
