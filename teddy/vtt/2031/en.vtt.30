00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
connects to our own pyramid of life.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
It's an ocean planet,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
but the pyramid of life in the ocean

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and our own lives on land

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
are intricately connected.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And it's only through having the ocean being healthy

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
that we can remain healthy ourselves.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
