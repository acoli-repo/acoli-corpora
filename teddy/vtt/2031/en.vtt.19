00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
causing neurological damage.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
We can also see blooms of bacteria,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
blooms of viruses in the ocean.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and a bacteria

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in the genus vibrio,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
which includes the genus that has cholera in it.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
How many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Why does that happen?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
It happens because we have jammed so much

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
into the base of the natural ocean pyramid

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that these bacteria clog it up

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and overfill onto our beaches.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Often what jams us up is sewage.
