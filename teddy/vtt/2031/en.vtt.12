00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and use it to genetically test the DNA

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
out of whale meat samples

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and identify what they really were.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
That's another story.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
But some of them were not whale meat at all.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And those dolphin parts

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
had a huge load of PCBs,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
dioxins and heavy metals.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And that huge load was passing into the people

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
that ate this meat.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It turns out that a lot of dolphins
