00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We know that, right? We've experienced that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And if we just take that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we build from there,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
then we can go to the next step,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which is that if the ocean ain't happy,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
ain't nobody happy.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's the theme of my talk.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Cannery Row, at the time,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
had the biggest industrial

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
canning operation on the west coast.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We piled enormous amounts of pollution

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
into the air and into the water.
