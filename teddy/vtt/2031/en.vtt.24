00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
of cholera into human communities,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
brought there, not by

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
a normal human vector,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
but by a marine vector, this copepod.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Copepods are small crustaceans.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
They're a tiny fraction of an inch long,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and they can carry on their little legs

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
some of the cholera bacteria

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
that then leads to human disease.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
That has sparked cholera epidemics

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
in ports along the world

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and has led to increased concentration

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
on trying to make sure shipping

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
doesn't move these

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
vectors of cholera around the world.
