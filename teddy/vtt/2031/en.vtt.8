00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and instead of accumulating,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
they will just pass into our group here

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and not accumulate in any one group

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
because they're absorbed by us.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And that's the difference between a PCB

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and, say, something natural like an omega-3,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
something we want out of the marine food chain.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
PCBs accumulate.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We have great examples of that, unfortunately.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
PCBs accumulate in dolphins

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
in Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They get into the food chain.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
The dolphins eat the fish

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that have PCBs from the plankton,
