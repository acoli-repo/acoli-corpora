00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and you're no longer going to be buying

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
toxic dolphin meat instead.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It isn't just there that this happens,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
but in a natural diet of some communities

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
in the Canadian arctic and in the United States

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and in the European arctic,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
a natural diet of seals and whales

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
leads to an accumulation of PCBs

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
that have gathered up from all parts of the world

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and ended up in these women.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
These women have toxic breast milk.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
They cannot feed their offspring, their children,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
their breast milk

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
because of the accumulation of these toxins
