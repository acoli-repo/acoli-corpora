00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
because when an ecologist looks at the ocean,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
we see all those interconnections.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We see the base of the food chain,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the plankton, the small things,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and we see how those animals

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and on so up this diagram.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And that flow, that flow of life,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
from the very base up to the very top,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is the flow that ecologists see.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And that's what we're trying to preserve

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
when we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's that pyramid.
