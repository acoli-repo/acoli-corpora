00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
(Laughter)

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
There's no mechanism in this game

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
for them to go anywhere but into

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
a bigger and bigger pile

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And that's exactly what happens with PDBs

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
in this food pyramid:

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
They accumulate into the top of it.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Now suppose, instead of Styrofoam peanuts,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
we take these lovely little chocolates that we get

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and we had those instead.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
instead of passing them around,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and instead of accumulating,
