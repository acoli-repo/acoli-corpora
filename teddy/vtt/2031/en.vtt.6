00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Imagine that when we got on this boat,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
we were all given

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
two Styrofoam peanuts.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Can't do much with them: Put them in your pocket.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Suppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
you give them the drink,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
will start moving through our society here,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and they will accumulate in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
the drunkest, stingiest people.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
(Laughter)
