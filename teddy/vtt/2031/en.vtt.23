00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
These same infections

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
create harmful algal blooms.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that come out of these harmful algal blooms:

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that --

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
These are things that are getting into our food chain

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
because of these blooms.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Rita Calwell very famously

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
traced a very interesting story

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
of cholera into human communities,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
brought there, not by
