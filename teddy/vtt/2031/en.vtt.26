00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
for where we may be able to fix problems,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
there have been places where problems have been fixed,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
where people have come to grips with these issues

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and begun to turn them around.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Monterey is one of those.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I started out showing how much

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
with pollution and the canning industry

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and all of the attendant problems.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
In 1932, that's the picture.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
In 2009, the picture is dramatically different.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But there's a greater sense here

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
that what the individual communities need
