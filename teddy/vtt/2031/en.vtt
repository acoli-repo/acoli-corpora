It can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but what I'm going to try to say is that

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
even in that complexity,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
there's some simple themes that I think,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if we understand, we can really move forward.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And those simple themes aren't really

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
themes about the complex science of what's going on,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but things that we all pretty well know.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And I'm going to start with this one:

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We know that, right? We've experienced that.
