WEBVTT

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
a lower load.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Those females, they're not trying to.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Those females are passing the PCBs

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
in the fat of their own mother's milk

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
into their offspring,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and their offspring don't survive.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
The death rate in these dolphins,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
for the first calf born of every female dolphin,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
is 60 to 80 percent.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
These mothers pump their first offspring

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
full of this pollutant,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and most of them die.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Now, the mother then can go and reproduce,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but what a terrible price to pay

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
for the accumulation of this pollutant
