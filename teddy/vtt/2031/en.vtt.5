00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's that pyramid.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Now why does that matter for human health?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Because when we jam things in the bottom

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
of that pyramid that shouldn't be there,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
some very frightening things happen.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us:

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
molecules like PCBs

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that can't be broken down by our bodies.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And they go in the base of that pyramid,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and they drift up; they're passed up that way,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
on to predators and on to the top predators,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and in so doing,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
they accumulate.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.
