00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
vectors of cholera around the world.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So what do you do?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
that the pyramid may not be working so well,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
that the flow from the base up into it

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
is being blocked and clogged.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Well, there's a bunch of things you could do.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
You could call Joe the Plumber, for example.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And he could come in

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and fix the flow.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
But in fact, if you look around the world,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
not only are there hope spots

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
for where we may be able to fix problems,
