Now I'm making it available to schools.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And it includes exercises that show you

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
not just how to solve these puzzles,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but how to extract the principles that will let you solve

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
as well as just me creating them.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
You know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
In Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I got interested in gene sequencing.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of the base pairs in DNA?"
