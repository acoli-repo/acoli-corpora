00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
First of all, you know, for a long time

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
computer games meant things like "Doom,"

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
where you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
aimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Well, guess what? That's changing.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
"Bejeweled" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
what's called casual games.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And the main players are over 35, and are female.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And it's a game you play with other people.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.
