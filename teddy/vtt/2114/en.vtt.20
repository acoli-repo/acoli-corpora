A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Everybody now considers themselves a creator,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and not just a viewer.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And what does this add up to?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Here is what we see coming.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And we decided to combine our skills.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Our first game is called "Photo Grab." The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
This is your first time playing my game. Okay.
