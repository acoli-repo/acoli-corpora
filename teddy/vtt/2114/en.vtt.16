00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But it takes some persistence.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And when you're done, it makes this design,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
which, if you squint, is the word "helix."

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
rather than the other way around.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Here is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Which way will these fall?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
One of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And depending on which one weighs which amount,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
they'll fall different directions.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And here is a puzzle based on color mixing.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
the basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations,
