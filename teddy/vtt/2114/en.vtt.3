00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and has a right answer.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You know, they might have a solution.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Who designed this?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
so we have to hire writers to make movies.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.
