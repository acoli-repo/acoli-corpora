Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer;

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
many puzzles have more than one.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
toys and games --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
You can create one out of Legos.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You know, you can do anything you want.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Or competitive games like chess where,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but the goal really is to beat another player.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I consider that puzzles are an art form.
