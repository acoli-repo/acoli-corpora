00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I'm here today to give you

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
a little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
through what I'm doing now.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I've designed puzzles for books, printed things.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I've been doing that for about 10 years.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I have a monthly puzzle calendar.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I did puzzles for "Bejeweled."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
(Applause)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I didn't invent "Bejeweled." I can't take credit for that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So, very first puzzle,
