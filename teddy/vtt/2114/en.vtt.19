This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Now, within that there is some interesting things happening.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
There is also a trend towards games that are good for you.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Why? Well, we aging Boomers,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
we're exercising. What about our minds?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Oh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.
