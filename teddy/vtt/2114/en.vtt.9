00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And recently in Magic magazine

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
This appears in my puzzle calendar.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Okay, let's go back to the slides.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Thank you very much.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now, those are fun to look at.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Now how would you do it interactively?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
For a while I was an interface designer.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And so I think a lot about interaction.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Well, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
make the thing on the right.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Now, if you could pick up the black vase,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
it would look like the figure on top.
