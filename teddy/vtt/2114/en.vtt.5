I consider that puzzles are an art form.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's a very small form, like a joke,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But at best they can reach for something more

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and create a memorable impression.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The progression of my career that you'll see

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'll show you how. Here is a famous one.
