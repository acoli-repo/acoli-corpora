00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of the base pairs in DNA?"

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and then you look for overlaps,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and you basically match them at the edges. And I said,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap."

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And it has to be solvable in a magazine.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
There is only one solution. It's not that hard.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But it takes some persistence.
