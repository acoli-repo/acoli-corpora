You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Those four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I wanted to make a sequel.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I work as an inventor is to create a sequel.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
In the other game the cars can only move forward and back.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Created a whole bunch of levels for it.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now I'm making it available to schools.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And it includes exercises that show you
