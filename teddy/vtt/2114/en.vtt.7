00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The background to one is the other.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Originally I tried to do the words "figure" and "ground."

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
But I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It's all "figure."

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
(Laughter)

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
A few other things. Here is my name.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And that turns into the title of my first book, "Inversions."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
These sorts of designs now go by the word "ambigram."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Each letter here is one of these digits.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.
