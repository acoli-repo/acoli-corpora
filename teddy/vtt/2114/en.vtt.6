is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'll show you how. Here is a famous one.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
This is called a figure-ground illusion.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The artist M.C. Escher exploited that

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in some of his wonderful prints.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Here we have "Day and Night."

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Here is what I did with figure and ground.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So, here we have "figure" in black.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Here we have "figure" in white.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And it's all part of the same design.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The background to one is the other.
