Looks like a black shape. So, where is that?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
That's the corner of the whole thing.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Yeah, I've played this image before,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And we have people all over the world doing that now.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
There we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
