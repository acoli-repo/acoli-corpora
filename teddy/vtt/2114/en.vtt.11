00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and you can pick it up.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I'll just go one step further.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So, here is --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
here is a couple pieces. Move them together,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and now this is an active piece.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
You can really get inside somebody's perception

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and have them experience something.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It's like the old maxim of

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
"you can tell somebody something

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and show them, but if they do it they really learn it."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Here is another thing you can do.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
There is a game called Rush Hour.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
besides Rubik's cube.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So, here we have a crowded parking lot

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
with cars all over the place.
