I didn't invent "Bejeweled." I can't take credit for that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So, very first puzzle,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
sixth grade, my teacher said,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
for the board."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I thought this was a great assignment.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that's been folded just once.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
One hint: It's not "L."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
(Laughter)
