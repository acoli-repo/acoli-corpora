with cars all over the place.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's made by the company Think Fun.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It's done very well. I love this puzzle.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Well, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Okay, so how would you solve this one?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Well, move the blue one out of the way.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Here, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Now we'll make it harder, a little harder.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Now, this one is a little bit trickier.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
You know? What do you do here?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The first move is going to be what?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.
