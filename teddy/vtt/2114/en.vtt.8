Each letter here is one of these digits.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Here's the word "mirror." No, it's not the same upside-down.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It's the same this way.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
who just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
(Laughter)

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And recently in Magic magazine

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.
