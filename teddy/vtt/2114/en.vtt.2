00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
One hint: It's not "L."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
(Laughter)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It could be an "L," of course.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So, what else could it be?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Yeah, a lot of you got it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Oh yeah. So, clever thing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I created something new, I was very excited

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This was something really original. I got hooked.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.
