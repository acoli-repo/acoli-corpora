that seems far removed from our own,
but is rife with familiar concerns

00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:35.577
about freedom, power, and control.


00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:39.387
The Tempest is set on a desert island,
exposed to the elements

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:44.717
and ruled with magic and might by 
Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan.

00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:49.417
Betrayed by his brother Antonio, 
Prospero has been marooned on the island

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:54.307
for twelve years with his daughter Miranda
and his beloved books.

00:00:54.307 --> 00:00:57.627
In this time he’s learned the 
magic of the island

00:00:57.627 --> 00:01:00.887
and uses it to harness its 
elementary spirits.
