00:01:29.707 --> 00:01:32.867
And as Prospero and Ariel
close in on Antonio,

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:35.797
Caliban joins forces with some 
drunken sailors,

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:39.317
who hatch a comic plot 
to take the island.

00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:42.957
The play strips society down
to its basest desires,

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:48.287
with each faction in hot pursuit of power-
be it over the land, other people,

00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:50.307
or their own destiny.

00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:54.327
But Shakespeare knows that power is
always a moving target;

00:01:54.327 --> 00:01:57.047
and as he reveals
these characters’ dark histories,

00:01:57.047 --> 00:02:01.637
we begin to wonder if this
vicious cycle will ever end.
