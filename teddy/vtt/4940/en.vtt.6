00:02:56.248 --> 00:03:00.898
Now Ariel spends the play hoping to repay
his debt and earn his freedom,

00:03:00.898 --> 00:03:04.818
while Caliban is enslaved indefinitely,
or at least as long

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:07.458
as Prospero is in charge.

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.558
For these reasons and many more,


00:03:09.558 --> 00:03:13.538
The Tempest has often been read as
an exploration of colonialism,

00:03:13.538 --> 00:03:18.158
and the moral dilemmas that come
with en-counters of “brave new world(s)."

00:03:18.158 --> 00:03:21.661
Questions of agency and justice
hang over the play:

00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:24.201
is Caliban the rightful 
master of the land?

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:26.181
Will Ariel flutter free? 


00:03:26.181 --> 00:03:28.551
And is Prospero the 
mighty overseer-

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:34.581
or is there some deeper magic at work,
beyond any one character's grasp?
