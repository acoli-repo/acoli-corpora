00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:32.497
all the qualities o’ th’ isle/

00:02:32.497 --> 00:02:35.857
brine pits, barren place 
and fertile./

00:02:35.857 --> 00:02:38.267
Cursed be I that did so!”

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:41.117
With his thunderous language
and seething anger,

00:02:41.117 --> 00:02:45.347
Caliban constantly reminds

this island’s mine by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me.

00:02:50.347 --> 00:02:52.998

00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:56.248
and imprisoned Ariel until 
Prospero released him.

00:02:56.248 --> 00:03:00.898
Now Ariel spends the play hoping to repay
his debt and earn his freedom,
