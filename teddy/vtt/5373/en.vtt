00:00:01.587 --> 00:00:04.066
Where does all the carbon
we release go?

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.809
Carbon works in a natural cycle,
present in all living things:

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:10.777
in the soil, in the oceans,
in the atmosphere

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.406
and in rocks deep underground.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.686
When plants and other living things die,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.315
much of their stored carbon
makes its way back to the atmosphere

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.448
until new plants grow
and reabsorb the carbon.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.691
But over millions of years,

00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:28.806
some of the carbon stored in ancient trees
and sea life becomes rock

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.347
and some becomes fossil fuels:
