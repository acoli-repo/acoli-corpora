Our role is to listen to their choices,
discuss them, and appreciate their efforts

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.136
and their ability to make
small and big decisions.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.176
If, from their childhood, children
learn how to make choices,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.255
they acquire the skills and confidence
to make the right choices.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.709
Human beings form relationships
with each other based on communication.

00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:25.496
Obviously, we also make
mistakes in the process.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.216
Imagine if I come home tired one day
and scream at the children.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.296
What's more, if I refuse to see
my mistake and blame the children.
