00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.500
will sound like a Bollywood film line
to you, but it's a very deep thought.

00:05:03.524 --> 00:05:05.736
“You, me and us."

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.536
Conflict happens only when

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.736
children do not fulfill
the expectations of their parents.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.896
Or if parents don’t fulfill
the expectations of their children.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.376
This expectation is what leads to fights.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.776
We can get rid of these fights by adopting
the “you, me and us” approach.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.936
You: you tell me what you think.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.176
I may or may not agree,
but I will listen to you attentively.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.936
Me: after I have heard you out,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.576
I will give my opinion which you
may or may not agree with.
