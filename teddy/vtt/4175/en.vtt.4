00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.416
in the real or digital world,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.096
our ability to communicate
and listen is getting lost.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.455
Especially with children.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.296
This is what I want to talk
to you about today.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.456
The first thing is that

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.930
we should listen not with our ears
but with our hearts.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.216
We see the way children are behaving
and immediately start criticizing them.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.736
"He is so ill mannered."
"He is always fighting with his sister."

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.376
Instead of solving these behavioral issues,
we only scold, blame and humiliate them.
