Like, “So you must be feeling
really lonely at school then?”

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.376
We are constantly telling our children,
speak like this, work like this, do this --

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.176
as if we know everything and they know
nothing. It's always a one-sided lecture.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.016
Instead of lecturing
your shy daughter ask her,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.736
“What do you think? What is the reason
you are having difficulty making friends?”

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.440
This is my second point. Don’t tell. Ask.
