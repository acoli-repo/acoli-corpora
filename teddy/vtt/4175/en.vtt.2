Shelja Sen: I have two
important roles in life.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.096
The first, as a child psychologist
and a family therapist.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.416
In this 25-year long journey

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.616
I have worked in India and England
amongst two different cultures.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.093
I have met thousands of children,
youngsters and families.

00:01:19.093 --> 00:01:23.349
I have met people who have
the ability to cope,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.456
and people dealing with a lot
of pain and loneliness.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.496
My second role is that of a mother

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.136
to Nishaat and Anya,
who are now 20 and 15 years old.
