00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.600
You showed us how we should 
talk to our children.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.970
But could you tell us
how our children should talk to us?

SS: To the kids, I would just say:
give your parents a chance.

They have spent 25, 30, 35, 40 years
in the world, or even 50 years in the world.
