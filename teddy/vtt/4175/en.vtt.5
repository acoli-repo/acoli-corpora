00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.376
Instead of solving these behavioral issues,
we only scold, blame and humiliate them.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.576
Just think about it:

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.896
How does it benefit anyone?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.416
Rather than looking at a child’s behavior,
we should try and understand their feelings.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.216
Assume that your shy daughter

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.776
comes and tells you that she has
no friends in school,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.856
and that nobody likes her.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.736
Your immediate response is

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.656
“If you don’t try
how will you make friends?”

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.922
Instead of immediately blaming her,
try and truly listen to your daughter,

00:02:57.962 --> 00:02:59.562
feel what she is feeling.

00:02:59.562 --> 00:03:04.376
Like, “So you must be feeling
really lonely at school then?”
