00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.296
What's more, if I refuse to see
my mistake and blame the children.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.376
“You got me angry, it's all your fault."

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.217
That is my fourth point.

00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:42.536
If you make a mistake, apologize.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.856
"Sorry I screamed at you,
please tell me what I can do,"

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.696
Children learn from us
that everybody makes mistakes.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.050
But instead of blaming others,
we should take responsibility for it

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.280
and ask for forgiveness.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.856
The fifth and last point
that I want to make

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.500
will sound like a Bollywood film line
to you, but it's a very deep thought.
