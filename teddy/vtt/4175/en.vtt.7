00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.440
This is my second point. Don’t tell. Ask.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.096
When we question children
with love, peace and respect,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.696
they feel like we are trying to understand
them and that we trust them.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.576
This builds their self-esteem
towards thinking and doing something new.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.816
Now comes the third point.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.816
What you choose is what you become.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.536
As children grow up, they start
making their own choices.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.336
What they should play,
what subjects they should choose,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.122
which college they should go to.

00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:03.496
Our role is to listen to their choices,
discuss them, and appreciate their efforts
