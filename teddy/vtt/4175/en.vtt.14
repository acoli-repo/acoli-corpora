They have spent 25, 30, 35, 40 years
in the world, or even 50 years in the world.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.776
So they must definitely know something;
so just give them a chance.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.040
Like my kids often tell me, when you
come to our school to conduct a workshop,

00:07:14.085 --> 00:07:16.955
"Don't try to act cool, please. OK?"

00:07:16.975 --> 00:07:17.777
(Laughter)

00:07:17.797 --> 00:07:20.867
"It will be very embarrassing,
I have to live in that school.

00:07:20.893 --> 00:07:22.243
And don't try to act cool."

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:23.840
So, you know, they have a point.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.720
You know, we try to act cool sometimes,
and we really fail at that.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.720
