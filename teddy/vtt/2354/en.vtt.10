Clearly, starting
an inclusive conversation,

00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:02.309
including members of all genders

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.637
and listening to
and supporting each other,

00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:06.112
can go a long way.

00:05:07.231 --> 00:05:11.201
Now, to make our campaign successful,
we conducted extensive research,

00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:12.977
interviewed gynecologists,

00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.038
surveyed people to gauge
public opinion on periods

00:05:16.062 --> 00:05:20.607
and conducted a panel discussion
with professionals working in this field.

00:05:20.631 --> 00:05:23.958
And then we undertook the journey
to create change.

00:05:23.982 --> 00:05:27.392
We organized a stall
at Shilpotsav, a local fair,

00:05:27.416 --> 00:05:30.442
where we distributed
sanitary napkin-shaped envelopes
