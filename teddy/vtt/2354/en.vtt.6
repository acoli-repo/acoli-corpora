00:02:57.384 --> 00:03:00.271
questions the taboos
surrounding menstruation

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:02.688
and spreads period positivity.

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.497
The name of our campaign, "Pravahkriti,"

00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:09.921
was born from the message
that we want to convey to the world.

00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:12.081
"Pravah" means "flow,"

00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:15.254
and "kriti" means "a beautiful creation."

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:20.050
Because how could the monthly cycle
that ultimately gives rise to all creation

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:22.537
be anything less than beautiful?

00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:28.269
Now, as a social issue,
menstruation has several facets to it

00:03:28.293 --> 00:03:31.767
that overlap, reinforce
and worsen the situation.
