00:02:30.907 --> 00:02:33.750
What about the struggles
of homeless, transgender,

00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:35.992
intersex and displaced people

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:37.276
who menstruate?

00:02:37.873 --> 00:02:39.824
What about them?

00:02:40.802 --> 00:02:42.328
The scale of the problem,

00:02:42.352 --> 00:02:46.707
stemming in part from the deep-rooted
stigma attached to menstruation,

00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:48.563
is unimaginable.

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.747
And the desire to voice this frustration

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.237
led me, along with three other teammates,

00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:57.360
to initiate a campaign
that calls for change,

00:02:57.384 --> 00:03:00.271
questions the taboos
surrounding menstruation
