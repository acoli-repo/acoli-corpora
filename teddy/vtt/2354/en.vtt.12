a sachet of ginger tea and so on.

00:06:00.288 --> 00:06:04.949
In whatever we did, we strived to think
beyond the norm and break barriers,

00:06:04.973 --> 00:06:07.294
be it by creating
a physical period tracker

00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:09.749
to help girls without access
to the internet

00:06:09.773 --> 00:06:12.128
to record their monthly cycle,

00:06:12.152 --> 00:06:16.561
or sensitizing the masses
by performing street plays,

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:19.920
or even developing a video game
called "Crimson Crusade" --

00:06:19.944 --> 00:06:20.957
(Laughter)

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:22.708
that introduces both boys and girls

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:25.222
to problems faced
by menstruating women globally

00:06:25.246 --> 00:06:27.208
and players progress in the game

00:06:27.232 --> 00:06:29.532
by defeating menstrual monsters.

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:32.024
(Laughter)
