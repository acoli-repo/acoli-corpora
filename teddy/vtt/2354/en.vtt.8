00:03:55.855 --> 00:04:00.127
We conducted an activity where students
strung together a bracelet

00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:05.288
consisting of 28 beads signifying
the length of the menstrual cycle,

00:04:05.312 --> 00:04:08.452
out of which four to seven beads
were of a different color,

00:04:08.476 --> 00:04:10.856
demonstrating the days a woman bleeds.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.369
And in this way, we not only
explained what periods are

00:04:15.393 --> 00:04:17.034
in a manner that was educational

00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:20.076
but also approachable and engaging.

00:04:20.683 --> 00:04:22.039
To offer another example,

00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:25.283
we explored various ways
of alleviating cramps,

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:28.782
including preparing some
natural remedies in school itself.

00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:32.837
And we didn't just stop
at involving girls in our campaign.
