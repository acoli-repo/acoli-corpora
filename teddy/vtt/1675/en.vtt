A couple of years ago,

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:05.164
when I was attending
the TED conference in Long Beach,

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:06.553
I met Harriet.

00:00:06.577 --> 00:00:09.976
We'd actually met online before --
not the way you're thinking.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.435
We were introduced
because we both knew Linda Avey,

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.763
one of the founders of the first
online personal genomic companies.

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:18.484
And because we shared
our genetic information with Linda,

00:00:18.508 --> 00:00:20.415
she could see that Harriet and I shared

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.329
a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA,
haplotype K1a1b1a,

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:26.348
which meant we were distantly related.

00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:29.205
We actually share the same
genealogy with Ötzi the Iceman.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.740
So -- Ötzi, Harriet and me.
