00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:02.162
And as you're thinking
about this incredible ability

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:04.439
to make life do what you want it to do,

00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:06.580
what it's programmed to do,

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:08.397
what you end up doing

00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:11.866
is taking what we've been doing
for thousands of years,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.011
which is breeding, changing,

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.106
mixing, matching

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.139
all kinds of life-forms,

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:20.624
and we accelerate it.

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:22.148
And this is not something new.

00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:24.472
This humble mustard weed has been modified

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.168
so that if you change it in one way,
you get broccoli.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.240
And if you change it
in a second way, you get kale.
