00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.240
And if you change it
in a second way, you get kale.

00:02:31.764 --> 00:02:33.780
And if you change it in a third way,

00:02:33.804 --> 00:02:35.073

00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:39.014
So when you go to these
all-natural, organic markets,

00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:40.618
you're really going to a place

00:02:40.642 --> 00:02:44.601

(Laughter)

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:54.223
We're beginning to practice
intelligent design.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.057
That means that instead
of doing this at random

00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:59.137
and seeing what happens over generations,

00:02:59.161 --> 00:03:02.847
we're inserting specific genes,
we're inserting specific proteins,
