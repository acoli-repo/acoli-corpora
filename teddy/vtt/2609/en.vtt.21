He's otherwise known
as the Octopus, his nickname.

00:10:33.085 --> 00:10:35.359
He was the Relief Pitcher
of the Year in 2000.

00:10:35.955 --> 00:10:38.719
And he had a random mutation
that gave him six fingers

00:10:38.743 --> 00:10:40.971
on each hand,

00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:43.637
which turns out to be really useful
if you're a pitcher.

00:10:43.661 --> 00:10:45.301
(Laughter)

00:10:46.119 --> 00:10:47.849
How about non-random mutation?

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:51.388
A non-random mutation is beer.

00:10:51.412 --> 00:10:53.110
It's wine. It's yogurt.

00:10:53.928 --> 00:10:56.264
How many times have you walked
through the forest

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:57.851
and found all-natural cheese?

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:00.102
Or all-natural yogurt?
