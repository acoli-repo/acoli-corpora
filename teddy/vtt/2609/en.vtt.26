00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:02.297
we came so close to extinction

00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:04.936
that all of us descend
from a single African mother

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.285
and the consequence of that

00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:10.814
is there's more genetic diversity
in 55 African chimpanzees

00:13:10.838 --> 00:13:12.713
than there are in seven billion humans.

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:16.256
Principle number four:

00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:19.079
we should take about
a quarter of the Earth

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.060
and only let Darwin run the show there.

00:13:22.981 --> 00:13:24.582
It doesn't have to be contiguous,

00:13:24.606 --> 00:13:26.380
doesn't have to all be tied together.

00:13:26.404 --> 00:13:28.610
It should be part
in the oceans, part on land.

00:13:28.634 --> 00:13:32.017
But we should not run every
evolutionary decision on this planet.
