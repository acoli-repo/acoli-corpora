but in the sense of assisted
reproductive technologies.

00:04:05.405 --> 00:04:07.841
So what are assisted
reproductive technologies?

00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:11.583
Assisted reproductive technologies
are things like in vitro fertilization.

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:15.838
And when you do in vitro fertilization,
there's very good reasons to do it.

00:04:15.862 --> 00:04:18.982
Sometimes you just
can't conceive otherwise.

00:04:19.622 --> 00:04:20.777
But when you do that,

00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:24.863
what you’re doing is separating
sex, conception, baby.

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:28.690
So you haven't just taken control
of when you have a baby,

00:04:28.714 --> 00:04:32.038
you've separated when the baby
and where the baby is fertilized.
