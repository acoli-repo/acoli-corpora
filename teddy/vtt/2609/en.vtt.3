00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:35.351
So in 2015, what word of advice
would you give people,

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:38.016

So what is "lifecode?"

00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:49.091

or DNA or RNA

00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:59.144
or plants or animals,
or a whole series of creatures.

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:02.162
And as you're thinking
