But if you can save them
and you can freeze them,

00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:02.524
and you can have a surrogate mother,

00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:04.707
it means that you've
decoupled sex from time.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.628
It means you can have twins
born -- oh, in 50 years?

00:05:11.287 --> 00:05:14.976
(Laughter)

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.257
In a hundred years?

00:05:17.342 --> 00:05:18.630
Two hundred years?

00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:22.353

00:05:22.377 --> 00:05:23.976
that are not, like, future stuff.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.117
This is stuff we take for granted today.

00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:29.840
So this lifecode stuff
turns out to be a superpower.
