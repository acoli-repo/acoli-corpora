When you do a cornfield,

00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:03.628
you're selecting what lives and what dies.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.419
And you're doing that
through unnatural selection.

00:10:06.443 --> 00:10:09.580
It's the same with a wheat field,
it's the same with a rice field.

00:10:09.604 --> 00:10:12.219
It's the same with a city,
it's the same with a suburb.

00:10:12.243 --> 00:10:14.138
In fact, half the surface of Earth

00:10:14.162 --> 00:10:15.669
has been unnaturally engineered

00:10:15.693 --> 00:10:18.876
so that what lives and what dies
there is what we want,

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.363
which is the reason why
you don't have grizzly bears

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.314
walking through downtown Manhattan.

00:10:25.077 --> 00:10:26.936
How about this random mutation stuff?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.403
Well, this is random mutation.

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:29.767
