00:04:28.714 --> 00:04:32.038
you've separated when the baby
and where the baby is fertilized.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.922
So you've separated the baby

00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:36.651
from the body from the act.

00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:40.412
And as you're thinking
of other things we've been doing,

00:04:40.436 --> 00:04:42.294
think about twins.

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:45.149
So you can freeze sperm,
you can freeze eggs,

00:04:45.173 --> 00:04:46.870
you can freeze fertilized eggs.

00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:49.543

00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:52.061
Well, that's a good thing
if you're a cancer patient.

00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:55.089
You're about to go under chemotherapy
or under radiation,

00:04:55.113 --> 00:04:56.343
so you save these things.

00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:57.604
You don't irradiate them.

00:04:58.072 --> 00:05:00.398
But if you can save them
and you can freeze them,
