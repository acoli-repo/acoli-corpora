00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:00.965
It's not, "Stuff happened."

00:12:00.989 --> 00:12:02.462
It didn't happen at random.

00:12:02.486 --> 00:12:05.090
It didn't come down
by a verdict of somebody else.

00:12:05.114 --> 00:12:06.931
We engineer this stuff,

00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:10.200
and it's the Pottery Barn rule:
you break it, you own it.

00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:12.491
Principle number two:

00:12:12.515 --> 00:12:15.643
we have to recognize and celebrate
diversity in this stuff.

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:18.801
There have been at least
33 versions of hominids

00:12:18.825 --> 00:12:20.547
that have walked around this Earth.

00:12:20.912 --> 00:12:23.218
Most all of them went extinct except us.

00:12:23.804 --> 00:12:25.965
But the normal and natural
state of this Earth

00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:29.376
is we have various versions of humans
walking around at the same time,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.057
which is why most of us
have some Neanderthal in us.
