00:02:59.161 --> 00:03:02.847
we're inserting specific genes,
we're inserting specific proteins,

00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:06.078
and we're changing lifecode
for very deliberate purposes.

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:09.839
And that allows us to accelerate
how this stuff happens.

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:12.211
Let me just give you one example.

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:17.823
Some of you occasionally
might think about sex.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.528
And we kind of take it for granted
how we've changed sex.

00:03:22.552 --> 00:03:25.460
So we think it's perfectly normal
and natural to change it.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.299
What's happened with sex over time is --

00:03:28.323 --> 00:03:31.011
normally, sex equals baby, eventually.
