00:06:59.275 --> 00:07:00.832
you save the lives of people.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.221
But you also are doing
germline engineering,

00:07:04.245 --> 00:07:08.388
which means her kids,
if she has kids, will be saved

00:07:08.412 --> 00:07:09.822
and won't go through this.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.337
And [their] kids will be saved,

00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:13.196
and their grandchildren will be saved,

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.417
and this passes on.

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:16.554
That makes people nervous.

00:07:16.578 --> 00:07:18.928
So 20 years ago,
the various authorities said,

00:07:18.952 --> 00:07:20.871
why don't we study this for a while?

00:07:21.903 --> 00:07:25.717
There are risks to doing stuff,
and there are risks to not doing stuff,

00:07:25.741 --> 00:07:29.089
because there were a couple dozen people
saved by this technology,

00:07:29.113 --> 00:07:32.097
and then we've been thinking about it
for the next 20 years.
