00:06:28.568 --> 00:06:30.714
And as you're thinking about this stuff,

00:06:30.738 --> 00:06:32.908
here's something
that happened 20 years ago.

00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:34.862
This is Emma Ott.

00:06:34.886 --> 00:06:37.695
She's a recent college admittee.

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:39.624
She's studying accounting.

00:06:39.648 --> 00:06:43.012
She played two varsity sports.
She graduated as a valedictorian.

00:06:43.687 --> 00:06:45.707
And that's not particularly extraordinary,

00:06:45.731 --> 00:06:49.302
except that she's the first human being
born to three parents.

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:51.395
Why?

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.585
Because she had a deadly
mitochondrial disease

00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:55.094
that she might have inherited.

00:06:55.118 --> 00:06:57.499
So when you swap out a third person's DNA

00:06:57.523 --> 00:06:59.251
and you put it in there,

00:06:59.275 --> 00:07:00.832
you save the lives of people.
