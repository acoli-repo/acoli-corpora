00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.142
So, there's an actor
called Dustin Hoffman.

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:07.619
And years ago, he made this movie
which some of you may have heard of,

00:00:07.643 --> 00:00:08.833
called "The Graduate."

00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:11.874
And there's two key scenes in that movie.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.653
The first one is the seduction scene.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:16.670
I'm not going to talk about that tonight.

00:00:16.694 --> 00:00:18.161
(Laughter)

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:22.775
The second scene is where he's taken out
by the old guy to the pool,

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:27.818
and as a young college graduate,
the old guy basically says one word,

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:29.031
just one word.

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.127
And of course, all of you know
what that word is.
