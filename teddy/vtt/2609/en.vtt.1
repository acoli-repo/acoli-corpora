00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.127
And of course, all of you know
what that word is.

00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:33.341
It's "plastics."

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.531
(Laughter)

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.122
And the only problem with that is,
it was completely the wrong advice.

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:40.633
(Laughter)

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.377
Let me tell you why it was so wrong.

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:45.194
The word should have been "silicon."

00:00:46.163 --> 00:00:48.187
And the reason it should have been silicon

00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:53.392
is because the basic patents
for semiconductors had already been made,

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:54.793
had already been filed,

00:00:54.817 --> 00:00:56.582
and they were already building them.

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:59.693
So Silicon Valley was just
being built in 1967,

00:00:59.717 --> 00:01:01.525
when this movie was released.
