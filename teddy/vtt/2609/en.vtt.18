00:08:58.016 --> 00:09:00.643
And so what lived and died,
what was structured,

00:09:01.167 --> 00:09:02.850
has now been flipped on its head.

00:09:04.262 --> 00:09:05.461
And what we've done

00:09:05.485 --> 00:09:08.096
is created this completely
parallel evolutionary system

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.449
where we are practicing unnatural
selection and non-random mutation.

00:09:11.473 --> 00:09:13.168
So let me explain these things.

00:09:13.192 --> 00:09:14.581
This is natural selection.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.495
This is unnatural selection.

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:19.141
(Laughter)

00:09:19.903 --> 00:09:22.547
So what happens with this stuff is,

00:09:22.571 --> 00:09:25.285
we started breeding wolves
thousands of years ago

00:09:25.309 --> 00:09:27.499
in central Asia to turn them into dogs.

00:09:27.523 --> 00:09:29.817
And then we started
turning them into big dogs

00:09:29.841 --> 00:09:31.592
and into little dogs.
