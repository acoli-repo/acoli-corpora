It turns out to be this incredibly
powerful way of changing viruses,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.064
of changing plants, of changing animals,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.094
perhaps even of evolving ourselves.

00:05:40.118 --> 00:05:43.860
It's something that Steve Gullans and I
have been thinking about for a while.

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:45.908
Let's have some risks.

00:05:46.408 --> 00:05:50.552
Like every powerful technology,
like electricity, like an automobile,

00:05:50.576 --> 00:05:53.885
like computers, this stuff
potentially can be misused.

00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:56.202
And that scares a lot of people.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.785
And as you apply these technologies,

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:01.061
you can even turn human
beings into chimeras.
