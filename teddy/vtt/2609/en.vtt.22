00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:00.102
Or all-natural yogurt?

00:11:01.046 --> 00:11:02.831
So we've been engineering this stuff.

00:11:02.855 --> 00:11:04.323
Now, the interesting thing is,

00:11:04.347 --> 00:11:05.965
we get to know the stuff better.

00:11:06.364 --> 00:11:10.077
We found one of the single most powerful
gene-editing instruments,

00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:11.888
CRISPR, inside yogurt.

00:11:13.028 --> 00:11:15.018
And as we start engineering cells,

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:19.322
we're producing eight out of the top 10
pharmaceutical products,

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:22.771
including the stuff that you use
to treat arthritis,

00:11:22.795 --> 00:11:25.221
which is the number one
best-selling drug, Humira.

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:27.436
So this lifecode stuff.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.605
It really is a superpower.
