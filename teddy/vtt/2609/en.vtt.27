We want to have Darwin's
evolutionary system running.

00:13:37.537 --> 00:13:41.213
And it's just really important to have
these two things running in parallel

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.754
and not overwhelm evolution.

00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:46.888

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.981
This is the single greatest superpower
humans have ever had.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.873
It would be a crime for you
not to participate in this stuff
