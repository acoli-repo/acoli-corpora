This could bring online
as many as four billion more people,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.080
who today have little
or no internet connection.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.015
But you can't just take a cell tower,

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.936
strap it to a balloon
and stick it in the sky.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.336
The winds are too strong,
it would be blown away.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.760
And the balloons are too high up
to tie it to the ground.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.240
Here comes the crazy moment.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.096
What if, instead,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.336
we let the balloons drift

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.200
and we taught them how to sail the winds
to go where the needed to go?
