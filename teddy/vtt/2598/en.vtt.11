00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.496
when we had these Lexus,
retrofitted, self-driving cars in testing,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.176
they were doing so well,
we gave them out to other Googlers

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.440
to find out what they thought
of the experience.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.256
And what we discovered

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.896
was that our plan to have the cars
do almost all the driving

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.816
and just hand over to the users
in case of emergency

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.920
was a really bad plan.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.856
It wasn't safe

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.016
because the users didn't do their job.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.480
They didn't stay alert
