00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.856
And the longer it survives that pressure,
the more excited we get

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.336
that this could become
a cheaper and more deployable form

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.280
of wind energy for the world.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.560
Probably the craziest sounding project
we have is Project Loon.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.856
We're trying to make
balloon-powered Internet.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.960
A network of balloons in the stratosphere

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.896
that beam an internet connection down
to rural and remote areas of the world.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.816
This could bring online
as many as four billion more people,
