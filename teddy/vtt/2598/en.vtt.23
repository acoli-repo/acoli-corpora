00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.280
We made balloons the size of a blue whale.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.376
We busted a lot of balloons.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.016
(Laughter)

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.096
Since one of the things that was
most likely to kill the Loon project

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.176
was whether we could guide
the balloons through the sky,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.960
one of our most important experiments
was putting a balloon inside a balloon.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.080
So there are two compartments here,
one with air and then one with helium.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.216
The balloon pumps air in
to make itself heavier,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.600
or lets air out to make it lighter.
