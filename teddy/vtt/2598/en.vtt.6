00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.616
Vertical farming uses 10 times less water

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.776
and a hundred times less land
than conventional farming.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.960
And because you can grow the food
close to where it's consumed,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.880
you don't have to
transport it large distances.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.456
We made progress in a lot of the areas

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.096
like automated harvesting
and efficient lighting.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.576
But unfortunately,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.656
we couldn't get staple crops
like grains and rice to grow this way.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.200
So we killed the project.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.480
Here's another huge problem.
