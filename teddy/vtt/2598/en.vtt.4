00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.960
That's it, that's the secret.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.216
Run at all the hardest
parts of the problem first.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.295
Get excited and cheer,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.759
"Hey! How are we going
to kill our project today?"

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.640
We've got this interesting balance going

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.096
where we allow our unchecked
optimism to fuel our visions.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.576
But then we also harness
enthusiastic skepticism

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.640
to breathe life, breathe reality
into those visions.
