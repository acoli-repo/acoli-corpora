00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.736
We use the word "moonshots"
to remind us to keep our visions big --

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.456
to keep dreaming.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.936
And we use the word "factory"
to remind ourselves

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.056
that we want to have concrete visions --

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.376
concrete plans to make them real.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.336
Here's our moonshot blueprint.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.576
Number one:

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.016
we want to find
a huge problem in the world

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.296
that affects many millions of people.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.816
Number two:

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.640
we want to find or propose a radical
solution for solving that problem.
