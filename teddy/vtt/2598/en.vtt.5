00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.640
to breathe life, breathe reality
into those visions.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.256
I want to show you a few of the projects

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.976
that we've had to leave behind
on the cutting room floor,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.576
and also a few of the gems

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.296
that at least so far,
have not only survived that process,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.080
but have been accelerated by it.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.176
Last year we killed a project
in automated vertical farming.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.216
This is some of the lettuce that we grew.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.816
One in nine people in the world
suffers from undernourishment.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.936
So this is a moonshot
that needs to happen.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.616
Vertical farming uses 10 times less water
