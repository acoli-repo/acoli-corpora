or lets air out to make it lighter.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.816
And these weight changes
allow it to rise or fall,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.576
and that simple movement of the balloon
is its steering mechanism.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.256
It floats up or down,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.200
hoping to grab winds going in the speed
and direction that it wants.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.120
But is that good enough
for it to navigate through the world?

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.336
Barely at first,

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.736
but better all the time.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.840
This particular balloon,
our latest balloon,

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.240
can navigate a two-mile
vertical stretch of sky
