00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.480
Here's another huge problem.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.416
We pay enormous costs in resources
and environmental damage

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.656
to ship goods worldwide.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.256
Economic development
of landlocked countries

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.856
is limited by lack
of shipping infrastructure.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.496
The radical solution?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.720
A lighter-than-air,
variable-buoyancy cargo ship.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.616
This has the potential to lower,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.256
at least overall,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.816
the cost, time and carbon
footprint of shipping
