went around the world
19 times over 187 days.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.160
are doing pretty much everything
a complete system needs to do.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.016
We're in discussions

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.376
and we're going to fly
over places like Indonesia

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.136

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.000

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.056
Being audacious
