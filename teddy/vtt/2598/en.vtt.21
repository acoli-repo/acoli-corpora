00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.056
so it was a real Internet connection?

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.040
So that people could have
something more than just SMS?

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.456
The early tests weren't even
a megabit per second,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.896
but now we can do
up to 15 megabits per second.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.240
Enough to watch a TED Talk.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.936
Could we get the balloons
to talk to each other through the sky

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.816
so that we could reach our signal
deeper into rural areas?

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.376
Check.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:04.056
Could we get balloons the size of a house
to stay up for more than 100 days,
