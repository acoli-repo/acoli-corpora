00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.336
200 million dollars
is just way too expensive.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.176
Because X is structured
with these tight feedback loops

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.856
of making mistakes
and learning and new designs,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.616
we can't spend 200 million dollars

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.376
to get the first data point

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.960
about whether we're
on the right track or not.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.936
If there's an Achilles' heel
in one our projects,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.256
we want to know it now, up front,
not way down the road.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.960
So we killed this project, too.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.616
Discovering a major flaw in a project

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.776
doesn't always mean
that it ends the project.
