00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.640
we want to find or propose a radical
solution for solving that problem.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.856
And then number three:

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.856
there has to be some reason to believe

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.936
that the technology
for such a radical solution

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.400
could actually be built.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.496
But I have a secret for you.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.760
The moonshot factory is a messy place.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.416
But rather than avoid the mess,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.976
pretend it's not there,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.840
we've tried to make that our strength.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.896
We spend most of our time breaking things

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.880
and trying to prove that we're wrong.
