00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.816
the cost, time and carbon
footprint of shipping

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.120
without needing runways.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.936
We came up with this clever set
of technical breakthroughs

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.896
that together might make it possible
for us to lower the cost enough

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.056
that we could actually make these ships --

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.720
inexpensively enough in volume.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.079
But however cheap they would
have been to make in volume

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.176
it turned out that it was going to cost
close to 200 million dollars

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.320
to design and build the first one.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.336
200 million dollars
is just way too expensive.
