In 1962 at Rice University,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.176
JFK told the country about a dream he had,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.096
a dream to put a person on the moon
by the end of the decade.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.520
The eponymous moonshot.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.696
No one knew if it was possible to do

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.080
but he made sure a plan was put in place
to do it if it was possible.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.336
That's how great dreams are.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.816
Great dreams aren't just visions,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.520
they're visions coupled to strategies
for making them real.
