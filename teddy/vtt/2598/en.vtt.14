Sometimes shifting your perspective
is more powerful than being smart.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.376
Take wind energy.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.736
It's one of my favorite examples
of perspective shifting.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.616
There's no way that we're going to build

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.040
a better standard wind turbine
than the experts in that industry.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.616
But we found a way
to get up higher into the sky,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.456
and so get access to faster,
more consistent winds,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.136
and so more energy without needing
hundreds of tons of steel to get there.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.496
