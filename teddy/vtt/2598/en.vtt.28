00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.936
The only way to get people
to work on big, risky things --

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.696
audacious ideas --

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.656
and have them run at all
the hardest parts of the problem first,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.560
is if you make that the path
of least resistance for them.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.240
We work hard at X to make it safe to fail.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.936
Teams kill their ideas
as soon as the evidence is on the table

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.520
because they're rewarded for it.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.976
They get applause from their peers.
