00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.240
can navigate a two-mile
vertical stretch of sky

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.336
and can sail itself to within 500 meters
of where it wants to go

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.960
from 20,000 kilometers away.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.576
We have lots more to do

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.176
in terms of fine-tuning
the system and reducing costs.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.216
But last year,
a balloon built inexpensively

00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.376
went around the world
19 times over 187 days.
