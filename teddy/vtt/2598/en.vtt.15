00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.496
Our Makani energy kite
rises up from its perch

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.536
by spinning up those
propellers along its wing.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.880
And it pulls out a tether as it rises,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.536
pulling energy up through the tether.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.416
Once the tether's all the way out,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.600
it goes into crosswind circles in the sky.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.680
And now those propellers that lifted it up
have become flying turbines.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.080
And that sends energy
back down the tether.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.736
We haven't yet found
a way to kill this project.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.856
And the longer it survives that pressure,
the more excited we get
