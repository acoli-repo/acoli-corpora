00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.480
They didn't stay alert

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.216
in case the car needed
to hand control back to them.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.256
This was a major crisis for the team.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.320
It sent them back to the drawing board.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.680
And they came up
with a beautiful, new perspective.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.320
Aim for a car where
you're truly a passenger.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.536
You tell the car where you want to go,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.816
you push a button

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.000
and it takes you
from point A to point B by itself.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.016
We're really grateful

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.576
that we had this insight
as early on in the project as we did.
