00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.896
It turns out the stratosphere has winds

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.016
that are going in quite different
speeds and directions in thin strata.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.920
So we hoped that using smart algorithms
and wind data from around the world,

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.256
we could maneuver the balloons a bit,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.376
getting them to go up and down
just a tiny bit in the stratosphere

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.016
to grab those winds going
in those different directions and speeds.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.336
The idea is to have enough balloons

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.216
so as one balloon floats out of your area,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.976
there's another balloon
ready to float into place,
