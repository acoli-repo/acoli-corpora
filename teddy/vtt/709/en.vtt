00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:05.795
Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone.

00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:08.057
You know that all over the world,

00:00:08.057 --> 00:00:10.852
people fight for their freedom,

00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:13.058
fight for their rights.

00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:16.219
Some battle oppressive governments.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.955
Others battle oppressive societies.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:24.811
Which battle do you think is harder?

00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:27.283
Allow me to try to answer this question

00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:30.363
in the few coming minutes.
