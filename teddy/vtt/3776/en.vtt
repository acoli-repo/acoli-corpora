00:00:00.662 --> 00:00:03.474
I want to speak about 
a forgotten conflict.

00:00:03.474 --> 00:00:07.180
It's a conflict that rarely
hits the headlines.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.400
It happens right here,
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:16.842
Now, most people outside of Africa
don't know much about the war in Congo,

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:20.099
so let me give you a couple of key facts.

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.687
The Congolese conflict is the deadliest 
conflict since World War II.

00:00:25.687 --> 00:00:28.987
It has caused almost four million deaths.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:33.581
It has destabilized most of Central Africa
for the past 18 years.
