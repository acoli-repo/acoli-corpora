00:12:27.068 --> 00:12:30.214
And what's fascinating
is that this analysis

00:12:30.214 --> 00:12:34.224
helps us to better understand
many cases of lasting conflict

00:12:34.224 --> 00:12:39.513
and international intervention failures,
in Africa and elsewhere.

00:12:39.513 --> 00:12:45.074
Local conflicts fuel violence
in most war and post-war environments,

00:12:45.074 --> 00:12:48.765
from Afghanistan to Sudan
to Timor-Leste,

00:12:48.765 --> 00:12:52.366
and in the rare cases
where there have been comprehensive,

00:12:52.366 --> 00:12:55.453
bottom-up peacebuilding initiatives,

00:12:55.453 --> 00:13:00.947
these attempts have been successful
at making peace sustainable.
