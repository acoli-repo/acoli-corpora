00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:31.601
the staff of most
nongovernmental organizations

00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:34.437
that work with the resolution of conflict,

00:05:34.437 --> 00:05:39.215
they all share a specific way
of seeing the world.

00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:43.221
And I was one of these people,
and I shared this culture,

00:05:43.221 --> 00:05:47.213
so I know all too well how powerful it is.

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:51.482
Throughout the world,
and throughout conflict zones,

00:05:51.482 --> 00:05:55.290
this common culture shapes
the intervener's understanding

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.774
of the causes of violence

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:04.517
as something that is primarily located
in the national and international spheres.
