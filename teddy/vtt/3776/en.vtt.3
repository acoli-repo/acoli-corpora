Although there is one story
about Congo that you may have heard.

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:35.214
It's a story about minerals and rape.

00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:37.800
Policy statements and media reports

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.534
both usually focus on a primary cause
of violence in Congo --

00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:47.312
the illegal exploitation and trafficking
of natural resources --

00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:50.049
and on a main consequence --

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.243
sexual abuse of women and girls
as a weapon of war.

00:01:55.243 --> 00:02:01.220
So, not that these two issues
aren't important and tragic. They are.
