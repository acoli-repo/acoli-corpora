00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.255
Instead, it is that both macro-level
and micro-level peacebuilding are needed

00:14:01.255 --> 00:14:03.972
to make peace sustainable,

00:14:03.972 --> 00:14:06.113
and local nongovernmental organizations,

00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:09.092
local authorities and 
civil society representatives

00:14:09.092 --> 00:14:13.702
should be the main actors
in the bottom-up process.

00:14:13.702 --> 00:14:16.131
So of course, there are obstacles.

00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:18.786
Local actors often lack the funding

00:14:18.786 --> 00:14:22.323
and sometimes the logistical means
and the technical capacity

00:14:22.323 --> 00:14:26.857
to implement effective,
local peacebuilding programs.

00:14:26.857 --> 00:14:31.913
So international actors
should expand their funding and support
