00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.757
One of the best examples is the contrast

00:13:03.757 --> 00:13:08.168
between the relatively peaceful
situation in Somaliland,

00:13:08.168 --> 00:13:13.378
which benefited from sustained
grassroots peacebuilding initiatives,

00:13:13.378 --> 00:13:17.586
and the violence prevalent
in the rest of Somalia,

00:13:17.586 --> 00:13:20.945
where peacebuilding
has been mostly top-down.

So if we want international
peacebuilding to work,
