00:05:01.793 --> 00:05:06.508
that the villagers needed
to cultivate food and to survive.

00:05:06.508 --> 00:05:11.278
The second central observation
is that international peace efforts

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:15.242
have failed to help
address local conflicts

00:05:15.242 --> 00:05:20.161
because of the presence
of a dominant peacebuilding culture.

00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:23.777
So what I mean is that

00:05:23.777 --> 00:05:26.150
Western and African diplomats,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.997
United Nations peacekeepers, donors,

00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:31.601
the staff of most
nongovernmental organizations
