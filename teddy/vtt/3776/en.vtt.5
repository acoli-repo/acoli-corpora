00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:30.568
The story starts from the fact
that not only is Congo notable

00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:34.885
for being the world's worst
ongoing humanitarian crisis,

00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:38.411
but it is also home to some of the largest

00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:42.572
international peacebuilding
efforts in the world.

00:02:42.572 --> 00:02:44.685
Congo hosts the largest

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:49.530
and most expensive United Nations
peacekeeping mission in the world.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.229
It was also the site of the first
European-led peacekeeping mission,

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:56.903
and for its first cases ever,

00:02:56.903 --> 00:03:03.535
the International Criminal Court
chose to prosecute Congolese warlords.
