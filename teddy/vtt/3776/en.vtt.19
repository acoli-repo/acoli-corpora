00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:33.995
This conflict started in the 1930s
during Belgian colonization,

00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:39.328
when both communities competed
over access to land and to local power.

00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:42.727
Then, in 1960,
after Congolese independence,

00:09:42.727 --> 00:09:48.572
it escalated because each camp
tried to align with national politicians,

00:09:48.578 --> 00:09:52.512
but still to advance their local agendas.

00:09:52.512 --> 00:09:56.880
And then, at the time
of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:03.059
these local actors allied
with Congolese and Rwandan armed groups,
