00:10:28.064 --> 00:10:32.340
But it turned out that no one
saved any energy.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.853
Now, why is that?

00:10:33.853 --> 00:10:36.588
Well, people couldn't predict the future.

00:10:36.588 --> 00:10:40.136
They just didn't know how their weeks
would change season to season,

00:10:40.136 --> 00:10:41.634
year to year.

00:10:42.414 --> 00:10:44.745
So no one was saving energy,

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:45.727
and what happened?

00:10:45.727 --> 00:10:48.350
Thermostat designers went back
to the drawing board

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.392
and they focused on that programming step.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:53.409
They made better U.I.s,

00:10:53.409 --> 00:10:55.575
they made better documentation.

00:10:55.575 --> 00:11:00.305
But still, years later,
people were not saving any energy
