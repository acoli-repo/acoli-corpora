Dan replies, "So often, you won't
even notice it."

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:36.448
And then, something falls off the wall.

00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:39.042
We all know what he's talking about.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:41.883
As human beings, we get used
to everyday things

00:00:41.883 --> 00:00:43.080
really fast.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.984
As a product designer,
it's my job to see those everyday things,

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:50.521
to feel them, and try
to improve upon them.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:54.861
For example, see this piece of fruit?

00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:57.811
See this little sticker?

00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:01.666
That sticker wasn't there
when I was a kid.
