00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:00.165
By the 10th time,

00:02:00.165 --> 00:02:02.641
you started to become less upset

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:06.071
and you just started peeling
the label off.

00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:08.480
By the 100th time,
at least for me,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.612
I became numb to it.

00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:13.103
I simply picked up the piece of fruit,

00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:17.215
dug at it with my nails,
tried to flick it off,

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:18.771
and then wondered,

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:22.270
"Was there another sticker?"

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.974
So why is that?

00:02:24.974 --> 00:02:27.126
Why do we get used to everyday things?

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:30.274
Well as human beings,
we have limited brain power.
