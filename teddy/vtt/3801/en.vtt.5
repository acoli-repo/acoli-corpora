00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:30.274
Well as human beings,
we have limited brain power.

00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:35.043
And so our brains encode the 
everyday things we do into habits

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:38.620
so we can free up space 
to learn new things.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.662
It's a process called habituation

00:02:40.662 --> 00:02:44.266
and it's one of the most basic ways,
as humans, we learn.

00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:47.765
Now, habituation isn't always bad.

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:50.611
Remember learning to drive?

00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:52.279
I sure do.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.227
Your hands clenched at 10 and 2
on the wheel,

00:02:56.227 --> 00:02:58.445
looking at every single
object out there --

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:01.695
the cars, the lights, the pedestrians.
