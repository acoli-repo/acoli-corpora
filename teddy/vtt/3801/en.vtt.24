I remember one story 
he told me about screws,

00:12:02.048 --> 00:12:05.678
and about how you need to have
the right screw for the right job.

00:12:05.678 --> 00:12:07.617
There are many different screws:

00:12:07.617 --> 00:12:12.487
wood screws, metal screws,
anchors, concrete screws,

00:12:12.487 --> 00:12:14.232
the list went on and on.

00:12:15.212 --> 00:12:18.485
Our job is to make products
that are easy to install

00:12:18.485 --> 00:12:22.219
for all of our customs themselves
without professionals.

00:12:22.789 --> 00:12:24.210
So what did we do?

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.655
I remembered that story 
that my grandfather told me,

00:12:27.655 --> 00:12:28.928
and so we thought,

00:12:28.928 --> 00:12:31.428
"How many different screws 
can we put in the box?
