00:10:55.575 --> 00:11:00.305
But still, years later,
people were not saving any energy

00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:02.901
because they just couldn't
predict the future.

00:11:03.431 --> 00:11:04.909
So what did we do?

00:11:04.909 --> 00:11:08.978
We put a machine-learning algorithm in
instead of the programming

00:11:08.978 --> 00:11:11.676
that would simply watch
when you turned it up and down,

00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:14.270
when you liked a certain temperature
when you got up,

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.977
or when you went away.

00:11:15.977 --> 00:11:17.245
And you know what?

00:11:17.245 --> 00:11:18.172
It worked.

00:11:18.422 --> 00:11:21.639
People are saving energy 
without any programming.

00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:25.246
So, it doesn't matter what you're doing.

00:11:25.246 --> 00:11:28.512
If you take a step back 
and look at all the boxes,

00:11:28.512 --> 00:11:31.533
maybe there's a way
to remove one or combine them
