00:12:28.928 --> 00:12:31.428
"How many different screws 
can we put in the box?

00:12:31.428 --> 00:12:34.278
Was it going to be two, three,
four, five?

00:12:34.278 --> 00:12:36.574
Because there's so many
different wall types."

00:12:36.574 --> 00:12:39.304
So we thought about it, we optimized it,

00:12:39.304 --> 00:12:43.395
and we came up with three different
screws to put in the box.

00:12:43.845 --> 00:12:46.122
We thought that was going
to solve the problem.

00:12:46.122 --> 00:12:48.817
But it turned out, it didn't.

00:12:49.527 --> 00:12:51.158
So we shipped the product,

00:12:51.158 --> 00:12:53.548
and people weren't having
a great experience.

00:12:54.128 --> 00:12:55.336
So what did we do?

00:12:55.336 --> 00:12:57.081
We went back to the drawing board

00:12:57.081 --> 00:13:00.545
just instantly after we figured out
we didn't get it right.
