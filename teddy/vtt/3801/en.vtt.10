As she was going to her destination,
she noticed the driver opening the window

00:05:02.323 --> 00:05:07.128
to clean off the excess snow
so he could drive safely.

00:05:08.258 --> 00:05:11.834
When he opened the window, though,
he let all this cold, wet air inside,

00:05:11.834 --> 00:05:13.779
making all the passengers miserable.

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:18.122

passengers just thought,

00:05:18.122 --> 00:05:21.373
"It's a fact of life, he's got
to open the window to clean it.

00:05:21.373 --> 00:05:22.766
That's just how it is."

00:05:23.176 --> 00:05:24.711
But Mary didn't.

00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:26.010
Mary thought,

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.844
"What if the diver could actually clean
the windshield from the inside

00:05:29.844 --> 00:05:33.122
so that he could stay safe and drive
