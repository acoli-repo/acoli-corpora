That sticker wasn't there
when I was a kid.

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:04.694
But somewhere as the years passed,

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:07.575
someone had the bright idea
to put that sticker on the fruit.

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:08.292
Why?

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:09.821
So it could be easier for us 


00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:11.558
to check out 
at the grocery counter.

00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:12.651
Well that's great,

00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:14.706
we can get in and out of
the store quickly.

00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:16.784
But now, there's a new problem.

00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:19.443
When we get home and we're hungry

00:01:19.443 --> 00:01:22.874
and we see this ripe, juicy piece
of fruit on the counter,

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:25.719
we just want to pick it up
and eat it.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.455
Except now, we have to look
for this little sticker.
