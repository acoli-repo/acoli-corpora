00:05:33.122 --> 00:05:36.063
and the passengers could 
actually stay warm?"

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:39.355

and began drawing what would become
the world's first windshield wiper.

00:05:44.924 --> 00:05:49.194
Now as a product designer,
I try to learn from people like Mary

00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:51.963

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:55.534

00:05:55.534 --> 00:05:58.881

that almost everyone sees.

00:05:59.894 --> 00:06:03.674
But it's hard to solve a problem
that almost no one sees.
