00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:32.210
and sometimes we find out
we just don't have the right answers.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:38.017
We say, "Son, that's just the way
the world works."

00:14:38.017 --> 00:14:40.567
So the more we're exposed to something,

00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:42.764
the more we get used to it.

00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:44.894
But kids haven't been around 
long enough

00:14:44.894 --> 00:14:46.794
to get used to those things.

00:14:46.794 --> 00:14:48.611
And so when they run into problems,

00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:50.834
they immediately try to solve them,

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:53.576
and sometimes they find a better way,

00:14:53.576 --> 00:14:56.280
and that way really is better.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.119
So my advice that we take to heart
is to have young people on your team,
