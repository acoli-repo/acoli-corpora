00:09:59.627 --> 00:10:01.579
You could turn them up or turn them down.

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:03.279
People understood them.

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:05.772
But in the 1970s,

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.846
the energy crisis struck,

00:10:07.846 --> 00:10:11.416
and customers started thinking about
how to save energy.

00:10:11.416 --> 00:10:12.703
So what happened?

00:10:12.703 --> 00:10:15.731
Thermostat designers decided 
to add a new step.

00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:17.581
Instead of just turning up and down,

00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:19.572
you now had to program it.

00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:22.790
So you could tell it the temperature
you wanted at a certain time.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.586
Now that seemed great.

00:10:24.586 --> 00:10:28.064
Every thermostat had
started adding that feature.

00:10:28.064 --> 00:10:32.340
But it turned out that no one
saved any energy.
