00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:02.385
for the customer after they 
pull it out of the box.

00:08:02.385 --> 00:08:05.451
What did we do instead?

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.541
We ran that product for over two hours.

00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:09.129
Why?

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:12.254
Well, first off, we could make
a higher quality product,

00:08:12.254 --> 00:08:14.404
be easy to test,

00:08:14.404 --> 00:08:17.346
and make sure it was great
for the customer.

00:08:17.906 --> 00:08:19.159
But most importantly,

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:22.178
the battery came fully charged
right out of the box,

00:08:22.178 --> 00:08:23.124
ready to use.

00:08:23.124 --> 00:08:26.956
So that customer, 
with all that exhilaration,

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:28.684
could just start using the product.

00:08:28.684 --> 00:08:31.074
It was great, and it worked.
