Jerry Seinfeld's entire career was built
on noticing those little details,

00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:06.769
those idiotic things we do every day
that we don't even remember.

He tells us about the time 
he visited his friends

00:04:10.615 --> 00:04:13.001
and he just wanted to take 
a comfortable shower.

00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.898

and it was 100 degrees too cold.

00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.726
we just don't remember it.

00:04:29.726 --> 00:04:31.048
