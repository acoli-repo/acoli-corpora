It was great, and it worked.

00:08:31.074 --> 00:08:32.338
People liked it.

00:08:32.338 --> 00:08:35.445
Today, almost every product
that you get that's battery powered

00:08:35.445 --> 00:08:37.508
comes out of the box fully charged,

00:08:37.508 --> 00:08:39.561
even if it doesn't have a hard drive.

00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:44.905
But back then, we noticed 
that detail and we fixed it,

00:08:44.905 --> 00:08:47.253
and now everyone else does that as well.

00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:49.894
No more, "Charge before use."

00:08:50.644 --> 00:08:52.701
So why am I telling you this?

00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:54.809
Well, it's seeing the invisible problem,

00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:59.320
not just the obvious problem,
that's important,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.160
not just for product design,
but for everything we do.
