00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.383
that we all can do,
to fight habituation.

00:09:30.383 --> 00:09:33.777
My first tip is to look broader.

00:09:33.777 --> 00:09:35.889
You see, when you're tackling a problem,

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:39.281
sometimes, there are a lot of steps
that lead up to that problem.

00:09:39.281 --> 00:09:42.351
And sometimes, a lot 
of steps after it.

00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:45.700
If you can take a step back
and look broader,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.971
maybe you can change some of those boxes

00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:48.977
before the problem.

00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:50.337
Maybe you can combine them.

00:09:50.337 --> 00:09:53.672
Maybe you can remove them altogether
to make that better.

00:09:54.258 --> 00:09:56.249
Take thermostats, for instance.

00:09:56.249 --> 00:09:59.627
In the 1900s when they first came out,
they were really simple to use.

00:09:59.627 --> 00:10:01.579
You could turn them up or turn them down.
