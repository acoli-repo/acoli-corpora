I have to wait what felt like an eternity
to use that coveted new toy.

00:07:33.158 --> 00:07:34.850
It was crazy.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.755
But you know what?

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:37.838
Almost every product back then did that.

00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:39.613
When it had batteries in it,

00:07:39.613 --> 00:07:41.890
you had to charge it
before you used it.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.136
Well, Steve noticed that

00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:45.967
and he said,

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:48.565
"We're not going to let that 
happen to our product."

00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:50.413
So what did we do?

00:07:50.413 --> 00:07:53.499
Typically, when you have a product
that has a hard drive in it,

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:56.162
you run it for about 
30 minutes in the factory

00:07:56.162 --> 00:07:59.311
to make sure that hard drive's going 
to be working years later

00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:02.385
for the customer after they 
pull it out of the box.
