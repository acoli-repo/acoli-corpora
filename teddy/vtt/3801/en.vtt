00:00:01.136 --> 00:00:04.389
In the great 1980s movie 
"The Blues Brothers,"

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:09.183
there's a scene where John Belushi
goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment

00:00:09.183 --> 00:00:11.506
in Chicago for the very first time.

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:14.637
It's a cramped, tiny space

00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:17.168
and it's just three feet away
from the train tracks.

00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:20.466
As John sits on Dan's bed,

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.929
a train goes rushing by,

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.153
rattling everything in the room.

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:28.982
John asks, "How often does
that train go by?"

00:00:28.982 --> 00:00:33.542
Dan replies, "So often, you won't
even notice it."
