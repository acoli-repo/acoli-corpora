not just for product design,
but for everything we do.

00:09:02.682 --> 00:09:06.206
You see, there are invisible problems
all around us,

00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:08.462
ones we can solve.

00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:12.286
But first we need
to see them, to feel them.

00:09:12.996 --> 00:09:14.964
So, I'm hesitant to give you any tips

00:09:14.964 --> 00:09:17.695
about neuroscience or psychology.

00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:20.689
There's far too many experienced people
in the TED community

00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:24.083
who would know much more
about that than I ever will.

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:26.710
But let me leave you with
a few tips that I do,

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.383
that we all can do,
to fight habituation.
