00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.333
Before the world of humans began,

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:15.027
there was the world of the gods, 
made of fields, plains and gardens.

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:17.726
Four brothers wandered this 
celestial realm.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:20.028
They had no family other 
than each other—

00:00:20.028 --> 00:00:22.777
they didn’t even know who 
their parents were.

00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:26.482
One of the brothers, Deminan, 
looked different from the others.

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:28.862
His skin was covered in painful scabs,

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:33.202
and he wondered why he alone had 
been marked with this affliction.
