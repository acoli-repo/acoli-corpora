Hi, I'm Katherine,

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:05.626
and I like capitalism,

00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:06.794
a lot.

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:09.881
But in my 20 years
as a libertarian journalist,

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:11.716
I have started to pick up

00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:15.553
that some people aren't as fond
of capitalism as I am.

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:19.265
That's fine, but here's the thing.

00:00:19.265 --> 00:00:24.812
I think a lot of the stuff
that you think you hate about capitalism

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:28.649
is actually stuff to hate
about government.
