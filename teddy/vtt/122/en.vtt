Pat Mitchell: I know you don't like
that "legend" business.

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:05.182
Marian Wright Edelman: I don't.

00:00:05.206 --> 00:00:06.357
(Laughter)

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:07.728
PM: Why not, Marian?

00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:09.586
Because you are somewhat of a legend.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.223
You've been doing this for a long time,

00:00:12.247 --> 00:00:15.064
and you're still there
as founder and president.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.077
MWE: Well, because my daddy raised us
and my mother raised us to serve,

00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:22.477
and we are servant-leaders.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:27.152
And it is not about
external things or labels,

00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:29.564
and I feel like the luckiest
person in the world

00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:33.774
having been born at the intersection
of great needs and great injustices
