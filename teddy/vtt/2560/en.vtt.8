00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.216
We started podcasting,
blogging, writing articles.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.776
I created lists of hundreds of ways

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.816
that men and women
are unequal in our community.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.336
The next thing we did
was build advocacy organizations.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.296
We tried to do things
that were unignorable,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.776
like wearing pants to church
and trying to attend all-male meetings.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.296
These seem like simple things,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.536
but to us, the organizers,
they were enormously costly.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.816
We lost relationships. We lost jobs.
