00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.416
But even more, I had a brother
die in a tragic accident at 15,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.696
and something as simple as this
means we won't be together as a family.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.296
And to my parents, they cannot understand

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.416
why something as simple
as fashion or women's rights

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.136
would prevent me
from seeing my brother again.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.896
And that's the mindset
that we're dealing with,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.016
and criticism does not change that.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.736
And so my parents and I
have been walking this tightrope,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.696
explaining our sides,
respecting one another,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.696
but actually invalidating
each other's very basic beliefs

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.056
by the way we live our lives,
and it's been difficult.
