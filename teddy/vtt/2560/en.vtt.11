00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.576
"They're going to be
homophobic and sexist."

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.656
What they didn't understand

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.240
was that that type of hostility
did not fight religious extremism,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.616
it bred religious extremism.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.056
Those arguments don't work,
and I know because I remember

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.120
someone telling me
that I was stupid for being Mormon.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.656
And what it caused me to do
was defend myself and my people

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.160
and everything we believe in,
because we're not stupid.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.496
So criticism and hostility doesn't work,
and I didn't listen to these arguments.
