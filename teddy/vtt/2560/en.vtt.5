00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.696
From paper routes and babysitting,
I donated 10 percent.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.776
I was the kind of religious
where I heard parents tell children

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.416
when they're leaving
on a two-year proselytizing mission

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.976
that they would rather have them die

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.216
than return home
without honor, having sinned.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.696
I was the type and the kind of religious

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.176
where kids kill themselves
every single year

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.536
because they're terrified
of coming out to our community as gay.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.576
But I was also the kind of religious

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.136
where it didn't matter
where in the world I lived,
