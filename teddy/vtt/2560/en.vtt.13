They're intelligent people.
They're lovely people.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.736
And let me try to help you
understand their perspective.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.736
In Mormonism, we believe
that after you die,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.096
if you keep all the rules
and you follow all the rituals,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.216
you can be together as a family again.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.656
And to my parents,
me doing something as simple

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.056
as having a sleeveless top right now,
showing my shoulders,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.856
that makes me unworthy.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.216
I won't be with my family
in the eternities.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.416
But even more, I had a brother
die in a tragic accident at 15,
