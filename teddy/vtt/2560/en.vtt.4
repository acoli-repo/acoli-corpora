00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.336
you don't smoke, you always do service,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.336
you're a good kid.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.936
Some of the rules we had were strict,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.576
but you followed the rules
because you loved the people

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.256
and you loved the religion
and you believed.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.096
Everything about Mormonism
determined what you wore,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.626
who you dated, who you married.

00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:20.000
It determined what underwear we wore.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.096
I was the kind of religious
where everyone I know

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.496
donated 10 percent of everything
they earned to the church,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.736
including myself.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.696
From paper routes and babysitting,
I donated 10 percent.
