00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.816
We lost relationships. We lost jobs.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.896
We got hate mail on a daily basis.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.256
We were attacked in social media
and national press.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.976
We received death threats.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.216
We lost standing in our community.
Some of us got excommunicated.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.136
Most of us got put
in front of a disciplinary council,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.296
and were rejected
from the communities that we loved

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.320
because we wanted to make them better,
because we believed that they could be.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.736
And I began to expect this reaction
from my own people.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.696
I know what it feels like when you feel
like someone's trying to change you
