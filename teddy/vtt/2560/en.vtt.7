disciplinary councils,
in decision-making capacities,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.216
and I gave my religion a free pass

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.096
because I loved it.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.096
Until I stopped,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.736
and I realized that I had
been allowing myself to be treated

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.656
as the support staff
to the real work of men.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.056
And I faced this contradiction in myself,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.816
and I joined with other activists
in my community.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.216
We've been working very, very, very hard
for the last decade and more.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.454
The first thing we did
was raise consciousness.

00:03:57.478 --> 00:03:59.976
You can't change what you can't see.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.216
We started podcasting,
blogging, writing articles.
