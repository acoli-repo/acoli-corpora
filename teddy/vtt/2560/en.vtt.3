00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.176
I never accepted being excluded
because I was a woman,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.376
except in my religion.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.776
Throughout all of that time,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.096
I was a part of a very patriarchal
orthodox Mormon religion.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.896
I grew up in an enormously
traditional family.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.056
I have eight siblings,
a stay-at-home mother.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.280
My father's actually
a religious leader in the community.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.016
And I grew up in a world believing
that my worth and my standing

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.096
was in keeping these rules
that I'd known my whole life.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.936
You get married a virgin,
you never drink alcohol,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.336
you don't smoke, you always do service,
