00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.496
So criticism and hostility doesn't work,
and I didn't listen to these arguments.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.216
When I hear these arguments,
I still continue to bristle,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.896
because I have family and friends.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.616
These are my people,
and I'm the first to defend them,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.656
but the struggle is real.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.456
How do we respect
someone's religious beliefs

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.776
while still holding them accountable
for the harm or damage

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.096
that those beliefs may cause others?

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.896
It's a tough question.
I still don't have a perfect answer.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.056
My parents and I have been walking
on this tightrope for the last decade.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.816
They're intelligent people.
They're lovely people.
