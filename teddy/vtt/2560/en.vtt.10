I know what it feels like when you feel
like someone's trying to change you

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.736
or criticize you.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.896
But what utterly shocked me
was throughout all of this work

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.120
I received equal measures of vitriol
from the secular left,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.096
the same vehemence as the religious right.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.976
And what my secular friends didn't realize
was that this religious hostility,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.136
these phrases of, "Oh, all religious
people are crazy or stupid."

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.216
"Don't pay attention to religion."

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.576
"They're going to be
homophobic and sexist."
