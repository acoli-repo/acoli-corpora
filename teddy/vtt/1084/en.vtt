Hello! My name is Golan Levin.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm an artist and an engineer,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which is, increasingly, a more common kind of hybrid.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But I still fall into this weird crack

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
where people don't seem to understand me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's a letter from "Artforum" in 1967

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
saying "We can't imagine ever doing a special issue

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
on electronics or computers in art." And they still haven't.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And lest you think that you all, as the digerati, are more enlightened,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I went to the Apple iPhone app store the other day.
