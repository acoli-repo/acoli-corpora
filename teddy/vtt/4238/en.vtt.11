00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
A very difficult time, actually. 



00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And this to me was an important message from Rand. 



00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time. 



00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
This is the first sort of play thing I did, my own serious play. 



00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator-ish thing. 



00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It looks like Illustrator; it can, like, draw. 



00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It was very hard to make this, actually. 



00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It took a month to make this part. 



00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And then I thought, what if I added this feature, 



00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
where I can say, this point, 



00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
you can fly like a bird. You're free, kind of thing.



00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So I could, sort of, change the kind of stability
