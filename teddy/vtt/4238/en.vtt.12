00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So I could, sort of, change the kind of stability 



00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
with a little control there on the dial, 



00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and I can sort of watch it flip around. 


00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And this is in 1993. 


00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And when my professors saw this, they were very upset at me. 



00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
They were saying, Why's it moving? 



00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
They were saying, Make it stop now.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Now, I was saying, Well, that's the whole point: it's moving.



00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And he says, Well, when's it going to stop?



00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And I said, Never.



00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And he said, Even worse. Stop it now.



00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I started studying this whole idea, 



00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
of like, what is this computer? It's a strange medium.
