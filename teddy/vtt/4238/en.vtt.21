00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So, Naomi was pivotal in that. 



00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And so, I began to think more carefully about the computer. 



00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
This was a moment where I was thinking about, 



00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
so, you have a computer program, 



00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
it responds to motion -- X and Y -- 



00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and I realized that each computer program 



00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
has all these images inside the program.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So, if you can see here, you know, 



00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
that program you're seeing in the corner,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
if you spread it out, it's all these things all at once. 



00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
It's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with. 



00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
We're so used to working in one vector. 



00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
This is all at the same time.
