00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
They're laughing because he said, 



00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
draw from the middle-right to the middle, and he kind of messed up.



00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
See, humans don't know how to take orders; 



00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
the computer's so good at it. 



00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once: 



00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
you know, you, pen, do this, and you, pen, do this.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And so began to have multiple pens on the page --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
again, hard to do with our hands. 



00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And then someone discovered this "a-ha moment" 



00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
where you could use coordinate systems. 



00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We thought, ah, this is when it's going to happen. 



00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
In the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing.
