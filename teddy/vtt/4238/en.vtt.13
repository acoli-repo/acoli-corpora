00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
of like, what is this computer? It's a strange medium.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It's not like print. It's not like video. 



00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium. 



00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So, I went off with this, 



00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and began to look for things even more.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And so in Japan, I began to experiment with people. 



00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
This is actually bad: human experiments. 



00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I would do these things where I'd have students become pens: 



00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
there's blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen. 



00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And someone sits down and draws a picture.
