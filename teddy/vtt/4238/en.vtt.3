She'd make this kind of, like, wall of tofu cooking, 



00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and it would confuse the customers, 



00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
because they all thought it was a restaurant.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
A bad sort of branding thing, or whatever. 



00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But, anyway, that's where I grew up, 



00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
in this little tofu factory in Seattle, 



00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and it was kind of like this: 



00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture.



00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really: 



00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
he would invent, like, ways to make things heavy.



00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Like back here, there's like, concrete block technology here, 



00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu, 


00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing,
