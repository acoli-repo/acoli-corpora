00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
for two weeks in the store, and that week -- 



00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
now, those two weeks were when my older brother and I 



00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
had to do everything.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And that was torture, real torture. 



00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Because, you see, we'd seen my father 



00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
taking the big block of tofu and cutting it,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
like, knife in, zap, zap, zap. We thought, wow. 



00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, the first time I did that, I went, like, whoa! Like this. 



00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Bad blocks. But anyways, 



00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And because working in a store was so hard, 



00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I liked going to school; it was like heaven. 



00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And I was really good at school.
