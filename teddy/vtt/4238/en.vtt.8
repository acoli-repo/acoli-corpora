00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And then luckily, you know, 



00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I had the fortune of going to something called a library, 



00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and in the library I came upon this very book. 



00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I found this book. It's called, 



00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
"Thoughts on Design," by a man named Paul Rand.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this. 



00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy, Paul Rand, 



00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
who was one of the greatest graphic designers, 



00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and also a great writer as well. 



00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And when I saw this man's work, 



00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I realized how bad I was at design,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
or whatever I called it back then, 



00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and I suddenly had a kind of career goal, 



00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
kind of in hot pursuit.
