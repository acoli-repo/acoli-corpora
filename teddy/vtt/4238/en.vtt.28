00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
but the thing I love the most is to 



00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
experience, taste the world.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
The world is just so tasty. 



00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
We think we'll go to a museum; that's where all the tastes are. 



00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
No, they're all out there. 



00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So, this is, like, in front of the Eiffel Tower, really,



00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
actually, around the Louvre area. 



00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
This I found, where nature had made a picture for me. 



00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
This is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature. 



00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
In this strange moment where, like, these things kind of appeared.



00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We all are creative people. 



00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
We have this gene defect in our mind.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
We can't help but stop, right? This feeling's a wonderful thing. 



00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
It's the forever-always-on museum.
