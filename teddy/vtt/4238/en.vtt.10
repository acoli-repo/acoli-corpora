00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
so, wow, my design's in a book, you know? 



00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
After that, things kind of got strange, 



00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and I got thinking about the computer, 



00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
because the computer to me always, kind of, bothered me. 



00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand



00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
was a kind of crusty designer, 



00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
you know, a crusty designer, like a good -- kind of like a good French bread? 



00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You know, he wrote in one of his books: 



00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
"A Yale student once said,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
'I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.' 



00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Design schools take heed." 



00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
This is in the '80s,



00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
in the great clash of computer/non-computer people.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
A very difficult time, actually.
