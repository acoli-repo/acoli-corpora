I'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity, actually,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
so I thought I'd make my life more complex, as a serious play.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, I'm going to, like, go through some slides 



00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
from way back when,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So, basically it all began with 



00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
this whole idea of a computer.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Who has a computer? Yeah.



00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
O.K., so, everyone has a computer.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Even a mobile phone, it's a computer. 



00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And -- anyone remember this workbook, 



00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Instant Activities for Your Apple" -- 



00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
free poster in each book?
