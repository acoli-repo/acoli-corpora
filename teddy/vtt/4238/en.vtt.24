00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Do you hear that? It's like cows. This is at 4 a.m. at Logan. 



00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So, I was wondering, like, 



00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
what is this thing in front of me, this computer thing? 



00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
It didn't make any sense. 



00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So, I began to make things again. This is another series of objects


00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
made of old computers from my basement. 



00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I made -- I took my old Macintoshes 



00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and made different objects out of them from Tokyo. 


00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves, 



00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots. 



00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I made this series of works. 



00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle
