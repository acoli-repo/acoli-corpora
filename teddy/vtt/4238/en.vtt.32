Wow, RISD wants to know what itself is. 



00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And I have no idea what RISD should be, actually, 



00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
or what it wants to be, but one thing I have to tell you is that



00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
although I'm a technologist, I don't like technology very much. 



00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
It's a, kind of, the qi thing, or whatever. 



00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
People say, 


00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Are you going to bring RISD into the future?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD. 



00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
There's my perspective. Because in reality, 



00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
the problem isn't how to make the world more technological. 



00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
It's about how to make it more humane again. 



00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And if anything, I think RISD has a strange DNA. 



00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
It's a strange exuberance
