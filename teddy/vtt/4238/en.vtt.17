This computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard, 



00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.



00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And this computer's programmed to do only one thing, which is,



00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
if you move your mouse, the mouse changes on the screen. 



00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
On the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around. 



00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
On this computer, if you move the mouse, it takes half an hour 



00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
for the mouse cursor to change. 



00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
To give you a sense of the speed, the scale: 



00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
the computer is just so amazingly fast, O.K.?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And so, after this I began to do experiments for different companies.



00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
This is something I did for Sony in 1996. 



00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It was three Sony "H" devices
