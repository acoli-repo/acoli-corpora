00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And I was really good at school. 



00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So, when I got to MIT, you know, 



00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
as most of you who are creatives,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
your parents all told you not to be creative, right? 



00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So, same way, you know, 



00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I was good at art and good at math, and my father says, he's --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
John's good at math. 



00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I went to MIT, did my math, 



00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
but I had this wonderful opportunity,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
because computers had just become visual. 



00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The Apple -- Macintosh just came out; 



00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT. 



00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And it was a time when a guy who, kind of, 



00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
could cross the two sides --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it was a good time.
