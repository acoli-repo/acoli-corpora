And if anything, I think RISD has a strange DNA. 



00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
It's a strange exuberance



00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
about materials, about the world:

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
a fascination that I think the world needs 



00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
quite very much right now.


00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
So, thank you everyone.
