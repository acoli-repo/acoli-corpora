00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So, three years ago I discovered, the letters M-I-T 



00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
occurring in simplicity and complexity. 



00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
My alma mater, MIT, and I had this moment -- 



00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
a kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment -- 



00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
where I thought, Whoa! I have to do this.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And I went after it with passion. 



00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
However, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose --



00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
going to RISD -- and I couldn't reconcile this real easy, 


00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
because the letters had told me, MIT forever. 



00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
But I discovered in the French word raison d'être. 



00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
I was, like, aha, wait a second. 



00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And there RISD appeared.
