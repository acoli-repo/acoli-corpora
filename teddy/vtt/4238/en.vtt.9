00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and I suddenly had a kind of career goal, 



00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
kind of in hot pursuit.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So I kind of switched. I went to MIT, finished. 


00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I got my masters,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So, I was published, you know, 



00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
so, wow, my design's in a book, you know? 



00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
After that, things kind of got strange,
