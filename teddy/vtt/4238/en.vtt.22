00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
This is all at the same time.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
The computer lives in so many dimensions. 



00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And also, at the same time I was frustrated, 



00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere, 



00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and there were these, like, "the computer lab," you know, 



00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and this is, like, in the late 1990s, 



00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and this is in Basel,


00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
a great graphic design school.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And here's this, like, dirty, kind of, shoddy, 


00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
kind of, dark computer room. 



00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And I began to wonder, Is this the goal? 



00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Is this what we want, you know? 



00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And also, I began to be fascinated by machines -- 



00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
you know, like copy machines -- and so this is actually in Basel.
