00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
could cross the two sides --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it was a good time. 



00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And so, I remember that my first major piece of software 



00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000

is, your head gets kind of big really easy. 



00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And when I was making icons, I was, like, 



00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the icon master,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and I was, like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know. 



00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
