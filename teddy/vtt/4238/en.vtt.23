00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And also, I began to be fascinated by machines -- 



00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
you know, like copy machines -- and so this is actually in Basel.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive -- 



00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
this is, like, a touch screen -- 



00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and I noticed how you can only touch five places, 



00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and so, "why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere?" 



00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
became a question. And also, the sound: 



00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone. 



00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
You get it? No? O.K.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And also, I discovered in Logan airport, 



00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
this was, like, calling out to me.
