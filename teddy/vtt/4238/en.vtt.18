00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
This is something I did for Sony in 1996. 



00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It was three Sony "H" devices 



00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that responded to sound.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So, if you talk into the mike,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
you'll hear some music in your headphones; 



00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
if you talk in the phone, then video would happen. 



00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So, I began to experiment with industry in different ways 



00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
with this kind of mixture of skills. 



00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol, but I do drink sometimes. 



00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And Chanel. So, getting to do different projects. 



00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And also, one thing I realized is that 



00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I like to make things.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
We like to make things. It's fun to make things. 



00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And so I never developed the ability to have a staff. 



00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I have no staff; it's all kind of made by hand --
