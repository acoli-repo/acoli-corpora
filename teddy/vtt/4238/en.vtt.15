00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We thought, ah, this is when it's going to happen. 



00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
In the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing. 



00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It became computerish; we began to think computerish -- 



00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
the X, Y system -- and so that was kind of a revelation. 



00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people, 



00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
called a human-powered computer. 



00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So, this happened in 1993.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Sound down, please. 



00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It's a computer where the people are the parts. 



00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I have behind this wall a disk drive, a CPU, 



00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
a graphics card, a memory system. 



00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard.
