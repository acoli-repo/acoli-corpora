They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard. 



00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
It's put inside the computer. 



00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And that little program's on that cardboard disk. 



00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, she wears the disk, 



00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and reads the data off the sectors of the disk,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really. 



00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I had a moment of -- what is it called? -- 



00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast. 



00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
This computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard,
