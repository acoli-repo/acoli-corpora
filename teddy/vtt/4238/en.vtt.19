00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And so I never developed the ability to have a staff. 



00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I have no staff; it's all kind of made by hand -- 



00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
these sort of broken hands.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And these hands were influenced 



00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
by this man, Mr. Inami Naomi.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
This guy was my kind of like mentor. 



00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo. 



00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
He's the guy that kind of discovered me, 



00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and kind of got me going in digital media. 



00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He was such an inspirational guy. 



00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I remember, like, we'd be in his studio, like, at 2 a.m., 



00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and then he'd show up from some client meeting. 



00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
He'd come in and say, you know, 



00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
If I am here, everything is okay.
