00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I made a whole installation out of blue tape -- blue painters' tape.



00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me, 



00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think, 



00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Well, what else is there in life? 



00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And so computers, as you know, 



00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
these big computers, there are now tiny computers. 



00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
They're littler computers, so the one-chip computers, 



00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I began to program one-chip computers 



00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and make objects out of P.C. boards, LEDs.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I began to make LED sculptures 



00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that would live inside little boxes out of MDF. 



00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy. 



00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Very simple boxes: you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs.
