00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
He'd come in and say, you know, 



00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
If I am here, everything is okay.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And you'd feel so much better, you know. 



00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And I'll never forget how, like, but -- I'll never forget how, like,



00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
he had a sudden situation with his -- he had an aneurysm. 



00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
He went into a coma.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And so, for three years he was out, and he could only blink, 



00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and so I realized at this moment, I thought, wow --



00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
how fragile is this thing we're wearing, 



00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
this body and mind we're wearing, 



00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and so I thought, How do you go for it more? 



00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
How do you take that time you have left and go after it? 



00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So, Naomi was pivotal in that. 



00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And so, I began to think more carefully about the computer.
