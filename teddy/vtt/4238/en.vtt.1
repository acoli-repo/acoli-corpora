00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
free poster in each book?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This was how computing began. 



00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Don't forget: a computer came out; it had no software. 



00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in, 



00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and it would do absolutely nothing at all. 



00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, you had to program it, 



00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and there were great programming, like, tutorials, like this. 



00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I mean, this was great. 



00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's, like, you know, Herbie the Apple II.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's such a great way to -- 



00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I mean, they should make Java books like this, 



00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we've have no problem learning a program. 



00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But this was a great, grand time of the computer, 



00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
when it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era.
