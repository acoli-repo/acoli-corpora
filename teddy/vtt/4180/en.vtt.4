00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.980
just like an arrow that’s left a bow
doesn’t come back.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.560
And sometimes it becomes
a danger to a human life.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.220
After Rebecca’s suicide,
I created an app, ReThink:

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.710
an app that lets you pause
and gives you a chance to think again

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.580
before you say something, 
just think it through once again.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.760
I am 17 years old and I am from Chicago.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.480
I am a change agent.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.270
A social entrepreneur.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.820
I look for solutions to problems in 
society and for betterment of the world.
