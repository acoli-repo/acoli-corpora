00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.210
our youngest speaker,
Trisha Prabhu, thought:

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.590
Can we stop the hurtful words 
before we actually post them?

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.110
She thinks yes, we can stop this.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.000
So today, from Chicago, USA,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.140
Trisha is here to tell us how we can
stop the words before they cause any harm.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.450
Please welcome our young innovator 
and social entrepreneur, Trisha Prabhu.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.680
