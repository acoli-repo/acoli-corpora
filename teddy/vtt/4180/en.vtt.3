00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.860
In the cyber world and social media,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.930
she was tortured in different ways.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.640
She was troubled.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.050
I felt awful when I learnt about this.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.580
Even felt anger.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.790
A girl younger than me 
was forced to commit suicide.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.160
And at that moment I decided
that I will definitely,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.560
surely do something about this.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.200
As you know...

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.910
anything said on social media 
cannot be taken back,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.980
just like an arrow that’s left a bow
doesn’t come back.
