For instance, if a student is 
about to post a message saying

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.320
"Your face is very ugly,"

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.800
ReThink will catch
this message and ask you,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.250
“Please stop, do you
really want to post this?”

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.240
When this slight break happened,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.800
most teenagers changed their mind 
and did not post the message.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.880
I did a study for the ReThink project 
with 300 teenagers,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.500
who were 12 to 18 years old.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.600
150 teenagers were
randomly given ReThink.
