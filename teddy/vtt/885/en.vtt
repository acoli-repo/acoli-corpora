00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.494
In half a century of trying to help prevent wars,

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:08.009
there's one question that never leaves me:

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:11.725
How do we deal with extreme violence

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:15.226
without using force in return?

00:00:15.226 --> 00:00:17.777
When you're faced with brutality,

00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:20.693
whether it's a child facing a bully on a playground

00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:22.393
or domestic violence --

00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:25.309
or, on the streets of Syria today,

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:27.860
facing tanks and shrapnel,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.207
what's the most effective thing to do?
