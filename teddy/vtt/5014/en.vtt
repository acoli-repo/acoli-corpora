00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:13.616
Most of the forest lives in the 
shadow of the giants

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:15.757
that make up the highest canopy.

00:00:15.757 --> 00:00:17.376
These are the oldest trees,

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:21.003
with hundreds of children and 
thousands of grandchildren.

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.325
They check in with their neighbors, 
sharing food, supplies,

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:27.468
and wisdom gained over their long lives.

00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:33.564
They do all this rooted in place, unable 
to speak, reach out, or move around.
