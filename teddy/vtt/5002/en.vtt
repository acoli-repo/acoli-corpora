00:00:02.518 --> 00:00:06.337
"The Second Coming" 
by William Butler Yeats

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.398
Turning and turning in the widening gyre

00:00:10.398 --> 00:00:14.310
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.579
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.099
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.749
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed,
and everywhere

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.939
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
