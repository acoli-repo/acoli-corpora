It is estimated that in India,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.879
one in 28 women are likely to be diagnosed
with breast cancer during their lifetime.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.799
Since this form of cancer

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.919
we are able to save 
only one out of two patients.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.825
In developed countries, 
a mammogram machine is used

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:21.079
for early detection of breast cancer.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.079

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.079
So what can be done
