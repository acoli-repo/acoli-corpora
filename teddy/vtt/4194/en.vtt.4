00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.159
that it reaches
every village, every society.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.839
And thirdly,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.040
this new invention should not
involve any pain or radiation.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.439
During this time of my search,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.720
innovators from 
Drexel University in America,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.180
from where I did my computer engineering,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.609
developed a new invention:

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.599
A new sensor technology.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.719
The knot of breast cancer is hard,
like the seed of the Neem tree.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.499
This sensor can detect that hardness.
