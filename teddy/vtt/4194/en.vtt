Shah Rukh Khan:
Computer engineer Mihir Shah,

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:10.319
while doing research on a serious illness,
realized that the world

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.799
is divided in two halves.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.559
One where it is easy to detect
and treat the illness

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.059
and the other half,
where unfortunately we live,

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:23.000
where it is so difficult
to even identify the illness.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.939
We now welcome on 
TED Talks India Nayi Soch,

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.729
Indian computer engineer and innovator
from Pennsylvania, USA: Mihir Shah.

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.519
He has tried to bridge the gap
