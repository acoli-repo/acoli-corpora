00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.079
So what can be done

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.079
to ensure that every woman can
have access to early detection?

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.399
For the past seven years,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.279
finding an answer to this
question has been my goal.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.960
I have read many research
papers and books on cancer.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.359
My research yielded
three points of information.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.400
Firstly,

00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:51.039
early detection should be done
by women health workers

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.999
who are reaching out 
and serving a large number of women.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.399
Secondly,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.119
the solution should be such

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.159
that it reaches
every village, every society.
