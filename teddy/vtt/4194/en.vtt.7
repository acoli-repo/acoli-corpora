00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.319
On switching it on,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.489
the machine connects itself to a tablet
and starts conducting the test.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.839
The nurse then moves it
to different areas of the breast

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.030
and checks in this manner.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.679
If a knot is detected,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.028
the tablet shows a red dot immediately.

00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:50.279
And within minutes, 
test results can be seen on the spot.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.479
If the test results are positive,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.199
the red area can be further
checked through ultrasound

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.519
to determine if a biopsy is needed or not.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.319
We have reached 60,000 women
with this breast check up
