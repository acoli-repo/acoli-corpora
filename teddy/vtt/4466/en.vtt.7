This is the role that ideas play
in shaping us as human beings,

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.040
and this is why idea technology may be
the most profoundly important technology

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.560
that science gives us.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.020
And there's something special
about idea technology,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.030
that makes it different
from the technology of things.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.180
With things, if the technology sucks,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.230
it just vanishes, right?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.110
Bad technology disappears.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.010
With ideas --

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.050
false ideas about human beings
will not go away
