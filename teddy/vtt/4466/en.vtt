Today I'm going to talk about work.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.180
And the question I want to ask
and answer is this:

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.120
"Why do we work?"

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.060
Why do we drag ourselves
out of bed every morning

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.100
instead of living our lives

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.180
just filled with bouncing from one
TED-like adventure to another?

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.010
(Laughter)

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.080
You may be asking yourselves
that very question.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.200
Now, I know of course,
we have to make a living,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.050
but nobody in this room thinks
that that's the answer to the question,
