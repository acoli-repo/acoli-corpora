00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.050
but nobody in this room thinks
that that's the answer to the question,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.100
"Why do we work?"

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.100
For folks in this room,
the work we do is challenging,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.010
it's engaging, it's stimulating,
it's meaningful.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.070
And if we're lucky,
it might even be important.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
So, we wouldn't work
if we didn't get paid,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.040
but that's not why we do what we do.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.090
And in general,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.160
I think we think that material rewards
are a pretty bad reason

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.090
for doing the work that we do.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.130
When we say of somebody
that he's "in it for the money,"

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.010
we are not just being descriptive.
