00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.100
was convinced that human beings
were by their very natures lazy,

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.110
and wouldn't do anything
unless you made it worth their while,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.110
and the way you made it worth their while

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.110
was by incentivizing,
by giving them rewards.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.060
That was the only reason
anyone ever did anything.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.210
So we created a factory system consistent
with that false view of human nature.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.180
But once that system
of production was in place,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.180
there was really no other way
for people to operate,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.030
except in a way that was consistent
with Adam Smith's vision.
