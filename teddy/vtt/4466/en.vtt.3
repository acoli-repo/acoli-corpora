00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.100
How is it that we allow
the majority of people on the planet

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.100
to do work that is monotonous,
meaningless and soul-deadening?

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.070
Why is it that as capitalism developed,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.120
it created a mode of production,
of goods and services,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.090
in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions
that might come from work were eliminated?

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.100
Workers who do this kind of work,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.060
whether they do it in factories,
in call centers,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.180
or in fulfillment warehouses,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.180
do it for pay.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.000
There is certainly no other earthly reason
to do what they do except for pay.
