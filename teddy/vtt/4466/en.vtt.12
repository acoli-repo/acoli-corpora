Whether he intended it or not,
what Adam Smith was telling us there,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.030
is that the very shape of the institution
within which people work

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.130
creates people who are fitted
to the demands of that institution

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.030
and deprives people of the opportunity

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.510
to derive the kinds of satisfactions
from their work that we take for granted.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.090
The thing about science --
natural science --

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.210
is that we can spin fantastic
theories about the cosmos,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.160
and have complete confidence

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.430
that the cosmos is completely
indifferent to our theories.
