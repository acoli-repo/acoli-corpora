There is certainly no other earthly reason
to do what they do except for pay.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.070
So the question is, "Why?"

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.220
And here's the answer:

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.100
the answer is technology.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.190
Now, I know, I know --

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.080
yeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation
screws people, blah blah --

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.200
that's not what I mean.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.120
I'm not talking about
the kind of technology

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.120
that has enveloped our lives,
and that people come to TED to hear about.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.110
I'm not talking about
the technology of things,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.100
profound though that is.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.090
I'm talking about another technology.
