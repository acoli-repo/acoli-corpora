I'm talking about another technology.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.080
I'm talking about the technology of ideas.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.140
I call it, "idea technology" --

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.210
how clever of me.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.030
(Laughter)

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.140
In addition to creating things,
science creates ideas.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.120
Science creates ways of understanding.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.070
And in the social sciences,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.060
the ways of understanding that get created
are ways of understanding ourselves.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.130
And they have an enormous influence
on how we think, what we aspire to,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.030
and how we act.
