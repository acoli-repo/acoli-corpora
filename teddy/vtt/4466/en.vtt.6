and how we act.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.200
If you think your poverty
is God's will, you pray.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.160
If you think your poverty is the result
of your own inadequacy,

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.110
you shrink into despair.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.210
And if you think your poverty is
the result of oppression and domination,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.220
then you rise up in revolt.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.020
Whether your response to poverty
is resignation or revolution,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.200
depends on how you understand
the sources of your poverty.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.100
This is the role that ideas play
in shaping us as human beings,
