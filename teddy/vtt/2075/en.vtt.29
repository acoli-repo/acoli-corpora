00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
How many years of protection do I need?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
What does that do to the payments

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and to the interest rates and so forth?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
that should be asked in exams,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
but I think it's a very important type

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
that right now just gets completely ignored

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and is critical for people's real understanding.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So I believe [there is] critical reform

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
we have to do in computer-based math.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
We have got to make sure

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that we can move our economies forward,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and also our societies,
