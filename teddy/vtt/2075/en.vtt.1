00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
than at any point in human history.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So at one end we've got falling interest

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in education in math,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a more quantitative world than we ever have had.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and what can we do to fix it?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Well actually, I think the answer

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is staring us right in the face:

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Use computers.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I believe

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that correctly using computers

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is the silver bullet

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
for making math education work.
