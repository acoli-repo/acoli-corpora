00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
mostly by hand.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Lots of things that seem simple

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and not difficult like in the real world,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
except if you're learning it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And another thing about math:

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
math sometimes looks like math --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
like in this example here --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and sometimes it doesn't --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
like "Am I drunk?"

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You wouldn't have expected that a few years back.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But now you can find out all about --
