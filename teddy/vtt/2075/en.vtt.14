00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and perhaps even be spiked into doing that.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So what are the issues people bring up with this?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
You shouldn't use the machine

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
until you get the basics of the subject.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?"

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Basics of what?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Are the basics of driving a car

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
learning how to service it, or design it for that matter?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I don't think so.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do
