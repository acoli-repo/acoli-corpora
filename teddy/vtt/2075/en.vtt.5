00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
what I call "everyday living" --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to function in the world today,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
you've got to be pretty quantitative,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
much more so than a few years ago:

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
figure out your mortgages,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and thirdly, what I would call something like

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
logical mind training, logical thinking.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Over the years

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
we've put so much in society

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's very important to learn that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
math is a great way to do that.
