00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
math is not equal to calculating.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Math is a much broader subject than calculating.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
over hundreds of years.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But in the last few decades

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that has totally changed.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
that I could ever imagine with computers.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Calculating was typically the limiting step,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and now often it isn't.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So I think in terms of the fact that math

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
has been liberated from calculating.
