But now you can find out all about --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
unfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
all about what happens.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So let's zoom out a bit and ask,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000

What's the point of teaching people math?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?

Why is it such an important part of education

as a sort of compulsory subject?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Well, I think there are about three reasons:

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
so critical to the development of our economies,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
what I call "everyday living" --
