00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
is we have a unique opportunity

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
to make maths both more practical

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and more conceptual, simultaneously.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It's usually some kind of choice

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
between the vocational and the intellectual.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
But I think we can do both at the same time here.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And we open up so many more possibilities.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
You can do so many more problems.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
What I really think we gain from this

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
is students getting intuition and experience

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And experience of harder problems --
