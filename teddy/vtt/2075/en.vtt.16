00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
from engineering of the car

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
or learning how to service it.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So automation allows this separation

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and also allows -- in the case of driving,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and I believe also in the future case of maths --

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
a democratized way of doing that.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It can be spread across a much larger number of people

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
who can really work with that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So there's another thing that comes up with basics.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
People confuse, in my view,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
the order of the invention of the tools

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
with the order in which they should use them for teaching.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So just because paper was invented before computers,
