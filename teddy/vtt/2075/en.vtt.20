00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
where the computer was the teacher --

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
This is just nuts.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that the computer should be doing anyway?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
All backwards.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Let me show you

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that you can also make problems harder to calculate.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
See, normally in school,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
you do things like solve quadratic equations.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
But you see, when you're using a computer,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
you can just substitute.
