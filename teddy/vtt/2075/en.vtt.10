00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
has been liberated from calculating.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
But that math liberation didn't get into education yet.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
See, I think of calculating, in a sense,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
as the machinery of math.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
It's the chore.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It's a means to an end, not an end in itself,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and automation allows us

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to have that machinery.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Computers allow us to do that --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and this is not a small problem by any means.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I estimated that, just today, across the world,
