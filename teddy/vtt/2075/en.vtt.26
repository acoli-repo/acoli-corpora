Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
But actually many of the concepts

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
are amenable to a much younger age group.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
This was an example I built for my daughter.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And very, very simple.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
We were talking about what happens

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
when you increase the number of sides of a polygon

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
to a very large number.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And of course, it turns into a circle.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And by the way, she was also very insistent

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
on being able to change the color,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
an important feature for this demonstration.
