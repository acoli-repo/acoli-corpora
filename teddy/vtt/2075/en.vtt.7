00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So the next thing is take that problem

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and turn it from a real world problem

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
into a math problem.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That's stage two.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Once you've done that, then there's the computation step.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Turn it from that into some answer

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
in a mathematical form.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And of course, math is very powerful at doing that.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And then finally, turn it back to the real world.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Did it answer the question?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And also verify it -- crucial step.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Now here's the crazy thing right now.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
In math education,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time
