00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I don't think so -- quite the opposite.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So the problem we've really got in math education

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
is not that computers might dumb it down,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
but that we have dumbed-down problems right now.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Well, another issue people bring up

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
is somehow that hand calculating procedures

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
teach understanding.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So if you go through lots of examples,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
you can get the answer,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
you can understand how the basics of the system work better.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.
