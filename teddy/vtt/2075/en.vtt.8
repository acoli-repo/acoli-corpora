00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
teaching people to do step three by hand.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Yet, that's the one step computers can do

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
better than any human after years of practice.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Instead, we ought to be using computers

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to do step three

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and using the students to spend much more effort

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
on learning how to do steps one, two and four --

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
conceptualizing problems, applying them,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
getting the teacher to run them through how to do that.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
See, crucial point here:

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
math is not equal to calculating.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Math is a much broader subject than calculating.
