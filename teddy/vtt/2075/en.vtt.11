I estimated that, just today, across the world,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
we spent about 106 average world lifetimes

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
teaching people how to calculate by hand.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So we better be damn sure --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
so we better be damn sure

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that we know why we're doing that

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and it has a real purpose.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I think we should be assuming computers

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
for doing the calculating

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And I think there are some cases.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
For example: mental arithmetic.
