00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
for making math education work.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So to explain that,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and what it looks like in education.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
See, in the real world

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's done by geologists,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
engineers, biologists,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
all sorts of different people --

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
modeling and simulation.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It's actually very popular.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But in education it looks very different --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
mostly by hand.
