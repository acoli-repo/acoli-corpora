00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
you can just substitute.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Same principles applied --

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
calculations, harder.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And problems in the real world

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
look nutty and horrible like this.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
They've got hair all over them.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And think of the outside world.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Do we really believe that engineering and biology

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and all of these other things

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that have so benefited from computers and maths

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I don't think so -- quite the opposite.
