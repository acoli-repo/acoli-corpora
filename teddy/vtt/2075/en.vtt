00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We've got a real problem with math education right now.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Basically, no one's very happy.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Those learning it

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
think it's disconnected,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
uninteresting and hard.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Those trying to employ them

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
think they don't know enough.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but don't know how to fix it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And teachers are also frustrated.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Yet math is more important to the world

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
than at any point in human history.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So at one end we've got falling interest
