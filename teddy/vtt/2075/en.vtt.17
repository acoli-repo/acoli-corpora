So just because paper was invented before computers,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
by using paper instead of a computer

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to teach mathematics.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
She enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops."

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
(Laughter)

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I didn't make these.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Why do you think that was?"

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And after a second or two, carefully reflecting,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
she said, "No paper?"

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
(Laughter)
