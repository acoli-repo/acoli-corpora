00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's very important to learn that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
math is a great way to do that.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So let's ask another question.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
What is math?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
What do we mean when we say we're doing math,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
or educating people to do math?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
starting with posing the right question.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
beyond virtually any other part of doing math.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
People ask the wrong question,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
for that reason, if not for others.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So the next thing is take that problem
