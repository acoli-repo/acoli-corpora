00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And I think there are some cases.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
For example: mental arithmetic.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
People say, "Is such and such true?"

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I'll say, "Hmm, not sure." I'll think about it roughly.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
It's still quicker to do that and more practical.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So I think practicality is one case

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
where it's worth teaching people by hand.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And then there are certain conceptual things

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that can also benefit from hand calculating,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
but I think they're relatively small in number.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
One thing I often ask about

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
is ancient Greek and how this relates.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
See, the thing we're doing right now

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
is we're forcing people to learn mathematics.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It's a major subject.
