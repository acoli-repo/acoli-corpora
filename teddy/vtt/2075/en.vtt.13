00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
is we're forcing people to learn mathematics.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It's a major subject.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
or in following their own interests

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
in any subject however bizarre --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
they should do that.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
That's absolutely the right thing,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
for people to follow their self-interest.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
but I don't think that we should force the entire population

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to learn a subject like ancient Greek.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I don't think it's warranted.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So I have this distinction between what we're making people do

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and the subject that's sort of mainstream

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest
