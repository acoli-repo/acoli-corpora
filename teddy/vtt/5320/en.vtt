00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.609
So, I'd like to talk about
the development of human potential,

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:09.723
and I'd like to start with maybe the most
impactful modern story of development.

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:13.527
Many of you here have probably heard
of the 10,000 hours rule.

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:15.661
Maybe you even model
your own life after it.

00:00:15.685 --> 00:00:18.434
Basically, it's the idea
that to become great in anything,

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:21.394
it takes 10,000 hours
of focused practice,

00:00:21.418 --> 00:00:23.772
so you'd better get started
as early as possible.

00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:27.711
The poster child for this story
is Tiger Woods.

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:30.997
His father famously gave him a putter
when he was seven months old.
