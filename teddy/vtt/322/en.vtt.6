00:02:59.402 --> 00:03:02.393
again this year. Mwah!

00:03:02.393 --> 00:03:05.919
Okay, next question. (Applause)

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.896
Next, please.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:08.992
"Is dating boring,

00:03:08.992 --> 00:03:11.576
now that humans reproduce asexually?"

00:03:11.576 --> 00:03:15.436
Who do we got?

00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:18.276
Hi, um, okay, hi everybody.

00:03:18.276 --> 00:03:19.820
My name is Nereida.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.148
I just want to say first of all

00:03:21.148 --> 00:03:23.670
that dating is never boring under any circumstance.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.390
But I am very excited to be here right now,

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.804
so I am just trying to remind myself that,

00:03:27.804 --> 00:03:29.589
you know, like, the purpose
of being here and everything,

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:32.294
I mean, trying to answer these
questions, it is very exciting.
