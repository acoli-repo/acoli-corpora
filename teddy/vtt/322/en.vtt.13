00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:31.051
but as far as I'm concerned,

00:06:31.051 --> 00:06:32.867
you know, I believe in creative commons,

00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:35.597
and I think it's really important that, you know,

00:06:35.597 --> 00:06:37.933
that needs to be sustainable and everything,

00:06:37.933 --> 00:06:40.617
and I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

00:06:40.617 --> 00:06:41.883
I mean, this right here,

00:06:41.883 --> 00:06:43.717
this environment, I would like to sustain.

00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:45.101
You know what I mean?

00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:47.565
But I'm just saying, if y'all are interested

00:06:47.565 --> 00:06:49.593
in the top five songs, you need to holler at me.

00:06:49.593 --> 00:06:51.161
You know what I'm saying?

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.483
Aight? In the future or the present. Yeah.

00:06:53.483 --> 00:06:55.040
Enjoy the rest of it.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.231
Okay, next question.

00:06:57.231 --> 00:06:58.893
What do you got?

00:06:58.893 --> 00:07:00.821
"How many of your organs have been 3D printed?"
