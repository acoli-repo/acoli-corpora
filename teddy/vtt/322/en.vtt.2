00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.168
I would really try to inhabit them.

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:01.525
And for example,

00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:03.700
I don't really talk like that,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.494
but that was one of my people,

00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:09.578
and I'm going to bring a few of my friends --

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:11.130
I think of them as my friends —

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.612
to this stage, in this spirit of the idea

00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:16.004
that the present is the new future,

00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:17.960
in sort of a meta way,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.950
because I thought about it, and the future, for me,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.428
what can be so frightening

00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:23.394
is that I don't know what's coming.

00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:24.856
I don't know if that's true for other people,

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:27.144
but that notion of thinking about

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:30.327
how we can understand the future
