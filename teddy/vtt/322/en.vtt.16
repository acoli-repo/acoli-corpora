00:07:57.695 --> 00:08:00.109
even in the future we will have the publication,

00:08:00.109 --> 00:08:03.955
kind of, you know, all the food that's fit to print.

00:08:03.955 --> 00:08:06.217
But everybody, please do enjoy that,

00:08:06.227 --> 00:08:08.270
and again, I think that you do throw

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.107
a cracking good party here at TED.

00:08:10.107 --> 00:08:12.037
Thank you.

00:08:12.037 --> 00:08:16.327
Next question. (Applause)

00:08:16.327 --> 00:08:23.421
What has changed? Okay, it's like,

00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:25.743
I have to think about that.

00:08:25.743 --> 00:08:30.444
"What has changed now that women run the world?"
