00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:02.023
Okay, next question. (Applause)

00:05:02.023 --> 00:05:06.719
What are your top five favorite songs right now?

00:05:10.472 --> 00:05:12.500
All right, well first of all, I'mma say,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.840
you know what I'm saying, I'm
the only dude up here right now.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.479
My name is Rashid,

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.902
and I never been at TED before,

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:20.737
you know what I'm saying.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:24.029
I think, Sarah Jones, maybe she
didn't want me to come out last time.

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:26.012
I don't know why. You know what I'm saying.

00:05:26.012 --> 00:05:28.566
Obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED.

00:05:28.566 --> 00:05:30.898
You know what I'm saying.
