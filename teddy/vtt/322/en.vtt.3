00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:30.327
how we can understand the future

00:01:30.327 --> 00:01:31.998
and predict outcomes,

00:01:31.998 --> 00:01:36.392
for me, it's terrifying to not
know what might be coming.

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:38.850
And so the idea that there are questions

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.370
that I've never seen

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.846
that my people are going to answer,

00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:44.586

I don't know what's coming,

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:52.403
and all I can do is remind myself

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:54.734
that I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants,

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:56.608
and now that I'm up here it sort of feels like

00:01:56.608 --> 00:01:59.308
that dream where you don't have any pants on,

00:01:59.308 --> 00:02:01.080
and so I suppose I'm going to be
