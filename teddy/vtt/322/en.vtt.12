00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:02.147
we're going to have to answer,
like, some random questions,

00:06:02.147 --> 00:06:03.805
just like, and I was like, what the hell is that?

00:06:03.805 --> 00:06:05.135
You know what I'm saying, just stand up there

00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:06.640
and answer some random questions?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.675
I don't want to,

00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:09.733
I mean, it's like an intellectual stop-and-frisk.

00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:10.909
You know what I'm saying? (Laughter)

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.615
I don't want to be standing up there just

00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:14.539
all getting interrogated and whatnot.

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:15.607
That's what I'm trying to leave behind

00:06:15.607 --> 00:06:17.215
in New York. You know what I'm saying?

00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:20.687
So anyway, I would have to say
my top five songs right now

00:06:20.687 --> 00:06:23.201
is all out of my own personal catalogue,

00:06:23.201 --> 00:06:24.678
you know what I mean?

00:06:24.678 --> 00:06:26.155
So if you want to know more about that,

00:06:26.155 --> 00:06:27.059
you know what I'm saying,

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:29.526
we could talk about the anti-piracy and all that,

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:31.051
but as far as I'm concerned,
