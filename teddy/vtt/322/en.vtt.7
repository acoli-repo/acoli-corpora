I mean, trying to answer these
questions, it is very exciting.

00:03:32.294 --> 00:03:34.190
But I also, I just need to acknowledge

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.782
that TED is an incredible experience right now

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:38.732

00:03:54.593 --> 00:03:56.933
I just need to, like, say some affirmations
