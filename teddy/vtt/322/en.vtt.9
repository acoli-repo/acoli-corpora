00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:30.473
Don't say, "Oh my God."

00:04:30.473 --> 00:04:32.480
And I just kept saying it: "Oh my God. Oh my God."

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.416
And, you know, I kept thinking to myself, like,

00:04:34.416 --> 00:04:37.171
President Obama has to come
up here at the same podium,

00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:38.511
and I'm standing here saying, "Oh my God."

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:39.864
It's like, the separation of church and state.

00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:41.781
It's just, I couldn't, like, I couldn't process.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:42.946
It was really too much.

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:44.900
So I think I've lost my way.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.675
But what I wanted to say is that dating, for me,

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:49.421
you know, as far as I'm concerned,

00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:52.040
however you reproduce, as long
as you're enjoying yourself

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.110
and it's with another consenting
asexual -- I don't know.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.430
You know where I'm going with that.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.501
Okay, ciao, gracias.

00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:02.023
Okay, next question. (Applause)
