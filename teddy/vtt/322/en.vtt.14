"How many of your organs have been 3D printed?"

00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:04.851
(Laughter)

00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:06.969
Well I have to say that I don't know about

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.256
how many of my organs

00:07:08.256 --> 00:07:10.835
have been 3-D printed as such,

00:07:10.835 --> 00:07:13.990
but I can tell you that it is so challenging to me,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.334
kind of thinking about this concept of the future

00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:19.007
and that, you know, all around the world

00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:23.070
parents are kind of telling their small children,

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.547
please, you have to eat that, you know,

00:07:24.547 --> 00:07:27.271
I have slaved over a hot 3D printer all day

00:07:27.271 --> 00:07:28.910
so that you can have this meal.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.515
You know, that kind of thing.
