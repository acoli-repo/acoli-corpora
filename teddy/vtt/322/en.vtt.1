00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.730
That's a long story filled with

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.412
intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame.

00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:38.900
But I was totally immersed in this world

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.962
that was filled with everybody,

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:44.002
and then I went on to the United Nations school,

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.688
and that just completely —

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:49.771
So I began sort of developing these voices

00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:51.657
and these people,

00:00:51.657 --> 00:00:54.027
all of whom were loosely based
on people I really know,

00:00:54.027 --> 00:00:58.210
and so, for example, in performing them,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.168
I would really try to inhabit them.
