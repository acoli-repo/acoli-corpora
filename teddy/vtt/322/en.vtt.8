00:03:59.337 --> 00:04:01.395
I usually just try to use, like, the three little words

00:04:01.395 --> 00:04:03.879
that always make me feel better:

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.860
Sotomayor, Sotomayor, Sotomayor. (Laughter)

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.617
Just, it really helps me to get grounded.

00:04:08.617 --> 00:04:10.914
Now I can use Allende, Allende, Allende,

00:04:10.914 --> 00:04:12.480
and, you know, I just need to say it, like,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.914
it's so incredible to be here, and I knew
that we were going to have these questions.

00:04:14.914 --> 00:04:17.167
I was so nervous and I was thinking
just, like, oh my God, oh my God,

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:19.144
and reminding me, because
I've had, like, some very,

00:04:19.144 --> 00:04:20.737
especially since the last time we were here at TED,

00:04:20.737 --> 00:04:22.063
it was, like, unbelievable,

00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:23.267
and then right after that, like,

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:24.221
so many crazy things happened, like,

00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:25.965
we ended up going to the White House to perform.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.189
That was, like, amazing,

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:28.209
and I'm standing there,

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:29.719
and I was just like, please don't say, "Oh my God."

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:30.473
Don't say, "Oh my God."
