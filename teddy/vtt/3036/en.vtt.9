00:04:26.222 --> 00:04:30.540
So rather than buy into the ideas
of Africa taking handouts,

00:04:30.564 --> 00:04:33.436
we are using our
interdisciplinary approach

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.086
to empower Africans
to find their own solutions.

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:40.819
Right now, we are working
with local communities and students,

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:42.638
a US entrepreneur,

00:04:42.662 --> 00:04:45.304
scientists from the US and Africa

00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:50.161
to find a way to sustainably grow ebony,
the iconic African hardwood.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.106
Ebonies, like most African hardwood,
are exploited for timber,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.867
but we know very little
about their ecology,

00:04:57.891 --> 00:04:59.459
what disperses them,

00:04:59.483 --> 00:05:02.792
how they survive in our forest
80 to 200 years.
