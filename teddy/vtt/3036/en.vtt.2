00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:01.035
upon graduation
as an ecologist in Nigeria,

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.512
was an even bigger challenge.

00:01:02.856 --> 00:01:04.416
So I left the continent

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.316
when I was offered a scholarship
to Boston University for my PhD.

00:01:11.014 --> 00:01:12.928
It is disheartening to see that,

00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:14.619
with all our challenges,

00:01:14.643 --> 00:01:16.024
with all the talents,

00:01:16.048 --> 00:01:18.968
with all the skills we have
in Africa as a continent,

00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:21.206
we tend to solve our problems

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.945
by parachuting in experts
from the West for short stays,

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.373
exporting the best
and brightest out of Africa,

00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:31.618
and treating Africa as a continent
in perpetual need of handouts.
