00:07:57.893 --> 00:08:00.345
through initiatives
like the Congo Basin Institute,

00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:01.719
and when that happens,

00:08:01.743 --> 00:08:05.076
Africa will be on the way
to solving Africa's problems.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.857
And in 50 years, I hope
someone will be giving a TED Talk

00:08:08.881 --> 00:08:12.755
on how to stop the brain drain
of Westerners leaving your homes

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:14.342
to work and live in Africa.

00:08:14.366 --> 00:08:15.367
(Applause)

00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:16.549
Thank you.

00:08:16.573 --> 00:08:22.177
(Applause)
