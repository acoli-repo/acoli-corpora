00:05:58.243 --> 00:06:00.159
So in addition to the ebony,

00:06:00.183 --> 00:06:02.508
the species which the farmers
choose themselves

00:06:02.532 --> 00:06:04.887
will be produced
using our modern techniques

00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:07.007
and incorporated into
their land-use systems,

00:06:07.031 --> 00:06:09.356
so that they start benefiting
from these products

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.558
while waiting for the ebony to mature.

00:06:12.736 --> 00:06:15.975
Today we are planting
15,000 ebony trees in Cameroon,

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:17.514
and for the first time,

00:06:17.538 --> 00:06:20.906
ebony won't be harvested
from the middle of a pristine forest.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.187
This is the model
for our African hardwoods,

00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:26.145
and we are extending this
to include sapele and bubinga,

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.691
other highly prized hardwoods.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.273
So if these examples existed
when I was 18,
