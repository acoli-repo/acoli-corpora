and treating Africa as a continent
in perpetual need of handouts.

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:35.710
After my training at Boston University,

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:36.924
I joined a research team

00:01:36.948 --> 00:01:38.566
at the University of California's

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.788
Institute of the Environment
and Sustainability

00:01:40.812 --> 00:01:43.495
because of its reputation
for groundbreaking research

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.638
and the development
of policies and programs

00:01:45.662 --> 00:01:48.639
that save the lives
of millions of people the world over,

00:01:48.663 --> 00:01:50.357
including in the developing world.

00:01:50.858 --> 00:01:52.016
And it has been shown

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.401
that for every skilled African
that returns home,

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:57.425
nine new jobs are created
in the formal and informal sectors.

00:01:58.776 --> 00:02:02.688
So as part of our program, therefore,
to build a sustainable Africa together,
