WEBVTT

00:01:58.776 --> 00:02:02.688
So as part of our program, therefore,
to build a sustainable Africa together,

00:02:02.712 --> 00:02:06.926
we are leading a multi-initiative
to develop the Congo Basin Institute,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.608
a permanent base

00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:12.900
where Africans can work in partnership
with international researchers,

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:15.692
but working out their own solutions
to their own problems.

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:21.836
We are using our interdisciplinary
approach to show how universities,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.471
NGOs and private business

00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:26.558
can partner in international development.

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:31.869
So instead of parachuting in experts
from the West for short stays,
