00:05:28.018 --> 00:05:30.733
in addition from generating
them from seeds,

00:05:30.757 --> 00:05:32.287
which is a very difficult task.

00:05:33.608 --> 00:05:37.189
(Applause)

00:05:37.213 --> 00:05:39.592
So other students will take
the varieties of ebony

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:42.205
which Arvin identifies in our lab,

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.301
graft them to produce saplings,

00:05:44.325 --> 00:05:47.261
and work with local communities
to co-produce ebony

00:05:47.285 --> 00:05:50.222
with local fruit tree species
in their various farms

00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:52.381
using our own tree farm approach,

00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:54.555
whereby we invite all the farmers

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:57.404
to choose their own tree species
they want in their farms.

00:05:58.243 --> 00:06:00.159
So in addition to the ebony,
