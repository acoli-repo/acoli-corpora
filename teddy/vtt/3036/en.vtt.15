00:07:33.796 --> 00:07:37.677
like Côte d'Ivoire, Tanzania and Senegal,

00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:40.184
among the top fastest growing economies

00:07:40.208 --> 00:07:44.297
that can attract several opportunities
for private-sector investment.

00:07:47.153 --> 00:07:50.210
We want to give more opportunities
to African scholars,

00:07:50.234 --> 00:07:52.011
and I long to see a day

00:07:52.035 --> 00:07:55.399

00:07:55.423 --> 00:07:57.869
and receive high-quality education

00:07:57.893 --> 00:08:00.345
through initiatives
like the Congo Basin Institute,
