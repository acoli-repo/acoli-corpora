00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:03.898
Also through our local help program,

00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:07.057
Dr. Gbenga Abiodun,
a young Nigerian scientist,

00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:09.470
can work as a post-doctoral fellow

00:03:09.494 --> 00:03:11.868
with the Foundation
for Professional Development

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:14.510
in the University of Western Cape
in South Africa

00:03:14.534 --> 00:03:16.869
and the University of California
at the same time,

00:03:16.893 --> 00:03:20.365
investigating the effects
of climate variability and change

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.425
on malaria transmission in Africa.

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.830
Indeed, Gbenga is currently
developing models

00:03:24.854 --> 00:03:28.116
that will be used
as an early warning system

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.314
to predict malaria transmission in Africa.
