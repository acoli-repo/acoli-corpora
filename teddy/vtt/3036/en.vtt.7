to predict malaria transmission in Africa.

00:03:31.603 --> 00:03:35.397
So rather than exporting
our best and brightest out of Africa,

00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:38.503
we are nurturing and supporting
local talent in Africa.

00:03:38.527 --> 00:03:40.475
For example, like me,

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.872
Dr. Eric Fokam was trained in the US.

00:03:44.472 --> 00:03:47.806
He returned home to Cameroon,
but couldn't secure the necessary grants,

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.371
and he found it incredibly challenging

00:03:50.395 --> 00:03:53.879
to practice and learn
the science he knew he could.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.448
So when I met Eric,

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:58.568
he was on the verge
of returning to the US.

00:03:58.592 --> 00:04:01.052
But we convinced him
to start collaborating
