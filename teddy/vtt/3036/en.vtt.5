00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:31.869
So instead of parachuting in experts
from the West for short stays,

00:02:31.893 --> 00:02:34.354
we are building a permanent
presence in Africa,

00:02:34.378 --> 00:02:37.988
a one-stop shop for logistics, housing

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:40.026
and development of collaborative projects

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.272
between Africans
and international researchers.

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:45.815
So this has allowed students like Michel

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.853
to receive high-quality
training in Africa.

00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:51.085
Michel is currently working in our labs

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.348
to investigate the effects
of climate change on insects, for his PhD,

00:02:54.372 --> 00:02:57.284
and has already secured
his post-doctorate fellowship

00:02:57.308 --> 00:02:59.789
that will enable him
to stay on the continent.
