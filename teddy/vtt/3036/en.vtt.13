00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.273
So if these examples existed
when I was 18,

00:06:33.297 --> 00:06:35.586
I would never have left,

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.521
but because of initiatives
by the Congo Basin Institute,

00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:40.459
I am coming back,

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:41.959
but I'm not coming back alone.

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.809
I'm bringing with me Western scientists,

00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:46.528
entrepreneurs and students,

00:06:46.552 --> 00:06:49.694
the best science from the best
universities in the world,

00:06:49.718 --> 00:06:51.622
to work and to live in Africa.

00:06:52.908 --> 00:06:57.201
But we all need to scale up this local,
powerful and empowering approach.

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:01.868
So far we have half a dozen
universities and NGOs as partners.
