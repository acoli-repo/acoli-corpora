To this day, more than one million people
die from malaria every year,

00:00:32.214 --> 00:00:34.582
mostly children under the age of five,

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:37.566

When I was 18, I left Cameroon

00:00:42.283 --> 00:00:44.497
in search of better
educational opportunities.

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:48.338
At the time, there was
just one university in Cameroon,

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:50.886
but Nigeria next door
offered some opportunities

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.544

to be trained in various fields.

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:56.938

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:58.829
but practicing my trade,

00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:01.035
upon graduation
as an ecologist in Nigeria,
