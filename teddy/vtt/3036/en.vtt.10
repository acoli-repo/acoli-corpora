how they survive in our forest
80 to 200 years.

00:05:04.044 --> 00:05:05.914
This is Arvin,

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.977
a young PhD student working in our labs,

00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:12.589
conducting what is turning out to be
some cutting-edge tissue culture work.

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:15.510
Arvin is holding in her hands

00:05:15.534 --> 00:05:19.001
the first ebony tree that was produced
entirely from tissues.

00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:21.462
This is unique in Africa.

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:24.271
We can now show that you can
produce African timber

00:05:24.295 --> 00:05:25.787
from different plant tissues --

00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:27.994
leaves, stems, roots --

00:05:28.018 --> 00:05:30.733
in addition from generating
them from seeds,
