00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Like many of you here, I am trying to contribute

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
towards a renaissance in Africa.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The question of transformation in Africa

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
really is a question of leadership.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it is my contention that the manner in which

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we educate our leaders is fundamental

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to progress on this continent.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I want to tell you some stories that explain my view.
