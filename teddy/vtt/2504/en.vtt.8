The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.536
is that these are strangers
counseling other strangers

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.216
on the most intimate issues,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.616
and getting them from hot moments
to cold moments.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.936
It's exciting, and I will tell you

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.216
that we have done a total
of more than 6.5 million text messages

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.536
in less than two years.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.536
(Applause)

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.776
But the thing that really gets me
hot and sweaty about this,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.656
the thing that really gets me
psyched is the data:

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.016
6.5 million messages --
