00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.040
(Applause)

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.280
But there's one weird side effect.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.936
Every time we send out a text message,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.256
we get back a few dozen text messages
having nothing to do with peanut butter

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.056
or hunger or senior citizens --

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.576
but text messages about being bullied,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.400
text messages about being addicted to pot.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.160
And the worst message
we ever got said exactly this:

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.200
"He won't stop raping me.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.240
It's my dad.
