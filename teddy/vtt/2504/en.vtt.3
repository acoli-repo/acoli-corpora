It's my dad.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.840
He told me not to tell anyone.
Are you there?"

00:01:38.238 --> 00:01:40.096
We couldn't believe this was happening.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.776
We couldn't believe that something
so horrific could happen to a human being,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.440
and that she would share it with us --
something so intimate, so personal.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.736
And we realized
we had to stop triaging this

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.760
and we had to build a crisis text line
for these people in pain.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.080
So we launched Crisis Text Line,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.456
very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso --
just a few thousand people in each market.
