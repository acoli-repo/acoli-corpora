00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.216
and you think that she's texting
the cute boy across the hall,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.880
but she's actually texting us
about her bulimia.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.056
And we don't get the word "like"
or "um" or hyperventilating or crying.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.840
We just get facts.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.816
We get things like, "I want to die.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.760
I have a bottle of pills
on the desk in front of me."

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.296
And so the crisis counselor says,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.320
"How about you put those pills
in the drawer while we text?"

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.136
And they go back and forth for a while.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
And the crisis counselor
gets the girl to give her her address,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.896
because if you're texting
a text line, you want help.
