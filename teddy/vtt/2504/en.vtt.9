6.5 million messages --

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.680
that's the volume, velocity and variety
to provide a really juicy corpus.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.856
We can do things like predictive work.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.416
We can do all kinds of conclusions
and learnings from that data set.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.656
So we can be better,
and the world can be better.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.096
So how do we use the data
to make us better?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.456
Alright, chances are someone here,
someone watching this

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.056
has seen a therapist or a shrink
at some point in time in your life --

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.747
you do not have to raise your hand.

00:04:57.771 --> 00:04:59.376
(Laughter)

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.656
How do you know that person's any good?
