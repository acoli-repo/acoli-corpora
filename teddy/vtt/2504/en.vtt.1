00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.055
So we'll run over 200 campaigns this year,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.776
things like collecting peanut butter
for food pantries,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.640
or making Valentine's Day cards
for senior citizens who are homebound.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.456
And we'll text them.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.416
And we'll have a 97 percent open rate.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.136
It'll over-index Hispanic and urban.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.136
We collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.536
and over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.336
This is big scale. OK --

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.040
