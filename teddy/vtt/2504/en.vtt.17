00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.696
is that I'm not inspired by helping you
find Chinese food at 2am in Dallas,

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.736
or helping you touch your wrist
and get a car immediately,

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.616
or swipe right and get laid.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.015
I'm inspired --

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:48.816
(Laughter, applause)

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.416
I want to use tech and data
to make the world a better place.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.136
I want to use it to help that girl,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.440
who texted in about 
being raped by her father.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.296
Because the truth is
we never heard from her again.
