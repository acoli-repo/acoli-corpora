if you text us, "I want to die,"
or "I want to kill myself,"

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.336
the algorithm reads that,
you're code orange,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.536
and you become number one in the queue.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.656
So we can handle severity,
not chronological.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.816

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.176
This data is also making the world better

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.696
because I'm sitting on the world's
first map of real-time crises.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.936
Think about it:

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.336
those 6.5 million messages, auto-tagging
through natural language processes,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.856
all of these data points --

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.760
I can tell you that the worst day
of the week for eating disorders: Monday.
