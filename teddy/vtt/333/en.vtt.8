00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the way we've always done them.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
If they have not worked, we have to look for alternative solutions.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I'm here to talk to you about solutions.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
This has been -- what has been a difficult sign to some of us.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Several years ago, we started thinking about it.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Everyone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Everyone is ready to throw in money,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
in terms of free money aid to developing countries.
