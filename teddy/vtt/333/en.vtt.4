they do -- but they do not survive after the time that they reach

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
about 45 years old and 50 years old.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And those are the times they're most productive.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Those are the times that they should be contributing

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to Africa's development. But they're not there.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If you cannot secure the parents,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
you cannot guarantee the security of the African child.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
What are the risk factors?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
These are just for information:

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise. The usual suspects.
