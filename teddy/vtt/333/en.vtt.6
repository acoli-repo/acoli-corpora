00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In eight short years -- we're here talking about HIV, malaria,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
which is all good.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
In eight short years, non-communicable diseases

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
will become the leading causes of death in Africa.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That is something to keep in mind. We can't deal with it with situations like this.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
This is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
they go to USA, Germany, U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
You can't depend on foreign aid alone.
