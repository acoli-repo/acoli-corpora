00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
All friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
should be very concerned about this deplorable situation.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Has anyone here wondered what will happen

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
if you go back to your room at night,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and you start getting chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Will you fly back to the U.S., Germany, Europe?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
No, you will die. 50 percent will die within 24 hours, if not treated.
