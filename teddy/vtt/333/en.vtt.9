00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Everyone is ready to throw in money,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
in terms of free money aid to developing countries.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Talk about sustainable investment, no one is interested.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You can't raise money.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States --

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[It's] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But start telling them, you know,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
we're going to try to do it in Nigeria -- everyone runs away.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
if you want to help Africa, invest money in sustainable development.
