00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is what's going on.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
In a look at the map of the U.S. -- the graph here,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
10 million people here, 10 million here.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
By the time you get to 50, it's almost no one left in Nigeria --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
life expectancy is 47.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
they do -- but they do not survive after the time that they reach

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
about 45 years old and 50 years old.
