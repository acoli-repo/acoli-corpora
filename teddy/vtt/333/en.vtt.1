A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
17 million people die every year from heart disease.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
32 million heart attacks and strokes occur.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Most of this is in developing countries, and the majority is in Africa.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is in developing countries -- not in the West --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Who is at risk? People like you.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that.
