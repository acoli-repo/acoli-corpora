It is interesting that in the United States,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the most significant health-care budget

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
goes to cardiovascular disease care, whether it's private or public.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There's no comparison at all.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In Africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.
