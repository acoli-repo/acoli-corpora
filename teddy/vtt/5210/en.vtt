00:00:07.204 --> 00:00:10.121
So how many of you have a robot at home?

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:12.954
OK, I see about 20, 30 hands.

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:14.663
That's actually pretty good.

00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:19.329
How many of you would want
your own personal robot at home?

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:21.913
I know I would!

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:23.663
OK, so why doesn't this exist?

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:26.704
Why canâ€™t I go to the convenience store
or the department store,

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:29.954
go up to the cashier and say,
"Yeah, I want my personal robot"?
