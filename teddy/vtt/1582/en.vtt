Well, this is about state budgets.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is probably the most boring topic

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of the whole morning.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But I want to tell you, I think it's an important topic

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that we need to care about.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
State budgets

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
are big, big money --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'll show you the numbers --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and they get very little scrutiny.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The understanding is very low.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Many of the people involved

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
have special interests or short-term interests

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that get them not thinking
