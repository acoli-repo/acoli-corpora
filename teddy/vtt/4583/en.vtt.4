00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:01.749
Your neck and back tense up, you slouch.

00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:03.092
Your legs and hand shake

00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:04.919
as your muscles prepare for attack.

00:02:04.943 --> 00:02:06.085
You sweat.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.348
Your blood pressure jumps.

00:02:07.372 --> 00:02:08.568
Your digestion shuts down

00:02:08.592 --> 00:02:10.354
to maximize the delivery of nutrients

00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:12.476
and oxygen to muscles and vital organs,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.800
so you get dry mouth, butterflies.

00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:16.266
Your pupils dilate,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.077
it's hard to read anything up close,

00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:19.260
like your notes,

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:20.761
but long range is easy.

00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:22.480
That's how stage fright works.

00:02:22.504 --> 00:02:23.766
How do we fight it?

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.959
First, perspective.

00:02:25.983 --> 00:02:27.342
This isn't all in your head.

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:29.539
It's a natural, hormonal,
full body reaction

00:02:29.563 --> 00:02:32.233
by an autonomic nervous
system on autopilot.
