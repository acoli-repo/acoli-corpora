so take that last minute
to stretch and breathe.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.020
You approach the Mic, voice clear,

00:03:34.044 --> 00:03:35.390
body relaxed.

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:38.015
Your well-prepared speech
convinces the wild crowd

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.012
you're a charismatic genius.

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:41.239
How?

00:03:41.263 --> 00:03:42.835
You didn't overcome stage fright,

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.055

00:03:45.554 --> 00:03:46.866
how civilized you may seem,

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.065
in part of your brain,

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:49.375
you're still a wild animal,

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.600
a profound, well-spoken wild animal.
