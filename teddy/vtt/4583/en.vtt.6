00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:01.465
you're confident in yourself
and the task at hand.

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.386
Steve Jobs rehearsed his epic speeches

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.611
for hundreds of hours,

00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:05.970
starting weeks in advance.

00:03:05.994 --> 00:03:07.478
If you know what you're saying,

00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:09.197
you'll feed off the crowd's energy

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:12.959
instead of letting your hypothalamus
convince your body it's about to be lunch

00:03:12.983 --> 00:03:14.195
for a pack of predators.

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.959
But hey, the vertebrate hypothalamus

00:03:15.983 --> 00:03:18.351
has had millions of years
more practice than you.

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:19.725
Just before you go on stage,

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:20.903
it's time to fight dirty

00:03:20.927 --> 00:03:22.087
and trick your brain.

00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:24.033
Stretch your arms up and breath deeply.

00:03:24.057 --> 00:03:25.772
This makes your hypothalamus trigger

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:26.984
a relaxation response.

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:29.976
Stage fright usually hits hardest
right before a presentation,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.286
so take that last minute
to stretch and breathe.
