00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:08.058
Palms sweaty,

00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:09.532
heart racing,

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:11.005
stomach in knots.

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:12.879
You can't cry for help.

00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:15.046
Not only is your throat
too tight to breathe,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.900
but it'd be so embarrassing.

00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:19.093
No, you aren't being stalked by a monster,

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:22.309
you're speaking in public,

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.075
a fate some deem worse than death.

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.004
See, when you're dead, you feel nothing;

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.401
at a podium, you feel stage fright.
