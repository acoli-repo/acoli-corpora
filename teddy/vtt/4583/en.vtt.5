00:02:29.563 --> 00:02:32.233
by an autonomic nervous
system on autopilot.

00:02:32.257 --> 00:02:35.197
And genetics play a huge
role in social anxiety.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.599
John Lennon played live
thousands of times.

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:39.759
Each time he vomited beforehand.

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:41.022
Some people are just wired

00:02:41.046 --> 00:02:43.126
to feel more scared performing in public.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.685
Since stage fright
is natural and inevitable,

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.418
focus on what you can control.

00:02:47.442 --> 00:02:49.454
Practice a lot,

00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:50.636
starting long before

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.286
in an environment similar
to the real performance.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.677
Practicing any task
increases your familiarity

00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:57.177
and reduces anxiety,

00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:59.041
so when it's time to speak in public,

00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:01.465
you're confident in yourself
and the task at hand.
