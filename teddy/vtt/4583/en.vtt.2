00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.348
a self-protective process
seen in a range of animals,

00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:04.946
most of which don't give speeches.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.435
But we have a wise partner

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:07.852
in the study of freaking out.

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:09.945

was an ancient reaction unaffected

00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:24.259
by the nuances of modern civilization.

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:25.903
So, to your conscious modern mind,

00:01:25.927 --> 00:01:27.139
it's a speech.

00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:28.476
To the rest of your brain,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.613
built up to code
with the law of the jungle,
