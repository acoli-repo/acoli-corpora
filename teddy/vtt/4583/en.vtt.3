00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.613
built up to code
with the law of the jungle,

00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:32.640
when you perceive
the possible consequences

00:01:32.664 --> 00:01:33.860
of blowing a speech,

00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:35.313
it's time to run for your life

00:01:35.337 --> 00:01:36.487
or fight to the death.

00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:52.764
Your hypothalamus, common
to all vertebrates,

00:01:52.788 --> 00:01:54.708
triggers your pituitary gland to secrete

00:01:54.732 --> 00:01:56.504
the hormone ACTH,

00:01:56.528 --> 00:01:57.750
making your adrenal gland

00:01:57.774 --> 00:01:59.704
shoot adrenaline into your blood.

00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:01.749
Your neck and back tense up, you slouch.
