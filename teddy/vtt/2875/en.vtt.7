00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:31.859
This decreases emotional reactivity,

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:33.431
which can be a superpower.

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:37.024
Conversely, let's say
you're a quarterback.

00:03:37.048 --> 00:03:39.240
You miss a pass.
You get furious with yourself.

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:40.770
That could cost you a game.

00:03:41.278 --> 00:03:45.188
If you're a CEO, and you fly
off the handle at a very valued employee

00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:46.712
because of a minor infraction,

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:48.747
that could cost you the employee.

00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:54.279
If you're a college student
who, say, is in a downward spiral,

00:03:54.938 --> 00:03:57.093
and you feel helpless and hopeless,

00:03:57.117 --> 00:03:59.094
unabated, that could cost you your life.

00:03:59.118 --> 00:04:01.377
So the stakes are very, very high.
