any life more beautiful

00:12:05.876 --> 00:12:07.335
than that of a Stoic.

00:12:08.813 --> 00:12:11.741
And the last was his mantra,
which he applies to everything,

00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:13.889
and you can apply to everything:

00:12:15.404 --> 00:12:17.413

what we most fear doing, asking, saying --

00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:32.571
these are very often exactly
what we most need to do.
