00:00:28.568 --> 00:00:31.563
And I came this close
to the edge of the precipice.

00:00:31.587 --> 00:00:33.224
It's the closest I've ever come.

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:36.661
And the only reason I took
my finger off the trigger

00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:39.108
was thanks to a few lucky coincidences.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.370
And after the fact,

00:00:41.394 --> 00:00:44.516
that's what scared me the most:
the element of chance.

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:48.434
So I became very methodical
about testing different ways

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.588
that I could manage my ups and downs,

00:00:50.612 --> 00:00:54.481
which has proven to be
a good investment. (Laughs)

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:58.657
Many normal people might have,
say, six to 10 major depressive episodes

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:00.208
in their lives.
