00:06:59.248 --> 00:07:01.262
I could take a portable blue light with me

00:07:01.286 --> 00:07:03.281
and use it for 15 minutes in the morning.

00:07:03.305 --> 00:07:05.960
I knew that helped stave off
depressive episodes.

00:07:05.984 --> 00:07:09.855
For the IRS bit, I could change
the mailing address on file with the IRS

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.946
so the paperwork would go to my accountant

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.923
instead of to my UPS address.

00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:15.396
Easy-peasy.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.462
Then we go to "Repair."

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:20.708
So if the worst-case scenarios happen,

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:23.698
what could you do to repair
the damage even a little bit,

00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:25.488
or who could you ask for help?

00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:27.920
So in the first case, London,

00:07:27.944 --> 00:07:31.619
well, I could fork over some money,
fly to Spain, get some sun --
