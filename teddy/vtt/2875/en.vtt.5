George Washington actually had
a play about a Stoic --

00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:34.548
this was "Cato, a Tragedy" --

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:37.759
performed for his troops at Valley Forge
to keep them motivated.

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:42.426
So why would people of action
focus so much on an ancient philosophy?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.136
This seems very academic.

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:48.208
I would encourage you to think
about stoicism a little bit differently,

00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:51.495
as an operating system for thriving
in high-stress environments,

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.001
for making better decisions.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.149
And it all started here,

00:02:56.173 --> 00:02:57.336
kind of,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.806
on a porch.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.087
So around 300 BC in Athens,
