(Laughter)

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:03.806
The second page is simple:

00:08:04.253 --> 00:08:07.674
What might be the benefits
of an attempt or a partial success?

00:08:07.698 --> 00:08:09.509
You can see we're playing up the fears

00:08:09.533 --> 00:08:12.415
and really taking a conservative
look at the upside.

00:08:12.924 --> 00:08:15.290
So if you attempted whatever
you're considering,

00:08:15.314 --> 00:08:17.498
might you build confidence,
develop skills,

00:08:17.522 --> 00:08:20.304
emotionally, financially, otherwise?

00:08:20.328 --> 00:08:23.067
What might be the benefits
of, say, a base hit?

00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:25.158
Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this.

00:08:25.182 --> 00:08:26.728
Page three.

00:08:26.752 --> 00:08:29.164
This might be the most important,
so don't skip it:

00:08:29.188 --> 00:08:30.738
"The Cost of Inaction."
