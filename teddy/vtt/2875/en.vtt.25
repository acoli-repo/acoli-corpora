00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:32.571
these are very often exactly
what we most need to do.

00:12:33.968 --> 00:12:36.457
And the biggest challenges
and problems we face

00:12:36.481 --> 00:12:39.576
will never be solved
with comfortable conversations,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.306
whether it's in your own head
or with other people.

00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:45.169
So I encourage you to ask yourselves:

00:12:45.193 --> 00:12:47.108
Where in your lives right now

00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:51.926
might defining your fears be more
important than defining your goals?

00:12:52.966 --> 00:12:56.171
Keeping in mind all the while,
the words of Seneca:

00:12:56.195 --> 00:13:00.144
"We suffer more often
in imagination than in reality."
