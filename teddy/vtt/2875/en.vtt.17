00:08:29.188 --> 00:08:30.738
"The Cost of Inaction."

00:08:30.762 --> 00:08:33.670
Humans are very good at considering
what might go wrong

00:08:33.694 --> 00:08:37.083
if we try something new,
say, ask for a raise.

00:08:37.107 --> 00:08:42.705
What we don't often consider
is the atrocious cost of the status quo --

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:44.163
not changing anything.

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.810
So you should ask yourself,

00:08:46.834 --> 00:08:50.034
if I avoid this action or decision

00:08:51.042 --> 00:08:53.565
and actions and decisions like it,

00:08:53.589 --> 00:08:58.346
what might my life look like in,
say, six months, 12 months, three years?

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.858
Any further out, it starts
to seem intangible.
