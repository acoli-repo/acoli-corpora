00:10:57.376 --> 00:11:00.042
which was a nonviolent
movement for social change

00:11:00.066 --> 00:11:02.843
that was violently suppressed
by the government.

00:11:02.867 --> 00:11:04.913
He lost his career as a firefighter.

00:11:04.937 --> 00:11:08.058
Then his mentor, a priest,
was kidnapped, tortured, killed

00:11:08.082 --> 00:11:09.716
and thrown into a river.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.954
He was then threatened.

00:11:10.978 --> 00:11:14.136
He and his wife had to flee Poland,
bounce from country to country

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.614
until they landed in the US
with next to nothing,

00:11:16.638 --> 00:11:18.031
sleeping on floors.

00:11:18.675 --> 00:11:22.462
He now lives in Woodside, California,
in a very nice place,

00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:25.111
and of the 10,000-plus people
I've met in my life,

00:11:25.135 --> 00:11:27.419
I would put him in the top 10,

00:11:27.443 --> 00:11:29.637
in terms of success and happiness.
