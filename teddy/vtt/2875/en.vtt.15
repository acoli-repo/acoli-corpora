00:07:27.944 --> 00:07:31.619
well, I could fork over some money,
fly to Spain, get some sun --

00:07:31.643 --> 00:07:34.290
undo the damage, if I got into a funk.

00:07:34.314 --> 00:07:36.723
In the case of missing
a letter from the IRS,

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:39.188
I could call a friend who is a lawyer

00:07:39.212 --> 00:07:41.706
or ask, say, a professor of law

00:07:42.777 --> 00:07:44.078
what they would recommend,

00:07:44.102 --> 00:07:47.298
who I should talk to,
how had people handled this in the past.

00:07:47.322 --> 00:07:51.359
So one question to keep in mind
as you're doing this first page is:

00:07:51.383 --> 00:07:53.540
Has anyone else in the history of time

00:07:53.564 --> 00:07:55.671
less intelligent or less driven

00:07:55.695 --> 00:07:56.919
figured this out?

00:07:57.383 --> 00:07:59.679
Chances are, the answer is "Yes."

00:07:59.703 --> 00:08:00.705
