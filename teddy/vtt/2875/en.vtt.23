00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:32.898
And there's a punchline coming,
so pay attention.

00:11:32.922 --> 00:11:34.785
I sent him a text a few weeks ago,

00:11:34.809 --> 00:11:37.604
asking him: Had he ever read
any Stoic philosophy?

00:11:37.628 --> 00:11:40.026
And he replied with two pages of text.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.295
This is very unlike him.
He is a terse dude.

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:43.811
(Laughter)

00:11:43.835 --> 00:11:46.896
And not only was he familiar
with stoicism,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.314
but he pointed out, for all
of his most important decisions,

00:11:50.338 --> 00:11:51.845
his inflection points,

00:11:51.869 --> 00:11:55.455
when he stood up
for his principles and ethics,

00:11:56.142 --> 00:11:59.244
how he had used stoicism
and something akin to fear-setting,

00:11:59.268 --> 00:12:00.430
which blew my mind.
