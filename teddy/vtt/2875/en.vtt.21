00:10:27.185 --> 00:10:31.574
I'd like to close with a profile
of one of my favorite modern-day Stoics.

00:10:32.141 --> 00:10:34.063
This is Jerzy Gregorek.

00:10:34.802 --> 00:10:38.231
He is a four-time world champion
in Olympic weightlifting,

00:10:38.255 --> 00:10:39.629
political refugee,

00:10:39.653 --> 00:10:40.934
published poet,

00:10:41.546 --> 00:10:42.935
62 years old.

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:46.429
He can still kick my ass and probably
most asses in this room.

00:10:47.437 --> 00:10:48.639
He's an impressive guy.

00:10:48.663 --> 00:10:50.927
I spent a lot of time
on his stoa, his porch,

00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:52.955
asking life and training advice.

00:10:54.168 --> 00:10:57.352
He was part of the Solidarity in Poland,

00:10:57.376 --> 00:11:00.042
which was a nonviolent
movement for social change
