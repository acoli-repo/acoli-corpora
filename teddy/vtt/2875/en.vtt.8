So the stakes are very, very high.

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:05.395
And there are many tools
in the toolkit to get you there.

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.256
I'm going to focus on one
that completely changed my life in 2004.

00:04:09.988 --> 00:04:12.619
It found me then because of two things:

00:04:12.643 --> 00:04:18.008
a very close friend, young guy, my age,
died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly,

00:04:18.032 --> 00:04:21.860
and then my girlfriend, who I thought
I was going to marry, walked out.

00:04:21.884 --> 00:04:25.929
She'd had enough, and she didn't
give me a Dear John letter,

00:04:25.953 --> 00:04:28.304
but she did give me this,

00:04:28.328 --> 00:04:29.640
a Dear John plaque.

00:04:29.664 --> 00:04:30.712
