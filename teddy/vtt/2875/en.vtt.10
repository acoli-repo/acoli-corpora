00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:02.565
And I did find a quote
that made a big difference in my life,

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:07.736
which was, "We suffer more often
in imagination than in reality,"

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.544
by Seneca the Younger,

00:05:09.568 --> 00:05:11.191
who was a famous Stoic writer.

00:05:11.215 --> 00:05:13.031
That took me to his letters,

00:05:13.055 --> 00:05:15.508
which took me to the exercise,

00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:18.035
"premeditatio malorum,"

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:20.355
which means the pre-meditation of evils.

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:21.535
In simple terms,

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:26.678
this is visualizing the worst-case
scenarios, in detail, that you fear,

00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:28.419
preventing you from taking action,

00:05:28.443 --> 00:05:31.183
so that you can take action
to overcome that paralysis.
