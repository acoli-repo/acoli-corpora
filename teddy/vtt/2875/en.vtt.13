I won't go through all of them,
but I'll give you two examples.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.956
One was, I'll go to London,
it'll be rainy, I'll get depressed,

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.203
the whole thing will be
a huge waste of time.

00:06:38.227 --> 00:06:41.031
Number two, I'll miss
a letter from the IRS,

00:06:41.055 --> 00:06:42.570
and I'll get audited

00:06:42.594 --> 00:06:45.132
or raided or shut down or some such.

00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:47.559
And then you go to the "Prevent" column.

00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:49.733
In that column, you write
down the answer to:

00:06:49.757 --> 00:06:52.852
What could I do to prevent
each of these bullets from happening,

00:06:52.876 --> 00:06:56.350
or, at the very least, decrease
the likelihood even a little bit?

00:06:56.829 --> 00:06:59.224
So for getting depressed in London,

00:06:59.248 --> 00:07:01.262
I could take a portable blue light with me
