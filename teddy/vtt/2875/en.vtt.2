00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:00.208
in their lives.

00:01:00.232 --> 00:01:02.558
I have bipolar depression.
It runs in my family.

00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:05.607
I've had 50-plus at this point,

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.152
and I've learned a lot.

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:09.748
I've had a lot of at-bats,

00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:12.113
many rounds in the ring with darkness,

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:13.597
taking good notes.

00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:17.296
So I thought rather than get up
and give any type of recipe for success

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.473
or highlight reel,

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:22.336
I would share my recipe
for avoiding self-destruction,

00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:25.238
and certainly self-paralysis.

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.215
And the tool I've found which has proven
to be the most reliable safety net
