And the tool I've found which has proven
to be the most reliable safety net

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:31.675
for emotional free fall

00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:34.252

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.510
It's not sad. It's not particularly happy.

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:59.334
It's just an impassive creature taking
whatever life sends its way.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:04.295
You might not think of the ultimate
