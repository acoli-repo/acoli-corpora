00:09:26.946 --> 00:09:30.537
And after this, I realized
that on a scale of one to 10,

00:09:30.561 --> 00:09:34.128
one being minimal impact,
10 being maximal impact,

00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:35.794
if I took the trip, I was risking

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:39.152
a one to three of temporary
and reversible pain

00:09:39.176 --> 00:09:43.187
for an eight to 10 of positive,
life-changing impact

00:09:43.211 --> 00:09:44.813
that could be a semi-permanent.

00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:47.163
So I took the trip.

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:48.962
None of the disasters came to pass.

00:09:48.986 --> 00:09:50.481
There were some hiccups, sure.

00:09:50.505 --> 00:09:53.047
I was able to extricate myself
from the business.

00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:56.929
I ended up extending that trip
for a year and a half around the world,

00:09:56.953 --> 00:09:59.159
and that became the basis
for my first book,

00:09:59.183 --> 00:10:00.660
that leads me here today.
