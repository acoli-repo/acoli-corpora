"Second of all, these are the information
you need to know to keep yourself safe.

00:04:00.846 --> 00:04:03.417
About quarantine, about prevention."

00:04:03.441 --> 00:04:06.096
And again, this would be
with any infectious disease,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.559
from Ebola, to cholera, to a sexually
transmitted disease like HIV.

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:14.671
And then we say,

00:04:14.695 --> 00:04:17.234
"OK, knowing what you know,

00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:20.191
do you have the means
to protect yourself?"

00:04:20.734 --> 00:04:23.311
Because often the most vulnerable

00:04:23.335 --> 00:04:25.958
do not have the means
to protect themselves.

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:30.466
So that is also where this resource
component comes in
