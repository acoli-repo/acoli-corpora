00:06:58.086 --> 00:07:02.267
And so there's three aspects
of timing and scale.

00:07:02.593 --> 00:07:05.156
First is, the earlier you start,

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.355
the better, right?

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:08.014
And that's what we saw in Rwanda.

00:07:08.038 --> 00:07:12.177
They went from early testing
and contact tracing,

00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:17.233
the first two cases entered
into the country on March 15,

00:07:17.257 --> 00:07:18.410
and in one month,

because of contact tracing,
isolation and plenty of testing,

00:07:22.336 --> 00:07:26.772
they had held that case rate
to 134 people.

00:07:26.796 --> 00:07:28.836
It's remarkable, it's remarkable.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.823
In the state of Georgia,
where is home to the CDC,
