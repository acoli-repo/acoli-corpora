You've argued against that,

00:06:00.221 --> 00:06:03.249
that even in a process of lockdown

00:06:03.273 --> 00:06:06.975
that actually contact tracing
plays a key role.

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.409
Help us understand the scale,

00:06:09.433 --> 00:06:10.774
when there's a lot of cases,

00:06:10.798 --> 00:06:13.097
the scale of tracing, both cases

00:06:13.121 --> 00:06:15.425
and everyone they may
have been in contact with

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:16.633
and their contacts.

00:06:16.657 --> 00:06:18.871
It quickly gets to a huge problem.

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:20.137
JM: It's massive.

00:06:20.161 --> 00:06:23.345
CA: What sort of workforce do you need
to make a difference

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:26.464
at this moment, where the US is at?

00:06:27.543 --> 00:06:28.750
JM: It's massive.

00:06:28.774 --> 00:06:30.211
I mean, the scale is massive,
