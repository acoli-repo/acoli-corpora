means writing down the names
and the phone numbers of the persons

00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:35.876
you've been in contact with
for the time you were sick

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.847
and a couple days before.

00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:40.268
And with those numbers then,
the contact tracers --

00:13:40.292 --> 00:13:43.931
And that's what we really redoubled
the workforce and really expanded,

00:13:43.955 --> 00:13:45.852
more than doubled,

00:13:45.876 --> 00:13:48.796
to support the department of public health

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.815

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:56.986
So we have 1,700 people employed
full time, with benefits,

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:01.418
to call those contacts
and say, "Are you OK?
