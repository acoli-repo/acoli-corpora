You're not just making this sort of,
wonderful, equity moral point

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.895
that we've got to help these people.

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.998
It's actually in all
of our interest, right?

00:05:04.022 --> 00:05:05.178
JM: Yes.

00:05:05.202 --> 00:05:07.998
Yes, we are one humanity,

00:05:08.022 --> 00:05:12.439
and any disease, any infectious
disease that is spreading

00:05:12.463 --> 00:05:14.680
is a threat to all of us.

00:05:14.704 --> 00:05:19.751
And that is one of the pieces,
there's the moral imperative,

00:05:19.775 --> 00:05:22.211
there is the epidemiologic imperative,

00:05:22.235 --> 00:05:25.735
that if you can't control
these diseases everywhere,

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.441
that it's a threat anywhere.

00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:32.029
And so as we look to the kind
of society we want to live in,
