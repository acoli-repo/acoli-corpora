00:00:57.165 --> 00:01:00.546
And we were launched
into an international dialogue

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.548
about whether that was possible

00:01:02.572 --> 00:01:06.842
for drug-resistant tuberculosis, for HIV.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.771
Indeed, for surgery, for cancer,

00:01:09.795 --> 00:01:11.556
for mental health,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.609
for noncommunicable diseases.

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:16.617
And we believe it's possible,

00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:20.633

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:25.201
So when COVID started,

00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:27.709
to the health of people
who were the poorest.

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.301
And Partners In Health
now works in 11 countries,
