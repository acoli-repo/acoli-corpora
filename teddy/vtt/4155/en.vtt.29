00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:33.687
That piece is the care piece.

00:14:33.711 --> 00:14:38.546

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.545
look at me in my beautiful house,
social distancing --

00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:43.799
to something that's progressive

00:14:43.823 --> 00:14:47.006
and paying attention
to those who need the resources.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.843
So the scale is massive,

00:14:48.867 --> 00:14:52.156
with 1,700 employees hired to do this,

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.409
but they are connected

00:14:53.433 --> 00:14:57.190
with local community food banks
and churches and facilities

00:14:57.214 --> 00:15:01.200
and primary health care centers as well.
