00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.233
and also to the other people
who need medical services --

00:08:01.257 --> 00:08:02.468
women who are pregnant,

00:08:02.492 --> 00:08:05.003
people who need their fracture repaired,

00:08:05.027 --> 00:08:07.569
because services themselves
in the United States

00:08:07.593 --> 00:08:11.733
have been, you know, really hampered
by this huge amount of COVID.

00:08:12.328 --> 00:08:15.010
So the first point is,

00:08:15.034 --> 00:08:18.843
it's always late, but it's never too late.

00:08:18.867 --> 00:08:20.047
Why?

00:08:20.071 --> 00:08:24.243
Because vulnerable populations
are sitting ducks,

00:08:24.267 --> 00:08:29.337
and so imagine if one of your contacts
was a nursing assistant

00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:30.949
who worked in a nursing home.
