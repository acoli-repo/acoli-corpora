00:02:56.935 --> 00:03:01.543
is about the provision of social support
and material support

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:03.993
to allow people to get the care they need.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.128
So that might be transportation,
it might be food.

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:10.180
So when you look
at that comprehensive approach,

00:03:10.204 --> 00:03:11.926
for an infectious disease,

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.553
part of prevention is knowing
where the disease is spreading

00:03:16.577 --> 00:03:19.569
and how it's spreading
and in whom it's spreading,

00:03:19.593 --> 00:03:23.283
so that resources can be
disproportionately put

00:03:23.307 --> 00:03:25.041
to the highest-risk areas.

00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:28.561
So contact tracing
is a staple of public health

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:32.387
and what it means is that every time
a new person is diagnosed
