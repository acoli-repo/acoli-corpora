00:06:28.774 --> 00:06:30.211
I mean, the scale is massive,

00:06:30.235 --> 00:06:32.721
and we should not take that lightly.

00:06:32.745 --> 00:06:34.514
And we don't, at Partners In Health.

00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:38.093
I mean, we are willing
to try to figure this out,

00:06:38.117 --> 00:06:41.643
and I always feel
that if we could stop Ebola

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:44.180
in some of the poorest
countries in the world,

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:46.022
of course we ought to do it here,

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:51.614
and was it too late when there were
28,000 deaths in Ebola?

00:06:51.638 --> 00:06:54.161
Sure, it's always too late.

00:06:54.574 --> 00:06:56.077
We should have started earlier,

00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:58.062
but it's not too late to have an impact.

00:06:58.086 --> 00:07:02.267
And so there's three aspects
of timing and scale.
