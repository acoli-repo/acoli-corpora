00:10:28.614 --> 00:10:31.267
and in the future, for future pandemics?

CA: Whitney.

00:10:34.031 --> 00:10:36.561
Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
You know, to that point,

00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:39.153
there is a question out there
from one of our anonymous

00:10:39.157 --> 00:10:40.164
community members,

00:10:40.188 --> 00:10:43.901
about why contact tracing isn't already
part of our public health system.

00:10:43.925 --> 00:10:45.926
It seems like it does make a lot of sense

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.608
its a way to mitigate
the spread of disease.

00:10:48.632 --> 00:10:50.440
Could you speak a little bit to that?

00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:53.368
JM: I think many people have said --

00:10:53.392 --> 00:10:55.426
and I am not a politician --

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.537
that our American
health care infrastructure

00:10:59.561 --> 00:11:03.726
is built on treatment and not prevention.
