So, talk a bit about contact tracing,

00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:32.752
why does it matter so much,

00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:34.694
and what would, I don't know,

00:02:34.718 --> 00:02:37.652
a perfect contact tracing setup look like?

00:02:39.752 --> 00:02:43.152
JM: Well, first I want to say
that you want to, always,

00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:45.296
in any type of illness,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.503
you want to do prevention,

00:02:47.527 --> 00:02:51.236
and diagnosis and treatment and care.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.513
That is what comprehensive
approaches look like,

00:02:54.537 --> 00:02:56.911
and that "care" piece, to us,

00:02:56.935 --> 00:03:01.543
is about the provision of social support
and material support
