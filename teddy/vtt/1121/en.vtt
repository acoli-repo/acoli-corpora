Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
since I became a paratrooper

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
27 years before.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We went down to the airfield early

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because this is the Army and you always go early.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You do some routine refresher training,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And you put on the T-10 parachute.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And you're very careful how you put the straps,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack.
