(Music)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is.

00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:29.000
And then I remember that there's an object we see every day

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.692
that would literally fit one million Earths inside it.
