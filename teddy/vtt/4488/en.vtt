Running: it's basically just
right, left, right, left, yeah?

00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:06.024
I mean, we've been doing it
for two million years,

00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:09.594
so it's kind of arrogant to assume
that I've got something to say

00:00:09.618 --> 00:00:12.838
that hasn't been said and performed
better a long time ago.

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.792
But the cool thing about running,
as I've discovered,

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:19.401
is that something bizarre happens
in this activity all the time.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:23.000
Case in point: A couple months ago,
if you saw the New York City Marathon,

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:26.612
I guarantee you, you saw something
that no one has ever seen before.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:31.064
An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu
turns up at the starting line.
