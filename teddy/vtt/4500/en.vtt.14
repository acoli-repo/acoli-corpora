00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:01.231
and lived in our latitudes,

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:04.447
but in actual fact, they're obviously
crossing the equator as well.

00:07:04.471 --> 00:07:06.233
So very simple things like that,

00:07:06.257 --> 00:07:08.305
we're trying to learn
about basking sharks.

00:07:09.088 --> 00:07:13.661
One thing that I think
is a very surprising and strange thing

00:07:13.685 --> 00:07:16.650
is just how low the genetic
diversity of sharks is.

00:07:16.674 --> 00:07:20.135
I'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretend
to understand the genetics.

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:22.516
And that's why it's great
to have collaboration.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.852
Whereas I'm a field person,

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:25.400
I get panic attacks

00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:28.572
if I have to spend too many hours
in a lab with a white coat on.

00:07:28.596 --> 00:07:29.827
Take me away.

00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:32.431
So we can work with geneticists
who understand that.
