00:08:27.448 --> 00:08:30.709
and to his surprise,
came up with almost identical results.

00:08:30.733 --> 00:08:33.645
So it does seem to be
that basking sharks, for some reason,

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.439
have incredibly low diversity.

00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:37.957
And it's thought maybe
it was a genetic bottleneck,

00:08:37.981 --> 00:08:40.052
thought to have been 12,000 years ago,

00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:42.600
and this has caused a very low diversity.

00:08:42.624 --> 00:08:44.584
And yet, if you look at the whale shark,

00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:47.323
which is the other
plankton-eating large shark,

00:08:47.347 --> 00:08:48.818
its diversity is much greater.

00:08:48.842 --> 00:08:51.277
So it doesn't really make sense at all.

00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:53.735
They found that there was
no genetic differentiation

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:56.220
between any of the world's oceans
of basking sharks:

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.482
even though they're found
throughout the world,

00:08:58.506 --> 00:09:00.664
you couldn't tell
the difference, genetically,
