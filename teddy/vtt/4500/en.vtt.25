00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.745
I had a little tube with alcohol in it
to send to the geneticists.

00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:34.824
So I scraped the slime off
and sent it to Aberdeen,

00:12:34.848 --> 00:12:36.364
and said, "You might try that."

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:37.998
And they sat on it for months.

00:12:38.022 --> 00:12:40.834
It was only because we had
a conference on the Isle of Man.

00:12:40.858 --> 00:12:42.397
But I kept emailing Les, saying,

00:12:42.421 --> 00:12:44.516
"Have you had a chance
to look at my slime?"

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.383
And he was like, "Yeah, yeah. Later."

00:12:46.407 --> 00:12:49.230
He thought he'd better do it
because I never met him before;

00:12:49.254 --> 00:12:52.009
he might lose face if he hadn't done
the thing I sent him.

00:12:52.033 --> 00:12:54.884
And he was amazed that they actually
got DNA from the slime.

00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:56.743
They amplified it and they tested it,

00:12:56.767 --> 00:12:59.565
and they found, yes,
this was actually basking shark DNA,

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:01.526
which was got from the slime.
