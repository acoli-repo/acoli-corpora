00:15:58.077 --> 00:16:00.897
to other disciplines,
such as the geneticists,

00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:03.376
who can gain so much more from that.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.106
So as I said, these things
are sent to you in strange ways.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.376
Grab them while you can.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.342
I'll take that as my scientific legacy.

00:16:10.366 --> 00:16:13.453
Hopefully, I might get something
a bit more dramatic and romantic

00:16:13.477 --> 00:16:14.726
before I die.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.155
But for the time being,
thank you for that.

00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:18.665
And keep an eye out for sharks.

00:16:18.689 --> 00:16:22.435
If you're more interested, we have
a basking shark website now set up.

00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:24.429
So thank you and thank you for listening.

00:16:24.453 --> 00:16:26.400
