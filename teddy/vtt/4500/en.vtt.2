00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.107
but also for dressing wounds
and other things.

00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:04.017
In fact, the streetlights in 1742,

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.565
of Galway, Dublin and Waterford,

00:01:05.589 --> 00:01:06.976
were lit with sunfish oil.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.390
"Sunfish" is one of the words
for basking sharks.

00:01:09.414 --> 00:01:11.430
So they were incredibly important animals.

00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:14.823
They've been around a long time,
very important to coastal communities.

00:01:14.847 --> 00:01:18.141
Probably the best-documented
basking shark fishery in the world

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:19.677
is that from Achill Island.

00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:22.076
This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.253
Sharks used to come into the bay,

00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:27.278
and the fishermen
would tie a net off the headland,

00:01:27.302 --> 00:01:28.934
string it out, an old Manila net,

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.307
and as the shark came round,
it would hit the net,
