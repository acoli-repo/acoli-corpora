00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.111
as the two areas
where I was mainly active.

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:05.292
And we tagged them
very simply, not very high-tech,

00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:06.492
with a big, long pole.

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:09.142
This is a beachcaster rod
with a tag on the end.

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:11.837
You go up in your boat and tag the shark.

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.147
And we were very effective.

00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:17.009
We tagged 105 sharks last summer.

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:20.684
We got 50 in three days
off Inishowen Peninsula.

00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:22.265
Half the challenge to get access

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.503
is to be in the right place
at the right time.

00:05:24.527 --> 00:05:27.996
But it's a very simple, easy technique;
I'll show you what it looks like.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.871
We use a pole camera on the boat
to actually film the shark.
