00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.215
with sea-surface temperature
and water depth,

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:33.592
but again, the second shark
spent most of its time

00:06:33.616 --> 00:06:34.965
in and around the Irish Sea.

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:38.167
Colleagues from the Isle of Man
last year actually tagged one shark

00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:41.375
that went from the Isle of Man
to Nova Scotia in about 90 days.

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:44.722
Nine and a half thousand kilometers --
we never thought that happened.

00:06:44.746 --> 00:06:48.670
Another colleague in the States
tagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts.

00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:50.134
His tags didn't really work.

00:06:50.158 --> 00:06:51.991
All he knows is where he tagged them,

00:06:52.015 --> 00:06:53.483
and where they popped off.

00:06:53.507 --> 00:06:55.825
His tags popped off in the Caribbean,

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.376
and even in Brazil.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.715
We thought basking sharks
were temperate animals

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:01.231
and lived in our latitudes,
