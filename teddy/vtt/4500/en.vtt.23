00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:31.414
the shark smacked the side
of the boat with his tail,

00:11:31.438 --> 00:11:34.582
more, I think, in startle to the fact
that a boat came near it,

00:11:34.606 --> 00:11:36.592
rather than the tag going in.

00:11:36.957 --> 00:11:39.353
And that was fine. We got wet. No problem.

00:11:39.876 --> 00:11:43.866
And then when myself and Emmett
got back to Malin Head, to the pier,

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.332
I noticed some black slime
on the front of the boat.

00:11:46.356 --> 00:11:49.085
I used to spend a lot of time
on commercial fishing boats,

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:50.588
and I remember fishermen saying

00:11:50.612 --> 00:11:53.435
they can tell when a basking shark
has been caught in a net,

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:55.339
because it leaves a black slime behind.

00:11:55.363 --> 00:11:57.194
So that must have come from the shark.

00:11:57.218 --> 00:12:00.612
Now, we had an interest
in getting tissue samples for genetics
