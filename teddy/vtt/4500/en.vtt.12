00:05:59.452 --> 00:06:02.542
you set the tag to detach
from the shark after a fixed period --

00:06:02.566 --> 00:06:03.964
in this case, eight months --

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.096
and literally to the day,
the tag popped off,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.999
drifted up, said hello to the satellite

00:06:08.023 --> 00:06:10.892
and sent, not all the data,
but enough data for us to use.

00:06:10.916 --> 00:06:14.160
This is the only way to really work out
their behavior and movements

00:06:14.184 --> 00:06:15.375
when they're underwater.

00:06:16.277 --> 00:06:18.376
And here's a couple
of maps that we've done.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.556
In that one, you can see
that we tagged both off Kerry.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.065
Basically, it spent all its time,
the last eight months, in Irish waters.

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:27.098
On Christmas, it was out
on the shelf edge.

00:06:27.122 --> 00:06:29.066
Here's one we haven't ground-truthed yet

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.215
with sea-surface temperature
and water depth,
