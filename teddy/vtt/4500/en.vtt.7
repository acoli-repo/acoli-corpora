00:03:29.123 --> 00:03:33.146
But more commonly all around the island,
they were known as the sunfish.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.879
And this represents their habit
of basking on the surface

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:37.061
when the sun is out.

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:39.648
There's great concern
that basking sharks are depleted

00:03:39.672 --> 00:03:41.185
all throughout the world.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.202
Some say it's not population decline,

00:03:43.226 --> 00:03:45.715
it might be a change
in the distribution of plankton.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:46.896
It's been suggested

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.144
that these sharks would make
fantastic indicators of climate change,

00:03:50.168 --> 00:03:52.579
as they're basically
continuous plankton recorders,

00:03:52.603 --> 00:03:54.423
swimming around with their mouth open.

00:03:54.447 --> 00:03:56.732
They're now listed
as vulnerable under the IUCN.

00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:59.716
There's movements in Europe
to try and stop catching them.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.196
There's now a ban on catching
and even landing them,
