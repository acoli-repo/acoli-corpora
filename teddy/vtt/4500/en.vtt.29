00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:30.907
and they're a bit more dramatic.

00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:32.967
You probably saw
the humpback whale footage

00:14:32.991 --> 00:14:35.101
we got a month or two ago
off County Wexford.

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:37.375
And you always think
you might have some legacy

00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:38.893
you can leave the world behind,

00:14:38.917 --> 00:14:41.852
and I was thinking of humpback
whales breaching and dolphins.

00:14:41.876 --> 00:14:44.261
But hey -- sometimes
these things are sent to you

00:14:44.285 --> 00:14:46.477
and you just have to take them
when they come.

00:14:46.501 --> 00:14:48.598
So this is possibly
going to be my legacy --

00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:50.264
Simon's Shark Slime.

00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:51.922
We got more money this year

00:14:51.946 --> 00:14:54.567
to carry on collecting
more and more samples.

00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:57.531
One thing that is very useful
is that we use a pole camera --

00:14:57.555 --> 00:14:59.968
this is my colleague, Joanne,
with a pole camera --

00:14:59.992 --> 00:15:01.931
where you can look underneath the shark.
