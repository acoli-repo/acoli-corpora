00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.156
So if you look at
all those studies I showed you,

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.836
the total number of samples worldwide

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.384
is 86, at present.

00:11:06.858 --> 00:11:08.950
So it's very important work,

00:11:08.974 --> 00:11:11.069
and they can ask
some really good questions,

00:11:11.093 --> 00:11:15.376
and tell us about population size
and subpopulations and structure,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.053
but they're constrained
by lack of samples.

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.593
When we were out tagging our sharks --

00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:23.927
this is how we tagged them on the front
of a RIB, get in there fast --

00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:26.117
occasionally, the sharks do react.

00:11:26.141 --> 00:11:28.892
On one occasion, when we were
up in Malin Head in Donegal,

00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:31.414
the shark smacked the side
of the boat with his tail,
