There's now a ban on catching
and even landing them,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.285
even landing ones caught accidentally.

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:05.897
They're not protected in Ireland;

00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:08.906
in fact, they have no legislative
status in Ireland whatsoever,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.860
despite our importance for the species

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:14.438
and also the historical context
within which basking sharks reside.

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:15.976
We know very little about them.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.101
And most of what we do know

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.911
is based on their habit
of coming to the surface --

00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:24.337
we try and guess what they're doing
from their behavior on the surface.

00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:27.429
I only found out last year,
at a conference on the Isle of Man,

00:04:27.453 --> 00:04:30.167
just how unusual it is to live somewhere
