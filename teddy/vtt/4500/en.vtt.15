00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:32.431
So we can work with geneticists
who understand that.

00:07:32.455 --> 00:07:35.035
So when they looked at
the genetics of basking sharks,

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:38.068
they found that the diversity
was incredibly low.

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:39.951
If you look at the first line, really,

00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:43.431
you can see that all these different
shark species are all quite similar.

00:07:43.455 --> 00:07:45.233
I think this means they're all sharks

00:07:45.257 --> 00:07:47.187
and they've come from a common ancestry.

00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:49.281
But if you look at nucleotide diversity,

00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:52.525
which is more genetics
that are passed on through the parents,

00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:55.382
you see that basking sharks,
if you look at the first study,

00:07:55.406 --> 00:07:59.376
was order of magnitude less diverse
even than other shark species.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.472
You can see this work
was only done in 2006.
