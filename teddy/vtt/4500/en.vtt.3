00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.307
and as the shark came round,
it would hit the net,

00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:32.727
the net would collapse on it.

00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:34.446
It would often drown and suffocate.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.325
Or at times, they would row out
in their small curraghs

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.883
and kill it with a lance
through the back of the neck.

00:01:39.907 --> 00:01:42.651
And then they'd tow the sharks
back to Purteen Harbour,

00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:44.399
boil them up, use the oil.

00:01:44.423 --> 00:01:48.347
They also used the flesh
as well, for fertilizer

00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:51.267
and also would fin the sharks.

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.132
This is probably the biggest threat
to sharks worldwide --

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.195
the finning of sharks.

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.708
We're often frightened
of sharks, thanks to "Jaws."

00:01:58.732 --> 00:02:01.786
Maybe five or six people
get killed by sharks every year.
