00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.059
literally just by stringing a Manila rope

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:34.661
off the tip of Keem Bay
up in Achill Island.

00:02:35.177 --> 00:02:37.590
Sharks were still killed
up into the mid-80s,

00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:40.627

like Dunmore East in County Waterford.

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:43.480
About two and a half, 3,000
sharks were killed up till '85,

00:02:43.504 --> 00:02:45.198
mainly by Norwegian vessels.

00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:46.376

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.939
but these are Norwegian
basking shark hunting vessels.

00:02:48.963 --> 00:02:52.518
The black line in the crow's nest
signifies this is a shark vessel,

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:54.614
rather than a whaling vessel.

00:02:54.638 --> 00:02:57.483
The importance of basking sharks
to the coast communities

00:02:57.507 --> 00:02:59.185
is recognized through the language.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.494
I don't pretend
to [know many Irish words],
