I don't pretend
to [know many Irish words],

00:03:01.518 --> 00:03:05.076
but in Kerry they were often
known as "ainmhide Na seolta,"

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.675
"the monster with the sails."

00:03:07.101 --> 00:03:10.105
Another title would be "liop an dá lapa,"

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.039
"the unwieldy beast with two fins."

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.835
"Liabhán mór," suggesting a big animal.

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.362
Or my favorite, "liabhán chor gréine,"
"the great fish of the sun."

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:20.922
That's a lovely, evocative name.

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:24.476
On Tory Island -- a strange place
anyway -- they were known as "muldoons."

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.521
(Laughter)

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:26.740
No one seems to know why.

00:03:26.764 --> 00:03:29.099
Hope there's no one
from Tory here. Lovely place.

00:03:29.123 --> 00:03:33.146
But more commonly all around the island,
they were known as the sunfish.
