00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:02.430
Basking sharks are awesome creatures.

00:00:02.454 --> 00:00:03.777
They are just magnificent.

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:06.976
They grow 10 meters long; some say bigger.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:09.388
They might weigh up to two tons.

00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:10.976
Some say up to five tons.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.253
They're the second-largest
fish in the world.

00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:15.889
They're also harmless
plankton-feeding animals.

00:00:15.913 --> 00:00:21.349
And they are thought to be able to filter
a cubic kilometer of water every hour

00:00:21.373 --> 00:00:26.110
and can feed on 30 kilos
of zoo plankton a day to survive.

00:00:26.134 --> 00:00:27.499
They're fantastic creatures.

00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:28.880
We're very lucky in Ireland,

00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:32.484
we have plenty of basking sharks
and plenty of opportunities to study them.
