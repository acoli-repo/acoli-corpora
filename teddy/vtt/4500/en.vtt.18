00:08:58.506 --> 00:09:00.664
you couldn't tell
the difference, genetically,

00:09:00.688 --> 00:09:04.121
from one from the Pacific, Atlantic,
New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa.

00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:05.724
They all basically seem the same.

00:09:05.748 --> 00:09:08.653
Which, again, is kind of surprising;
you wouldn't expect that.

00:09:08.677 --> 00:09:11.024
I don't understand or pretend
to understand this;

00:09:11.048 --> 00:09:12.958
I suspect most geneticists don't either,

00:09:12.982 --> 00:09:14.376
but they produce the numbers.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.727
So you can actually estimate
the population size

00:09:16.751 --> 00:09:18.921
based on the diversity of the genetics.

00:09:18.945 --> 00:09:22.497
And Rus Hoelzel came up with
an effective population size:

00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:24.354
8,200 animals.

00:09:24.378 --> 00:09:27.282
That's it -- 8,000 animals in the world.

00:09:27.306 --> 00:09:29.528
You're thinking,
"That's ridiculous. No way."

00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:31.376
So Les did a finer study,
