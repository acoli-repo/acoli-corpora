00:04:27.453 --> 00:04:30.167
just how unusual it is to live somewhere

00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.738
where basking sharks regularly,
frequently and predictably

00:04:33.762 --> 00:04:36.306
come to the surface to "bask."

00:04:36.726 --> 00:04:38.821
It's a fantastic opportunity
for a scientist

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.646
to see and experience basking sharks.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.019
They are awesome creatures.

00:04:42.043 --> 00:04:45.499
It gives us a fantastic opportunity
to study them, to get access to them.

00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:48.921
What we've been doing for a couple
years -- last year was a big year --

00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:50.799
is we started tagging sharks,

00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:53.869
so we could try to get some idea
of sight fidelity and movement

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:55.051
and things like that.

00:04:55.075 --> 00:04:58.376
So we concentrated mainly
in North Donegal and West Kerry

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.111
as the two areas
where I was mainly active.
