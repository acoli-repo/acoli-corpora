00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:31.376
So Les did a finer study,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.178
and he found out it came out about 9,000.

00:09:34.202 --> 00:09:37.083
Using different microsatellites
gave the different results,

00:09:37.107 --> 00:09:41.748
but the mean of all these
studies is about 5,000,

00:09:41.772 --> 00:09:43.376
which I personally don't believe.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.030
But then, I am a skeptic.

00:09:45.054 --> 00:09:47.483
But even if you toss a few numbers around,

00:09:47.507 --> 00:09:50.924
you're probably talking an effective
population of about 20,000 animals.

00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:55.463
Do you remember how many they killed
off Achill in the 70s and the 50s?

00:09:55.487 --> 00:09:57.183
So what it tells us, actually,

00:09:57.207 --> 00:10:00.459
is that there's actually a risk
of extinction of this species
