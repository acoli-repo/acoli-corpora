00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:32.484
we have plenty of basking sharks
and plenty of opportunities to study them.

00:00:32.508 --> 00:00:34.806
They were very important
to coastal communities,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.266
going back hundreds of years,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.042
especially around
the Claddaghduff, Connemara region

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.664
where subsistence farmers used to sail
out on their hookers and open boats,

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:45.415
sometimes way offshore
to a place called the Sunfish Bank,

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:47.216
about 30 miles west of Achill Island,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.533
to kill the basking sharks.

00:00:48.557 --> 00:00:50.729
This is a woodcut from about the 1800s.

00:00:50.753 --> 00:00:53.504
They were very important,
for the oil out of their liver.

00:00:53.528 --> 00:00:55.990
A third of the basking
shark's size is their liver,

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.797
and it's full of oil, gallons of oil.

00:00:57.821 --> 00:00:59.910
That oil was used especially for lighting,

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.107
but also for dressing wounds
and other things.
