00:01:58.732 --> 00:02:01.786
Maybe five or six people
get killed by sharks every year.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.985
There was someone recently, wasn't there?
Just a couple weeks ago.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.976
We kill about 100 million sharks a year.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.976
So I don't know what the balance is,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.994
but I think sharks have more right
to be fearful of us than we have of them.

00:02:13.018 --> 00:02:14.647
It was a well-documented fishery.

00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:16.874
As you can see here,
it peaked in the '50s,

00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:18.995
where they were killing
1,500 sharks a year.

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.953
And it declined very fast --
a classic boom-and-bust fishery,

00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:24.649
which suggests that a stock
has been depleted

00:02:24.673 --> 00:02:26.611
or there's low reproductive rates.

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:29.105
They killed about 12,000 sharks
within this period,

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.059
literally just by stringing a Manila rope
