00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So this is called "Tembererana."

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
It's based on an Argentinian rhythm

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
called "carnivalito."

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
♫ A dream within a dream, ♫

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
♫ a world within a world, ♫

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
♫ the sound of a primal scream ♫

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
♫ travels out across the land. ♫

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
♫ Images flickering, ♫

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
♫ the sound of the war machine, ♫

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
♫ a procession of limousines ♫
