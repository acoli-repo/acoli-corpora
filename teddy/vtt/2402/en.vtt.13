00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
One thing is, it's unpronounceable.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And it's a made-up word.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It's called "Tembererana."

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And the song is based on

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
what I think was my first

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
childhood attempts

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to think about invisible forces.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So "tembererana" was these dreams,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
in which I would be running away

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
from bad feelings -- is the only way I can put it.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So this is called "Tembererana."
