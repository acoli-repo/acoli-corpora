00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
That's the first time I've ever played it.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
(Applause)

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It's a "feel the fear and do it anyway" kind of thing.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
This next song is a song

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It was one of the titles

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that I was sort of thinking about calling my record,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
except there's a couple of problems.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
One thing is, it's unpronounceable.
