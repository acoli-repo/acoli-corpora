and I've never played these songs for anybody

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
except the microphone.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is a song that I wrote

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
about the meaning of technology,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which goes perfectly with this gathering.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I started thinking about -- when I was in college,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
especially as a blind person,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
doing a research paper was a major undertaking.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You had to go to the library,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
see if you could get them to find the books for you,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you know, footnotes and all that.
