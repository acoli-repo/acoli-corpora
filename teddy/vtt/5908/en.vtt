00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:12.768
Your town is holding a mayoral election 
and the stakes have never been higher:

00:00:12.768 --> 00:00:15.598
the outcome will decide the fate 
of a local movement

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.770
to rely on 100% renewable energy.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.588
One mayoral nominee, Joanna B. Greene, 
is a champion of this movement,

00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:27.698
while the other, Stannis Quo, 
staunchly opposes it.

00:00:27.698 --> 00:00:32.601
He’s announced he’ll use whatever tactics 
are necessary to win the election.
