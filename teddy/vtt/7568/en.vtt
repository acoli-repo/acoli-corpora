Unfortunately, thatâ€™s what
the scientific evidence tells us.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.678
Part of the reason is due to an imbalance

00:00:15.678 --> 00:00:20.933
in two key appetite-regulating hormones
called leptin and ghrelin.

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:25.313
Now, leptin sends a signal
of fullness to your brain,

00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:27.899
so you feel satiated by your food.

00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:31.110
Ghrelin, on the other hand,
does the opposite.
