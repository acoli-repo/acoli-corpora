00:00:00.163 --> 00:00:01.372
We live in a culture

00:00:01.414 --> 00:00:05.251
that doesn't take mental health
issues seriously.

00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:06.836
There's a lot of stigma.

00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:09.047
Some people tell you to just suck it up,

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:11.549
or get it together, or to stop worrying,

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:13.259
or that it's all in your head.

00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:15.845
But I'm here to tell you
that anxiety disorders,

00:00:15.887 --> 00:00:18.097
they're as real as diabetes.

[Body Stuff with Dr. Jen Gunter]

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:23.144
Hi again.

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:24.353
It's Dr. Jen,

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:26.439
and I've noticed something
with my patients.

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:27.732
They often describe to me

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:30.068
some classic symptoms
of an anxiety disorder.
