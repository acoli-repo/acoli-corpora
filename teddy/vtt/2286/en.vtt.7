00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:32.097
and we are constantly exposed
to this air pollution

00:03:32.121 --> 00:03:34.146
because we cannot stop breathing.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.679
I mean, we can do it for 10 seconds,
but no more than that.

00:03:38.157 --> 00:03:39.780
We cannot stop breathing

00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:41.305
and, in addition,

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:47.752
we need, every day,
around 10,000 liters of air.

00:03:48.688 --> 00:03:51.944
So we said that we have
seven million deaths

00:03:51.968 --> 00:03:54.460
caused by air pollution every year.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.759
Are we panicking?

00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:58.661
Are we keeping calm?

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:03.745
Are we declaring a national disaster,
a global emergency?
