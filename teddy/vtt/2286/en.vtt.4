00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:02.384
we are inhaling toxic pollutants,

00:02:02.408 --> 00:02:06.704
and our poor pink and lovely lungs

00:02:06.728 --> 00:02:08.584
are suffering all of that.

00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:12.460

00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:17.006
we have put together a lot of knowledge
about what's happened to that,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.340

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.895

is a very complex mixture

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.608

liquid droplets
