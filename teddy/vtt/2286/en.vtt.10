00:04:59.107 --> 00:05:03.158
First, there is an emerging
body of evidence

00:05:03.182 --> 00:05:06.400
regarding the potential harmful effects

00:05:06.424 --> 00:05:07.802
of air pollutants

00:05:07.826 --> 00:05:10.671

00:05:23.967 --> 00:05:27.290
and from the bloodstream,

00:05:27.314 --> 00:05:29.491
they can reach the whole body,

00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:32.110
threatening every organ,
