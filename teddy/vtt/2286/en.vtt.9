00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:30.376
We all need it.

00:04:31.063 --> 00:04:33.580
Hopefully, we all use it --

00:04:33.604 --> 00:04:34.673
(Laughter)

00:04:34.697 --> 00:04:36.369
some more than others.

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:39.730
And in the last 10 years of history,

00:04:39.754 --> 00:04:43.611
the research about the relationship
between air pollution

00:04:43.635 --> 00:04:45.284
and our brain's health

00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:47.553
has been increased dramatically,

00:04:47.577 --> 00:04:52.102
so maybe now our brain
is going up in smoke.

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:54.983
But let me tell you the evidence,

00:04:55.007 --> 00:04:58.546
what we know so far
about air pollution in our brain.

00:04:59.107 --> 00:05:03.158
First, there is an emerging
body of evidence
