liquid droplets

00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:32.668
and gaseous chemicals.

00:02:32.692 --> 00:02:34.518
Imagine all of this mixture

00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:40.427
that might come from sources
like household fuel burning

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:42.626
or industry or traffic

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.777
or many other indoor and outdoor sources.

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:50.700
And, of course, different
sources of pollution

00:02:50.724 --> 00:02:54.822
will make different
mixtures of pollutants.

00:02:55.512 --> 00:02:58.713
The point is that all of these toxins,

00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:01.120
they can be combined in different ways.
