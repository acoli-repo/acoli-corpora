00:08:58.828 --> 00:09:00.482
at the World Health Organization,

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:04.852
and I know that the knowledge is there
and the solutions as well.

00:09:05.483 --> 00:09:09.380
Sure, some places
are more polluted than others,

00:09:09.404 --> 00:09:11.705
but this a global issue,

00:09:11.729 --> 00:09:18.726
and no individual, no city,
no group, no country, no region

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.710
will be able to solve it alone.

00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:26.996
We need very strong commitments
and very strong action by everyone:

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.394
civil society,

00:09:29.418 --> 00:09:30.901
private sector,
