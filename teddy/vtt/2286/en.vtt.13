00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.371
In addition to that, some evidence found

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:40.191
that exposing our children's
and young adults' brains

00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:43.032
for a long time to particulate matter

00:06:43.056 --> 00:06:48.342
will cause some reactions
like brain inflammation,

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.918
altering the neural response

00:06:50.942 --> 00:06:57.912
and [also] leading to the influence
of more protein plaques

00:06:57.936 --> 00:06:59.523
that are accumulating,

00:06:59.547 --> 00:07:02.730
and those can increase
the risks for diseases
