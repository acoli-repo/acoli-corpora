is influencing negatively
the development of their brain.

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:34.839
Let's go to the third: What about adults?

00:07:34.863 --> 00:07:38.106
According to recent scientific evidence,

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:46.346
long-term exposure to particulate matter
will cause a cognitive decline

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.521
in study participants as they age.

00:07:49.545 --> 00:07:50.764
And not only that,

00:07:50.788 --> 00:07:56.160
if you expose them to long-term,
very fine particulate matter,

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:59.582
their brain will age more rapidly,

00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:02.582
and they will have higher odds
