Are we declaring a national disaster,
a global emergency?

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.831
Well, no, and in fact I'm asking myself
this question every day:

00:04:08.855 --> 00:04:10.546
What is happening?

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.065
But here is something that maybe
will force us to react more quickly.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.076
Air pollution is not just
affecting our lungs.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.170
It's affecting our brain as well.

00:04:24.194 --> 00:04:25.488
This is our brain.

00:04:26.186 --> 00:04:27.351
Beautiful.

00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:28.655
We all have it.

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:30.376
We all need it.
