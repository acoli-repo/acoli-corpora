About 75 years ago,

00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:05.335
my grandfather, a young man,

00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:07.246
walked into a tent

00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:08.743
that was converted into a

00:00:08.743 --> 00:00:10.454
movie theater like that,

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:12.654
and he fell hopelessly in love

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:13.983
with the woman he saw on the

00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:17.312
silver screen: none other than Mae West,

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:19.227
the heartthrob of the '30s,

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.267
and he could never forget her.

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:23.187
In fact, when he had his daughter

00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:25.379
many years later, he wanted to

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:26.795
name her after Mae West,

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:28.379
but can you imagine an Indian

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:29.915
child name Mae West?

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:31.601
The Indian family said, no way!
