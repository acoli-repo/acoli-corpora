This summer, I was visiting
family in England.

00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:05.756
There was a heat wave.

00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:08.236
It was hot, and it was humid.

00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:10.116
There was very little breeze.

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:13.756
The temperature was hovering 
around 29 degrees centigrade

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:14.756
for days on end,

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:16.476
and the nights were not much better.

00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:18.276
In our little bungalow,

00:00:18.276 --> 00:00:20.116
there was nowhere to get cool.

00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:23.116
We had one fan moving hot air around.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:24.916
I was worried for my mom.

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:27.036
Heat can send your heart rate
all the way up.

00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:29.236
The only place to get cool,

00:00:29.236 --> 00:00:30.236
the only relief,
