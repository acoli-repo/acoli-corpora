00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.674
babies prefer to hear human sounds,

00:02:40.698 --> 00:02:42.822
rather than just sounds
in the environment.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:45.323
They prefer to look at people
rather than at things,

00:02:45.347 --> 00:02:48.688
and even as they're looking at people,

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.437

to look at people

00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:59.700
who are looking at them
rather than people who are looking away.
