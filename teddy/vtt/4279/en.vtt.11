It happens to some
of our phyletic cousins,

00:05:30.824 --> 00:05:34.890
because if you're a monkey,
and you look at another monkey,

00:05:34.914 --> 00:05:38.908
and that monkey has a higher
hierarchy position than you,

00:05:38.932 --> 00:05:42.461
and that is considered
to be a signal or threat,

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:44.879
well, you are not going
to be alive for long.

00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:50.197
So something that in other species
are survival mechanisms,

00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:53.328
without which they
wouldn't basically live,

00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:55.883
we bring into the context of human beings,

00:05:55.907 --> 00:05:59.624
and this is what we need
to simply act, socially.
