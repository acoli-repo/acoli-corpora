00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:01.360
but often in an awkward fashion,

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.889
without that immediate resonance.

00:08:05.812 --> 00:08:09.558
Well, this is much more prevalent
than we thought at the time.

00:08:09.582 --> 00:08:10.993
When I started in this field,

00:08:11.017 --> 00:08:14.105
we thought there were four individuals
with autism per 10,000 --

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:15.400
a very rare condition.

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:19.515
Well, now we know it's more
like one in 100.

00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:23.245
There are millions of individuals
with autism all around us.

00:08:25.216 --> 00:08:28.469
The societal cost
of this condition is huge,

00:08:28.585 --> 00:08:31.533
in the US alone,
maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars.
