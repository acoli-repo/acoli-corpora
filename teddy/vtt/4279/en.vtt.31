00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.530
you're not exerting
influence on what happens

00:15:31.554 --> 00:15:33.908
as they navigate their daily lives.

00:15:35.236 --> 00:15:41.996
Now, we thought those data
were so powerful, in a way,

00:15:42.686 --> 00:15:45.936
that we wanted to see what happened
in the first six months of life,

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.168
because if you interact
with a two- and a three-month-old,

00:15:49.192 --> 00:15:52.442
you'd be surprised
by how social those babies are.

00:15:53.513 --> 00:15:56.370
And what we see
in the first six months of life

00:15:56.394 --> 00:16:01.271
is that those two groups
can be segregated very easily.
