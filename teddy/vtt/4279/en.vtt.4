Well, now we know that autism
is this disruption,

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.746
the disruption of this resonance
that I am telling you about.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.704
These are survival skills.

00:02:11.728 --> 00:02:13.855
These are survival skills
that we inherited

00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:18.019
over many, many hundreds
of thousands of years of evolution.

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:23.513
You see, babies are born
in a state of utter fragility.

00:02:24.032 --> 00:02:26.161
Without the caregiver,
they wouldn't survive,

00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:28.691
so it stands to reason
that nature would endow them

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.492
with these mechanisms of survival.
