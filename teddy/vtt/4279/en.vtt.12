00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:06.482
maybe she can hear you.

00:06:06.506 --> 00:06:08.128
Well, a few minutes later,

00:06:08.152 --> 00:06:10.093

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.271

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.447
Now, most of us make a big dichotomy

00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:27.351
between the world of things
and the world of people.

00:06:28.882 --> 00:06:33.373
Now, for this girl,
that division line is not so clear,
