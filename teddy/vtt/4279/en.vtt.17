00:08:28.585 --> 00:08:31.533
in the US alone,
maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars.

00:08:31.557 --> 00:08:32.745
And you know what?

00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:37.406
Most of those funds are associated
with adolescents and particularly adults

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.181
who are severely disabled,

00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:41.366
individuals who need
wraparound services --

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.646
services that are very, very intensive.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.756
And those services can cost in excess
of 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year.

00:08:48.536 --> 00:08:51.760
Those are individuals who did not
benefit from early treatment,

00:08:52.474 --> 00:08:56.612
because now we know
that autism creates itself

00:08:56.636 --> 00:09:00.788
as individuals diverge in that pathway
of learning that I mentioned to you.
