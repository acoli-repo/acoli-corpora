They also learn to follow
other people's gazes,

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:04.664
because whatever people are looking at
is what they are thinking about.

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:10.350
And soon enough, they start to learn
about the meaning of things,

00:04:10.374 --> 00:04:12.747
because when somebody
is looking at something

00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:14.989
or somebody is pointing at something,

00:04:15.013 --> 00:04:17.186
they're not just getting
a directional cue.

00:04:17.752 --> 00:04:21.435
They are getting the other
person's meaning of that thing,

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.669
the attitude.

00:04:22.693 --> 00:04:27.464
And soon enough, they start
building this body of meanings,

00:04:27.488 --> 00:04:31.340
but meanings that were acquired
within the realm of social interaction.
