00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.341
I always wanted to become
a walking laboratory of social engagement:

00:00:06.313 --> 00:00:11.683
to resonate other people's feelings,
thoughts, intentions, motivations,

00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:13.368
in the act of being with them.

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.528
As a scientist, I always wanted
to measure that resonance,

00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:23.394
that sense of the other
that happens so quickly,

00:00:23.418 --> 00:00:24.725
in the blink of an eye.

00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:28.008
We intuit other people's feelings;

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:31.175
we know the meaning of their actions
even before they happen.
