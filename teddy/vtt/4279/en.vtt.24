00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.760
Well, it's hard to do that,

00:12:04.784 --> 00:12:06.962
so we had to create the technologies.

00:12:06.986 --> 00:12:09.455
We had to basically step inside a body.

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:12.073
We had to see the world through her eyes.

00:12:13.192 --> 00:12:15.504
And so in the past many years,

00:12:15.528 --> 00:12:17.924
we've been building these new technologies

00:12:17.948 --> 00:12:19.529
that are based on eye tracking.

00:12:19.553 --> 00:12:24.469
We can see, moment by moment,
what children are engaging with.

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:27.810
This is my colleague, Warren Jones,

00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:31.128
with whom we've been building
these methods, these studies,
