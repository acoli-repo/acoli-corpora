00:01:28.243 --> 00:01:30.031
for individuals with autism,

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:32.368
you'd hear a lot of noise,

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:36.465
plenty of commotion, actions,
people doing things.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.215
But they're always doing
things by themselves.

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:44.886
So they may be looking
at a light in the ceiling,

00:01:45.527 --> 00:01:48.309
or they may be isolated in the corner,

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:52.471
or they might be engaged
in these repetitive movements,

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:55.914
in self-stimulatory movements
that led them nowhere.

00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:59.157
Extremely, extremely isolated.
