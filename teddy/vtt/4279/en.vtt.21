for the child, for the family,
and for the community at large.

00:10:31.075 --> 00:10:33.648
So this is our view of autism.

00:10:34.145 --> 00:10:37.467
There are over a hundred genes
that are associated with autism.

00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:39.450
In fact, we believe there are going to be

00:10:39.474 --> 00:10:43.279
something between 300 and 600
genes associated with autism,

00:10:43.303 --> 00:10:46.606
and genetic anomalies,
much more than just genes.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.779
And we actually have
a bit of a question here,

00:10:51.644 --> 00:10:54.929
because if there are so many
different causes of autism,

00:10:54.953 --> 00:10:59.221
how do you go from those liabilities
to the actual syndrome?

00:10:59.245 --> 00:11:00.796
Because people like myself,
