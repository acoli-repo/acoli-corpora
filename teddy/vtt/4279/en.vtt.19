00:09:27.974 --> 00:09:30.685
It's not that that window
closes; it doesn't.

00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:34.134
But it diminishes considerably.

00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:37.997
And yet, the median age
of diagnosis in this country

00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:39.933
is still about five years,

00:09:39.957 --> 00:09:42.052
and in disadvantaged populations,

00:09:42.076 --> 00:09:45.205
the populations that don't have
access to clinical services,

00:09:45.229 --> 00:09:47.642
rural populations, minorities,

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:51.047
the age of diagnosis is later still,

00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:53.096
which is almost as if I were to tell you

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.887
that we are condemning those communities
to have individuals with autism

00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:59.234
whose condition is going
to be more severe.
