00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:31.128
with whom we've been building
these methods, these studies,

00:12:31.152 --> 00:12:32.481
for the past 12 years.

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:36.035
And you see there a happy five-month-old,

00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:41.856
a five-month little boy
who is going to watch things

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.792
that are brought from his world:

00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:46.829
his mom, the caregiver,

00:12:46.853 --> 00:12:51.083
but also experiences that he would have
were he to be in his daycare.

00:12:51.884 --> 00:12:55.724
What we want is to embrace that world
and bring it into our laboratory,

00:12:55.748 --> 00:12:57.782
but in order for us to do that,

00:12:57.806 --> 00:13:02.061
we had to create
these very sophisticated measures,
