these very sophisticated measures,

00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:05.566
measures of how people, how little babies,

and here, what you see
is what we call a funnel of attention.

00:13:19.826 --> 00:13:21.191

through the eyes of 35 typically
developing two-year-olds.

00:13:28.837 --> 00:13:31.134
And we freeze one frame,
