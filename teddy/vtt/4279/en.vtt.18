00:08:56.636 --> 00:09:00.788
as individuals diverge in that pathway
of learning that I mentioned to you.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.773
Were we to be able
to identify this condition

00:09:03.797 --> 00:09:06.547
at an earlier point,
and intervene and treat --

00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:11.866
I can tell you, this has been probably
something that has changed my life

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.186
in the past 10 years,

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:17.464
this notion that we can absolutely
attenuate this condition.

00:09:18.922 --> 00:09:21.277
Also, we have a window of opportunity,

00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:23.921
because the brain
is malleable for just so long,

00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:27.950
and that window of opportunity
happens in the first three years of life.

00:09:27.974 --> 00:09:30.685
It's not that that window
closes; it doesn't.
