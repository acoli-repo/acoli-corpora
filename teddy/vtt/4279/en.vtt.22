Because people like myself,

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.767
when we walk into a playroom,

00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:06.149

to a syndrome that has some homogeneity?

00:11:12.491 --> 00:11:15.182

which is development.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.433
And in fact, we are very interested

don't necessarily convert into autism.

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.027
Autism creates itself.

00:11:28.812 --> 00:11:32.657
Were we to be able to intervene
during those years of life,
