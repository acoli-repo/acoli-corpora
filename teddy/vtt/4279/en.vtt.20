00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:02.706
So I feel that we have
a bioethical imperative.

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:04.897
The science is there.

00:10:06.025 --> 00:10:08.145
But no science is of relevance

00:10:08.169 --> 00:10:11.098
if it doesn't have an impact
on the community.

00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:14.681
And we just can't afford
that missed opportunity,

00:10:14.705 --> 00:10:17.650
because children with autism
become adults with autism.

00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:22.416
And we feel that those things we can do

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.818
for these children,
for those families, early on,

00:10:24.842 --> 00:10:27.019
will have lifetime consequences --

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:31.051
for the child, for the family,
and for the community at large.
