00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So, really even challenging the notion

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
of what can be considered a story.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
not with the Internet,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So these are some newer projects that

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
actually aren't even launched publicly yet.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The first such one is called "The Whale Hunt."

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the northernmost settlement in the United States,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
with a family of Inupiat Eskimos,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
documenting their annual spring whale hunt.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,
