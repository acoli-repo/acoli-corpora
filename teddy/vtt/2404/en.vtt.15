00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
some kind of omniscient, external body

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
through whose eyes you see the story.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
We're very used to this.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and there's all of these overlapping stories

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
intersecting and touching each other.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
to surface those types of stories. So, in the case of "The Whale Hunt,"

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,
