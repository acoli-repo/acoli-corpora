You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
on a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from "We Feel Fine."

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
These are the images that are automatically constructed.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe."

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the kisses felt messy and wrong,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual."

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
"I can feel my cancer grow."

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
"I feel pretty."
