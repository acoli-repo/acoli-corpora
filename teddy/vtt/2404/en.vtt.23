00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I would start by asking people to rate their happiness

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
between one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and give them that number of balloons to hold.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and some really sad soul holding one balloon.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
But you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
(Laughter)

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And then I would ask them a number of questions like

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
what was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And when they made a wish, I would write their wish

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.
