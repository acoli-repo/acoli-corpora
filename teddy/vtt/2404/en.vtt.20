00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And now we've whittled down that whole story

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
to just 29 matching photographs,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and then we can enter the narrative at that position.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
These whales are about 40 feet long,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
for the community for much of the year.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Skipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
They use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and an incredibly efficient process.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
This is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
This is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.
