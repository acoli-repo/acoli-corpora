00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
This is an 11-year-old student.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
He was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and they all had plastic toy guns.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
His wish was to become a police officer.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
He was getting started early. Those were his hands.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I took pictures of everybody's hands,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and asked everybody to make a funny face.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
A 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy.
