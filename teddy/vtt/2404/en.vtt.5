every two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
"I feel" and "I am feeling." And when it finds one of those phrases,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
it grabs the full sentence up to the period

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000

These dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
feelings from the last few hours,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.
