00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
dominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
with an excitement level of high?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I built a web interface for viewing "The Whale Hunt" that attempts to do just this.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
You can start to see some of the story here, told by color.
