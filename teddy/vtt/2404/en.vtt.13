00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So every five minutes, I took a photograph.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
When I was awake, with the camera around my neck.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
When I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And then in moments of high adrenaline,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
like when something exciting was happening,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I would up that photographic frequency to as many as

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
37 photographs in five minutes.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So what this created was a photographic heartbeat

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
that sped up and slowed down, more or less matching

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
the changing pace of my own heartbeat.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
That was the first concept here.
