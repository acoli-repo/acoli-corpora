00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
You can start to see some of the story here, told by color.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
in the basement apartment where I was staying.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
You can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
These are organized chronologically.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And any of these can be clicked,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and then the narrative is entered at that position.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.
