00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
the changing pace of my own heartbeat.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
That was the first concept here.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
photographs, movies, even lectures like this one --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,
