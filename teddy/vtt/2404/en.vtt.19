00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
showing the exciting moments of adrenaline.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in "The Whale Hunt"

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and the two whales that were killed down here.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And we could do something as arbitrary as, say,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
extract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And now we've whittled down that whole story
