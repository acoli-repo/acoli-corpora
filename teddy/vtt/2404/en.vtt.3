As opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,

that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and I noticed that it was suddenly possible

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores
