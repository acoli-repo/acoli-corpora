00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in some unconventional ways.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Anyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in collecting imaginary stories.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So this is a picture of me

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
from reality -- so, real stories.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,
