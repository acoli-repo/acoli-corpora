00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
feelings from the last few hours,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
so the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And the diameter of each dot corresponds

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to the length of the sentence inside.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,"

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
"I got this on some trading locally,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap."

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Also, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.
