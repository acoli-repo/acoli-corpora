00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
man-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python."

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So the next movement is called mobs.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
This provides a slightly more statistical look at things.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
dominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and the snowy ones flutter to the ground.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.
