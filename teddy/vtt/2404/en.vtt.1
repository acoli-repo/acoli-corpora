00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
stories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So I'll be talking about each of those today.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I have many of these books,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They accompany me wherever I go in my life,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and I fill them with all sorts of things,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
records of my lived experience:

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
dead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,
