00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
documenting their annual spring whale hunt.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
camping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And that water that you see there is the open lead,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
it throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
under the ice, and cuts it up.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So I went up there, and I lived with these guys

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
out in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,
