So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
most of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and they've been doing this since the '70s.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And it leads to just a completely different value system.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
where people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and took a number of set photographs,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I would start by asking people to rate their happiness

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
between one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.
