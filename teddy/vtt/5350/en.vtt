00:00:01.323 --> 00:00:03.417
When I was six years old,

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:05.016
our house caught fire,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.444
and my mother died.

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.404
It was a cold February night in Michigan.

00:00:09.428 --> 00:00:11.344
Our chimney had recently been fixed,

00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:14.196
so we had a warm fire going
in the fireplace.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.803
My younger sister and I
were sitting next to our dog

00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:19.807
and coloring with a brand-new box
of colored pencils,

00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.812
when Mom said it was time for bed.

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:23.696
We'd planned to go up north that night

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.973
for a weekend of
snowmobiling and sledding,

00:00:25.997 --> 00:00:28.166
but it was already dark
and snowing outside,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.780
so we decided to leave
the next morning instead.
