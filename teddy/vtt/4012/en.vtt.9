and he fled to England as a refugee,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.360
and we soon followed him.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.376
I was 17.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.856
So these experiences gave me

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.680
a sharp awareness of the atrocities
and injustices in the world.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.136
And I had a strong desire --

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.176
a very keen, deep desire --

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.416
to right wrongs

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.107
and help the victims of oppression.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.536
While studying at college in the UK,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.040
I met others who showed me
how I could channel that desire

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.440
and help through my religion.
