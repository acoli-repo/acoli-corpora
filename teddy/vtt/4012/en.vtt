00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.776
Today I stand before you
as a man who lives life to the full

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.040
in the here and now.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.936
But for a long time,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.160
I lived for death.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.536
I was a young man who believed

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.120
that jihad is to be understood
in the language of force and violence.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.000
I tried to right wrongs
through power and aggression.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.880
I had deep concerns
for the suffering of others
