00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.336
going to school,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.560
living a safe life.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.136
And I couldn't help wonder

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.616
how much these young boys
must have spoken to one another

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.840
about their dreams for such a life.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.840
Victims of circumstances:

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.640
these two young boys,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.376
sleeping rough on the ground,
looking up at the stars,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.896
cynically exploited by their leaders

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.400
for their personal lust
for glory and power.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.136
I soon witnessed boys like them
killing one another
