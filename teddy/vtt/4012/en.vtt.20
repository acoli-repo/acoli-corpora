00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.136
I soon witnessed boys like them
killing one another

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.400
in conflicts between rival groups.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.760
And it was the same everywhere ...

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.776
Afghanistan, Kashmir, Burma,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.280
Philippines, Chechnya;

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.856
petty warlords got the young
and vulnerable to kill one another

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.200
in the name of jihad.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.080
Muslims against Muslims.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.016
Not protecting anyone
against invaders or occupiers;
