00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.280
Why did he die and I lived?

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.056
I carried on.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.696
I fought in Kashmir.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.416
I also recruited for the Philippines,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.240
Bosnia and Chechnya.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.840
And the questions grew.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.776
Later in Burma,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.136
I came across Rohingya fighters,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.416
who were barely teenagers,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.096
born and brought up in the jungle,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.180
carrying machine guns
and grenade launchers.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.200
I met two 13-year-olds
with soft manners and gentle voices.
