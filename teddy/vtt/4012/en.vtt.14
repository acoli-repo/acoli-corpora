00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.216
During one battle in Afghanistan,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.120
some British men and I
formed a special bond

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.696
with a 15-year-old Afghani boy,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.920
Abdullah,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.176
an innocent, loving and lovable kid

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.240
who was always eager to please.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.160
He was poor.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.480
And boys like him
did menial tasks in the camp.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.766
And he seemed happy enough,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.896
but I couldn't help wonder --

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.825
his parents must have missed him dearly.
