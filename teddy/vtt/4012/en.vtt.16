00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.216
And I went out on a short,
pointless skirmish --

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.440
always pointless,

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.880
And I came back a few hours later
to discover he was dead.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.936
He had tried to recover
explosives from that shell.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.560
It exploded, and he died a violent death,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.720
blown to bits by the very same device
that had proved harmless to me.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.600
So I started to question.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.320
How did his death serve any purpose?
