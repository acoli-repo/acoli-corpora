When most people think about the beginnings

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
of AIDS, they're gonna think back to the 1980s.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And certainly, this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and the virus that causes it, HIV.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
from chimpanzees, where the virus originated, into humans who hunt these apes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This photo was taken before the Great Depression

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in Brazzaville, Congo.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
At this time, there were thousands of individuals,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we think, that were infected with HIV.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So I have a couple of really important questions for you.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If this virus was in thousands
