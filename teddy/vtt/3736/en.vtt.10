00:04:57.707 --> 00:05:01.084
There's a question about
the Statue of Liberty and where it is.

00:05:01.108 --> 00:05:03.470
There's no question about Ellis Island,

00:05:03.494 --> 00:05:05.942
about the United States
as an immigrant nation

00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:09.069
and the countless anti-immigrant
laws that were passed.

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.933
There's nothing about
Native American history.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.786
There's a question about
what Martin Luther King, Jr. did,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.298
but largely, there's inadequate
and irresponsible contexts

00:05:19.322 --> 00:05:21.074
about African Americans.

00:05:21.098 --> 00:05:22.288
Here's an example.

00:05:22.312 --> 00:05:26.510
Question number 74
under the American history section

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:32.024
asks applicants to "name one problem
that led to the Civil War."
