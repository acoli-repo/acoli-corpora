00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:32.078
know of these crucial parts
of American history?

00:04:32.102 --> 00:04:36.107
How much of this history makes up
the actual US citizenship test?

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.721
Have you ever seen it?

00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:39.462
It's a mostly oral test,

00:04:39.486 --> 00:04:44.307
and government officers ask applicants
up to 10 of the 100 questions.

00:04:44.331 --> 00:04:48.130
To pass, applicants must get
at least six answers right.

00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:50.330
I looked at the test recently,

00:04:50.354 --> 00:04:53.520
and I was aghast at the questions posed

00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:57.683
and what constitutes acceptable answers
to the glaring omissions.

00:04:57.707 --> 00:05:01.084
There's a question about
the Statue of Liberty and where it is.
