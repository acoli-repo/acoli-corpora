00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.815
We are, I think,
individually and collectively,

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:06.251
rewriting the master narrative of America.

00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:09.814
The people who were once defined
are now doing the defining.

00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:12.664
They're asking the questions
that need to be asked.

00:08:12.688 --> 00:08:14.588
A core part of that redefinition

00:08:14.612 --> 00:08:17.737
is how we define
not only who is an American

00:08:17.761 --> 00:08:19.957
but what constitutes citizenship.

00:08:20.277 --> 00:08:24.458
Which, to me, is our
responsibility to each other.

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:27.968
So consider your own personal narrative

00:08:27.992 --> 00:08:29.190
and ask yourself:

00:08:29.814 --> 00:08:31.146
Where did you come from?
