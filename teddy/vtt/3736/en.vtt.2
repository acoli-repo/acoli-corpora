When he legally emigrated to America
and became a naturalized citizen,

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:04.658
he changed his name from Teofilo to Ted,

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:08.159
after Ted Danson
from the TV show "Cheers."

00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:10.290
Can't get any more American than that.

00:01:10.314 --> 00:01:14.218
Lolo's favorite song
was Frank Sinatra's "My Way,"

00:01:14.242 --> 00:01:18.424
and when it came to figuring out
how to get his only grandson, me,

00:01:18.448 --> 00:01:19.607
to America,

00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:21.266
he decided to do it his way.

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:25.674
According to Lolo, there was no easy
and simple way to get me here,

00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:29.554
so Lolo saved up 4,500 dollars --

00:01:29.578 --> 00:01:31.648
that's a lot of money for a security guard
