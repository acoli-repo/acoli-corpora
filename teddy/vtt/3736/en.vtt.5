00:02:29.493 --> 00:02:32.021
however unrealized and imperfect,

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:36.050
one that only exists because
the first settlers came here freely

00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:38.074
without worry of citizenship.

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.563
So, where did you come from?

00:02:40.923 --> 00:02:42.142
How did you get here?

00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:43.821
Who paid?

00:02:43.845 --> 00:02:46.616
All across America,
in front of diverse audiences --

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.147
conservatives and progressives,

00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:50.197
high school students
and senior citizens --

00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:51.637
I've asked those questions.

00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:54.413
As a person of color,
I always get asked where I'm from,

00:02:54.437 --> 00:02:56.888
as in, "Where are you from from?"

00:02:56.912 --> 00:02:59.931
So I've asked white people
where they're from from, too.
