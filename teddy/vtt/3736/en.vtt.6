00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:02.899
After asking a student
at the University of Georgia

00:03:02.923 --> 00:03:04.123
where he was from,

00:03:04.147 --> 00:03:05.968
he said, "I'm American."

00:03:05.992 --> 00:03:08.623
"I know," I said,
"but where are you from?"

00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:10.932
"I'm white," he replied.

00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:13.847
"But white is not a country," I said.

00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:15.960
"Where are your ancestors from?"

00:03:16.428 --> 00:03:18.159
When he replied with a shrug,

00:03:18.183 --> 00:03:19.739
I said,

00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:21.420
"Well, where did you come from?

00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:23.868
How did you get here? Who paid?"

00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:26.340
He couldn't answer.

00:03:26.364 --> 00:03:29.191
I don't think you can talk
about America as America

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:32.536
without answering those
three core questions.
