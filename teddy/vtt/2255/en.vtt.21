00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:30.101
that teachers thought
was the overachiever,

00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:31.643
the popular person,

00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:34.042
the one that had it together.

00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.976
But guys, I was lost.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.393
I was lost,

00:10:39.417 --> 00:10:42.393
and I wanted someone to ask me,

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:44.518
"Lisa, why are you here all the time,

00:10:44.542 --> 00:10:48.476
why are you throwing yourself
into all these things?"

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.684
Did they ever wonder,

00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:52.976
was I running away from someone,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.893
was I running away from something?

00:10:55.917 --> 00:10:59.726
Why did I not want to be in my community

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.184
or in my home?
