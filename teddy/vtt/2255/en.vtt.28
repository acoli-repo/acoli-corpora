And I wanted her to know

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:04.226
I have advocated for more funding

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.476
for guidance counselors,
for school social workers,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.393
for psychologists, for nurses,

00:14:09.417 --> 00:14:13.851
because they are so vital
to the mental and physical health

00:14:13.875 --> 00:14:15.726
of our children.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.726
I'm thankful for Ms. McFadyen.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:22.143

00:14:22.167 --> 00:14:24.934
I once heard someone say,

00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.643
in order to find your way
out of the darkness,

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:29.792
you have to find the light.
