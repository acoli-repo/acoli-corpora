And you have them in your classrooms.

00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:04.809
That is why it's so important for me
to talk to you today,

00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:06.934
so you can be aware

00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.851
and you can start asking the questions
that need to be asked

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:13.809
and paying attention to these students,

00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:18.042
so you too can help them find their way.

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.643
As a kindergarten teacher,

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.559
I start my year off

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:28.184
with my kids making box biographies.

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:30.601
These are two of my students.
