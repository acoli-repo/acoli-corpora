00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.143
And I also made it really hard
on my parents, too.

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:31.643
I didn't want to go to school,

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:35.143
so I fought them every morning,
getting on the bus.

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:36.893
At night, I couldn't sleep,

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:40.059
because my anxiety was so high.

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:43.726
So I was going into class exhausted.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.226
Which, exhausted children
are cranky children,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.976
and they're not easy to teach,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.250
you know that.

00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:56.851
Mr. Randolph could have
approached me with frustration,

00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:59.958
like so many teachers do
with students like me.
