that make us all look perfect,

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:05.684
or did I want to make myself vulnerable

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:07.292
and become an open book?

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:11.101
The choice became very clear.

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:13.934
In order to make a difference
in the life of a child,

00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.809
I had to become transparent.

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:21.625
So I made the commitment
to tell my personal story.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:26.934
And this story is filled
with people that have loved me

00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.768
and taken care of me and grown me.

00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:33.351
And have helped me overcome and heal.
