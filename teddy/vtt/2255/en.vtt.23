You could be the reason
that they move forward

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.083
with their story.

00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:39.684
Be careful not to assume

00:11:39.708 --> 00:11:42.601
that you already know
the ending to their story.

00:11:42.625 --> 00:11:46.309
Don't put a period
where a semicolon should be.

00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:47.851
Keep that story going

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:52.476
and help them know that even if
something has happened traumatic to them,

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.125
that their life is still worth telling.

00:11:56.208 --> 00:11:59.250
Their story is worth telling.
