Everyone has a story,

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:06.268
and that story is filled with chapters

00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:08.833
that have made us who we are today.

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:13.684
Those early chapters of that story

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:17.601
sometimes are the ones
that define us the most.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.309
The Center for Disease Control

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:24.101
has estimated that over half
of our nation's children

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:28.333
have experienced at least
one or two types of childhood trauma.

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:32.792
That adversity can have lasting effects.
