00:08:59.917 --> 00:09:03.018
the facial expressions that they give me,

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:06.684
the things they don't say

00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:09.309
can become red flags for me

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:13.101
and can help me figure out
what their needs are.

00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:15.893
What is driving them

00:09:15.917 --> 00:09:19.375
to maybe have the behaviors
that they're showing me in class.

00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:22.768
How can I be a better teacher

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:24.917
by listening to their voices?

00:09:26.083 --> 00:09:29.434
I also make times to develop
relationships with them,

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:31.768
much like Mr. Randolph did with me.
