00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.519
players of sports 
and recreational activities

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.542

How dangerous are all those concussions?

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.860

when something strikes it.

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.829
The brain is made of soft fatty tissue,
with a consistency something like jello.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.109
