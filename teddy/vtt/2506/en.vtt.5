00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:32.498
and much more accessible
than the ones we used at my internship.

00:02:32.984 --> 00:02:34.390
So I looked at the necklace,

00:02:34.414 --> 00:02:37.877
and then I thought, "If I can
print a necklace from home,

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:40.056
why not print my clothes from home, too?"

00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:44.145
I really liked the idea that I wouldn't
have to go to the market

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:46.793
and pick fabrics that
someone else chose to sell --

00:02:46.817 --> 00:02:50.903
I could just design them
and print them directly from home.

00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:54.051
I found a small makerspace,

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:56.698
where I learned everything
I know about 3D printing.

00:02:57.036 --> 00:02:59.631
Right away, they literally
gave me the key to the lab,

00:02:59.655 --> 00:03:02.673
so I could experiment
into the night, every night.
