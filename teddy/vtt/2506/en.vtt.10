Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing
one of my five outfits.

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:10.650
Almost everything here she's wearing,
I printed from my home.

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:13.330
Even her shoes are printed.

00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:14.506
Audience: Wow!

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.695
Audience: Cool!

Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca.

00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:23.826
(To audience) Thank you, guys.

00:05:24.848 --> 00:05:27.365
So I think in the future,
materials will evolve,

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.570
and they will look and feel
like fabrics we know today,
