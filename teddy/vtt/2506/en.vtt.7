00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:31.575
the red jacket that had
the word "Liberté" --

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.794
"freedom" in French --

00:03:32.818 --> 00:03:34.331
embedded into it.

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:37.148
I chose this word because I felt
so empowered and free

00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:39.475
when I could just design
a garment from my home

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:41.608
and then print it by myself.

00:03:42.328 --> 00:03:45.742
And actually, you can easily
download this jacket,

00:03:45.766 --> 00:03:48.394
and easily change the word
to something else.

00:03:48.418 --> 00:03:51.066
For example, your name
or your sweetheart's name.

00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:52.657
(Laughter)

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.766
So the printer plates are small,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.868
so I had to piece the garment
together, just like a puzzle.
