00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:02.489
And I wanted to solve another challenge.

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:04.058
I wanted to print textiles

00:04:04.082 --> 00:04:06.587
that I would use
just like regular fabrics.

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:08.545
That's when I found an open-source file

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.158
from an architect who designed
a pattern that I love.

00:04:11.182 --> 00:04:13.901
And with it, I was able to print
a beautiful textile

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:16.549
that I would use
just like a regular fabric.

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:19.898
And it actually even looks
a little bit like lace.

00:04:21.247 --> 00:04:24.637
So I took his file and I modified it,
and changed it, played with it --

00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:27.255
many kinds of versions out of it.

00:04:27.654 --> 00:04:31.838
And I needed to print
another 1,500 more hours
