00:04:27.654 --> 00:04:31.838
And I needed to print
another 1,500 more hours

00:04:31.862 --> 00:04:34.789
to complete printing my collection.

00:04:34.813 --> 00:04:38.621
So I brought six printers to my home
and just printed 24-7.

00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:41.696
And this is actually
a really slow process,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.063
but let's remember the Internet
was significantly slower 20 years ago,

00:04:46.087 --> 00:04:48.412
so 3D printing will also accelerate

00:04:48.436 --> 00:04:51.419
and in no time you'll be able to print
a T-Shirt in your home

00:04:51.443 --> 00:04:54.408
in just a couple of hours,
or even minutes.

00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:57.146
So you guys, you want to see
what it looks like?

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.471
Audience: Yeah!

00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:00.346
