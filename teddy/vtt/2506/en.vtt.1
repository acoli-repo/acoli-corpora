The next morning,
I just took all the pieces,

00:00:30.783 --> 00:00:32.750
assembled them together in my hotel room,

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:35.730
and this is actually the skirt
that I'm wearing right now.

00:00:35.754 --> 00:00:39.654
(Applause)

00:00:39.678 --> 00:00:42.461
So it wasn't the first time
that I printed clothes.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:44.850
For my senior collection
at fashion design school,

00:00:44.874 --> 00:00:49.357
I decided to try and 3D print
an entire fashion collection from my home.

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:53.212
The problem was that I barely knew
anything about 3D printing,

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:58.011
and I had only nine months to figure out
how to print five fashionable looks.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.932
I always felt most creative
when I worked from home.
