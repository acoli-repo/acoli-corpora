00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.932
I always felt most creative
when I worked from home.

00:01:01.956 --> 00:01:04.344
I loved experimenting with new materials,

00:01:04.368 --> 00:01:06.577
and I always tried
to develop new techniques

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:10.104
to make the most unique textiles
for my fashion projects.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.105
I loved going to old factories
and weird stores

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:17.819
in search of leftovers
of strange powders and weird materials,

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:20.189
and then bring them home to experiment on.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.073
As you can probably imagine,

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:24.112
my roommates didn't like that at all.

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:25.141
(Laughter)

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:29.278
So I decided to move on
to working with big machines,

00:01:29.302 --> 00:01:31.395
ones that didn't fit in my living room.
