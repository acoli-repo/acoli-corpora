In the past few months, I've been
traveling for weeks at a time

00:00:04.532 --> 00:00:06.563
with only one suitcase of clothes.

00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:09.051
One day, I was invited
to an important event,

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.749
and I wanted to wear
something special and new for it.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.553
So I looked through my suitcase
and I couldn't find anything to wear.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.063
I was lucky to be at the technology
conference on that day,

00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:21.681
and I had access to 3D printers.

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:23.942
So I quickly designed
a skirt on my computer,

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.111
and I loaded the file on the printer.

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:28.290
It just printed the pieces overnight.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.759
The next morning,
I just took all the pieces,
