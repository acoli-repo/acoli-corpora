The models couldn't sit in them,

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:04.846
and they even got scratched
from the plastics under their arms.

00:02:05.444 --> 00:02:08.455
With 3D printing, the designers
had so much freedom

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.761
to make the dresses look
exactly like they wanted,

00:02:11.785 --> 00:02:17.378
but still, they were very dependent
on big and expensive industrial printers

00:02:17.402 --> 00:02:20.559
that were located in a lab
far from their studio.

00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:24.889
Later that year, a friend gave me
a 3D printed necklace,

00:02:24.913 --> 00:02:27.048
printed using a home printer.

00:02:27.072 --> 00:02:29.218
I knew that these printers
were much cheaper

00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:32.498
and much more accessible
than the ones we used at my internship.
