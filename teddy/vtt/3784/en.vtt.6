00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:03.069
Golf helps people bond.

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:09.336
Some of the best interviews I ever scored
during my trip were on the golf courses.

00:03:09.716 --> 00:03:15.175
One venture capitalist, for example,
invited me to golf in his private club

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.254
that had no minority members.

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:20.408
I also went fishing.

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:22.433
(Laughter)

00:03:22.457 --> 00:03:25.473
Because I had never fished,
this fellow had to teach me

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:28.273
how to cast my line and what bait to use.
