00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:31.484
What a journey that would have been.

00:10:31.508 --> 00:10:33.266
(Laughter)

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.159
And yet, some things haven't changed.

00:10:35.572 --> 00:10:42.283
America is as residentially
and educationally segregated today

00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:44.874
as it was in 1970.

00:10:47.523 --> 00:10:52.154
As Americans, we often find ways
to cook for each other,

00:10:52.178 --> 00:10:53.798
to dance with each other,

00:10:53.822 --> 00:10:55.695
to host with each other,

00:10:55.719 --> 00:11:00.767
but why can't that translate into how we
treat each other as communities?
