00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.852
In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags

00:06:32.876 --> 00:06:37.101
on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia,

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:38.422
and on cars.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.225
About a seven-minute drive
from my hidden lake cabin

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.066
was the compound of Aryan Nations,

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.082
the white supremacist group.

00:06:50.384 --> 00:06:55.456
America's Promise Ministries,
the religious arm of Aryan Nations,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.968
happened to have a three-day
retreat during my visit.
