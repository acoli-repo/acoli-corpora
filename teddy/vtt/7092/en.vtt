00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:10.996
Your antivirus squad is up against
a particularly sadistic bit

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:14.204
of malicious code 
that’s hijacked your mainframe.

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.871
What you’ve learned from other infected
systems— right before they went dark—

00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:23.954
is that it likes to toy with antivirus
agents in a very peculiar way.

00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:28.163
It corrupts one of the 4 disks
that run your mainframe,

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:31.788
represented by lights showing
which are on and which off.
