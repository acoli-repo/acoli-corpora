00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm actually here

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to make a challenge to people.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I know there have been many challenges made to people.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The one I'm going to make

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is that it is time for us to reclaim

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
what peace really means.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Peace is not the dove and the rainbow --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
as lovely as they are.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When I see the symbols

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
of the rainbow and the dove,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I think of personal serenity.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I think of meditation.
