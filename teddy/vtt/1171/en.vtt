00:00:00.635 --> 00:00:03.256
I've been a journalist now since I was about 17,

00:00:03.256 --> 00:00:06.816
and it's an interesting industry to be in at the moment,

00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.152
because as you all know, there's a huge amount of upheaval

00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:11.632
going on in media, and most of you probably know this

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:14.855
from the business angle, which is that the business model

00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:17.798
is pretty screwed, and as my grandfather would say,

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:20.512
the profits have all been gobbled up by Google.

00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:22.856
So it's a really interesting time to be a journalist,

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.940
but the upheaval that I'm interested in is not on the output side.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.035
It's on the input side. It's concern with

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:31.533
how we get information and how we gather the news.
