Researchers took a look at 150 cases

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.944
in which people had help
from these paralegals,

00:10:32.968 --> 00:10:36.088
and they found no evictions at all,

00:10:36.112 --> 00:10:37.262
not one.

00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:40.934
A little bit of legal empowerment
can go a long way.

00:10:41.831 --> 00:10:46.354
I see the beginnings of a real movement,

00:10:46.378 --> 00:10:48.505

Not yet.

00:10:50.889 --> 00:10:52.615
In most countries around the world,

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:55.875
governments do not provide
a single dollar of support

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:58.270
to paralegals like Hassan and Kush.

00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:02.794
Most governments don't even recognize
the role paralegals play,
