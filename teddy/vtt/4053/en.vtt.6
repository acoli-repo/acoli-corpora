without anybody even explaining the terms.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.533
Governments seem to think that's OK.

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:08.751
Right now, in the United States,

00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:11.727
in India, in Slovenia,

00:03:11.751 --> 00:03:14.838
people like Ravi
are raising their children

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:17.783
in the shadow of factories or mines

00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:20.180
that are poisoning
their air and their water.

00:03:21.121 --> 00:03:24.030
There are environmental laws
that would protect these people,

00:03:24.054 --> 00:03:25.770
but many have never seen those laws,

00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:28.016
let alone having a shot at enforcing them.

00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:31.817
And the world seems
to have decided that's OK.
