00:05:29.815 --> 00:05:32.220
sometimes we call them
community paralegals,

00:05:32.244 --> 00:05:34.368
or barefoot lawyers,

00:05:34.392 --> 00:05:35.602
can be a bridge.

00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:38.912
These paralegals are from
the communities they serve.

00:05:39.577 --> 00:05:41.377
They demystify law,

00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:43.613
break it down into simple terms,

00:05:43.637 --> 00:05:46.319
and then they help people
look for a solution.

00:05:47.142 --> 00:05:48.905
They don't focus on the courts alone.

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:50.632
They look everywhere:

00:05:50.656 --> 00:05:54.775
ministry departments,
local government, an ombudsman's office.

00:05:55.933 --> 00:05:58.512
Lawyers sometimes say to their clients,

00:05:58.536 --> 00:06:00.488
"I'll handle it for you. I've got you."
