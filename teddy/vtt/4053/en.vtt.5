00:02:39.308 --> 00:02:41.172
but we've been choosing to ignore it.

Right now, in Sierra Leone,

00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:48.228
in Cambodia, in Ethiopia,

00:02:48.252 --> 00:02:50.301
farmers are being cajoled

00:02:50.325 --> 00:02:55.087

00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:58.547

00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:01.015
without anybody even explaining the terms.
