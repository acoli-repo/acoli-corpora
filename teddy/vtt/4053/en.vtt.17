00:08:28.056 --> 00:08:31.088
Namati helps convene a global network

00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:32.785
dedicated to legal empowerment.

00:08:33.434 --> 00:08:36.389
All together, we are over
a thousand organizations

00:08:36.413 --> 00:08:37.777
in 120 countries.

00:08:38.224 --> 00:08:42.097
Collectively, we deploy
tens of thousands of community paralegals.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.383
Let me give you another example.

00:08:46.544 --> 00:08:48.345
This is Khadija Hamsa.

00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:55.577
She is one of five million people in Kenya
who faces a discriminatory vetting process

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:58.393
when trying to obtain a national ID card.

00:08:58.965 --> 00:09:02.824
It is like the Jim Crow South
in the United States.
