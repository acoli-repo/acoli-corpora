This is not a consultant
flying into Myanmar

00:13:01.671 --> 00:13:05.059
with a template he's going
to cut and paste from Macedonia,

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:08.059
and this is not an angry tweet.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.963
This is about growing reforms
from the experience of ordinary people

00:13:12.987 --> 00:13:15.689
trying to make the rules and systems work.

00:13:17.154 --> 00:13:23.756
This transformation in the relationship
between people and law

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.287
is the right thing to do.

00:13:26.748 --> 00:13:29.853
It's also essential for overcoming

00:13:29.877 --> 00:13:33.359
all of the other
great challenges of our times.
