00:04:27.273 --> 00:04:30.074
and we tend to focus
on formal court channels

00:04:30.098 --> 00:04:33.519
that are impractical
for many of the problems people face.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:39.727
Worse, our profession has shrouded law
in a cloak of complexity.

00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:43.425
Law is like riot gear on a police officer.

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:47.188
It's intimidating and impenetrable,

00:04:47.212 --> 00:04:49.902
and it's hard to tell
there's something human underneath.

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:55.022
If we're going to make justice
a reality for everyone,

00:04:55.046 --> 00:04:59.062
we need to turn law
from an abstraction or a threat

00:04:59.086 --> 00:05:04.879
into something that every single person
can understand, use and shape.
