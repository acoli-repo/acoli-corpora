(Laughter)

00:01:35.268 --> 00:01:39.861
He said the company ignored
every one of those letters,

00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:41.875
and so in 2013,

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.136

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.421

00:01:53.732 --> 00:01:55.787
intending to set himself on fire.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:01.908
Ravi is not alone in his desperation.
