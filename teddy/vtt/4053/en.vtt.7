00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:31.817
And the world seems
to have decided that's OK.

00:03:33.234 --> 00:03:34.987
What would it take to change that?

00:03:36.437 --> 00:03:40.663
Law is supposed to be the language we use

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:43.531
to translate our dreams about justice

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:46.837
into living institutions
that hold us together.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.753
Law is supposed to be the difference

00:03:49.777 --> 00:03:52.602
between a society
ruled by the most powerful

00:03:52.626 --> 00:03:55.110
and one that honors
the dignity of everyone,

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.522
strong or weak.

00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.865
That's why I told
my grandmother 20 years ago

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.610
that I wanted to go to law school.
