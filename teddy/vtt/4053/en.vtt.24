00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:01.070
is like Ravi's case.

00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:05.081
Hope and despair are neck and neck.

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:10.259
And so not only do we urgently need
to support and protect

00:12:10.283 --> 00:12:13.180
the work of barefoot lawyers
around the world,

00:12:13.204 --> 00:12:16.259
we need to change the systems themselves.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.474
Every case a paralegal takes on

00:12:20.498 --> 00:12:24.880
is a story about how a system
is working in practice.

00:12:25.793 --> 00:12:27.532
When you put those stories together,

00:12:27.556 --> 00:12:31.183
it gives you a detailed portrait
of the system as a whole.
