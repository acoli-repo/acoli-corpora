Most governments don't even recognize
the role paralegals play,

00:11:02.818 --> 00:11:04.532
or protect paralegals from harm.

00:11:05.711 --> 00:11:07.822
I also don't want
to give you the impression

00:11:07.846 --> 00:11:10.830
that paralegals and their clients
win every time.

00:11:11.957 --> 00:11:13.123
Not at all.

00:11:13.147 --> 00:11:15.933
That cement factory behind Ravi's village,

00:11:15.957 --> 00:11:19.331
it's been turning off
the filtration system at night,

00:11:19.355 --> 00:11:22.609
when it's least likely
that the company would get caught.

00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:24.339
Running that filter costs money.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.651
Ravi WhatsApps photos
of the polluted night sky.

00:11:28.976 --> 00:11:31.103
This is one he sent to Kush in May.
