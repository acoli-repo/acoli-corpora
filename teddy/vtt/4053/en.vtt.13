00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:31.392
that I began feeling hopeful
about the law again,

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:33.919
and I have been obsessed ever since.

00:06:35.158 --> 00:06:36.554
Let me come back to Ravi.

00:06:38.173 --> 00:06:42.331
2013, he did reach
the gates of that factory

00:06:42.355 --> 00:06:44.872
with the bucket of petrol in his hands,

00:06:44.896 --> 00:06:47.507
but he was arrested
before he could follow through.

00:06:48.503 --> 00:06:50.265
He didn't have to spend long in jail,

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:52.971
but he felt completely defeated.

00:06:53.962 --> 00:06:57.136
Then, two years later, he met someone.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.879
I'm going to call him Kush.

00:06:58.903 --> 00:07:02.303
Kush is part of a team
of community paralegals
