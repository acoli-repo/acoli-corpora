Ravi is not alone in his desperation.

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.712
The UN estimates that worldwide,

00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:09.735
four billion people live
without basic access to justice.

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:15.425
These people face grave threats
to their safety, their livelihoods,

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:16.614
their dignity.

00:02:17.455 --> 00:02:22.178
There are almost always laws on the books
that would protect these people,

00:02:22.202 --> 00:02:24.961
but they've often
never heard of those laws,

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:28.271
and the systems that are supposed
to enforce those laws

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:31.874
are corrupt or broken or both.
