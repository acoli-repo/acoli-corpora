00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.942
from large groups of simple elements.

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:37.044
Like many animals, 
fish stick together in groups,

00:00:37.044 --> 00:00:40.002
but that's not just because
they enjoy each other's company.

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.292
It's a matter of survival.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.569
Schools of fish exhibit 
complex swarming behaviors

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:48.208
that help them evade hungry predators,

00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:53.679
while a lone fish is quickly singled out
as easy prey.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.162
So which brilliant fish leader
is the one in charge?

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:59.122
Actually, no one is,

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:01.243
and everyone is.
