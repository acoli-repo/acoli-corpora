00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:02.246
At some point, these emergent
patterns of activity

00:05:02.246 --> 00:05:04.209
become sufficiently complex,

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:08.557
and curious to begin studying
their own biological origins,

00:05:08.557 --> 00:05:11.293
not to mention emergence.

00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:15.413
And what we found in emergent phenomena
at vastly different scales

00:05:15.413 --> 00:05:19.053
is that same remarkable
characteristic as the fish displayed:

00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:24.420
That emergence doesn't require
someone or something to be in charge.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.230
If the right rules are in place,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.487
and some basic conditions are met,

00:05:28.487 --> 00:05:33.347
a complex system will fall into
the same habits over and over again,
