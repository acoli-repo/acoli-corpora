00:01:56.836 --> 00:02:01.995
allowing fish all across the ocean
to reliably avoid predation.

00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:03.629
And it's not just fish.

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:09.422
Emergence is a basic property of many
complex systems of interacting elements.

00:02:09.422 --> 00:02:14.089
For example, the specific way in which
millions of grains of sand

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.668
collide and tumble over each other

00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:21.914
almost always produces the same
basic pattern of ripples.

00:02:21.914 --> 00:02:24.167
And when moisture freezes
in the atmosphere,

00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:27.418
the specific binding properties
of water molecules

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:33.885
reliably produce radiating lattices
that form into beautiful snowflakes.
