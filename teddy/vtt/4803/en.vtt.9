00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.086
As more and more neurons are connected,

00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:36.333
increasingly complex patterns 
of activity emerge from the network.

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:41.555
Soon, so many neurons are interacting
in so many different ways at once

00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:43.737
that the system becomes chaotic.

00:04:43.737 --> 00:04:48.354
The trajectory of the network's activity
cannot be easily explained

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:51.656
by the simple local circuits
described earlier.

00:04:51.656 --> 00:04:54.630
And yet, from this chaos,
patterns can emerge,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.001
and then emerge again and again
in a reproducible manner.

00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:02.246
At some point, these emergent
patterns of activity
