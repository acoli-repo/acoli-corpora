When you turn such a complicated
system like that on,

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:36.304
it could behave in all sorts
of weird ways, but it doesn't.

00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:40.847
The neurons in our brain follow
simple rules, just like the fish,

00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:46.218
so that as a group, their activity
self-organizes into reliable patterns

00:03:46.218 --> 00:03:48.697
that let you do things 
like recognize faces,

00:03:48.697 --> 00:03:52.531
successfully repeat the same task
over and over again,

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:58.319
and keep all those silly little habits
that everyone likes about you.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.896
So, what are the simple rules 
when it comes to the brain?
