How do schools of fish swim in harmony?

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:16.409
And how do the tiny cells in your brain
give rise to the complex thoughts,

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:17.470
memories,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.377
and consciousness that are you?

00:00:20.377 --> 00:00:24.006
Oddly enough, those questions have
the same general answer:

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:25.481
emergence,

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:29.770
or the spontaneous creation of
sophisticated behaviors and functions

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.942
from large groups of simple elements.
