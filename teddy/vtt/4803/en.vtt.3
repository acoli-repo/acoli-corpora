00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.054
As individuals, the fish are focused on
the minutiae of these local interactions,

00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:34.375
but if enough fish join the group,
something remarkable happens.

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:39.908
The movement of individual fish 
is eclipsed by an entirely new entity:

00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:43.905
the school, which has its own
unique set of behaviors.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:46.861
The school isn't controlled
by any single fish.

00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:53.622
It simply emerges if you have enough fish
following the right set of local rules.

00:01:53.622 --> 00:01:56.836
It's like an accident that happens over
and over again,

00:01:56.836 --> 00:02:01.995
allowing fish all across the ocean
to reliably avoid predation.
