at least most of the time.

isn't reliant on a single neuron
lodged in the corner of your brain.

Rather, the mind emerges from
the collective activities

00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:22.024
of many, many neurons.

00:03:22.024 --> 00:03:25.100
There are billions of neurons 
in the human brain,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.517
and trillions of connections between
all those neurons.

00:03:28.517 --> 00:03:32.149
When you turn such a complicated
system like that on,
