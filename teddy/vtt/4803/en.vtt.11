a complex system will fall into
the same habits over and over again,

00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:36.593
turning chaos into order.

00:05:36.593 --> 00:05:39.911
That's true in the molecular pandemonium
that lets your cells function,

00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.482
the tangled thicket of neurons
that produces your thoughts and identity,

00:05:43.482 --> 00:05:46.119
your network of friends and family,

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:50.685
all the way up to the structures and
economies of our cities across the planet.
