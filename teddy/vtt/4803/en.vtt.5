00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:33.885
reliably produce radiating lattices
that form into beautiful snowflakes.

00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:36.013
What makes emergence so complex

00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:39.423
is that you can't understand it
by simply taking it apart,

00:02:39.423 --> 00:02:41.586
like the engine of a car.

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:46.122
Taking things apart is a good first step
to understanding a complex system.

00:02:46.122 --> 00:02:48.718
But if you reduce a school of fish
to individuals,

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:51.427
it loses the ability to evade predators,

00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:54.238
and there's nothing left to study.

00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:57.674
And if you reduce the brain 
to individual neurons,

00:02:57.674 --> 00:03:00.991
you're left with something that is
notoriously unreliable,
