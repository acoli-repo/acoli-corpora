00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.896
So, what are the simple rules 
when it comes to the brain?

00:04:01.896 --> 00:04:05.241
The basic function of each neuron
in the brain

00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:09.073
is to either excite or inhibit
other neurons.

00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:12.195
If you connect a few neurons together
into a simple circuit,

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:15.029
you can generate rhythmic patterns
of activity,

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:18.465
feedback loops that ramp up
or shut down a signal,

00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:20.276
coincidence detectors,

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:22.564
and disinhibition,

00:04:22.564 --> 00:04:26.877
where two inhibitory neurons
can actually activate another neuron

00:04:26.877 --> 00:04:29.480
by removing inhibitory brakes.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.086
As more and more neurons are connected,
