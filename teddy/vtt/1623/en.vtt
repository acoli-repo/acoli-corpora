00:00:00.577 --> 00:00:02.432
Almost two years ago,

00:00:02.432 --> 00:00:04.823
I was driving in my car in Germany,

00:00:04.823 --> 00:00:07.339
and I turned on the radio.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.546
Europe at the time was in the middle

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:10.989
of the Euro crisis,

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:15.235
and all the headlines were about European countries

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:18.076
getting downgraded by rating agencies

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.930
in the United States.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.039
I listened and thought to myself,

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.111
"What are these rating agencies,

00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:27.564
and why is everybody so upset about their work?"

00:00:27.564 --> 00:00:29.616
Well, if you were sitting

00:00:29.616 --> 00:00:31.377
next to me in the car that day
