00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.138
is that it has never been the one
to just be defeated.

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:34.692
So the story about the Baltimore Ceasefire

00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:38.151
is that Baltimore looked
the murder rate in the eye

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:42.181
and said, "What you're not going to do
is snatch our greatness."

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.641
So two years ago,
I'm at a 300 Man March meeting.

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:48.762
At the time, I was a leader
in that movement.

00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:50.385
And this guy named Ogun --

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.794
he's like a godfather
of hip-hop in Baltimore --

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:54.386
he came over to me and he said,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.921
"Yo, I have this idea about
calling a ceasefire in Baltimore,

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:00.888
and I feel like you are somebody
I should talk to about that."
