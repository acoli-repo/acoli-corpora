where everybody in the city
was committing,

00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:04.979
nobody is going to kill anybody,

00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:07.435
and we're going to celebrate life instead,

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.610
when can we do that?"

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:10.365
So it's May, I look at my calendar,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.304
all right, I've got some free time

and the more I drive, the scareder I get.

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:27.669
And so I start going, "Never mind ...

00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:28.694
(Laughter)

00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:30.296
I won't say this thing out loud.
