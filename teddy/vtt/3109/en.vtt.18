00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:01.738
that nobody got killed.

00:09:01.762 --> 00:09:05.059
And so we had to make a vow with ourselves

00:09:05.083 --> 00:09:09.837
not to be numb anymore
when we lose people in our city.

00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:15.701
These two lives were going to remind us
to vibrate higher and to move forward.

00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:20.180
So as we move forward
into Baltimore Ceasefire 365,

00:09:20.204 --> 00:09:22.665
because there's work that needs
to be done all year,

00:09:22.689 --> 00:09:25.347
and there's another cease-fire
happening next weekend,

00:09:25.371 --> 00:09:28.379
November 3rd through 5th.
Mark your calendar.

00:09:28.403 --> 00:09:29.404
(Applause)

00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:31.467
Right? And we expect the same thing.
