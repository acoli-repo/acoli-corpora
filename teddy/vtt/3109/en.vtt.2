00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:00.888
and I feel like you are somebody
I should talk to about that."

00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:04.246
And I was like, "I'm absolutely
somebody you should talk to about that,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.128
because that's something we should do."

00:01:06.152 --> 00:01:08.197
And so we played phone tag
and meeting tag,

00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:12.527
and two years went by and we never
really sat down and talked about it.

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:15.402
So now we're in May of 2017.

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:19.377
My son Paul, he's 19 years old,
he's driving me home from work one day,

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:22.402
and he says, "Ma, did you know
that the murder rate in Baltimore

00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:23.982
is higher than it's ever been?"

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.951
And I said, "What you mean
it's higher than it's ever been?

00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:28.356
How is that possible?

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.001
Like, I mean, what about people who say
they have connections to the streets?
