maybe somebody will be plotting
to take a life right then and there,

00:03:31.442 --> 00:03:35.508
but now they would have
a rumbling in their spirit.

00:03:35.532 --> 00:03:38.050
And so I knew it was time for my city

00:03:38.074 --> 00:03:41.669
to have a collective
rumbling in our spirit.

00:03:41.693 --> 00:03:44.486
So I got on the phone, got around to Ogun,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.150
and I said, "Yo, you said
you wanted to do a cease-fire?

00:03:47.174 --> 00:03:48.340
What is it? I'm ready."

00:03:48.364 --> 00:03:52.572
So he said, "You know, when I hear about
the Israelis and Palestinians at war,

00:03:52.596 --> 00:03:54.835
I'm like, that's too bad,
they should stop that,

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.688
but when I hear the word 'cease-fire,'

00:03:56.712 --> 00:04:00.086
that makes me pause and stop
and really research what's going on."
