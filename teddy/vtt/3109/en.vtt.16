00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.214
and we said, "This is sacred ground
because we make it so,

00:08:00.238 --> 00:08:04.106
because everywhere in our city
where people lose their lives to violence

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.175
needs to be sacred ground."

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:10.466
And it wasn't just about
upholding Trey and his transition

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.046
and sending love to his family.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.533
It was about us pausing to really
think about what must it feel like

00:08:17.557 --> 00:08:20.650
20 minutes after you kill somebody?

00:08:20.674 --> 00:08:23.092
Can't we pour love into that?

00:08:23.116 --> 00:08:27.083
Because until we do,
we will not heal this epidemic.

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:30.257
Later on in the day, we get another call.
