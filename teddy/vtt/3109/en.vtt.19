00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:31.467
Right? And we expect the same thing.

00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:33.630
It was news media
from all around the world,

00:09:33.654 --> 00:09:35.335
Australia and Norway and China.

00:09:35.359 --> 00:09:37.884
Everybody wanted to come
get this work from Baltimore,

00:09:37.908 --> 00:09:40.174
and y'all could come get it. Right?

00:09:40.198 --> 00:09:43.322
So as we push forward,
we don't need to keep asking now

00:09:43.346 --> 00:09:44.497
"What can we do?"

00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:48.005
We have seen the power
of collective consciousness.

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:50.762
Y'all were the ones
who misunderstood Baltimore.

00:09:50.786 --> 00:09:53.739
Y'all thought Baltimore
was just "The Wire."

00:09:53.763 --> 00:09:55.541
When we lost Freddie Gray,

00:09:55.565 --> 00:09:57.550
y'all saw the Baltimore uprising,

00:09:57.574 --> 00:10:01.865
and people around this world
mischaracterized it and misunderstood it.
