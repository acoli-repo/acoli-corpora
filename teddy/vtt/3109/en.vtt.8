that makes me pause and stop
and really research what's going on."

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.065
And he wanted Baltimore
to get that same kind of attention

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:04.269
from the outside,

00:04:04.293 --> 00:04:08.122
but introspection from the inside
about what was going on with us.

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:11.154
And we talked about how it couldn't

00:04:11.178 --> 00:04:14.597
Not one person or one organization
should call a cease-fire.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:18.148

and do it together.

00:04:18.172 --> 00:04:20.098

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.849
and this is where it gets named
the Baltimore Ceasefire,

00:04:25.873 --> 00:04:29.164
because you know what that means
when you hear the word "cease-fire."

00:04:29.188 --> 00:04:30.523
Just don't kill nobody.
