00:04:29.188 --> 00:04:30.523
Just don't kill nobody.

00:04:30.547 --> 00:04:34.192
And this is where the Baltimore
Peace Challenge was born.

00:04:34.216 --> 00:04:36.889
Because it's not just about
not being violent.

00:04:36.913 --> 00:04:40.142
It is about being purposefully peaceful.

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:42.018
What is going on in your thoughts?

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:45.162
What kind of petty things
are you not saying out of your mouth?

00:04:45.186 --> 00:04:48.725
How are you responding
in your behaviors to conflict?

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:51.265
I grabbed up five people who I trusted,

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.387
and the six of us became
the organizing squad.

00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:56.136
So let's give them props real quick.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.997
On the count of three,
I want you to yell "squad."

00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:01.012
One, two, three: squad! Audience: Squad!
