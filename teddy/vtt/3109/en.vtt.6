00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.414
And people who had already
been killed in my city

00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:04.111
were calling to me

00:03:04.135 --> 00:03:06.683
up through my gut and my chest,

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:11.803
as a knot in my throat, "Yo, E,
you cannot just let us be dead in vain

00:03:11.827 --> 00:03:14.134
when you know how to say
this thing out loud."

00:03:14.158 --> 00:03:16.871
And I responded to them with my fear.

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:19.571
"But somebody might get killed
anyway that weekend."

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:21.764
And that was the moment
where I had to accept

00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:24.638
that maybe while we're out
spreading this message --

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:28.052
"Hey, nobody's going to kill anybody.
We're going to celebrate life!" --

00:03:28.076 --> 00:03:31.418
maybe somebody will be plotting
to take a life right then and there,
