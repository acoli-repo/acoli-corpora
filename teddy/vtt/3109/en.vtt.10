00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:01.012
One, two, three: squad! Audience: Squad!

00:05:01.116 --> 00:05:03.693
And it's Shellers's birthday.
Happy birthday, Shellers.

00:05:03.727 --> 00:05:04.997
Audience: Happy birthday!

00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.331
And so we put out a press release,

00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:10.125
and the media told us,
this is not really a story yet,

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:13.506
we will get with you on August 7th
to see how the cease-fire went.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.146
So we went, "Oh, word?
Oh, all right then."

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.484
And Baltimore got to work,

00:05:17.508 --> 00:05:20.825
and not only did people send money
to the PayPal account

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.102
so we could buy flyers and posters,

00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:25.730
people came and got the flyers and posters

00:05:25.754 --> 00:05:27.849
and they put them all around the city,

00:05:27.873 --> 00:05:30.454
and people were having
conversations with each other.
