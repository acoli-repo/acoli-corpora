00:06:58.494 --> 00:07:00.106
(Laughter)

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.119
was talking about this thing
Baltimore was doing together. Right?

00:07:04.762 --> 00:07:06.336
And then, the weekend came:

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.806
events all over the city,
people yelling "Happy Ceasefire Day!"

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.987
Over 200 people got their records
expunged and got jobs,

00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:16.686
and people went
into drug recovery programs

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.845
because of what was happening
in our city that weekend.

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:22.836
People were going, "But the air
feels different in Baltimore.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.062
Nobody's mother
got that phone call last night.

00:07:25.086 --> 00:07:26.491
I didn't hear any gunshots."

00:07:26.515 --> 00:07:29.586
And on Saturday, Trey went to go get a job

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.915
and was excited about it.
