Rana Ayyub is a journalist in India

00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:11.380
whose work has exposed
government corruption

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:14.568
and human rights violations.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.157
And over the years,

00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:19.484
she's gotten used to vitriol
and controversy around her work.

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:25.258
But none of it could have prepared her
for what she faced in April 2018.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.776
She was sitting in a cafÃ© with a friend
when she first saw it:

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.743
a two-minute, 20-second video
of her engaged in a sex act.
