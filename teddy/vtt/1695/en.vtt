00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.932
You'll be happy to know that
I'll be talking not about my own tragedy,

00:00:04.956 --> 00:00:06.257
but other people's tragedy.

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:09.350
It's a lot easier to be lighthearted
about other people's tragedy

00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:10.525
than your own,

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.276
and I want to keep it
in the spirit of the conference.

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.238
So, if you believe the media accounts,

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:21.815
being a drug dealer in the height
of the crack cocaine epidemic

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.665
was a very glamorous life,
in the words of Virginia Postrel.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.868
There was money,
there was drugs, guns, women,

00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:33.380
you know, you name it -- jewelry,
bling-bling -- it had it all.
