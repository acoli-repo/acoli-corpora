00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
not out of passion and love for the flavor.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And ultimately, the challenge of the baker,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
the challenge of every culinary student, of every chef,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
is to deliver flavor.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Flavor is king. Flavor rules.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And -- and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So, this is the challenge for this bread.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We're going to try this at lunch, and

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'll explain a bit more about it,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor
