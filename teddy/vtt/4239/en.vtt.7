00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and when we put them together and add the final ingredients,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
we can create a bread that does evoke

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That's the challenge. Okay, so, now, what we --

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
in the journey of wheat, let's go back and look at these 12 stages.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Okay, we're going to start with the first stage.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And this is what every student has to begin with.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the first stage of cooking is "mise en place,"

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
which is just a French way of saying, "get organized."

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Everything in its place. First stage.
