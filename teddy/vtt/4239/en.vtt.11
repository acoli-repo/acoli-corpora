00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
"panning" -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
This takes a second, but it's a distinctive stage.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And then, stage nine.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
through all these other stages. Again, developing more flavor.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The final fermentation takes place in stage nine.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
We call it "proofing."

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and it goes into the oven -- stage 10.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Three transformations take place in the oven.
