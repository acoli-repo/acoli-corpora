00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
unless you first understand the literal level,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
so that's why we're talking literally about bread.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But let's kind of look at these stages again

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
all in my quest for answering the question,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
"What is it about bread that's so special?"

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Because what happens is,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
bread begins as wheat or any other grain.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But what's wheat? Wheat is a grass

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
that grows in the field.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And, like all grasses, at a certain point it puts out seeds.
