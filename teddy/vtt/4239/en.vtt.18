We can plant those in the ground.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And we save some of those for the next generation.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
But most of those seeds get crushed

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and turned into flour.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
It's not only been killed,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
but it's been denied any potential for creating future life.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So we turn it into flour.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So as I said, I think bread is a transformational food.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
The first transformation -- and, by the way,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the definition of transformation for me is

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
a radical change from one thing into something else.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
O.K.? Radical, not subtle.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Not like hot water made cold,
