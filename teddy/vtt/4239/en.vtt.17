00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And, like all grasses, at a certain point it puts out seeds.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And we harvest those seeds, and those are the wheat kernels.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Now, in order to harvest it -- I mean, what's harvesting?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It's just a euphemism for killing, right?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
We harvest the wheat,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and in harvesting it, we kill it.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Now, wheat is alive,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Now, at least with seeds we have the potential for future life.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We can plant those in the ground.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And we save some of those for the next generation.
