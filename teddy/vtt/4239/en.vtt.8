Everything in its place. First stage.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We have to develop the gluten.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
There's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Here's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
because we've got glutenin and gliadin,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
they create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And so we, in the mixing process,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
have to develop the gluten,
