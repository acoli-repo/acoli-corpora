00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
because I really believe that

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
all things can be understood --

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that all things can be understood on four levels:

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
the literal, the metaphoric or poetic level,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
the political or ethical level.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And ultimately, the mystical or sometimes called the "anagogical" level.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
In fact, Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
unless you first understand the literal level,
