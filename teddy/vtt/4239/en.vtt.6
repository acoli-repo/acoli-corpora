They become accessible to the oven for caramelization

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
to give us a beautiful crust.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The other pre-dough

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a "biga"

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and that starts to develop flavor also.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And on day two, we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And we're hoping that, sort of, the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
enzyme piece of dough

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and when we put them together and add the final ingredients,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
we can create a bread that does evoke
