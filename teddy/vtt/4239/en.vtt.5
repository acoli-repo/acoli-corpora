00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
is to make a piece of dough

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
the day before that is not leavened.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's just dough that is wet.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It's hydrated dough we call "the soaker" --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that helps to start enzyme activity.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And enzymes are the secret, kind of, ingredient in dough

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that brings out flavor.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That's what enzymes are doing.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And so, if we can release some of those,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
they become accessible to us in our palate.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
They become accessible to the yeast as food.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They become accessible to the oven for caramelization
