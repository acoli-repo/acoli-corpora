00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
is that it is a transformational food,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and we're going to explore that in a minute.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
But then, quickly through the next few stages.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We, after it's fermented and it's developed,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
started to develop flavor and character,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
we divide it into smaller units.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre-shape,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
usually a round or a little torpedo shape, sometimes.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
That's called "rounding."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And there's a short rest period. It can be for a few seconds.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It can be for 20 or 30 minutes. We call that resting or benching.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Then we go into final shaping,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
"panning" -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan.
