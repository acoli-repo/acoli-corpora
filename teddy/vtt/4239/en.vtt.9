00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And so we, in the mixing process,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
have to develop the gluten,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
we have to activate the leaven or the yeast,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Then we get into fermentation, the third stage,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
which is really where the flavor develops. 



00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
creating carbon dioxide and alcohol --

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
essentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It's yeast burps and sweat.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And somehow, this is transformed --

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
is that it is a transformational food,
