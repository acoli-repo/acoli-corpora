This is a wheat bread, a whole wheat bread,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and it's made with a new technique

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that I've been playing around with,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and developing and writing about which, for lack of a better name,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we call the epoxy method.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I call it an epoxy method because --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
it's not very appetizing. I understand that --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but -- but

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if you think about epoxy, what's epoxy?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's two resins that are, sort of,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but when you put the two together,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
something happens. A bond takes place,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and you get this very strong, powerful

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
adhesive.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, in this technique,
