00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
The yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
to enliven it, to vivify it,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
in order to complete its mission,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
which is also to turn this dough into bread,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
has to give up its life.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
It's starting to make sense to me --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
what goes in is dough,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
what comes out is bread --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
or it goes in alive,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
comes out dead.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Third transformation. First transformation, alive to dead.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Second transformation, dead brought back to life.
