00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And we know it's alive because in stage three,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
it grows. Growth is the proof of life.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And while it's growing, all these

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
literal transformations are taking place.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Yeast is eating sugar and

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Bacteria is in there, eating the same sugars,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
turning them into acids.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
In other words, personality and character's being developed in this dough



00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
under the watchful gaze of the baker.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And the baker's choices all along the way

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
determine the outcome of the product.
