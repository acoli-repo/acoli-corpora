00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
It's so

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
deeply embedded in our psyches that

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
bread is used as a symbol for life.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
It's used as a symbol for transformation.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And so, as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
again completing the life cycle,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
you know, we have a chance to essentially ingest that --

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
it nurtures us, and we continue to carry on

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and have opportunities to ponder

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
things like this.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So this is what I've learned from bread.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
This is what bread has taught me in my journey.
