00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And stage 11, we call it cooling --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
because we never really eat the bread right away.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
There's a little carry-over baking.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
The proteins have to set up, strengthen and firm up.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And then we have stage 12, which the textbooks call "packaging,"

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
but my students call "eating."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And so, we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and in a few minutes we will try this,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and see if we have succeeded

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But I want to go back now and revisit these steps,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation,
