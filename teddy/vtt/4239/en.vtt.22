00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
determine the outcome of the product.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
A subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time --

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
it's all about a balancing act between time, temperature

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and ingredients. That's the art of baking.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So all these things are determined by the baker,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
is divided into smaller units, and each of those units

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
are given shape by the baker.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And as they're shaped, they're raised again,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
all along proving that they're alive,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and developing character.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And at stage 10, we take it to the oven.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough --
