00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and it goes into the oven -- stage 10.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Three transformations take place in the oven.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
They give us that beautiful brown crust.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Only the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Inside, the proteins --

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
this gluten -- coagulates.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
When it gets to about 160 degrees,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
the proteins all line up 
and they create structure,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the gluten structure --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And the starches, when they reach about 180 degrees,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
gelatinize.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And gelatinization is yet another
