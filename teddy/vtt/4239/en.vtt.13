00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And gelatinization is yet another

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
oven transformation.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Coagulation, caramelization and gelatinization --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
they -- they kind of swell, and then they burst.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And they burst, and they spill their guts into the bread.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So basically now we're eating yeast sweats --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
sweat, burps and starch guts.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Again, transformed in stage 10 in the oven

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
because what went into the oven as dough

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
comes out in stage 11 as bread.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And stage 11, we call it cooling --
