With whole grain bread, you have other obstacles.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You've got bran, which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
for the bran is fiber.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It's got germ. Those are the good things,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So whole grain breads historically

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
have had sort of this onus of being health food breads,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and people don't like to eat,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
quote, health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
but when we think of something as a health food,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
we think of it as something we eat out of obligation,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
not out of passion and love for the flavor.
