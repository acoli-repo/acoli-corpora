00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and attempting to actually eat them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
(Laughter)

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
you know, how do you make it taste good?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Because whole grain -- it's easy with white flour

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's mainly starch, and starch, when you break it down --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
what is starch? It's -- thank you -- sugar, yes.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So a baker, and a good baker,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
knows how to pull or draw forth

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the inherent sugar trapped in the starch.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
With whole grain bread, you have other obstacles.
