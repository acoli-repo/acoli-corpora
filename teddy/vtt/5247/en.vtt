00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.070
At the temple of the fisherman, 
Quexo, the village shaman,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.770
looks out over the ocean and frowns.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.440
It’s a still morning–
unusually still,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.118
and the lack of wind is the latest 
in a series of troubling signs.

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:24.768
The year is 1400 BCE.

00:00:24.768 --> 00:00:28.078
Quexo’s village sits in the dusty, 
treeless desert

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:31.108
between the towering Andes 
and Pacific Ocean.
