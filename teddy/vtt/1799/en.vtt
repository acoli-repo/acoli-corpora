When you grow up in a developing country
like India, as I did,

00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:11.107
you instantly learn to get more value
from limited resources

00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:15.237
and find creative ways to reuse
what you already have.

00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:20.005
Take Mansukh Prajapati,
a potter in India.

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:25.977
He has created a fridge
made entirely of clay

00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:28.275
that consumes no electricity.

00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:32.130
He can keep fruits and vegetables
fresh for many days.
