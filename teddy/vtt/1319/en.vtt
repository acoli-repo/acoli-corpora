00:00:01.072 --> 00:00:03.083
Chris Anderson: The rights of citizens,

00:00:03.083 --> 00:00:05.169
the future of the Internet.

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:08.552
So I would like to welcome to the TED stage

00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:11.378
the man behind those revelations,

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.754
Ed Snowden.

00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:17.321
(Applause)

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:21.574
Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:24.349
controlling this bot from his laptop,

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.402
so he can see what the bot can see.

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.350
Ed, welcome to the TED stage.
