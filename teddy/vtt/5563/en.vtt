It starts with a tickle in your throat
that becomes a cough.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.485
Your muscles begin to ache,

00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:15.955
you grow irritable,

00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:17.922
and you lose your appetite.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:20.820
It's official: you've got the flu.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.105
It's logical to assume that this
miserable medley of symptoms

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:27.291
is the result of the infection
coursing through your body,

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:29.191
but is that really the case?

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:31.927
What's actually making you feel sick?
