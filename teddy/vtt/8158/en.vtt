00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:02.123
For nearly a decade,

00:00:02.165 --> 00:00:05.251
I owned and operated a restaurant
called Eleven Madison Park.

00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:08.504
To give you some context,
if you don't know what that is,

00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:10.798
Eleven Madison is a very fancy restaurant

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.468
on the corner of 24th and Madison
here in New York City.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.261
I mean, like very fancy.

00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:18.181
We're talking servers
wearing suits and ties,

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:20.725
like, crisp, ironed white tablecloths.

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:25.438
More than 30 cooks in the kitchen
serving like 10-, 15-course tasting menus.

00:00:25.438 --> 00:00:26.856
I think you get the gist.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.985
When I got there in 2006,
it was kind of a middling brasserie.
