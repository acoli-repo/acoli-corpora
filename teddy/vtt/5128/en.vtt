00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:09.446
Today ,more than half of all people in the world

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:11.366
live in an urban area.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.694
By mid-century, this will increase to 70%.

00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:16.782
But as recently as 100 years ago,

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.491
only two out of ten people lived in a city,

00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:21.615
and before that, it was even less.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:22.700
How have we reached

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.785
such a high degree of urbanization,

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:27.180
and what does it mean for our future?

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.250
In the earliest days of human history,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.000
humans were hunter-gatherers,
