00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
because the defender

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
doesn't know who to fight back against.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
they risk making one more enemy

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and ending up diplomatically isolated.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
This issue isn't just theoretical.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
In May 2007, Estonia was the victim of cyberattacks,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that damaged its communication

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and banking systems.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Estonia accused Russia.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
But NATO, though it defends Estonia,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
reacted very prudently. Why?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Because NATO couldn't be 100% sure

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that the Kremlin was indeed behind these attacks.
