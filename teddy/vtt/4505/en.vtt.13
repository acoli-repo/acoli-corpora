00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
but in addition, they're emerging

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
in a much more unstable environment.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
If you remember the Cold War,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
it was a very hard game,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but a stable one played only by two players,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
which allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Today we're moving to a multipolar world

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
in which coordination is much more complicated,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
as we have seen at Copenhagen.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And this coordination may become even trickier

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
with the introduction of cyber weapons.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Why? Because no nation

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
knows for sure whether its neighbor
