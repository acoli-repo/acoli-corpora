00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
we would have talked about the military innovation of the day --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the massive Vauban-style fortifications --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and we could have predicted

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a period of stability in the world or in Europe.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
which was indeed the case in Europe

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
between 1650 and 1750.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Similarly, if we'd had this talk

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
30 or 40 years ago, we would have seen

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
how the rise of nuclear weapons,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
However, if we'd had this talk 60 years ago,
