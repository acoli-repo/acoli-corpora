00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
But in doing so, they also add their own risk

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
as we've just seen, a very important risk --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and a risk we may have to confront

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
with a collective security solution

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
which includes all of us:

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
European allies, NATO members,
