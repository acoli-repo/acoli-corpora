00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Even more worrying for the Americans,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in December 2008 the holiest of holies,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the IT systems of CENTCOM,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the central command

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
managing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
may have been infiltrated by hackers

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
who used these:

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
plain but infected USB keys.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And with these keys, they may have been able

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to get inside CENTCOM's systems,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to see and hear everything,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and maybe even infect some of them.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
As a result, the Americans take the threat very seriously.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'll quote General James Cartwright,
