00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you have followed

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
diplomatic news in the past weeks,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you may have heard of a kind of crisis

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
between China and the U.S.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
regarding cyberattacks

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
against the American company Google.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Many things have been said about this.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Some people have called a cyberwar

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what may actually be

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
just a spy operation --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and obviously, a quite mishandled one.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
However, this episode reveals

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the growing anxiety in the Western world

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
regarding these emerging cyber weapons.
