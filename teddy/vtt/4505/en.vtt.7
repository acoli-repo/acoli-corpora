00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
However, if we'd had this talk 60 years ago,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we would have seen how the emergence

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
of new aircraft and tank technologies,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
which give the advantage to the attacker,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
make the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and thus create the possibility of war in Europe.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So military technologies

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
can influence the course of the world,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
can make or break world peace --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and there lies the issue with cyber weapons.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The first issue:

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Imagine a potential enemy announcing

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
they're building a cyberwar unit,
