00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the best defense is to attack.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And so, they're joining China,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
whose doctrine of use for 15 years has been

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
both defensive and offensive.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The second issue:

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Your country could be under cyberattack

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
with entire regions plunged into total darkness,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and you may not even know

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
who's attacking you.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.800
Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature:

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.300
they can be used

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.000
without leaving traces.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
because the defender
