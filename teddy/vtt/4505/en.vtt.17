00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
European allies, NATO members,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
our American friends and allies,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
our other Western allies,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and maybe, by forcing their hand a little,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
our Russian and Chinese partners.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
The information technologies

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.500
Joël de Rosnay was talking about,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.000
which were historically born from military research,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
are today on the verge of developing

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
an offensive capability of destruction,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
which could tomorrow, if we're not careful,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
completely destroy world peace.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Thank you.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
