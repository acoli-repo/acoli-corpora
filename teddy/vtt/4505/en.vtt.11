00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that the Kremlin was indeed behind these attacks.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So to sum up, on the one hand,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
when a possible enemy announces

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
they're building a cyberwar unit,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
you don't know whether it's for attack

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
or defense.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
On the other hand,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
In a major article published in 1978,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
described a model to understand

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
how conflicts could arise.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
In this context,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
when you don't know if the potential enemy
