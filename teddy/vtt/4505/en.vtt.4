00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'll quote General James Cartwright,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
who says in a report to Congress

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that cyberattacks could be as powerful as

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
weapons of mass destruction.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Moreover, the Americans have decided

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to spend over 30 billion dollars

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.500
in the next five years

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.000
to build up their cyberwar capabilities.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And across the world today, we see

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
a sort of cyber arms race,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
with cyberwar units

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
built up by countries like North Korea

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
or even Iran.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Yet, what you'll never hear
