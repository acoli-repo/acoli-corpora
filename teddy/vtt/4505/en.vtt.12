00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
In this context,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
when you don't know if the potential enemy

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
is preparing for defense or attack,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
then this environment is

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
most likely to spark a conflict.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
This is the environment that's being created

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
by cyber weapons today,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and historically it was the environment in Europe

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
at the onset of World War I.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So cyber weapons

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
are dangerous by nature,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
but in addition, they're emerging
