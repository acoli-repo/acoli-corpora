00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Imagine a potential enemy announcing

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
they're building a cyberwar unit,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
but only for their country's defense.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Okay, but what distinguishes it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
from an offensive unit?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It gets even more complicated

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
when the doctrines of use become ambiguous.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Just 3 years ago, both the U.S. and France

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
strictly to defend their IT systems.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But today both countries say

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the best defense is to attack.
