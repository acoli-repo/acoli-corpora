00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:12.526
For almost a decade, scientists chased 
the source of a deadly new virus

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:16.526
through Chinaâ€™s tallest mountains 
and most isolated caverns.

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:21.256
They finally found it here: 
in the bats of Shitou Cave.

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:23.486
The virus in question was a coronavirus

00:00:23.486 --> 00:00:27.489
that caused an epidemic 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome,

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.739
or SARS, in 2003.
