00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Just to put everything in context,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
so that a lot of the things I'm going to say,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and the things I'm going to do --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
or things I'm going to tell you I've done --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Finished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.
