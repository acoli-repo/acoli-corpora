00:03:29.524 --> 00:03:35.246
we likely altered the rate and geographic 
distribution of these whale falls

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:37.563
that would descend into deep oceans,

00:03:37.563 --> 00:03:41.254
and as a result, probably led
to a number of extinctions

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:43.392
of species that were most specialized

00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:47.876
and dependent on these carcasses
for their survival.

00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:55.808
Whale carcasses are also known
to transport about 190,000 tons of carbon,

00:03:55.808 --> 00:03:58.106
which is the equivalent of that produced

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:01.171
by 80,000 cars per year
