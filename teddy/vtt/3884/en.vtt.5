Gray whales off America
migrate 16,000 kilometers

00:02:32.707 --> 00:02:38.812
between productive feeding areas and less
productive calving, or birthing, areas

00:02:38.812 --> 00:02:41.902
and back every year.

00:02:41.902 --> 00:02:46.886
As they do so, they transport fertilizer
in the form of their feces

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:50.676
from places that have it
to places that need it.

00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:54.115
So clearly, whales are really
important in nutrient cycling,

00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:57.807
both horizontally and vertically,
through the oceans.

00:02:57.807 --> 00:03:04.466
But what's really cool is that they're 
also really important after they're dead.
