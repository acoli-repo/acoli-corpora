00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.412
We only have whales in our waters today

00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:37.057
because of the Save the Whales
movement of the '70s.

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:40.455
It was instrumental in stopping
commercial whaling,

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:44.227
and was built on the idea that
if we couldn't save whales,

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:46.154
what could we save?

00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:49.080
It was ultimately a test
of our political ability

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.683
to halt environmental destruction.

00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:56.236
So in the early '80s, there was
a ban on commercial whaling

00:00:56.236 --> 00:00:59.951
that came into force
as a result of this campaign.

00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:02.760
Whales in our waters are still
low in numbers, however,
