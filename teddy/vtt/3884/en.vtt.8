00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:01.171
by 80,000 cars per year

00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:04.000
from the atmosphere to the deep oceans,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.510
and the deep oceans
are what we call "carbon sinks,"

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.573
because they trap and hold
excess carbon from the atmosphere,

00:04:11.573 --> 00:04:15.789
and therefore help
to delay global warming.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.468
Sometimes these carcasses
also wash up on beaches

00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:24.540
and provide a meal to a number
of predatory species on land.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.464
The 200 years of whaling
was clearly detrimental

00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:31.356
and caused a reduction
in the populations of whales
