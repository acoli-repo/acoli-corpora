They help maintain the stability
and health of the oceans,

00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:37.299
and even provide services
to human society.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.275
So let's talk about why
saving whales is critical

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:44.806
to the resiliency of the oceans.

00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:49.334
It boils down to two main things:

00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:52.546
whale poop and rotting carcasses.

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:58.012
As whales dive to the depths to feed
and come up to the surface to breathe,

00:01:58.012 --> 00:02:01.918
they actually release these
enormous fecal plumes.
