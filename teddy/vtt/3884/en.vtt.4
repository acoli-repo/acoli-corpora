This whale pump, as it's called,


00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:06.955
actually brings essential limiting 
nutrients from the depths

00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:10.975
to the surface waters where they 
stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,

00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:14.422
which forms the base
of all marine food chains.

00:02:14.422 --> 00:02:17.127
So really, having more whales
in the oceans pooping

00:02:17.127 --> 00:02:21.208
is really beneficial
to the entire ecosystem.

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:26.760
Whales are also known to undertake some 
of the longest migrations of all mammals.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.696
Gray whales off America
