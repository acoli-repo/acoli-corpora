00:02:57.807 --> 00:03:04.466
But what's really cool is that they're 
also really important after they're dead.

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:08.559
Whale carcasses are some of 
the largest form of detritus

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:12.769
to fall from the ocean's surface, 
and they're called whale fall.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.466
As these carcasses sink,

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:18.495
they provide a feast
to some 400-odd species,

00:03:18.495 --> 00:03:22.331
including the eel-shaped, slime-producing 
hagfish.

00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.154
So over the 200 years of whaling,

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:29.524
when we were busy killing and removing
these carcasses from the oceans,

00:03:29.524 --> 00:03:35.246
we likely altered the rate and geographic 
distribution of these whale falls
