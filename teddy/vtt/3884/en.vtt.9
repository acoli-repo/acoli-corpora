00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:31.356
and caused a reduction
in the populations of whales

00:04:31.356 --> 00:04:34.476
between 60 to 90 percent.

00:04:34.476 --> 00:04:36.302
Clearly, the Save the Whales movement

00:04:36.302 --> 00:04:40.713
was instrumental in preventing
commercial whaling from going on,

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:43.854
but we need to revise this.

00:04:43.854 --> 00:04:48.608
We need to address the more modern,
pressing problems that these whales face

00:04:48.608 --> 00:04:50.349
in our waters today.

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.482
Amongst other things, we need to stop them

00:04:52.482 --> 00:04:57.187
from getting plowed down by container 
ships when they're in their feeding areas,

00:04:57.187 --> 00:04:59.985
and stop them from getting
entangled in fishing nets

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:02.469
as they float around in the ocean.
