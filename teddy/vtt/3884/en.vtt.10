as they float around in the ocean.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.839
We also need to learn to contextualize
our conservation messages,

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:13.225
so people really understand the true 
ecosystem value of these creatures.

00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:18.142
So, let's save the whales again,

00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:22.275
but this time, let's not just 
do it for their sake.

00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:24.806
Let's also do it for ours.

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:27.151
Thank you.

00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:31.981
