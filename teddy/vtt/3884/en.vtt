00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.914
In the 1600s, there were so many
right whales in Cape Cod Bay

00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:06.741
off the east coast of the U.S.

00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:10.389
that apparently you could
walk across their backs

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.484
from one end of the bay to the other.

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:16.573
Today, they number in the hundreds,
and they're endangered.

00:00:16.573 --> 00:00:21.728
Like them, many species of whales
saw their numbers drastically reduced

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:24.170
by 200 years of whaling,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.889
where they were hunted and killed
for their whale meat, oil and whale bone.
