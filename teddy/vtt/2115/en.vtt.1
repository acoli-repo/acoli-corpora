00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Imagine if a group of sculptors

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
could be inside of a lattice of atoms

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and sculpt with their material.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
into the brain, as though it was a world,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and see tissues as landscapes,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and hear blood density levels as music.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is some of the research that you're going to see

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But first a little bit about this group

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of artists, scientists, and engineers

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that are working together.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm a composer, orchestrally-trained,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and the inventor of the AlloSphere.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
With my visual artist colleagues, we map
