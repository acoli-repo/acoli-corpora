00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You see the electron flow with the streamlines

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
we as artists have generated for the scientists.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We think it makes a beautiful structural art.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The sound that you're hearing are the actual

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
emission spectrums of these atoms.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
We've mapped them into the audio domain,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
so they're singing to you.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Oxygen, hydrogen and zinc have their own signature.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We're going to actually move even further down

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
as we go from this lattice of atoms

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
to one single hydrogen atom.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We're working with our physicist colleagues
