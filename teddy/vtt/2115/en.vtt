The AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in an echo-free chamber.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Think of the AlloSphere as a large,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
dynamically varying digital microscope

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that's connected to a supercomputer.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
20 researchers can stand on a bridge

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
suspended inside of the sphere, and be

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
completely immersed in their data.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Imagine if a team of physicists

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
could stand inside of an atom

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and watch and hear electrons spin.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Imagine if a group of sculptors

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
could be inside of a lattice of atoms
