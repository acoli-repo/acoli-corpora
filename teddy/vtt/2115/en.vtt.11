00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So these brief examples that I've shown you

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
at the University of California, Santa Barbara,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
to bring together, arts, science

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and engineering

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
into a new age of math, science and art.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Thank you very much.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
