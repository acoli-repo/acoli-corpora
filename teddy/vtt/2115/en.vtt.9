00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
In a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and you're going to notice a pulsing.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
This is actually a light emitter.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
As the sound starts to pulse and contract,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
They're starting to find new mathematical structures

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
in these calculations.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We're going to move even further down,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and go to one single electron spin.
