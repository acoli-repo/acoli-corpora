00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And they're reporting them back to you sonically.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Higher density levels mean

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
more activity in that point of the brain.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
They're actually singing these densities to you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
with higher pitches mapped to higher densities.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We're now going to move from real biological data

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
in our next artistic and scientific installation.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
In this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
are helping us to understand

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
self-generation and growth:
