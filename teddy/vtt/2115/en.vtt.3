This first project is called the AlloBrain.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And it's our attempt to quantify beauty

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
by finding which regions of the brain

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Our narrative here is real fMRI data

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that's mapped visually and sonically.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You see 12 intelligent computer agents,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
They're mining blood density levels.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And they're reporting them back to you sonically.
