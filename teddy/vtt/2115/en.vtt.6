00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
down into the atomic world,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
as we fly into a lattice of atoms.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This is real AFM -- Atomic Force Microscope -- data

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
They've discovered a new bond,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
a new material for transparent solar cells.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We're flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
oxygen, hydrogen and zinc.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You view the bond in the triangle.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's four blue zinc atoms

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
bonding with one white hydrogen atom.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You see the electron flow with the streamlines

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
we as artists have generated for the scientists.
