00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
self-generation and growth:

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
For artists, we're making new worlds

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that we can uncover and explore.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
These generative algorithms grow over time,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Our researchers are interacting with this data

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
by injecting bacterial code,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
which are computer programs,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that allow these creatures to grow over time.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We're going to move now from the biological

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and the macroscopic world,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
down into the atomic world,
