00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We're working with our physicist colleagues

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that have given us the mathematical calculations

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
of the n-dimensional Schrödinger equation in time.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The white dots are the probability wave

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that will show you where the electron is

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
in any given point of time and space

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
in this particular three-orbital configuration.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
In a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration,
