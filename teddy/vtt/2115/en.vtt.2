00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
With my visual artist colleagues, we map

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
visually and sonically.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in the information.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And our engineering colleagues are making

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
for this kind of data exploration.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm going to fly you into five research projects

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
biological macroscopic data

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
all the way down to electron spin.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This first project is called the AlloBrain.
