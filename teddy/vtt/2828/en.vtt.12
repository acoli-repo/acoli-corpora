00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:02.970
But is true only for rats?

00:06:02.994 --> 00:06:05.946
The problem is, we cannot
test this in humans,

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.082
because ethically, we cannot administer
child adversity in a random way.

00:06:10.106 --> 00:06:13.410
So if a poor child develops
a certain property,

00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:17.173
we don't know whether
this is caused by poverty

00:06:17.197 --> 00:06:20.021
or whether poor people have bad genes.

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:23.160
So geneticists will try to tell you
that poor people are poor

00:06:23.184 --> 00:06:25.240
because their genes make them poor.

00:06:25.264 --> 00:06:27.224
Epigeneticists will tell you

00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:31.358
poor people are in a bad environment
or an impoverished environment
