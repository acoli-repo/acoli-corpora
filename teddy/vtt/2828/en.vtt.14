00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:02.829
And other monkeys were reared
with their normal, natural mothers.

00:07:02.853 --> 00:07:07.549
And when they were old,
they were completely different animals.

00:07:07.573 --> 00:07:10.666
The monkeys that had a mother
did not care about alcohol,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.369
they were not sexually aggressive.

00:07:12.393 --> 00:07:16.160
The monkeys that didn't have a mother
were aggressive, were stressed

00:07:16.184 --> 00:07:17.798
and were alcoholics.

00:07:18.482 --> 00:07:23.964
So we looked at their DNA
early after birth, to see:

00:07:23.988 --> 00:07:26.755
Is it possible that the mother is marking?

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:32.137
Is there a signature of the mother
in the DNA of the offspring?
