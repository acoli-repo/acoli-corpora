00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.414
Is this magic?

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:32.371
How does this work?

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:34.604
As geneticists would like you to think,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.362
perhaps the mother had
the "bad mother" gene

00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:43.023
that caused her pups to be stressful,

00:01:43.047 --> 00:01:45.594
and then it was passed
from generation to generation;

00:01:45.618 --> 00:01:48.318
it's all determined by genetics.

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:51.836
Or is it possible that something
else is going on here?

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.431
In rats, we can ask
this question and answer it.

00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:59.060
So what we did is
a cross-fostering experiment.

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:03.839
You essentially separate the litter,
the babies of this rat, at birth,
