00:05:28.568 --> 00:05:34.978
And therefore, the preparation
that we had by our mothers

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:37.594
is turning out to be maladaptive.

00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:42.564
The same preparation that was supposed
to protect us from hunger and famine

00:05:42.588 --> 00:05:45.045
is going to cause obesity,

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.039
cardiovascular problems
and metabolic disease.

00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:52.138
So this concept that genes
could be marked by our experience,

00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:54.463
and especially the early life experience,

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:57.301
can provide us a unifying explanation

00:05:57.325 --> 00:05:59.668
of both health and disease.
