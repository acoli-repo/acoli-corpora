00:09:27.349 --> 00:09:31.580
So we are born already knowing
the social information,

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:34.657
and that social information
is not bad or good,

00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:36.100
it just prepares us for life,

00:09:36.124 --> 00:09:40.365
because we have to program
our biology differently

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:43.470
if we are in the high
or the low social status.

00:09:44.326 --> 00:09:46.207
But how can you study this in humans?

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.158
We can't do experiments,
we can't administer adversity to humans.

00:09:50.182 --> 00:09:52.775
But God does experiments with humans,

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:55.087
and it's called natural disasters.

00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:59.371
One of the hardest natural disasters
in Canadian history

00:09:59.395 --> 00:10:01.805
happened in my province of Quebec.
