00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:32.137
Is there a signature of the mother
in the DNA of the offspring?

00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:34.413
These are Day-14 monkeys,

00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:38.513
and what you see here is the modern way
by which we study epigenetics.

00:07:38.537 --> 00:07:43.200
We can now map those chemical marks,
which we call methylation marks,

00:07:43.224 --> 00:07:46.482
on DNA at a single nucleotide resolution.

00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:48.383
We can map the entire genome.

00:07:48.407 --> 00:07:51.474
We can now compare the monkey
that had a mother or not.

00:07:51.498 --> 00:07:53.452
And here's a visual presentation of this.

00:07:53.476 --> 00:07:58.213
What you see is the genes
that got more methylated are red.

00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:01.251
The genes that got
less methylated are green.
