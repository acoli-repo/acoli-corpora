Do we sense our social status,
even at the moment of birth?

00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:35.180
So in this experiment,
we took placentas of monkeys

00:08:35.204 --> 00:08:37.161
that had different social status.

00:08:37.698 --> 00:08:43.072
What's interesting about social rank
is that across all living beings,

00:08:43.096 --> 00:08:45.714
they will structure
themselves by hierarchy.

00:08:46.345 --> 00:08:48.533
Monkey number one is the boss;

00:08:48.557 --> 00:08:50.895
monkey number four is the peon.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:53.358
You put four monkeys in a cage,

00:08:53.382 --> 00:08:56.393
there will always be a boss
and always be a peon.

00:08:57.448 --> 00:09:01.296
And what's interesting
is that the monkey number one
