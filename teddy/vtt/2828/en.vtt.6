00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:00.557
And we thought: Is it possible

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:07.528
that the mother is somehow
reprogramming the gene of her offspring

00:03:07.552 --> 00:03:09.101
through her behavior?

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.736
And we spent 10 years,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.801
and we found that there is a cascade
of biochemical events

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:18.268
by which the licking and grooming
of the mother, the care of the mother,

00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:20.775
is translated to biochemical signals

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.110
that go into the nucleus and into the DNA

00:03:24.134 --> 00:03:26.212
and program it differently.

00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:31.132
So now the animal can prepare
itself for life:
