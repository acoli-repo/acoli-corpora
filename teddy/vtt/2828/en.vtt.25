00:12:28.458 --> 00:12:31.586
then for one month, no cocaine.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.286
Then he reminds them of the party
when they saw the cocaine the first time

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.126
by cue, the colors of the cage
when they saw cocaine.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.802
And they go crazy.

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:42.273
They will press the lever to get cocaine

00:12:42.297 --> 00:12:43.556
until they die.

00:12:44.047 --> 00:12:48.490
We first determined that the difference
between these animals

00:12:48.514 --> 00:12:51.215
is that during that time
when nothing happens,

00:12:51.239 --> 00:12:53.011
there's no cocaine around,

00:12:53.035 --> 00:12:54.956
their epigenome is rearranged.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.869
Their genes are re-marked
in a different way,

00:12:57.893 --> 00:13:01.635
and when the cue comes,
their genome is ready
