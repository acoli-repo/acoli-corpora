00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:01.251
The genes that got
less methylated are green.

00:08:01.275 --> 00:08:03.759
You can see many genes are changing,

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:06.497
because not having a mother
is not just one thing --

00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:08.052
it affects the whole way;

00:08:08.076 --> 00:08:11.584
it sends signals about the whole way
your world is going to look

00:08:11.608 --> 00:08:13.367
when you become an adult.

00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:15.812
And you can see the two groups of monkeys

00:08:15.836 --> 00:08:18.556
extremely well-separated from each other.

00:08:19.392 --> 00:08:21.521
How early does this develop?

00:08:22.078 --> 00:08:24.291
These monkeys already
didn't see their mothers,

00:08:24.315 --> 00:08:26.014
so they had a social experience.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:30.303
Do we sense our social status,
even at the moment of birth?
