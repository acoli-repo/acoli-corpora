It is the mother that
took care of the pups.

00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:35.596
So how can this work?

00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:38.724
I am an a epigeneticist.

00:02:38.748 --> 00:02:42.420
I am interested in how genes are marked

00:02:42.444 --> 00:02:44.160
by a chemical mark

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:48.989
during embryogenesis, during the time
we're in the womb of our mothers,

00:02:49.013 --> 00:02:51.492
and decide which gene will be expressed

00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:52.698
in what tissue.

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:56.892
Different genes are expressed in the brain
than in the liver and the eye.

00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:00.557
And we thought: Is it possible
