00:13:28.258 --> 00:13:30.362
the animals are not addicted anymore.

00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:32.005
We have reprogrammed them.

00:13:32.029 --> 00:13:35.335
And a fundamental difference
between an epigenetic drug

00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:36.665
and any other drug

00:13:36.689 --> 00:13:38.861
is that with epigenetic drugs,

00:13:38.885 --> 00:13:43.017
we essentially remove
the signs of experience,

00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:45.168
and once they're gone,

00:13:45.192 --> 00:13:48.213
they will not come back
unless you have the same experience.

00:13:48.237 --> 00:13:49.891
The animal now is reprogrammed.

00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:54.136
So when we visited the animals
30 days, 60 days later,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.079
which is in human terms
many years of life,

00:13:57.103 --> 00:14:02.409
they were still not addicted --
by a single epigenetic treatment.
