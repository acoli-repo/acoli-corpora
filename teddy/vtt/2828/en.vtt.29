you have control of the way
your genes look,

00:14:40.504 --> 00:14:43.774
and this has a tremendous
optimistic message

00:14:43.798 --> 00:14:47.306
for the ability to now encounter
some of the deadly diseases

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.234
like cancer, mental health,

00:14:50.258 --> 00:14:53.186
with a new approach,

looking at them as maladaptation.

00:14:55.768 --> 00:14:58.842
And if we can epigenetically intervene,

00:14:58.866 --> 00:15:02.362
[we can] reverse the movie
by removing an actor
