00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:31.443
and here we had objective
measures of stress:

00:10:31.467 --> 00:10:35.905
How long were you without power?
Where did you spend your time?

00:10:35.929 --> 00:10:40.932
Was it in your mother-in-law's apartment
or in some posh country home?

00:10:40.956 --> 00:10:43.614
So all of these added up
to a social stress scale,

00:10:43.638 --> 00:10:45.020
and you can ask the question:

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:48.088
How did the children look?

00:10:48.112 --> 00:10:50.746
And it appears that as stress increases,

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.828
the children develop more autism,

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:55.391
they develop more metabolic diseases

00:10:55.415 --> 00:10:58.247
and they develop more autoimmune diseases.

00:10:58.787 --> 00:11:01.211
We would map the methylation state,
