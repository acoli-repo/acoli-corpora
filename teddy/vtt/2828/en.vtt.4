You essentially separate the litter,
the babies of this rat, at birth,

00:02:03.863 --> 00:02:05.730
to two kinds of fostering mothers --

00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:09.082
not the real mothers,
but mothers that will take care of them:

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:11.360
high-licking mothers
and low-licking mothers.

00:02:11.384 --> 00:02:15.262
And you can do the opposite
with the low-licking pups.

00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:18.081
And the remarkable answer was,

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:22.144
it wasn't important
what gene you got from your mother.

00:02:22.168 --> 00:02:27.916
It was not the biological mother
that defined this property of these rats.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.946
It is the mother that
took care of the pups.
