00:08:57.448 --> 00:09:01.296
And what's interesting
is that the monkey number one

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.752
is much healthier than monkey number four.

00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:06.580
And if you put them in a cage,

00:09:06.604 --> 00:09:11.301
monkey number one will not eat as much.

00:09:11.325 --> 00:09:13.162
Monkey number four will eat [a lot].

00:09:14.129 --> 00:09:18.402
And what you see here
in this methylation mapping,

00:09:18.426 --> 00:09:21.201
a dramatic separation at birth

00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:23.939
of the animals that had
a high social status

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:26.637
versus the animals
that did not have a high status.

00:09:27.349 --> 00:09:31.580
So we are born already knowing
the social information,
