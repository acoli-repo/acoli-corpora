00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:31.132
So now the animal can prepare
itself for life:

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:33.777
Is life going to be harsh?

00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:35.563
Is there going to be a lot of food?

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:38.112
Are there going to be a lot of cats
and snakes around,

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:40.459
or will I live
in an upper-class neighborhood

00:03:40.483 --> 00:03:43.190
where all I have to do
is behave well and proper,

00:03:43.214 --> 00:03:46.349
and that will gain me social acceptance?

00:03:46.978 --> 00:03:52.569
And now one can think about
how important that process can be

00:03:52.593 --> 00:03:53.768
for our lives.

00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:56.704
We inherit our DNA from our ancestors.

00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:59.340
The DNA is old.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.432
It evolved during evolution.
