Evolution has selected this

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:05.050
to allow our fixed, old DNA
to function in a dynamic way

00:05:05.074 --> 00:05:06.923
in new environments.

00:05:07.377 --> 00:05:09.960
But sometimes things can go wrong;

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:14.568
for example, if you're born
to a poor family

00:05:14.592 --> 00:05:17.521
and the signals are, "You better binge,

00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:20.760
you better eat every piece of food
you're going to encounter."

00:05:20.784 --> 00:05:23.036
But now we humans
and our brain have evolved,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.156

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.544
Now you can buy McDonald's for one dollar.

00:05:28.568 --> 00:05:34.978
And therefore, the preparation
that we had by our mothers
