00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.099
"This is where my tax
dollars are wasted --

00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:32.157
(Laughter)

00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:34.959
on this kind of soft science."

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.332
And he started telling me

00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:41.756
that the rats, like humans,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.226
lick their pups in very different ways.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.985
Some mothers do a lot of that,

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.214
some mothers do very little,

00:00:49.238 --> 00:00:51.208
and most are in between.

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:53.768
But what's interesting about it

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:58.710
is when he follows these pups
when they become adults --

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:02.913
like, years in human life,
long after their mother died.
