00:12:57.893 --> 00:13:01.635
and when the cue comes,
their genome is ready

00:13:01.659 --> 00:13:03.948
to develop this addictive phenotype.

00:13:04.565 --> 00:13:11.335
So we treated these animals with drugs
that either increase DNA methylation,

00:13:11.359 --> 00:13:13.583
which was the epigenetic
marker to look at,

00:13:13.607 --> 00:13:17.090
or decrease epigenetic markings.

00:13:17.114 --> 00:13:20.369
And we found that
if we increased methylation,

00:13:20.393 --> 00:13:22.276
these animals go even crazier.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.784
They become more craving for cocaine.

00:13:24.808 --> 00:13:28.234
But if we reduce the DNA methylation,

00:13:28.258 --> 00:13:30.362
the animals are not addicted anymore.
