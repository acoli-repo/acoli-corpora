00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:31.358
poor people are in a bad environment
or an impoverished environment

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:34.346
that creates that phenotype,
that property.

00:06:35.576 --> 00:06:41.418
So we moved to look
into our cousins, the monkeys.

00:06:42.087 --> 00:06:45.781
My colleague, Stephen Suomi,
has been rearing monkeys

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:46.966
in two different ways:

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.891
randomly separated the monkey
from the mother

00:06:49.915 --> 00:06:52.507
and reared her with a nurse

00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:55.490
and surrogate motherhood conditions.

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:58.185
So these monkeys didn't have
a mother; they had a nurse.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:02.829
And other monkeys were reared
with their normal, natural mothers.
