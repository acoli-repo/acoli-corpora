00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.455
tell the child what kind of social world
you're going to be living in.

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.879
It will be harsh, and you'd better
be anxious and be stressful,

00:04:33.903 --> 00:04:37.026
or it's going to be an easy world,
and you have to be different.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.240
Is it going to be a world
with a lot of light or little light?

00:04:40.264 --> 00:04:44.249
Is it going to be a world
with a lot of food or little food?

00:04:44.273 --> 00:04:45.797
If there's no food around,

00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:50.437
you'd better develop your brain to binge
whenever you see a meal,

00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:55.217
or store every piece of food
that you have as fat.

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.249
So this is good.
