It evolved during evolution.

00:04:01.938 --> 00:04:06.271
But it doesn't tell us
if you are going to be born in Stockholm,

00:04:06.295 --> 00:04:09.681
where the days are long in the summer
and short in the winter,

00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:11.010
or in Ecuador,

00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:14.567
where there's an equal number of hours
for day and night all year round.

00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:18.386
And that has such an enormous [effect]
on our physiology.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.725
So what we suggest is,
perhaps what happens early in life,

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:25.916
those signals that come
through the mother,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.455
tell the child what kind of social world
you're going to be living in.
