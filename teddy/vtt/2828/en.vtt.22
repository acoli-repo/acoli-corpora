00:10:58.787 --> 00:11:01.211
We would map the methylation state,

00:11:01.235 --> 00:11:06.773
and again, you see the green genes
becoming red as stress increases,

00:11:06.797 --> 00:11:10.289
the red genes becoming green
as stress increases,

00:11:10.313 --> 00:11:14.863
an entire rearrangement
of the genome in response to stress.

00:11:17.442 --> 00:11:20.651
So if we can program genes,

00:11:20.675 --> 00:11:24.648
if we are not just the slaves
of the history of our genes,

00:11:24.672 --> 00:11:27.300
that they could be programmed,
can we deprogram them?

00:11:28.093 --> 00:11:32.675
Because epigenetic causes
can cause diseases like cancer,
