where a judge set 500 dollars bail.

00:03:00.936 --> 00:03:04.008
But Ramel -- he didn't have 500 dollars.

00:03:04.032 --> 00:03:07.884
So this 32-year-old father
was sent to "The Boat" --

00:03:07.908 --> 00:03:11.612
a floating jail barge
that sits on the East River

00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:14.307
between a sewage plant and a fish market.

00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:17.463
That's right, you heard me.

00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:20.265
In New York City, in 2018,

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:24.785
we have a floating prison barge
that sits out there

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:28.216
and houses primarily black and brown men

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.387
who cannot pay their bail.
