(Applause)

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.157
But how are we going to make that happen?

00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:11.182
Well, that's the question
I was wrestling with over a decade ago

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:14.064
when I was sitting at a kitchen table
with my husband, David,

00:07:14.088 --> 00:07:15.517
who is also a public defender.

00:07:15.541 --> 00:07:19.206
We were eating our Chinese takeout
and venting about the injustice of it all

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.642
when David looked up and said,

00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:23.550
"Why don't we just start a bail fund,

00:07:23.574 --> 00:07:25.864
and just start bailing
our clients out of jail?"

00:07:26.836 --> 00:07:29.296
And in that unexpected moment,

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.185
the idea for the Bronx
Freedom Fund was born.
