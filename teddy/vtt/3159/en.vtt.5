00:02:27.507 --> 00:02:30.899
Seventy-five percent of people
in American local jails

00:02:30.923 --> 00:02:33.226
are there because they cannot pay bail.

00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:35.775
People like Ramel.

00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:38.114
On a chilly October afternoon,

00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:40.980
Ramel was riding his bicycle
in his South Bronx neighborhood

00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:43.382
on his way to a market
to pick up a quart of milk.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.430
He was stopped by the police.

00:02:45.454 --> 00:02:48.022
And when he demanded to know
why he was being stopped,

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:50.372
an argument ensued,
and the next thing he knew,

00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:52.017
he was on the ground in handcuffs,

00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:55.039
being charged with "riding
your bicycle on the sidewalk

00:02:55.063 --> 00:02:56.335
and resisting arrest."

00:02:56.944 --> 00:02:57.994
He was taken to court,

00:02:58.018 --> 00:03:00.912
where a judge set 500 dollars bail.
