00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.924
I will never forget the first time
I visited a client in jail.

00:00:05.074 --> 00:00:07.281
The heavy, metal door slammed behind me,

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:09.550
and I heard the key turn in the lock.

00:00:10.198 --> 00:00:13.453
The cement floor underneath me
had a sticky film on it

00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:15.019
that made a ripping sound,

00:00:15.043 --> 00:00:17.657
like tape being pulled off a box,

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:19.340
every time I moved my foot.

00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:24.731
The only connection to the outside world
was a small window placed too high to see.

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:28.496
There was a small, square table
bolted to the floor

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.972
and two metal chairs,

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.524
one on either side.
