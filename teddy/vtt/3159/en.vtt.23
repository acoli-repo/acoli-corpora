00:11:26.903 --> 00:11:30.904
These are passionate, dedicated
advocates from local communities,

00:11:30.928 --> 00:11:33.537
many of whom were formerly
incarcerated themselves,

00:11:33.561 --> 00:11:35.910
who will pay bails and support clients

00:11:35.934 --> 00:11:38.411
while their cases are going
through the legal system,

00:11:38.435 --> 00:11:41.628
providing them with whatever
resources and support they may need.

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:44.850
Our first two sites are up and running.

00:11:44.874 --> 00:11:46.627
One in Tulsa, Oklahoma,

00:11:46.651 --> 00:11:48.437
and one in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.270
And Ramel?

00:11:50.634 --> 00:11:54.158
He's training right now to be a bail
disrupter in Queens County, New York.

00:11:54.182 --> 00:11:59.623

00:11:59.647 --> 00:12:01.973
Our next three sites are ready to launch
