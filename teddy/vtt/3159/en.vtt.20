00:09:59.528 --> 00:10:01.595
It's time to do something about that.

00:10:02.173 --> 00:10:04.504
It's time to do something big.

00:10:04.528 --> 00:10:06.567
It's time to do something bold.

00:10:07.016 --> 00:10:10.394
It's time to do something,
maybe, audacious?

00:10:10.418 --> 00:10:11.645
(Laughter)

00:10:11.669 --> 00:10:14.939
We want to take our proven,
revolving bail-fund model

00:10:14.963 --> 00:10:16.329
that we built in the Bronx

00:10:16.353 --> 00:10:18.177
and spread it across America,

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.398
attacking the front end
of the legal system

00:10:20.422 --> 00:10:22.288
before incarceration begins.

00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:24.290
(Applause)

00:10:24.314 --> 00:10:27.626
(Cheers)

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:33.708
(Applause)
