(Applause)

00:10:33.732 --> 00:10:34.914
Here's the plan.

00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:35.990
(Applause)

00:10:36.014 --> 00:10:38.253
We're going to bail out
as many people as we can

00:10:38.277 --> 00:10:39.511
as quickly as we can.

00:10:39.535 --> 00:10:40.767
Over the next five years,

00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:43.934
partnering with public defenders
and local community organizations,

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.708
we're going to set up 40 sites
in high-need jurisdictions.

00:10:46.732 --> 00:10:49.965
The goal is to bail out 160,000 people.

00:10:50.453 --> 00:10:52.065
Our strategy leverages the fact

00:10:52.089 --> 00:10:54.597
that bail money comes back
at the end of a case.

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:55.841
Data from the Bronx

00:10:55.865 --> 00:11:00.676
shows that a dollar can be used
two or three times a year,
