00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.185
the idea for the Bronx
Freedom Fund was born.

00:07:33.026 --> 00:07:35.073
Look, we didn't know what to expect.

00:07:35.097 --> 00:07:37.713
There were plenty of people
that told us we were crazy

00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:39.737
and we were going
to lose all of the money.

00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:42.904
People wouldn't come back
because they didn't have any stake in it.

00:07:42.928 --> 00:07:44.983
But what if clients did come back?

00:07:45.952 --> 00:07:49.723
We knew that bail money comes back
at the end of a criminal case,

00:07:49.747 --> 00:07:51.995
so it could come back into the fund,

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:56.503
and we could use it over and over again
for more and more bail.

00:07:56.527 --> 00:07:57.837
That was our big bet,

00:07:57.861 --> 00:07:59.765
and that bet paid off.
