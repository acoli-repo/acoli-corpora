00:12:28.078 --> 00:12:32.808
so that we do not recreate this system
of oppression in just another form.

00:12:33.434 --> 00:12:34.595
The Bail Project,

00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:38.228
by bailing out 160,000 people
over the next five years,

00:12:38.252 --> 00:12:41.690
will become one of the largest
non-governmental decarcerations

00:12:41.714 --> 00:12:43.367
of Americans in history.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.051
So look --

00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:47.535
(Applause)

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:50.139
the criminal legal system, as it exists --

00:12:50.163 --> 00:12:52.066
it needs to be dismantled.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.671
But here's the thing I know
from decades in the system:

00:12:54.695 --> 00:12:57.410
real, systemic change takes time,

00:12:57.434 --> 00:12:59.236
and it takes a variety of strategies.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.416
So it's going to take all of us.
