You plead guilty
whether you did it or not.

00:05:01.173 --> 00:05:03.650
But now you have a criminal record

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:06.411
that's going to follow you
for the rest of your life.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.772
Jailing people because they don't have
enough money to pay bail

00:05:10.796 --> 00:05:14.649
is one of the most unfair,
immoral things we do as a society.

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:18.409
But it is also expensive
and counterproductive.

00:05:19.264 --> 00:05:20.759
American taxpayers --

00:05:20.783 --> 00:05:25.425
they spend 14 billion dollars annually
holding people in jail cells

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.338
who haven't been convicted of anything.

00:05:27.362 --> 00:05:29.675
That's 40 million dollars a day.
