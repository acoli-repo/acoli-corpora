00:06:28.857 --> 00:06:30.997
as they were dragged into those jail cells

00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:33.373
because they didn't have
enough money to pay bail.

00:06:33.397 --> 00:06:37.952
I have watched as questions of justice
were subsumed by questions of money,

00:06:37.976 --> 00:06:42.145
calling into question the legitimacy
of the entire American legal system.

00:06:43.213 --> 00:06:46.444
I am here to say something simple --

00:06:46.468 --> 00:06:48.146
something obvious,

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.759
but something urgent.

00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:54.181
Freedom makes all the difference,

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:57.895
and freedom should be free.

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:04.919
