00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.823
that it is enshrined in our constitution.

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:10.339
And yet, America is addicted
to imprisonment.

00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.510
From slavery through mass incarceration,

00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:14.867
it always has been.

00:01:15.704 --> 00:01:18.632
Look, we all know the shocking numbers.

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:21.308
The United States incarcerates
more people per capita

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:24.084
than almost any nation on the planet.

00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:29.148
But what you may not know
is that on any given night in America,

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:33.363
almost half a million people go to sleep
in those concrete jail cells
