00:10:55.865 --> 00:11:00.676
shows that a dollar can be used
two or three times a year,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.013
creating a massive force multiplier.

00:11:03.516 --> 00:11:08.666
So a dollar donated today can be used
to pay bail for up to 15 people

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.699
over the next five years.

00:11:11.483 --> 00:11:16.552
Our strategy also relies on the experience
and the wisdom and the leadership

00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:20.450
of those who have experienced
this injustice firsthand.

00:11:20.474 --> 00:11:22.323
(Applause)

00:11:22.347 --> 00:11:26.378
Each bail project site will be staffed
by a team of bail disrupters.

00:11:26.903 --> 00:11:30.904
These are passionate, dedicated
advocates from local communities,
