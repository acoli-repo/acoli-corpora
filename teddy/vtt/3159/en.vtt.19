00:09:26.957 --> 00:09:30.155
and the Bronx Freedom Fund
intervened and paid his bail.

00:09:30.179 --> 00:09:32.116
Now, reunited with his daughter,

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.948
he was able to fight
his case from outside.

00:09:34.972 --> 00:09:36.275
Look, it took some time --

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:38.363
two years, to be exact --

00:09:38.387 --> 00:09:39.617
but at the end of that,

00:09:39.641 --> 00:09:41.966
his case was dismissed in its entirety.

00:09:42.928 --> 00:09:44.079
For Ramel --

00:09:44.103 --> 00:09:49.340
(Applause)

00:09:49.364 --> 00:09:54.007
For Ramel, the Bronx
Freedom Fund was a lifeline,

00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:56.832
but for countless other Americans
locked in jail cells,

00:09:56.856 --> 00:09:58.924
there is no freedom fund coming.

00:09:59.528 --> 00:10:01.595
It's time to do something about that.
