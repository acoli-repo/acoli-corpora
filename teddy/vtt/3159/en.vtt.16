Over the past 10 years,

00:08:01.608 --> 00:08:05.280
we have been paying bails for low-income
residents of New York City,

00:08:05.304 --> 00:08:09.205
and what we have learned
has exploded our ideas

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:11.043
of why people come back to court

00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:13.755
and how the criminal
legal system itself is operated.

00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:18.413
Turns out money isn't what makes
people come back to court.

00:08:18.437 --> 00:08:21.374
We know this because when
the Bronx Freedom Fund pays bail,

00:08:21.398 --> 00:08:25.567
96 percent of clients
return for every court appearance,

00:08:25.591 --> 00:08:29.179
laying waste to the myth
that it's money that mattered.

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:34.091
It's powerful evidence
that we don't need cash
