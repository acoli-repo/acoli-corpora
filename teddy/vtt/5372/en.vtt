00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.245
What is net zero?

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:08.466
We release 55 gigatons of greenhouse gases
into the air every year.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.976
To stop global warming,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.856
we have to get our greenhouse
gas emissions down to zero.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.736
But for every country
to immediately shut down

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.966
all greenhouse gas-releasing activities

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.051
would be an enormous challenge,

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:22.626
especially since some countries

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.269
have built up an economic head start
with no restrictions.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:30.586
So instead, we can use
an approach called net zero.
