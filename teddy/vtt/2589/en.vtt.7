00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.136
In the US, we spend
7 billion hours a year,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.120
wasted, sitting in traffic.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.720
160 billion dollars in lost productivity,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.976
of course also sitting in traffic,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.936
and one-fifth of all
of our carbon footprint

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.120
is spewed out in the air
by those cars that we're sitting in.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.216
Now, that's only four percent
of our problem though.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.456
Because if you have to own a car

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.920
then that means 96 percent of the time
your car is sitting idle.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.576
And so, up to 30 percent
of our land and our space
