00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.600
by 1915,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.040
there were 50,000
rides per day in Seattle,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.976
45,000 rides per day in Kansas

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.696
and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480
To give you some perspective,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.080
Uber in Los Angeles

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.680
is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ...

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.560
100 years later.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.280
And so these are the trolley guys,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.416
the existing transportation
monopoly at the time.
