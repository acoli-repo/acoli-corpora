Today I wanted to --
well, this morning --

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.920
I want to talk about the future
of human-driven transportation;

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.880
about how we can cut congestion,
pollution and parking

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.960
by getting more people into fewer cars;

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.160
and how we can do it
with the technology that's in our pockets.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.696
And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ...

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.120
not self-driving cars.
