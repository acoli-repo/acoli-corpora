Now, in China everything is supersized,

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.096
and so we're doing 15 million
uberPOOL trips per month,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.176
that's 500,000 per day.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.176
And of course we're seeing
that exponential growth happen.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.296
In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.696
And when I talk to my team,
we don't talk about,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:22.080
"Hey, well, 100,000 people
carpooling every week and we're done."

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.080
How do we get that to a million?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.040
And in China, well,
that could be several million.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.936
And so uberPOOL is a very great
solution for urban carpooling.
