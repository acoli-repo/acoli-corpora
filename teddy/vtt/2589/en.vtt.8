00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.576
And so, up to 30 percent
of our land and our space

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.896
is used storing these hunks of steel.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.856
We even have skyscrapers built for cars.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.800
That's the world we live in today.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.800
Now, cities have been dealing
with this problem for decades.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.055
It's called mass transit.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.616
And even in a city like New York City,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.856
one of the most densely
populated in the world

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.536
and one of the most sophisticated
mass transit systems in the world,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.920
there are still 2.5 million cars
that go over those bridges every day.
