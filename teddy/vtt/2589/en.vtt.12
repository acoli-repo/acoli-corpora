00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.400
And the bright colors
is where we have the most cars.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.016
And once we introduced uberPOOL,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.320
well, you see there's not
as many bright colors.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.336
More people getting around
the city in fewer cars,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.416
taking cars off the road.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.360
It looks like uberPOOL is working.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.680
And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.040
eight months ago.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.600
And since then, we've taken
7.9 million miles off the roads

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.480
and we've taken 1.4 thousand
metric tons of CO2 out of the air.
