00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.856
So the question for us is:

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.120
well, how do we turn

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.136
all of these commuter cars --

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.440
and literally there's
tens of millions of them --

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.160
how do we turn all these
commuter cars into shared cars?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.280
Well, we have something for this that we
recently launched called uberCOMMUTE.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.593
You get up in the morning,
get ready for work, get your coffee,

00:08:20.617 --> 00:08:21.896
go to your car

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.936
and you light up the Uber app,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.456
and all of a sudden,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.200
you become an Uber driver.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.736
And we'll match you up
with one of your neighbors
