Did you notice other people
not finding the app that day?

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.616
Are you going to win people over
for this redesign?

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.696
TK: Well, first I should
probably just say,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.896
well, what we were trying to accomplish.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.816
And I think if you know
a little bit about our history,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.776
it makes a lot more sense.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.016
Which is, when we first got started,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.416
it was just black cars.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.096
It was literally you push a button
and get an S-Class.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.736
And so what we did

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.096
was almost what I would call
an immature version of a luxury brand

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.976
that looked like a badge on a luxury car.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.816
And as we've gone worldwide
