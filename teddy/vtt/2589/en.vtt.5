In other cities,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.080
they required two jitney
drivers for one jitney.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.016
But there was a really
interesting regulation

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.920
which was they had to
put a backseat light --

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.816
install it in every Jitney --

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.776
to stop a new pernicious innovation
which they called spooning.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.016
(Laughter)

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.216
All right. So what happened?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.336
Well, within a year
this thing had taken off.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.200
But the jitney, by 1919, was regulated
completely out of existence.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.080
That's unfortunate ...
