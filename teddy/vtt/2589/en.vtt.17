00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.736
And we'll match you up
with one of your neighbors

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.960
on your way to work

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.360
and it's a really great thing.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.280
There's just one hitch ...

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.000
it's called regulation.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.655
So 54 cents a mile, what is that?

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.736
Well, that is what the US government

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.920
has determined that the cost
of owning a car is per mile.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.696
You can pick up anybody
in the United States

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.296
and take them wherever they want to go
at a moment's notice,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.816
for 54 cents a mile or less.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.160
But if you charge 60 cents a mile,
you're a criminal.
