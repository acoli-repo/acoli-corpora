In 1914 it was created or invented
by a guy named LP Draper.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.135
He was a car salesman from LA,
and he had an idea.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.656
Well, he was cruising around
downtown Los Angeles,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.056
my hometown,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.416
and he saw trolleys

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.080
with long lines of people trying
to get to where they wanted to go.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.696
He said, well, why don't
I just put a sign on my car

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.656
that takes people wherever
they want to go for a jitney --

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.040
that was slang for a nickel.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.680
And so people jumped on board,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.240
and not just in Los Angeles
but across the country.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.896
And within one year,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.600
by 1915,
