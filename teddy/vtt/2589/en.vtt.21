CA: You know -- I mean the company
you've built is absolutely astounding.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.296
You only just talked
about a small part of it here --

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.536
a powerful part --

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.256
the idea of turning cars
into public transport like that,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.496
it's cool.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.336
But I've got a couple other questions

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.776
because I know they're
out there on people's minds.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.136
So first of all, last week I think it was,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.976
I switched on my phone
and tried to book an Uber

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.056
and I couldn't find the app.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.496
You had this very radical,
very bold, brave redesign.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.936
TK: Sure.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.176
CA: How did it go?

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.896
Did you notice other people
not finding the app that day?
