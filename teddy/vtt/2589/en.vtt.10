00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.296
We didn't have any grand ambitions.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.656
But it just turned out

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.576
that lots of people wanted
to push a button and get a ride,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.160
and ultimately what we started to see
was a lot of duplicate rides.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.136
We saw a lot of people

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.176
pushing the same button at the same time

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.656
going essentially to the same place.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.256
And so we started thinking about,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.960
well, how do we make those two trips
and turn them into one.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.176
Because if we did,
that ride would be a lot cheaper --

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.680
up to 50 percent cheaper --
