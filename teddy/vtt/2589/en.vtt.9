00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.920
there are still 2.5 million cars
that go over those bridges every day.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.680
Why is that?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.480
Well, it's because mass transit
hasn't yet figured out

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.960
how to get to everybody's doorstep.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.496
And so back in San Francisco,
where I live,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.856
the situation's much worse,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.480
in fact, much worse around the world.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.456
And so the beginning
of Uber in 2010 was --

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.976
well, we just wanted
to push a button and get a ride.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.296
We didn't have any grand ambitions.
