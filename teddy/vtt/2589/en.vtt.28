00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.296
And I think we learned a lot of lessons

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.496
but I think at the end of it
we came out stronger.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.040
But it was certainly a difficult period.

00:14:08.151 --> 00:14:10.056
CA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.816
you're facing people
who occasionally give you a hard time.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.616
Some Uber drivers
in New York and elsewhere

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.896
are mad as hell now
because you changed the fees

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.800
and they can barely -- they claim --
barely afford the deal anymore.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.216
How --

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.536
You know, you said
that you started this originally --

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.816
just the coolness of pressing a button
and summoning a ride.
