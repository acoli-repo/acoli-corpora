00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.016
to sort of --

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.896
We'd gone from a very small company --

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.016
I mean if you go literally
two and a half years ago,

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.176
our company was 400 people,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.280
and today it's 6,500.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.776
And so when you go through that growth,

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.816
you have to sort of cement
your cultural values

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.640
and talk about them all of the time.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.376
And make sure that people
are constantly checking

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.896
to say, "Are we good people
doing good work?"

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.576
And if you check those boxes,

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.600
the next part of that
is making sure you're telling your story.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.296
And I think we learned a lot of lessons
