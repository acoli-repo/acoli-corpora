They taught me about what a respectful relationship

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
should look like between men and women.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like:

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and an admiration for each other's unique gifts.

They taught me about what it means

but to reach out and help raise kids

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
in the broader community.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
