00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Neither of them attended university.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in the prime of his life.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But even as it got harder for him to walk

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and get dressed in the morning --

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I saw him struggle more and more --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
my father never complained about his struggle.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
He was grateful for what he had.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need:

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
love, strong values
