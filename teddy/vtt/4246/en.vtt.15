00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000

And this school, named after the U.K.'s first female doctor,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo,

Mary Seacole,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the Jamaican nurse known as the "black Florence Nightingale,"

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to pursue their passions to feed their own souls.
