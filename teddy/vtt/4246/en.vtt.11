00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And sometimes we settle for the world as it is,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But Barack reminded us on that day,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
all of us in that room, that we all know

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
what our world should look like.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We all know.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And he urged the people in that meeting,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
in that community,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
to devote themselves to closing the gap

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
between those two ideas,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to work together to try to make the world as it is
