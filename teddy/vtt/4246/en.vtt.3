00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
There is nothing in my story that would land me here.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I wasn't raised with wealth or resources

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
or any social standing to speak of.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I was raised on the South Side of Chicago.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
That's the real part of Chicago.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And I was the product of a working-class community.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
My father was a city worker all of his life,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and my mother was a stay-at-home mom.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Neither of them attended university.
