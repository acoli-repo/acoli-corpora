He worked, helping people to find jobs

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
As he talked to the residents in that community center,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
he talked about two concepts.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
He talked about "the world as it is" and "the world as it should be."

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
What he said, that all too often,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
is that we accept the distance between those two ideas.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And sometimes we settle for the world as it is,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations.
