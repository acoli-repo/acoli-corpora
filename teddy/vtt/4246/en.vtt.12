to work together to try to make the world as it is

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and the world as it should be, one and the same.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I think about that today because I am

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
reminded and convinced that all of you in this school

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
are very important parts of closing that gap.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
You are the women who will build the world as it should be.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
You're going to write the next chapter in history.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Not just for yourselves, but for your generation

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and generations to come.
