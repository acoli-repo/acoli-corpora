and generations to come.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And that's why getting a good education

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
is so important.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
That's why all of this that you're going through --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
the ups and the downs, the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
why it's so important.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Because communities and countries and ultimately the world

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
are only as strong as the health of their women.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And that's important to keep in mind.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Part of that health includes an outstanding education.
