00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
grandmothers, teachers, aunts, cousins, neighbors,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
who taught me about quiet strength and dignity.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And my mother, the most important role model in my life,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
who lives with us at the White House

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and helps to care for our two little daughters,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Malia and Sasha.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
She's an active presence in their lives, as well as mine,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and is instilling in them

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the same values that she taught me and my brother:

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
things like compassion, and integrity,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and confidence, and perseverance --
