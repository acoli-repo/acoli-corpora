00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.486
Most physicists of the time
would have scoffed at the idea

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:35.015
that this minor civil servant
could have much to contribute to science.

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:36.809
Yet within the following year,

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.933
Einstein would publish not one,

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.251
not two,

00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:41.420
not three,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.577
but four extraordinary papers,
each on a different topic,

00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:51.159
that were destined to radically transform
our understanding of the universe.

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.740
The myth that Einstein
had failed math is just that.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.097
He had mastered calculus on his own
by the age of 15

00:00:58.097 --> 00:01:00.672
and done well at both
his Munich secondary school
