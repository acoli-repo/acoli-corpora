00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:32.110
regardless of reference frame,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.381
while both time and space
were relative to the observer.

00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:39.434
It took Einstein only a few weeks
to work out the details

00:03:39.434 --> 00:03:43.614
and formulate what came to be known
as special relativity.

00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:46.821
The theory not only shattered
our previous understanding of reality

00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:49.189
but would also pave the way
for technologies,

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.186
ranging from particle accelerators,

00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:53.752
to the global positioning system.

00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:55.587
One might think that this was enough,

00:03:55.587 --> 00:03:56.593
but in September,

00:03:56.593 --> 00:04:02.071
a fourth paper arrived as a "by the way"
follow-up to the special relativity paper.
