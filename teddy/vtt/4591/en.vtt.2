00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.309
where he studied for
a math and physics teaching diploma.

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:09.247
But skipping classes to spend
more time in the lab

00:01:09.247 --> 00:01:12.232
and neglecting to show proper deference
to his professors

00:01:12.232 --> 00:01:15.643

Passed over even

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.539
obtained with the help

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.592
Working six days a week as a patent clerk,

00:01:26.592 --> 00:01:29.832
Einstein still managed to make
some time for physics,
