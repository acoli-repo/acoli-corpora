00:02:29.028 --> 00:02:31.270
showing that the behavior
of small particles

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.372
randomly moving around in a liquid,
known as Brownian motion,

00:02:35.372 --> 00:02:37.085
could be precisely predicted

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:40.424
by the collisions of millions
of invisible atoms.

00:02:40.424 --> 00:02:43.331
Experiments soon confirmed
Einstein's model,

00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:47.009
and atomic skeptics threw in the towel.

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:49.942
The third paper came in June.

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:51.012
For a long time,

00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:53.461
Einstein had been troubled
by an inconsistency

00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:56.299
between two fundamental
principles of physics.

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.637
The well established
principle of relativity,

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.655
going all the way back to Galileo,
