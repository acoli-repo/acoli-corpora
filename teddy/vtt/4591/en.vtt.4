00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:01.997
but Einstein was simply
twenty years ahead of his time.

00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:07.811
Wave-particle duality was slated to become
a cornerstone of the quantum revolution.

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:11.050
Two months later in May,
Einstein submitted a second paper,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.528
this time tackling the centuries old
question of whether atoms actually exist.

00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:19.866
Though certain theories were built on
the idea of invisible atoms,

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:24.393
some prominent scientists still
believed them to be a useful fiction,

00:02:24.393 --> 00:02:26.901
rather than actual physical objects.

00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.028
But Einstein used an ingenious argument,

00:02:29.028 --> 00:02:31.270
showing that the behavior
of small particles
