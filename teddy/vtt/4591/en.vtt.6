00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.655
going all the way back to Galileo,

00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:04.178
stated that absolute motion
could not be defined.

00:03:04.178 --> 00:03:07.357
Yet electromagnetic theory,
also well established,

00:03:07.357 --> 00:03:10.181
asserted that absolute motion did exist.

00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.322
The discrepancy,
and his inability to resolve it,

00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:17.635
left Einstein in what he described
as a state of psychic tension.

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:18.715
But one day in May,

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:21.838
after he had mulled over the puzzle
with his friend Michele Besso,

00:03:21.838 --> 00:03:24.016
the clouds parted.

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:26.871
Einstein realized
that the contradiction could be resolved

00:03:26.871 --> 00:03:29.861
if it was the speed of light
that remained constant,

00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:32.110
regardless of reference frame,
