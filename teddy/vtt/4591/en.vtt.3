discussing the latest work
with a few close friends,

00:01:33.074 --> 00:01:35.638
and publishing a couple of minor papers.

00:01:35.638 --> 00:01:37.149
It came as a major surprise

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.737
when in March 1905 he submitted
a paper with a shocking hypothesis.

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:45.469
Despite decades of evidence
that light was a wave,

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.132
Einstein proposed that it could,
in fact, be a particle,

00:01:49.132 --> 00:01:53.049
showing that mysterious phenomena,
such as the photoelectric effect,

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.097
could be explained by his hypothesis.

00:01:56.097 --> 00:01:58.341
The idea was derided for years to come,

00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:01.997
but Einstein was simply
twenty years ahead of his time.
