00:03:56.593 --> 00:04:02.071
a fourth paper arrived as a "by the way"
follow-up to the special relativity paper.

00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:04.931
Einstein had thought a little bit more
about his theory,

00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:08.694
and realized it also implied
that mass and energy,

00:04:08.694 --> 00:04:12.479
one apparently solid
and the other supposedly ethereal,

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.059
were actually equivalent.

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:18.928
And their relationship could be expressed
in what was to become the most famous

00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:21.831
and consequential equation in history:

00:04:21.831 --> 00:04:25.304
E=mc^2.

00:04:25.304 --> 00:04:29.947
Einstein would not become a world famous
icon for nearly another fifteen years.

00:04:29.947 --> 00:04:34.795
It was only after his later general theory
of relativity was confirmed in 1919
