00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:04.625
One of the most evident remnants
of colonialism on the African continent

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:08.212
are laws that are used to persecute people
for the sexual orientation,

00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:10.757
gender identity and gender expression.

00:00:10.798 --> 00:00:13.426
I want to tell you about some
sections of the penal code

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:15.094
from my home country, Kenya.

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:18.639
Section 162 (a)
and (c) of the penal code

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:22.268
say that it is a felony for any person
to have carnal knowledge

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.896
of any other person
against the order of nature,

00:00:24.937 --> 00:00:28.608
or to permit a male person
to have carnal knowledge of him or her

00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:29.984
against the order of nature.
