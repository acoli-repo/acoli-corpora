It's a video I recorded
about three years ago.

00:03:30.892 --> 00:03:34.100
And as new parents, we all want
to make sure our babies are healthy,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.642
that they're breathing,
that they're alive, of course.

00:03:36.642 --> 00:03:38.784
So I too got one of those baby monitors

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:41.253
so that I could see my daughter
when she was asleep.

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:44.780
And this is pretty much what you'll see
with a standard baby monitor.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.462
You can see the baby's sleeping, but 
there's not too much information there.

00:03:48.474 --> 00:03:50.078
There's not too much we can see.

00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:52.902
Wouldn't it be better,
or more informative, or more useful,

00:03:52.902 --> 00:03:55.892
if instead we could look
at the view like this.

00:03:55.892 --> 00:04:02.248
So here I took the motions
and I magnified them 30 times,
