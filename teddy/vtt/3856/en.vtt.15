00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:30.053
But it turns out that sound
also produces visual motions.

00:07:30.053 --> 00:07:32.886
Those are motions
that are not visible to us

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:35.887
but are visible to a camera
with the right processing.

00:07:35.887 --> 00:07:37.460
So here are two examples.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.074
This is me demonstrating
my great singing skills.

00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:42.698
(Singing)

00:07:42.698 --> 00:07:44.134
(Laughter)

00:07:44.134 --> 00:07:47.120
And I took a high-speed video
of my throat while I was humming.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.884
Again, if you stare at that video,

00:07:48.884 --> 00:07:50.960
there's not too much
you'll be able to see,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.292
but once we magnify the motions 100 times,
we can see all the motions and ripples

00:07:55.292 --> 00:07:58.566
in the neck that are involved
in producing the sound.

00:07:58.566 --> 00:08:01.306
That signal is there in that video.
