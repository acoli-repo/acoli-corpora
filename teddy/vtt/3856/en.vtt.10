00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:03.193
that can help engineers detect
and diagnose machinery problems,

00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:07.931
or see how our buildings and structures
sway in the wind and react to forces.

00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:12.512
Those are all things that our society
knows how to measure in various ways,

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:14.965
but measuring those motions is one thing,

00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:17.241
and actually seeing those
motions as they happen

00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:19.795
is a whole different thing.

00:05:19.795 --> 00:05:22.836
And ever since we discovered
this new technology,

00:05:22.836 --> 00:05:26.789
we made our code available online so that 
others could use and experiment with it.

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.664
It's very simple to use.

00:05:28.664 --> 00:05:30.708
It can work on your own videos.
