00:03:55.892 --> 00:04:02.248
So here I took the motions
and I magnified them 30 times,

00:04:02.248 --> 00:04:06.074
and then I could clearly see that my
daughter was indeed alive and breathing.

00:04:06.074 --> 00:04:08.327
(Laughter)

00:04:08.327 --> 00:04:10.249
Here is a side-by-side comparison.

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.732
So again, in the source video,
in the original video,

00:04:12.732 --> 00:04:14.368
there's not too much we can see,

00:04:14.368 --> 00:04:18.075
but once we magnify the motions,
the breathing becomes much more visible.

00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:20.145
And it turns out, there's
a lot of phenomena

00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:23.768
we can reveal and magnify
with our new motion microscope.

00:04:23.768 --> 00:04:28.332
We can see how our veins and arteries
are pulsing in our bodies.

00:04:28.332 --> 00:04:30.960
We can see that our eyes
are constantly moving
