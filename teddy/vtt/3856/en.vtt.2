00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.925
when you look at the person
sitting next to you,

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:05.500
you don't see their skin
or their face changing color.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.860
When we look at this video of Steve here,
it appears to us like a static picture,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.720
but once we look at this video
through our new, special microscope,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.320
suddenly we see
a completely different image.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.250
What you see here are small changes
in the color of Steve's skin,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.686
magnified 100 times
so that they become visible.

00:01:24.686 --> 00:01:27.953
We can actually see a human pulse.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:31.180
We can see how fast
Steve's heart is beating,
