00:08:59.623 --> 00:09:02.419
So here's the sound
that we played in the room.

00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:06.853
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:13.032
And this is a high-speed video
we recorded of that bag of chips.

00:09:13.032 --> 00:09:14.306
Again it's playing.

00:09:14.306 --> 00:09:17.648
There's no chance you'll be able
to see anything going on in that video

00:09:17.648 --> 00:09:18.706
just by looking at it,

00:09:18.706 --> 00:09:21.690
but here's the sound we were able
to recover just by analyzing

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.873
the tiny motions in that video.

00:09:23.873 --> 00:09:26.682
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
