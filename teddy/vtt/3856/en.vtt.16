00:07:58.566 --> 00:08:01.306
That signal is there in that video.

00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:03.976
We also know that singers
can break a wine glass

00:08:03.976 --> 00:08:05.439
if they hit the correct note.

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:07.204
So here, we're going to play a note

00:08:07.204 --> 00:08:09.730
that's in the resonance
frequency of that glass

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.778
through a loudspeaker that's next to it.

00:08:11.778 --> 00:08:16.197
Once we play that note
and magnify the motions 250 times,

00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:18.535
we can very clearly see 
how the glass vibrates

00:08:18.535 --> 00:08:22.105
and resonates in response to the sound.

00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:24.525
It's not something you're used
to seeing every day.

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:28.054
But this made us think.
It gave us this crazy idea.

00:08:28.054 --> 00:08:33.662
Can we actually invert this process
and recover sound from video
