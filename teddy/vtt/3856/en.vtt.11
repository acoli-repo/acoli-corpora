It can work on your own videos.

00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:33.901
Our collaborators at Quanta Research
even created this nice website

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:36.579
where you can upload your videos
and process them online,

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:40.395
so even if you don't have any experience
in computer science or programming,

00:05:40.395 --> 00:05:43.331
you can still very easily experiment
with this new microscope.

00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:45.735
And I'd like to show you
just a couple of examples

00:05:45.735 --> 00:05:48.470
of what others have done with it.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.787
So this video was made by
a YouTube user called Tamez85.

00:05:53.787 --> 00:05:55.250
I don't know who that user is,

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.595
but he, or she, used our code

00:05:57.595 --> 00:06:01.310
to magnify small belly
movements during pregnancy.
