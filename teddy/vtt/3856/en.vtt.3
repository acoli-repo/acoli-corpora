00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:31.180
We can see how fast
Steve's heart is beating,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.535
but we can also see the actual way
that the blood flows in his face.

00:01:36.544 --> 00:01:39.175
And we can do that not just
to visualize the pulse,

00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:42.646
but also to actually 
recover our heart rates,

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:44.439
and measure our heart rates.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.892
And we can do it with regular cameras
and without touching the patients.

00:01:48.892 --> 00:01:54.509
So here you see the pulse and heart rate
we extracted from a neonatal baby

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.390
from a video we took
with a regular DSLR camera,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.206
and the heart rate measurement we get

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:04.017
is as accurate as the one you'd get
with a standard monitor in a hospital.
