00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:00.179
and then the way the color
changes over time,

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.872
and then we amplify those changes.

00:03:02.872 --> 00:03:06.852
We make them bigger to create those types
of enhanced videos, or magnified videos,

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:09.024
that actually show us those changes.

00:03:09.024 --> 00:03:13.262
But it turns out we can do that
not just to show tiny changes in color,

00:03:13.262 --> 00:03:15.503
but also tiny motions,

00:03:15.503 --> 00:03:19.079
and that's because the light
that gets recorded in our cameras

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.889
will change not only if the color
of the object changes,

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.257
but also if the object moves.

00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:27.893
So this is my daughter
when she was about two months old.

00:03:27.893 --> 00:03:30.892
It's a video I recorded
about three years ago.
