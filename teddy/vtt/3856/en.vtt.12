00:05:57.595 --> 00:06:01.310
to magnify small belly
movements during pregnancy.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.912
It's kind of creepy.

00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:04.525
(Laughter)

00:06:04.525 --> 00:06:09.486
People have used it to magnify
pulsing veins in their hands.

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:13.268
And you know it's not real science
unless you use guinea pigs,

00:06:13.268 --> 00:06:16.658
and apparently this guinea pig
is called Tiffany,

00:06:16.658 --> 00:06:19.607
and this YouTube user claims
it is the first rodent on Earth

00:06:19.607 --> 00:06:22.295
that was motion-magnified.

00:06:22.295 --> 00:06:24.483
You can also do some art with it.

00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:27.501
So this video was sent to me
by a design student at Yale.

00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:29.638
She wanted to see
if there's any difference

00:06:29.638 --> 00:06:31.160
in the way her classmates move.
