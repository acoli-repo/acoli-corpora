00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:30.925
Maybe in the future, we'll be able
to use it, for example,

00:12:30.925 --> 00:12:33.177
to recover sound across space,

00:12:33.177 --> 00:12:36.753
because sound can't travel
in space, but light can.

00:12:36.753 --> 00:12:39.157
We've only just begun exploring

00:12:39.157 --> 00:12:42.176
other possible uses
for this new technology.

00:12:42.176 --> 00:12:45.008
It lets us see physical processes
that we know are there

00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:48.564
but that we've never been able
to see with our own eyes until now.

00:12:48.564 --> 00:12:49.768
This is our team.

00:12:49.768 --> 00:12:52.647
Everything I showed you today
is a result of a collaboration

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.838
with this great group
of people you see here,

00:12:54.838 --> 00:12:58.005
and I encourage you and welcome you
to check out our website,

00:12:58.005 --> 00:12:59.451
try it out yourself,

00:12:59.451 --> 00:13:02.423
and join us in exploring
this world of tiny motions.
