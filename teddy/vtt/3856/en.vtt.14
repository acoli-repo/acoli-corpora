00:06:59.845 --> 00:07:03.026
and pushes the limits of what
we can do with our cameras.

00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:05.255
So as scientists, we started wondering,

00:07:05.255 --> 00:07:09.040
what other types of physical phenomena
produce tiny motions

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.943
that we could now use
our cameras to measure?

00:07:11.943 --> 00:07:15.944
And one such phenomenon
that we focused on recently is sound.

00:07:15.944 --> 00:07:18.049
Sound, as we all know,
is basically changes

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:20.232
in air pressure that
travel through the air.

00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:23.853
Those pressure waves hit objects
and they create small vibrations in them,

00:07:23.853 --> 00:07:26.385
which is how we hear
and how we record sound.

00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:30.053
But it turns out that sound
also produces visual motions.
