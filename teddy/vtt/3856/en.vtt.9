00:04:28.332 --> 00:04:30.960
We can see that our eyes
are constantly moving

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.847
in this wobbly motion.

00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:34.356
And that's actually my eye,

00:04:34.356 --> 00:04:37.421
and again this video was taken
right after my daughter was born,

00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:41.623
so you can see I wasn't getting
too much sleep. (Laughter)

00:04:41.623 --> 00:04:44.339
Even when a person is sitting still,

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:46.383
there's a lot of information
we can extract

00:04:46.383 --> 00:04:49.912
about their breathing patterns,
small facial expressions.

00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:51.537
Maybe we could use those motions

00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:54.691
to tell us something about
our thoughts or our emotions.

00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:57.946
We can also magnify small
mechanical movements,

00:04:57.946 --> 00:04:59.501
like vibrations in engines,

00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:03.193
that can help engineers detect
and diagnose machinery problems,
