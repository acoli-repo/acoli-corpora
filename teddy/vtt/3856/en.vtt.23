00:11:29.859 --> 00:11:33.528
and everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

00:11:33.528 --> 00:11:36.268
Testing, testing, one two three.

00:11:36.268 --> 00:11:40.424
Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:11:40.424 --> 00:11:45.648
and everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

00:11:45.648 --> 00:11:49.665
MR: And now, 137 years later,

00:11:49.665 --> 00:11:53.752
we're able to get sound
in pretty much similar quality

00:11:53.752 --> 00:11:57.831
but by just watching objects
vibrate to sound with cameras,

00:11:57.831 --> 00:11:59.765
and we can even do that when the camera

00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:03.999
is 15 feet away from the object,
behind soundproof glass.
