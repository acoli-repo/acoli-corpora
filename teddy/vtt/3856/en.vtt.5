00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:32.844
We basically analyze the changes
in the light that are recorded

00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:35.115
at every pixel in the video over time,

00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:36.913
and then we crank up those changes.

00:02:36.913 --> 00:02:39.075
We make them bigger
so that we can see them.

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:40.977
The tricky part is that those signals,

00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:43.910
those changes that we're after,
are extremely subtle,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.689
so we have to be very careful
when you try to separate them

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.520
from noise that always exists in videos.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.515
So we use some clever
image processing techniques

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:57.509
to get a very accurate measurement
of the color at each pixel in the video,

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:00.179
and then the way the color
changes over time,
