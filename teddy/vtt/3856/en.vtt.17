00:08:28.054 --> 00:08:33.662
Can we actually invert this process
and recover sound from video

00:08:33.662 --> 00:08:37.697
by analyzing the tiny vibrations
that sound waves create in objects,

00:08:37.697 --> 00:08:42.474
and essentially convert those
back into the sounds that produced them.

00:08:42.474 --> 00:08:46.931
In this way, we can turn
everyday objects into microphones.

00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:49.163
So that's exactly what we did.

00:08:49.163 --> 00:08:51.979
So here's an empty bag of chips
that was lying on a table,

00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:54.804
and we're going to turn that 
bag of chips into a microphone

00:08:54.804 --> 00:08:56.395
by filming it with a video camera

00:08:56.395 --> 00:08:59.623
and analyzing the tiny motions
that sound waves create in it.

00:08:59.623 --> 00:09:02.419
So here's the sound
that we played in the room.
