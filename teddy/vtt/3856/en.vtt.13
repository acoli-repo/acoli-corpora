00:06:29.638 --> 00:06:31.160
in the way her classmates move.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.369
She made them all stand still,
and then magnified their motions.

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:38.747
It's like seeing 
still pictures come to life.

00:06:38.747 --> 00:06:41.180
And the nice thing with 
all those examples

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.476
is that we had nothing to do with them.

00:06:43.476 --> 00:06:47.330
We just provided this new tool,
a new way to look at the world,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.462
and then people find other interesting,
new and creative ways of using it.

00:06:52.462 --> 00:06:54.226
But we didn't stop there.

00:06:54.226 --> 00:06:57.477
This tool not only allows us
to look at the world in a new way,

00:06:57.477 --> 00:06:59.845
it also redefines what we can do

00:06:59.845 --> 00:07:03.026
and pushes the limits of what
we can do with our cameras.
