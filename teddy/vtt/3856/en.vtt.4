00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:04.017
is as accurate as the one you'd get
with a standard monitor in a hospital.

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:06.659
And it doesn't even have to be
a video we recorded.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.654
We can do it essentially
with other videos as well.

00:02:09.654 --> 00:02:13.555
So I just took a short clip
from "Batman Begins" here

00:02:13.555 --> 00:02:15.459
just to show Christian Bale's pulse.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.281
(Laughter)

00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:19.404
And you know, presumably
he's wearing makeup,

00:02:19.404 --> 00:02:21.357
the lighting here is kind of challenging,

00:02:21.357 --> 00:02:24.308
but still, just from the video,
we're able to extract his pulse

00:02:24.308 --> 00:02:26.326
and show it quite well.

00:02:26.326 --> 00:02:28.246
So how do we do all that?

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:32.844
We basically analyze the changes
in the light that are recorded
