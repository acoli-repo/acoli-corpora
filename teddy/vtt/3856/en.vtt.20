a pretty loud sound will cause that bag

00:10:04.135 --> 00:10:06.874
That's one thousandth of a millimeter.

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:10.435
That's how tiny the motions are
that we are now able to pull out

00:10:10.435 --> 00:10:13.678
just by observing how light
bounces off objects

00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:15.814
and gets recorded by our cameras.

00:10:15.814 --> 00:10:19.064
We can recover sounds
from other objects, like plants.

So here's a person speaking in a room.
