00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:42.471
I call it -- Thank you.

00:09:42.471 --> 00:09:47.696
(Applause)

00:09:49.878 --> 00:09:52.223
I call it the visual microphone.

00:09:52.223 --> 00:09:55.613
We actually extract audio signals
from video signals.

00:09:55.613 --> 00:09:58.794
And just to give you a sense
of the scale of the motions here,

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:04.135
a pretty loud sound will cause that bag
of chips to move less than a micrometer.
