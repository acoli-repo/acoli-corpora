00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:30.220
to the rhythm of your beating heart,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.884
exerting its influence over each 
and every one of your cells.

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:37.143
The endocrine system relies 
on interactions

00:00:37.143 --> 00:00:39.692
between three features to do its job:

00:00:39.692 --> 00:00:40.615
glands,

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:41.520
hormones,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.294
and trillions of cell receptors.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:47.444
Firstly, there are several
hormone-producing glands:

00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:48.815
three in your brain,

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.161
and seven in the rest of your body.

00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:54.033
Each is surrounded by 
a network of blood vessels,

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:58.452
from which they extract ingredients 
to manufacture dozens of hormones.

00:00:58.452 --> 00:01:01.736
Those hormones are then
pumped out in tiny amounts,
