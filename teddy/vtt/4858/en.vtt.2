00:00:58.452 --> 00:01:01.736
Those hormones are then
pumped out in tiny amounts,

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:04.031
usually into the bloodstream.

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:08.151
From there, each hormone needs 
to locate a set of target cells

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.889
in order to bring about a specific change.

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:14.681
To find its targets, 
it’s helped along by receptors,

00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:18.934
which are special proteins inside 
or on the cell’s surface.

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:22.948
Those receptors recognise
specific hormones as they waft by,

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:24.697
and bind to them.

00:01:24.697 --> 00:01:25.807
When this happens,

00:01:25.807 --> 00:01:29.681
that hormone-receptor combination 
triggers a range of effects

00:01:29.681 --> 00:01:34.222
that either increase or decrease 
specific processes inside the cell
