They’re frequently viewed as the main 
drivers of our behavior,

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:35.321
making us slaves to their effects,
especially during puberty.

00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.858
But research shows that our behavior 
is collectively shaped

00:03:38.858 --> 00:03:40.947
by a variety of influences,

00:03:40.947 --> 00:03:43.218
including the brain 
and its neurotransmitters,

00:03:43.218 --> 00:03:44.261
our hormones,

00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:46.625
and various social factors.

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.931
The primary function 
of the endocrine system

00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:53.252
is to regulate our bodily processes, 
not control us.

00:03:53.252 --> 00:03:54.443
Sometimes disease,

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:55.184
stress,

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:58.955
and even diet can disrupt 
that regulatory function, however,

00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:01.766
altering the quantity of hormones 
that glands secrete
