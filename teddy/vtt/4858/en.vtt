00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:08.569
Over the course of our lifetimes,

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:12.449
our bodies undergo a series 
of extraordinary metamorphoses:

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:13.393
we grow,

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:14.661
experience puberty,

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:16.485
and many of us reproduce.

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:17.778
Behind the scenes,

00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:22.231
the endocrine system works 
constantly to orchestrate these changes.

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:24.853
Alongside growth and sexual maturity,

00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:27.838
this system regulates everything 
from your sleep

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:30.220
to the rhythm of your beating heart,
