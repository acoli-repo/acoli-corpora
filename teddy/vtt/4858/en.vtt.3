00:01:29.681 --> 00:01:34.222
that either increase or decrease 
specific processes inside the cell

00:01:34.222 --> 00:01:36.840
to change the way that cell behaves.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.739
By exposing millions of cells at a time

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:42.462
to hormones
in carefully-regulated quantities,

00:01:42.462 --> 00:01:47.022
the endocrine system drives 
large-scale changes across the body.

00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:51.434
Take, for instance, the thyroid 
and the two hormones it produces,

00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:54.807
triiodothyronine and thyroxine.

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:57.805
These hormones travel to most 
of the body’s cells,

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:01.179
where they influence how quickly 
those cells use energy
