00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:01.179
where they influence how quickly 
those cells use energy

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.195
and how rapidly they work.

00:02:03.195 --> 00:02:06.166
In turn, that regulates everything 
from breathing rate

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:07.271
to heartbeat,

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:08.389
body temperature,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.992
and digestion.

00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:14.387
Hormones also have some of their most
visible—and familiar—effects

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:16.070
during puberty.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.443
In men, puberty begins when 
the testes start secreting testosterone.

00:02:20.443 --> 00:02:23.602
That triggers the gradual development 
of the sexual organs,

00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:25.241
makes facial hair sprout,

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:27.693
and causes the voice to deepen

00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:29.910
and height to increase.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.643
In women, estrogen secreted from the
ovaries signals the start of adulthood.
