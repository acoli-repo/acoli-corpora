00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
they're shopping with their helmets.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
(Laughter)

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Well yeah, I tried that.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Now it's a little extreme, I admit.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But if you think about this,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
this is actually -- the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that more people die on a per mile basis

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
from drunk walking

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
than from drunk driving.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So something to think about tonight

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
if you've had a couple.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So I finished,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and it was a success in a sense.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
All of the markers went in the right direction.
