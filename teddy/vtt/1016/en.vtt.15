food.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The junk food industry

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
is really great

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
at pressing our pleasure buttons

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and figuring out what's the most pleasurable.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But I think we can use their techniques

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and apply them to healthy food.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
To give just one example,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
we love crunchiness, mouthfeel.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
into a lot of my recipes --

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
throw in some sunflower seeds.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And you can almost trick yourself

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
into thinking you're eating Doritos.
