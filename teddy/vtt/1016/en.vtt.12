00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And this, over the years,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
The World Health Organization just did a big study

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that they published this year.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And it was done in Europe.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And they estimated

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that 1.6 million years of healthy living

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
are lost every year in Europe

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
because of noise pollution.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So they think it's actually very deadly.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And by the way,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
it's also terrible for your brain.
