00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
(Laughter)

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It was so overwhelming,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
because the amount of things you have to do,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
it's just mind-boggling.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I was listening to all the experts

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And they were telling me

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
all the things I had to do.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I had to eat right,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
exercise, meditate, pet dogs,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
because that lowers the blood pressure.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I wrote the book on a treadmill,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and it took me about a thousand miles

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to write the book.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I had to put on sunscreen.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This was no small feat,
