00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
All of the markers went in the right direction.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
My cholesterol went down, I lost weight,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So that was nice.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And it was successful overall.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
But I also learned that I was too healthy,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and that was unhealthy.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I was so focused on doing all these things

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that I was neglecting my friends and family.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And as Dan Buettner can tell you,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
having a strong social network

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is so crucial to our health.
