00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I've spent the last decade

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
subjecting myself to pain and humiliation,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
hopefully for a good cause,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is self-improvement.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I've done this in three parts.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So first I started with the mind.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And I decided to try to get smarter

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
from A to Z --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And here's a little image of that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And this was an amazing year.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It was really a fascinating journey.
