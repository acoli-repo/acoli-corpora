00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And I finally have stabilized.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So now I'm back

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
to adopting many -- not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
but dozens of healthy behaviors

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that I adopted during my year.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
It was really a life-changing project.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Let me just tell you two really quickly.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
The first is -- and this was surprising to me;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I didn't expect this to come out --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but I live a much quieter life now.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Because we live in such a noisy world.
