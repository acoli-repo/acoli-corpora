00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
(Laughter)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Not really.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
by actually diving in

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and trying to live it and immerse myself in it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And from the Ten Commandments

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to growing my beard --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because Leviticus says you cannot shave.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So this is what I looked like by the end.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Thank you for that reaction.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
(Laughter)

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.
