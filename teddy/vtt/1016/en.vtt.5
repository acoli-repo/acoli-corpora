00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I had to put on sunscreen.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This was no small feat,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
because if you listen to dermatologists,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So I think half of my book advance

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
went into sunscreen.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I was like a glazed doughnut

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
for most of the year.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
There was the washing of hands.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I had to do that properly.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And my immunologist told me

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that I should also wipe down

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because those are just orgies of germs.
