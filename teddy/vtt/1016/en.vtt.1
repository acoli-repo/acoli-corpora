00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And this was an amazing year.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It was really a fascinating journey.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It was painful at times,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
especially for those around me.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
My wife started to fine me one dollar

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So it had its downsides.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But after that,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I decided to work on the spirit.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
As I mentioned last year,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I grew up with no religion at all.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm Jewish,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
(Laughter)
