00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because those are just orgies of germs.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So that took a lot of time.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I also tried to be the safest person I could be,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
because that's a part of health.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I was inspired

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
by the Danish Safety Council.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
They started a public campaign

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet."

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
but also for walking around.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And you can see there

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
they're shopping with their helmets.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
