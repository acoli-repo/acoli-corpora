00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.920
I didn't feel confident at all.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.736
I didn't have the tools.
I lacked the experience.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.720
I didn't know what to do,
but I wanted to do something.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.816
I left the wake.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.096
I hugged a few tradie mates and said,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.056
"Please come and see me if you need to."

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.856
But I didn't know what to say
to them or what to tell them.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.096
I had no idea.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.696
I got a phone call two weeks later
from Catherine Pilgrim, my cofounder,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.896
wanting to do something for the family.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.536
We talked for a while and I said,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.896
let's do something
for the tradie community.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.096
We love our town, we're grateful,
