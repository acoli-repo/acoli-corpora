00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.216
but those tradies I know
still have those bags in their Ute

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.656
or in their shed.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.736
On November 10, 2013,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.296
we had our event,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.696
and interestingly enough, when I talk
about a whole of community approach,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.776
that was our first event
in Castlemaine at Tonks Brothers,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.016
and there's a whole of community there.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.296
There's counselors,

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.736
there's people who have
gone through mental health.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.480
That first event set the scene.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.936
Since then, we've had more events.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.296
Interestingly enough,
it's not only tradies

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.976
that are affected by mental health
or anxiety or depression or suicide.
