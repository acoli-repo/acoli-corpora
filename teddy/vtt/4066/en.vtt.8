00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.296
I thought, where is the perfect place
we can get the tradies together

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.216
where they feel socially included

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.736
and they feel comfortable

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.216
and they can share, they can open up
and talk about mental health

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.576
in the building industry?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.480
Where can we have an event?

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.136
A hardware store.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.376
(Laughter)

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.336
Yeah, that's what I thought too.
I thought it was very clever.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.336
More precisely, the timber yard
of a hardware store.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.216
So there we were. OK, we've got the venue.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.656
What else do we need?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.800
What else do tradies love?

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.096
Food.
