00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.696
nothing, not a single cent.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.096
We had conversations.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.536
This is a community issue.
It starts in community.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.416
So we went around to the butcher,
we went around to the baker,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.336
there was no candlestick maker,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.816
there was an egg place
and there was some chocolate,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.496
there was coffee, there was fruit,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.896
but we went around and said,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.111
"Hey, we're doing
this awareness-raising event.

00:05:20.135 --> 00:05:23.176
Do you want to contribute?
Because we haven't got any money."

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.896
Of course, nearly every person
we initiated the conversation with

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.216
knew someone that had anxiety,
depression or thoughts of suicide
