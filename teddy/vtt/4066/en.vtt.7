00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.096
We love our town, we're grateful,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.216
let's do something
for the tradie community.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.496
So we talked a bit more.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.776
What could we do?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.280
An awareness-raising event. Awesome.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.736
We're talking about tradies.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.656
How do you get tradies somewhere?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.696
Can you get them to a hospital? No.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.616
To a community health center? No.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.480
There's an ingrained culture
of being a tradie.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.296
I thought, where is the perfect place
we can get the tradies together
