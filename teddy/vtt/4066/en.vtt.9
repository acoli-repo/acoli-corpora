Food.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.096
I know, we all do, but tradies love food.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.576
Tradies especially,
and I'm a tradie myself,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.120
we love egg and bacon rolls.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.456
So we thought we'd supply
the tradies with egg and bacon rolls,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.696
and there was the slogan:

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.960
save your bacon.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.616
It's a bit corny, but it sort of works.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.560
And we also came up with a logo.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.376
"Hope Assistance Local Tradies."

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.480
Keep in mind, "HALT," our charity,
had no money to begin,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.696
nothing, not a single cent.
