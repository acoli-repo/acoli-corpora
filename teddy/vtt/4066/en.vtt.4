The essence of the conversations
was contained in two words

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.920
that I heard several times:

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.600
Who's next?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.760
Who's next?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.336
That was the epiphany.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.256
That was the moment
where I was standing in a community hall

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.056
in a place where
this Castlemaine community

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.216
had given me such support for 20 years,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.176
this community had backed my work,
I'd played footy there,
