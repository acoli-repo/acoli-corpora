00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.176
this community had backed my work,
I'd played footy there,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.576
I'd done theater there,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.176
I was so grateful
for what they'd given me.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.936
But I was standing there in that space,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.456
and I was looking around
that hall as well,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.176
and I could tell people in that hall

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.176
who were struggling with alcohol,
drugs, finance, gambling,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.776
domestic abuse, bullying and harassment.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.256
Yet because of my tradie culture

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.616
and that ignorant attitude
that we have in the tradie community,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.920
I didn't feel confident at all.
