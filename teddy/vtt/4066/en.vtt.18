00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.976
It's one of thing to tell a tradie
or someone at one of these events,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.736
"You should go here, here and here,"

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.416
but we need the whole of community

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.216
to wrap around the idea
of suicide prevention.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.976
We need those services,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.616
and suicide doesn't discriminate at all.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.296
It's not a 9-to-5 thing.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.936
We need to do events before 9am,
which most of our brekkies are,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.056
and after 5 PM.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.216
That's what we need to do.
It's a whole-of-community approach.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.056
We need to get into businesses.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.816
We need to get into
sporting clubs, community clubs.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.376
We need to get in there and train people
