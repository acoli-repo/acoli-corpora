00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.256
And invariably at every single
HALT event at a hardware store,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.056
I have one tradie come up to me,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.600
at least one come up and tell me
about his suicide attempt.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.416
They're not suicidal there and then,
they've worked through it,

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.416
but these men have never felt
they could share their vulnerabilities.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.656
They've never felt they can
talk about their suicide attempt,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.936
but the HALT events,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.656
where there's no expectations
for them to talk,

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.736
makes them feel comfortable
to start talking.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.696
And it's not just they talk
to me and tell me their story,
