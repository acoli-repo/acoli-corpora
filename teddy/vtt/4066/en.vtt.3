00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.376
It was a grieving community

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.680
who had no answers

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.920
to Pete's suicide,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.536
no answers at all.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.536
As I wandered around between the tradies
and the community members,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.320
I started hearing some tones
of another underlying tragic level.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.976
I heard people talking
in that community hall

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.760
about the struggles
other people were going through.
