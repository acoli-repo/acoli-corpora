This day, with hindsight,
which is a wonderful gift,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.680
Pete seemed happier than usual.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.176
Two weeks later,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.216
I was painting a house
down the end of Pete's street

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.080
when I heard the tragic news.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.640
Pete had suicided.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.296
Pete, like myself,
was a tradie, or a tradesman.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.056
We do like to shorten things
in the Australian vernacular.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.576
A tradie.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.936
There was an expectation as a tradie.
