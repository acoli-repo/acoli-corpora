00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.216
knew someone that had anxiety,
depression or thoughts of suicide

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.736
or had suicided.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.056
There was that unity,

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.736
that whole of community approach.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.176
So we thought, that's great,
we've got some food.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.536
What else do we need?

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.936
We need the support services there.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.616
A lot of tradies,
and a lot of men in general,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.560
don't necessarily know
where to go and get help.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.136
I myself was one of them,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.536
and this is what I talk about
at the HALT events,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.896
that four years ago when I founded HALT,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.096
I didn't know I could go to the doctor
about my mental health
