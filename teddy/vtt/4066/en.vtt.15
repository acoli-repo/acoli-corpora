For me, it's really crucial to get

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.256
We've done events for men's sheds,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.016

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.320
We've done events for council
depot workers and tradies.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.656
Interestingly enough,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.296
nearly every single event --

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.536
and we've actually done now,
with very little funding,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.800
150 events over four states.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.496
So -- oh please, thank you.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.456

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.256
And invariably at every single
HALT event at a hardware store,
