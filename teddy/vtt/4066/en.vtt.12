00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.096
I didn't know I could go to the doctor
about my mental health

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.616
and get a mental health plan.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.616
I didn't know about community health.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.656
I certainly didn't know about Lifeline,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.336
and I've called Lifeline three times,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.080
and they've certainly
potentially saved my life.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.696
I had to learn all these things.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.320
Tradies need to know them.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.456
We provided bags,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.936
bags of information,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.256
and I had quite a few tradies
say to me in the first year,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.336
"Aw, this is a load of you-know-what,"

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.216
but those tradies I know
still have those bags in their Ute
