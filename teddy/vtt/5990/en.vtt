[This talk contains mature content]

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:06.960
I'm often asked what do I do.

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:09.300
To which I reply,

00:00:09.324 --> 00:00:12.187
"I work to end violence against children.

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:15.878
All violence against every child
in every country."

00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:18.267
There's usually a pause.

00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:20.529
Sometimes, depending on the setting,

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.785
"Whoa, that's a conversation killer."

00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:25.438
And then the questions:

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:27.684
"What sort of violence
are you talking about?"

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:29.184
"How much violence is there?"

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:32.065
"Where is it happening,
is it happening here?"
