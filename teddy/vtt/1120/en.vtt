00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It feels like we're all suffering

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
from information overload or data glut.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and that's using our eyes more.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So, visualizing information, so that we can see

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the patterns and connections that matter

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then designing that information so it makes more sense,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or it tells a story,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or allows us to focus only on the information that's important.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Failing that, visualized information can just look really cool.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, let's see.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
