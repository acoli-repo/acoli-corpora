00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.656
But it's hard to really
interpret this image,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.456
because as you can see,
it's very low resolution.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.656
Radio waves have a wavelength that's long,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.976
and that makes their resolution poorer.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.056
This image is also black and white,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.840
so we don't really know
what is the color of everything in here.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.016
Well, fast-forward to today.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.496
We can build telescopes

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.136
which can get over these problems.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.496
Now, I'm showing you here an image
of the Murchison Radio Observatory,

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.296
a fantastic place
to build radio telescopes.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.616
It's flat, it's dry,
