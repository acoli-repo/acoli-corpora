00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.200
As I mentioned, radio goes
straight through dust, so not a problem.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.736
But the view is very different.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.576
We can see that the center
of the Milky Way is aglow,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.280
and this isn't starlight.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.096
This is a light called
synchrotron radiation,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.720
and it's formed from electrons
spiraling around cosmic magnetic fields.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.376
So the plane is aglow with this light.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.696
And we can also see
strange tufts coming off of it,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.216
and objects which don't appear to line up

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.560
with anything that we can see
with our own eyes.
