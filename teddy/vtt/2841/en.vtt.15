00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.376
from the antennas

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.936
and bring them
to central processing units.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.736
And it's the size of this telescope,

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.416
the fact that we've built it
over the entire desert

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.240
that gives us a better
resolution than Parkes.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.416
Now, eventually all those cables
bring them to a unit

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.976
which sends it off
to a supercomputer here in Perth,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.286
and that's where I come in.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.536
(Sighs)

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.776
Radio data.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.616
I have spent the last five years

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.496
working with very difficult,
very interesting data

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.496
that no one had really looked at before.
