00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.640
It's a billionth the size
of any of the objects in my survey.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.216
So our telescope may not be quite
sensitive enough to pick up this signal.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.736
However, there's a new radio telescope.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.416
So I can't have a starship,

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.696
but I can hopefully have

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.576
one of the biggest
radio telescopes in the world.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.216
We're building the Square Kilometre Array,
a new radio telescope,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.976
and it's going to be a thousand
times bigger than the MWA,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.216
a thousand times more sensitive,
and have an even better resolution.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.456
So we should find
tens of millions of galaxies.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.816
And perhaps, deep in that signal,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.016
I will get to look upon the very first
stars and galaxies switching on,
