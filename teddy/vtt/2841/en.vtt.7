00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.376
The sound waves,
as the ambulance approached,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.616
were compressed,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.576
and they changed higher in pitch.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.376
As the ambulance receded,
the sound waves were stretched,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.456
and they sounded lower in pitch.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.480
The same thing happens with light.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.416
Objects moving towards us,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.616
their light waves are compressed
and they appear bluer.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.856
Objects moving away from us,

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.536
their light waves are stretched,
and they appear redder.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.440
So we call these effects
blueshift and redshift.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.376
Now, our universe is expanding,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.576
so everything is moving away
from everything else,
