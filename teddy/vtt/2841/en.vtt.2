00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.616
Now, I show you before you
an image of the night sky.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.560
You might see it anywhere in the world.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.000
And all of these stars are part
of our local galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.256
Now, if you were to go
to a darker part of the sky,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.816
a nice dark site, perhaps in the desert,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.256
you might see the center
of our Milky Way galaxy

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.240
spread out before you,
hundreds of billions of stars.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.416
And it's a very beautiful image.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.776
It's colorful.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.416
And again, this is just
a local corner of our universe.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.736
You can see there's
a sort of strange dark dust across it.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.736
Now, that is local dust
