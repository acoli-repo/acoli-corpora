00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.616
It's flat, it's dry,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.616
and most importantly, it's radio quiet:

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.736
no mobile phones, no Wi-Fi, nothing,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.256
just very, very radio quiet,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.000
so a perfect place
to build a radio telescope.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.736
Now, the telescope that I've been
working on for a few years

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.696
is called the Murchison Widefield Array,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.736
and I'm going to show you
a little time lapse of it being built.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.016
This is a group of undergraduate
and postgraduate students

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.296
located in Perth.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.056
We call them the Student Army,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.896
and they volunteered their time
to build a radio telescope.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.560
There's no course credit for this.
