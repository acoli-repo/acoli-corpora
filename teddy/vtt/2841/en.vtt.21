00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.296
When a star explodes,

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.776
its outer shell is cast off

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.096
and it travels outward into space
gathering up material,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.080
and it produces a little shell.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.176
It's been a long-standing
mystery to astronomers

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.280
where all the supernova remnants are.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.296
We know that there must be a lot
of high-energy electrons in the plane

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.976
to produce the synchrotron
radiation that we see,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.576
and we think they're produced
by supernova remnants,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.376
but there don't seem to be enough.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.296
Fortunately, GLEAM is really, really
good at detecting supernova remnants,
