00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.576
so everything is moving away
from everything else,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.280
and that means
everything appears to be red.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.776
And oddly enough, as you look
more deeply into the universe,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.096
more distant objects
are moving away further and faster,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.839
so they appear more red.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.495
So if I come back to the Hubble Deep Field

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.216
and we were to continue
to peer deeply into the universe

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.776
just using the Hubble,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.496
as we get to a certain distance away,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.120
everything becomes red,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.896
and that presents something of a problem.
