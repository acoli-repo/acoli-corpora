00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.840
Space, the final frontier.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.336
I first heard these words
when I was just six years old,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.616
and I was completely inspired.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.016
I wanted to explore strange new worlds.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.536
I wanted to seek out new life.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.760
I wanted to see everything
that the universe had to offer.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.536
And those dreams, those words,
they took me on a journey,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.016
a journey of discovery,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.216
through school, through university,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.680
to do a PhD and finally
to become a professional astronomer.
