00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.296
a technicolor view.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.296
Now, it's not a false color view.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.720
These are real radio colors.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.416
What I've done is I've colored
the lowest frequencies red

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.056
and the highest frequencies blue,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.656
and the middle ones green.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.896
And that gives us this rainbow view.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.176
And this isn't just false color.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.136
The colors in this image
tell us about the physical processes

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.400
going on in the universe.

00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:54.736
So for instance, if you look
along the plane of the galaxy,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.216
it's alight with synchrotron,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.616
which is mostly reddish orange,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.760
but if we look very closely,
we see little blue dots.
