00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.296
Fortunately, GLEAM is really, really
good at detecting supernova remnants,

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.800
so we're hoping to have
a new paper out on that soon.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.056
Now, that's fine.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.416
We've explored our little local universe,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.816
but I wanted to go deeper,
I wanted to go further.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.920
I wanted to go beyond the Milky Way.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.296
Well, as it happens, we can see a very
interesting object in the top right,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.536
and this is a local radio galaxy,

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.800
Centaurus A.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.496
If we zoom in on this,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.920
we can see that there are
two huge plumes going out into space.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.496
And if you look right in the center
between those two plumes,
