00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.816
they ionized that hydrogen.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.280
So the universe went
from neutral to ionized.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.336
That imprinted a signal all around us.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.096
Everywhere, it pervades us,

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.536
like the Force.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.280
Now, because that happened so long ago,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.800
the signal was redshifted,

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.856
so now that signal
is at very low frequencies.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.336
It's at the same frequency as my survey,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.736
but it's so faint.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.640
It's a billionth the size
of any of the objects in my survey.
