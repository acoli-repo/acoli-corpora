00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.056
Well, very well, so we've seen
one radio galaxy. That's nice.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.256
But if you just look
at the top of that image,

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.016
you'll see another radio galaxy.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.280
It's a little bit smaller,
and that's just because it's further away.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.456
OK. Two radio galaxies.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.056
We can see this. This is fine.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.816
Well, what about all the other dots?

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.400
Presumably those are just stars.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.096
They're not.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.720
They're all radio galaxies.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.216
Every single one of the dots in this image

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.976
is a distant galaxy,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.856
millions to billions of light-years away
