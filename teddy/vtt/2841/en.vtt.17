00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:31.256
so you are literally the first people

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.080
to see this southern survey
of the entire sky.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:38.120
So I'm delighted to share with you
some images from this survey.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.775
Now, imagine you went to the Murchison,

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.895
you camped out underneath the stars

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.536
and you looked towards the south.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.227
You saw the south's celestial pole,

00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:47.456
the galaxy rising.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.096
If I fade in the radio light,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.776
this is what we observe with our survey.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.856
You can see that the galactic plane
is no longer dark with dust.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.296
It's alight with synchrotron radiation,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.816
and thousands of dots are in the sky.
