00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.416
Now, black holes are invisible.
That's why they're called that.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.456
All you can see is the deflection
of the light around them,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.776
and occasionally, when a star
or a cloud of gas comes into their orbit,

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.536
it is ripped apart by tidal forces,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.040
forming what we call an accretion disk.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.856
The accretion disk
glows brightly in the x-rays,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.296
and huge magnetic fields
can launch the material into space

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.040
at nearly the speed of light.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.680
So these jets are visible in the radio

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.400
and this is what we pick up in our survey.
