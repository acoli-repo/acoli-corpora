00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.496
And if you look right in the center
between those two plumes,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.896
you'll see a galaxy just like our own.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.376
It's a spiral. It has a dust lane.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.016
It's a normal galaxy.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.656
But these jets
are only visible in the radio.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.856
If we looked in the visible,
we wouldn't even know they were there,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.920
and they're thousands of times larger
than the host galaxy.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.880
What's going on?
What's producing these jets?

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.696
At the center of every galaxy
that we know about

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.976
is a supermassive black hole.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.416
Now, black holes are invisible.
That's why they're called that.
