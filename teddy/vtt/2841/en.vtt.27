00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.740
I'm very proud of this,
and it will be published next week.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.096
Now, that's not all.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.456
I've explored the furthest reaches
of the galaxy with this survey,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.440
but there's something
even more in this image.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.616
Now, I'll take you right back
to the dawn of time.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.296
When the universe formed,
it was a big bang,

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.376
which left the universe
as a sea of hydrogen,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.896
neutral hydrogen.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.696
And when the very first stars
and galaxies switched on,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.816
they ionized that hydrogen.
