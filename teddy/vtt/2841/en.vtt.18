00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.816
and thousands of dots are in the sky.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.136
Our large Magellanic Cloud,
our nearest galactic neighbor,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.376
is orange instead
of its more familiar blue-white.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.776
So there's a lot going on in this.
Let's take a closer look.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.216
If we look back
towards the galactic center,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.456
where we originally saw the Parkes image
that I showed you earlier,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.856
low resolution, black and white,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.960
and we fade to the GLEAM view,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.056
you can see the resolution
has gone up by a factor of a hundred.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.936
We now have a color view of the sky,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.296
a technicolor view.
