00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.736
Now, that is local dust

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.416
that's obscuring the light of the stars.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.016
But we can do a pretty good job.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.496
Just with our own eyes, we can explore
our little corner of the universe.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.856
It's possible to do better.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.640
You can use wonderful telescopes
like the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.376
Now, astronomers
have put together this image.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.296
It's called the Hubble Deep Field,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.656
and they've spent hundreds of hours
observing just a tiny patch of the sky

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.080
no larger than your thumbnail
held at arm's length.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.776
And in this image

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.456
you can see thousands of galaxies,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.936
and we know that there must be
hundreds of millions, billions of galaxies
