00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.936
and we know that there must be
hundreds of millions, billions of galaxies

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.336
in the entire universe,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.016
some like our own and some very different.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.696
So you think, OK, well,
I can continue this journey.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.416
This is easy. I can just
use a very powerful telescope

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.240
and just look at the sky, no problem.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.976
It's actually really missing out
if we just do that.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.736
Now, that's because
everything I've talked about so far

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.656
is just using the visible spectrum,
just the thing that your eyes can see,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.096
and that's a tiny slice,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.480
a tiny, tiny slice
of what the universe has to offer us.
