00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.896
Now, there's also two very important
problems with using visible light.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.656
Not only are we missing out
on all the other processes

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.856
that are emitting other kinds of light,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.296
but there's two issues.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.696
Now, the first is that dust
that I mentioned earlier.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.656
The dust stops the visible light
from getting to us.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.376
So as we look deeper
into the universe, we see less light.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.960
The dust stops it getting to us.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.936
But there's a really strange problem
with using visible light

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.920
in order to try and explore the universe.
