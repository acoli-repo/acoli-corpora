00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.856
millions to billions of light-years away

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.496
with a supermassive
black hole at its center

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.096
pushing material into space
at nearly the speed of light.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.880
It is mind-blowing.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.416
And this survey is even larger
than what I've shown here.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.976
If we zoom out to
the full extent of the survey,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.096
you can see I found 300,000
of these radio galaxies.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.016
So it's truly an epic journey.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.696
We've discovered all of these galaxies

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.280
right back to the very first
supermassive black holes.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.740
I'm very proud of this,
and it will be published next week.
