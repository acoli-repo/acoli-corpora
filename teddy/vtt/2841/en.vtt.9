00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.896
and that presents something of a problem.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.976
Eventually, we get so far away

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.976
everything is shifted into the infrared

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and we can't see anything at all.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.376
So there must be a way around this.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.216
Otherwise, I'm limited in my journey.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.136
I wanted to explore the whole universe,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.080
not just whatever I can see,
you know, before the redshift kicks in.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.416
There is a technique.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.816
It's called radio astronomy.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.176
Astronomers have been
using this for decades.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.496
It's a fantastic technique.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.006
I show you the Parkes Radio Telescope,
affectionately known as "The Dish."
