00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.496
that no one had really looked at before.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.656
I've spent a long time calibrating it,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.576
running millions of CPU hours
on supercomputers

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.800
and really trying to understand that data.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.296
And with this telescope,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.576
with this data,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.536
we've performed a survey
of the entire southern sky,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.656
the GaLactic and Extragalactic
All-sky MWA Survey,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.560
or GLEAM, as I call it.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.896
And I'm very excited.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.301
This survey is just about to be published,
but it hasn't been shown yet,

00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:31.256
so you are literally the first people
