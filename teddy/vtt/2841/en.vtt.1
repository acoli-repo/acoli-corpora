00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.680
to do a PhD and finally
to become a professional astronomer.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.936
Now, I learned two amazing things,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.496
one slightly unfortunate,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.576
when I was doing my PhD.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.016
I learned that the reality was

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.200
I wouldn't be piloting
a starship anytime soon.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.056
But I also learned that the universe
is strange, wonderful and vast,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.880
actually too vast
to be explored by spaceship.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.080
And so I turned my attention
to astronomy, to using telescopes.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.616
Now, I show you before you
an image of the night sky.
