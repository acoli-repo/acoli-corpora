00:00:01.014 --> 00:00:02.825
I'll begin today

00:00:02.825 --> 00:00:04.891
by sharing a poem

00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:08.026
written by my friend from Malawi,

00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:10.162
Eileen Piri.

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:13.506
Eileen is only 13 years old,

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:19.380
but when we were going through
the collection of poetry that we wrote,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.248
I found her poem so interesting,

00:00:22.248 --> 00:00:24.245
so motivating.

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:26.358
So I'll read it to you.

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:30.503
She entitled her poem
"I'll Marry When I Want."
