00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:03.708
So we built a virus-resistant organism.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.001
Why?

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:08.463
It's not about disease, or not directly.

00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:11.674
It's about building
the clean factories of the future.

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:15.636
Let me explain by taking a big step back.

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.931
All life runs on DNA.

00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:24.145
DNA codes for proteins,
and proteins run life.

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:29.067
DNA is composed of four bases:

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:30.943
A, T, G and C.
