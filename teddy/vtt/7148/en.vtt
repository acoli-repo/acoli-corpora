Thinking about the past week,

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:06.236
did any of you forget
where you put your phone?

00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:09.436
Did you have a word
stuck on the tip of your tongue,

00:00:09.436 --> 00:00:11.636
you couldn't remember the name of an actor

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:14.276
or that movie a friend recommended?

00:00:14.676 --> 00:00:16.796
Did you forget to take out the trash

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:20.076
or move the laundry
from the washer to the dryer

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:23.396
or to pick up something from
the grocery store you meant to buy?

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:28.036
What is going on here,
is your memory failing?

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:29.196
It's not.

00:00:29.236 --> 00:00:32.436
It's doing exactly
what it's supposed to do.
