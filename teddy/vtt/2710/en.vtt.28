00:13:59.576 --> 00:14:03.344
And you, in your respective communities,
all have a Muslim neighbor,

00:14:03.368 --> 00:14:04.521
colleague

00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:06.876
or friend your child plays with at school.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.368
Reach out to them.

00:14:08.392 --> 00:14:10.968
Let them know you stand
with them in solidarity.

00:14:11.332 --> 00:14:12.724
It may feel really small,

00:14:12.748 --> 00:14:15.543
but I promise you it makes a difference.

00:14:17.268 --> 00:14:21.117
Nothing will ever bring back
Deah, Yusor and Razan.

00:14:21.723 --> 00:14:24.070
But when we raise our collective voices,

00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:25.809
that is when we stop the hate.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.512
Thank you.

00:14:27.536 --> 00:14:35.833
(Applause)
