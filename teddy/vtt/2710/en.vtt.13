00:06:29.578 --> 00:06:32.173
I sit on my brother's bed
and remember his words,

00:06:32.763 --> 00:06:36.002
the words he gave me
so freely and with so much love,

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:38.257
"I am who I am because of you."

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.956
That's what it takes for me
to climb through my crippling grief

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.137
and speak out.

00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:45.943
I cannot let my family's deaths
be diminished to a segment

00:06:45.967 --> 00:06:48.065
that is barely discussed on local news.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.159
They were murdered by their neighbor
because of their faith,

00:06:52.183 --> 00:06:55.641
because of a piece of cloth
they chose to don on their heads,

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.658
because they were visibly Muslim.
