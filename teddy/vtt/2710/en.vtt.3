00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.663
About a month later, I'm back home
in North Carolina for a short visit,

00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:33.398
and on the last evening,
I run upstairs to Deah's room,

00:01:33.422 --> 00:01:36.717
eager to find out how he's feeling
being a newly married man.

00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:39.042
With a big boyish smile he says,

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:42.780
"I'm so happy. I love her.
She's an amazing girl."

00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:44.438
And she is.

00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:47.840
At just 21, she'd recently
been accepted to join Deah

00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:49.439
at UNC dental school.

00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:53.249
She shared his love for basketball,
and at her urging,

00:01:53.273 --> 00:01:57.196
they started their honeymoon off
attending their favorite team of the NBA,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.625
the LA Lakers.

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.401
I mean, check out that form.
