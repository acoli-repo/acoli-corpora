00:02:59.404 --> 00:03:00.567
hugs me goodnight,

00:03:00.591 --> 00:03:02.821
and I leave the next morning
without waking him

00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:04.285
to go back to San Francisco.

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.245
That is the last time I ever hug him.

00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:13.615
Ten days later, I'm on call
at San Francisco General Hospital

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.485
when I receive a barrage of vague
text messages expressing condolences.

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.317
Confused, I call my father,
who calmly intones,

00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:23.342
"There's been a shooting
in Deah's neighborhood in Chapel Hill.

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:25.358
It's on lock-down. That's all we know."

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.822
I hang up and quickly Google,
"shooting in Chapel Hill."

00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:30.877
One hit comes up.
