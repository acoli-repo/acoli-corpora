00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:01.945
I move to the back of the hall
and burst into tears.

00:01:02.557 --> 00:01:04.545
And the second the song finishes playing,

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.756
he beelines towards me,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.031
buries me into his arms

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:08.475
and rocks me back and forth.

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.123
Even in that moment,

00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:12.024
when everything was so distracting,

00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:13.901
he was attuned to me.

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:15.756
He cups my face and says,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.960
"Suzanne,

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:19.268
I am who I am because of you.

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:24.843
Thank you for everything.

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:26.038
I love you."

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.663
About a month later, I'm back home
in North Carolina for a short visit,
