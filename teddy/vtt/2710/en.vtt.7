00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:30.877
One hit comes up.

00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:32.323
Quote:

00:03:32.347 --> 00:03:34.608
"Three people were shot
in the back of the head

00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:36.376
and confirmed dead on the scene."

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.466
Something in me just knows.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.610
I fling out of my chair and faint
onto the gritty hospital floor,

00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:42.884
wailing.

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.757
I take the first red-eye
out of San Francisco,

00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:47.018
numb and disoriented.

00:03:47.443 --> 00:03:50.948
I walk into my childhood home
and faint into my parents' arms,

00:03:50.972 --> 00:03:52.154
sobbing.

00:03:52.178 --> 00:03:55.096
I then run up to Deah's room
as I did so many times before,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.168
just looking for him,

00:03:57.192 --> 00:03:59.785
only to find a void
that will never be filled.
