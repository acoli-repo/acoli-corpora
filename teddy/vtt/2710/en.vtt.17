00:08:29.507 --> 00:08:31.518
And in under 24 hours from the murders,

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:34.291
I'm on CNN being interviewed
by Anderson Cooper.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.902
The following day, major newspapers --

00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:39.677
including the New York Times,
Chicago Tribune --

00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:42.332
published stories about Deah,
Yusor and Razan,

00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:44.531
allowing us to reclaim the narrative

00:08:44.555 --> 00:08:48.048
and call attention the mainstreaming
of anti-Muslim hatred.

00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:52.491
These days,

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:57.095
it feels like Islamophobia
is a socially acceptable form of bigotry.

00:08:57.987 --> 00:09:00.299
We just have to put up with it and smile.
