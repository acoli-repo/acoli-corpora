00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:32.104
including a dental relief trip
they were planning

00:02:32.128 --> 00:02:34.026
for Syrian refugees in Turkey.

00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:36.796
Razan, at just 19,

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.974
used her creativity
as an architectural engineering student

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:41.689
to serve those around her,

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:43.960
making care packages
for the local homeless,

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:45.650
among other projects.

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:53.628

and look at Deah and tell him,

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:57.141
"I have never been more proud of you
than I am in this moment."

00:02:57.575 --> 00:02:59.380
He pulls me into his tall frame,

00:02:59.404 --> 00:03:00.567
hugs me goodnight,
