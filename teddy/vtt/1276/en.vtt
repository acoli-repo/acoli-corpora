00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Today I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And the problem I'm going to talk about

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is not the familiar one from philosophy,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is, "How can we know

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
whether other people have minds?"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That is, maybe you have a mind,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and everyone else is just a really convincing robot.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So that's a problem in philosophy,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but for today's purposes I'm going to assume

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that many people in this audience have a mind,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and that I don't have to worry about this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
as parents and teachers and spouses
