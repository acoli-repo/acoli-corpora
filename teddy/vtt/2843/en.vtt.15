Palchinsky's view on technocrats
is very different

00:07:31.877 --> 00:07:37.227
from one that is still very popular,
still very common --

00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:42.960
that of a dispassionate researcher
working in his ivory tower lab,

00:07:42.984 --> 00:07:45.951
or a nerdy engineer
working in his cubicle.

00:07:46.518 --> 00:07:48.810
Brilliant, no doubt,

00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:50.764
yet somehow cut off from the world,

00:07:50.788 --> 00:07:53.000
shows little emotion --

00:07:53.024 --> 00:07:56.357
kind of like Spock
from "Star Trek," you know?

00:07:56.947 --> 00:07:58.183
This guy.

00:07:58.207 --> 00:07:59.804
(Laughter)

00:07:59.828 --> 00:08:01.599
Let's try and do the Spock salute.
