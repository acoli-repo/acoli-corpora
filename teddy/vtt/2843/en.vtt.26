00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.283
folks who are developing
their moral courage at all times,

00:13:00.307 --> 00:13:04.093
and who realize that conflict
and controversy

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.221
are not necessarily bad things

00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:09.900
if our ultimate loyalty
is to the public and the planet.

00:13:10.821 --> 00:13:15.863
These are the people who will
stand up like we did in Flint --

00:13:15.887 --> 00:13:19.622
not to be saviors or heroes in the media,

00:13:19.646 --> 00:13:26.597
but altruistic and fundamentally good
actors that you and I can trust.

00:13:27.717 --> 00:13:32.510
Imagine fostering
such a public-focused mindset
