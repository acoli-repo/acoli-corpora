Just consider this email
that an EPA employee wrote,

00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:34.143
where she goes,

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:38.315
"I'm not so sure Flint is a community
we want to go out on a limb for."

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.336
The dehumanization of an entire population
could not be more obvious.

00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:49.760
Now, contrast that to the first
canon of engineering,

00:05:49.784 --> 00:05:53.045
which, in my opinion, should be
the first law of humanity:

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.146
"To hold paramount the health,
safety and welfare of the public,"

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.840
above all else.

00:05:58.864 --> 00:06:02.308
This is the Hippocratic Oath
we've rarely acknowledged,
