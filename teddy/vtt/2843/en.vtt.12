00:05:58.864 --> 00:06:02.308
This is the Hippocratic Oath
we've rarely acknowledged,

00:06:02.332 --> 00:06:03.690
let alone embraced.

00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:08.775
And so when scientists and engineers,
very much like medical doctors,

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:10.048
screw up,

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:11.913
people can get hurt --

00:06:11.937 --> 00:06:13.308
even die.

00:06:13.332 --> 00:06:17.877
If our professionals and even
students fail to get that,

00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:19.955
society pays a huge price.

00:06:21.652 --> 00:06:25.853
Buried deep in history lies
a character I deeply admire --

00:06:25.877 --> 00:06:29.018
an engineer named Peter Palchinsky.

00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:31.939
He lived in the time of the Soviet Union.
