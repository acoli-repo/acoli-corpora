Fresh out of college,

00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:05.124
I went to work for a consulting firm.

00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:08.852
During orientation,
the leaders dished out advice.

00:00:09.287 --> 00:00:12.870
Amongst them was one pithy counsel
I will never forget.

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.671
He told us, "Be easy to manage."

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:20.484
Considering how naÃ¯ve
I really was at the time,

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:22.275
I took his advice to heart.

00:00:22.299 --> 00:00:23.794
I told myself,

00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:26.674
"Yes, I will be the ultimate team player.

00:00:26.698 --> 00:00:28.641
I will do everything I'm told.

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:30.551
I will be easy to manage."
