00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:03.259
our education system today
is focused more on creating

00:10:03.283 --> 00:10:08.338
what ex-Yale professor Bill Deresiewicz
calls "excellent sheep" --

00:10:08.362 --> 00:10:11.217
young people who are smart and ambitious,

00:10:11.241 --> 00:10:16.145
and yet somehow risk-averse,
timid, directionless

00:10:16.169 --> 00:10:18.971
and, sometimes, full of themselves.

00:10:18.995 --> 00:10:20.914
Now, kids ... you know,

00:10:20.938 --> 00:10:23.554
we fell in love with science
when we were kids,

00:10:23.578 --> 00:10:27.880
and yet we somehow spend most of our time
during high school and college

00:10:27.904 --> 00:10:29.401
just jumping through hoops

00:10:29.425 --> 00:10:32.892
and doing things
so that we can polish our résumé
