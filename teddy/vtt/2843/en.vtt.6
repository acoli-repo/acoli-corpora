who came together forming
many grassroots coalitions,

00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:03.906
and these groups started protesting
and demanding change.

00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:08.226
The group also reached out

and a few responded.

00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:13.959
Amongst them was a guy
named Miguel Del Toral,

00:03:13.983 --> 00:03:18.661
a water expert at the US EPA --
the Environmental Protection Agency --

00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:21.248
who actually wrote this scientific memo

00:03:21.272 --> 00:03:24.412
and sent it to the state of Michigan
and the federal government

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:26.800
to bring their attention to this problem.

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.847
He was characterized a "rogue employee,"

00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:31.335
and silenced.
