00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:02.934
and committed my career to caring
for those we often call the underserved,

00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.268
the vulnerable,

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:07.833
like those neighbors I had
when I first immigrated to America.

00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:13.268
During my early training years
in Harlem in the '80s,

00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:17.643
I saw a shocking increase
in young men with HIV.

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:19.476
Then when I moved [to] Miami,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.393
I noticed HIV included women and children,

00:02:22.417 --> 00:02:25.184
primarily, poor black and brown people.

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:29.518
Within a few years, an infection
seen in a select population

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:31.893
became a worldwide epidemic.
