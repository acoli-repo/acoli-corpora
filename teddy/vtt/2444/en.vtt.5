WEBVTT

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:31.893
became a worldwide epidemic.

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:34.559
Again I got the urge to do something.

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:38.684
Fortunately, with the help of activists
and advocates and educators

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:41.309
and physicians like me
who treat the disease,

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:43.476
we found a way forward.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.726
There was a massive education effort
to reduce HIV transmission

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.309
and provide legal protection
for those with the disease.

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:53.601
There was a political will to make sure

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:57.101
that as many patients
as possible worldwide,

00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:59.559
regardless of ability to pay,

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:02.143
could get access to medication.
