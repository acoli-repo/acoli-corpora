I arrived in the US from Kingston, Jamaica
in the summer of '68.

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:09.643
My family of six crammed
into a small, two-bedroom apartment

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:12.226
in a three-story walk-up in Brooklyn.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.059
The block had several children --

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:16.726
some spoke Spanish, some spoke English.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.184
Initially, I wasn't allowed
to play with them

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:22.143

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:23.184
(Laughter)

00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:25.601
so I could only watch them from my window.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.684
Rollerskating was one
of their favorite activities.

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:31.601
They loved hitching a ride
at the back of the city bus,
