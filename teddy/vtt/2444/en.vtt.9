00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:31.934
but knowing she might be denied,

00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.458
I also sent her to the social worker.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.643
Then there was Jorge,

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:38.393
such a sweet, kind man

00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:39.768
who often gifted our clinic

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:43.059
with some of the fruits he sold
on the streets of Miami.

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:46.518
He had signs of worsening kidney function

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:50.226
whenever he worked days on end
on those hot streets

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.809
due to dehydration --

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.684
just not enough blood
getting to the kidneys.

00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:58.768
His kidneys worked much better
whenever he took some days off.

00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:01.768
But with no other support,
what could he do?
