00:09:28.542 --> 00:09:30.476
and politics.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.643
There is so much we can do.

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:35.518
As clinicians, our many patient
contacts allows us

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:37.601
to see things before others.

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:41.976
And this puts us in an ideal position
to be on the frontlines of change.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.184
We can teach climate-related illnesses
in our health-professional schools.

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:49.518
We can collect data on our patients'
climate-related conditions

00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:52.684
by making sure there are
billing codes to identify them.

00:09:52.708 --> 00:09:55.393
We can do climate-related health research.

00:09:55.417 --> 00:09:58.309
We can teach how to have
green practices in homes.

00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:01.101
We can advocate
for our patient energy needs.
