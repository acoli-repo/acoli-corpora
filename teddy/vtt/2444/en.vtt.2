00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:02.684
The experienced riders
adjusted and quickly let go,

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:06.393
but the new girl lurched back
and fell onto the pavement.

00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:08.083
She didn't move.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.268
The adults outside ran to help her.

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:13.601
The bus driver came out
to see what had happened

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:15.309
and call for an ambulance.

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.226
There was blood coming from her head.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.059
She didn't open her eyes.

00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:20.476
We waited for the ambulance,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.768
and waited,

00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:23.851
and everyone said,
"Where is the ambulance?

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.518
Where is the ambulance?"

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:27.625
The police finally arrived.

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:32.208
An older black American man said,
"Ain't no ambulance coming."
