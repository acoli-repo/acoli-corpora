00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.101
walked in for medication refills.

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:34.809
She had common chronic conditions
of high blood pressure, diabetes,

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:36.559
heart disease and asthma

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:39.518
with overlapping chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease --

00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:41.643
COPD.

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:44.226
Ms. Anna Mae was one
of my more adherent patients,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.768
so I was surprised she needed refills
of her breathing medicines

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.309
earlier than usual.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:50.851
Towards the end of the visit,

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:54.476
she handed me a Florida Power and Light 
form and asked me to sign it.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.976
She was behind on her light bill.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.393
This form allowed physicians
to document serious medical conditions
