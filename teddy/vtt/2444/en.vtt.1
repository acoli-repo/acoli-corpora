They loved hitching a ride
at the back of the city bus,

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:33.559
letting go of the rear bumper

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:35.934
as the bus arrived
at the bottom of the block

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.101
in front of my building.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.559
One day there was a new girl with them.

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:44.934
I heard the usual squeals of laughter
interspersed with, "Mira, mira!

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.268
Mira, mira!"

00:00:46.292 --> 00:00:48.101
Spanish for, "Look, look!"

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:52.101
The group grabbed onto the back
of the bus at the top of the block,

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:56.643
and as they rolled down laughing
and screaming, "Mira, mira, mira, mira,"

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:59.101
the bus abruptly stopped.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:02.684
The experienced riders
adjusted and quickly let go,
