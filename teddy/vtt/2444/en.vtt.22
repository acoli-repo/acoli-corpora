00:10:55.958 --> 00:11:00.268
but are stories of resilience,
innovation and survival.

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:03.434
Like that wise old man
who loudly spoke truth to the cop

00:11:03.458 --> 00:11:04.726
that summer night:

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.143
"Ain't no ambulance coming,"

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:11.208
and compelled him to deliver
that little girl to the hospital instead.

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:13.476
You know what?

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.750
Listen up.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.559
If there's going to be a medical
response to climate change,

00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:23.125
it is not going to be
just waiting for an ambulance.

00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:28.018
It is going to happen because
we the clinicians take the first step.

00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:29.726
We make so much noise

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.458
that the issue cannot
be ignored or misunderstood.
