00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:32.559
This new epidemic is climate change,

00:06:32.583 --> 00:06:35.559
and it has a variety of health effects.

00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:38.893
Climate change impacts us
in four major ways.

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:43.101
Directly, through heat,
extreme weather and pollution;

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:45.226
through the spread of the disease;

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.684
through disruption
of our food and water supply;

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:52.059
and through disruption
of our emotional well-being.

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:56.226
In medicine we use mnemonics
to aid our memory,

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.643
and this mnemonic, "heatwave,"

00:06:58.667 --> 00:07:02.643
shows the eight significant
health effects of climate change.
