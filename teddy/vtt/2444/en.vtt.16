WEBVTT

00:07:58.792 --> 00:08:00.851
we will find solutions.

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:03.351
We have done this with the HIV crisis.

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:06.851
There [it] was thanks to the activism
of patients with HIV

00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:09.976
that demanded medications
and better research,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.851
and the collaboration
of doctors and scientists

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:15.250
that we were able to control the epidemic.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.559
And then it was thanks
to international health agencies,

00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:22.434
NGOs, politicians
and pharmaceutical companies

00:08:22.458 --> 00:08:26.958
that HIV medication became
available in low-income countries.

00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:32.601
There is no reason we can't also apply
this model of collaboration
