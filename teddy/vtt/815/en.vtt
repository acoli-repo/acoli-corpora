There are a lot of ways
the people around us

00:00:04.308 --> 00:00:06.411
can help improve our lives.

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:08.055
We don't bump into every neighbor,

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.126
so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.602
though we do share the same public spaces.

00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:16.863
So over the past few years,
I've tried ways to share more

00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:19.203
with my neighbors in public space,

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:22.187
using simple tools like
stickers, stencils and chalk.

00:00:22.798 --> 00:00:26.170
And these projects came
from questions I had, like:

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:28.885
How much are my neighbors
paying for their apartments?

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.099
