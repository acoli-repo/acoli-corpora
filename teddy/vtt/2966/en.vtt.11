00:05:28.487 --> 00:05:31.547
Can you imagine how many
first-time entrepreneurs there will be

00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:33.611
among 84 million people?

00:05:34.073 --> 00:05:36.652
And they'll all have
four decades of experience.

00:05:36.676 --> 00:05:38.471
(Laughter)

00:05:38.495 --> 00:05:43.911
So when I say, "Let's start talking more
about these wonderful entrepreneurs,"

00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:47.075
I mean, let's talk about their ventures,

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.663
just as we do the ventures
of their much younger counterparts.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.457
The older entrepreneurs in this country
have a 70 percent success rate

00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:58.923
starting new ventures.

00:05:58.947 --> 00:06:00.951
70 percent success rate.
