00:02:29.787 --> 00:02:34.167
manufacturing, outsourcing, job creation,

00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:38.076
patents, partnerships, funding --

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.790
these are all typical
issues for a start-up,

00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:43.053
but hardly typical for me.

00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:44.639
And a word about funding.

00:02:45.107 --> 00:02:47.702
I live and work in San Francisco,

00:02:47.726 --> 00:02:49.432
and if you're looking for funding,

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:53.265
you are typically going to compete
with some very young people

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.079
from the high-tech industry,

00:02:55.103 --> 00:02:58.614
and it can be very discouraging
and intimidating.

00:02:59.296 --> 00:03:01.709
I have shoes older
than most of these people.
