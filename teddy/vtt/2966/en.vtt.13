That's why I'd like to make the phrase
"70 over 70" just as --

00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:33.327
(Laughter)

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:37.278
just as commonplace
as the phrase "30 under 30."

00:06:37.302 --> 00:06:38.303
(Applause)

00:06:38.327 --> 00:06:39.478
Thank you.

00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:40.786
(Cheers)

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.680
(Applause)
