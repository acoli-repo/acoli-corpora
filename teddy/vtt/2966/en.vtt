00:00:00.797 --> 00:00:03.707
I'd like to take you back
about seven years in my life.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.412
Friday afternoon,

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:08.602
a few days before Christmas 2009,

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:10.419
I was the director of operations

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:13.776
at a consumer products company
in San Francisco,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.010
and I was called into a meeting
that was already in progress.

00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:20.483
That meeting turned out
to be my exit interview.

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:23.517
I was fired, along with several others.

00:00:24.288 --> 00:00:26.467
I was 64 years old at the time.

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:29.986
It wasn't completely unexpected.
