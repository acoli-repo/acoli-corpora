In the United States, for example,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.902
narcissism as a personality trait
has been rising since the 1970s,

00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:07.991
when the communal focus of the 60s

00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:10.150
gave way to the self-esteem movement

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.633
and a rise in materialism.

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:17.078
More recently, social media has multiplied
the possibilities for self-promotion,

00:04:17.078 --> 00:04:18.371
though it's worth noting

00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:22.191
that there's no clear evidence
that social media causes narcissism.

00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:27.764
Rather, it provides narcissists a means
to seek social status and attention.

00:04:27.764 --> 00:04:31.235
So can narcissists improve 
on those negative traits?
