00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:02.119
To varying degrees, narcissists think
they're better looking,

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.973
smarter,

00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:05.233
and more important than other people,

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:08.011
and that they deserve special treatment.

00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:12.767
Psychologists recognize two forms
of narcissism as a personality trait:

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:15.889
grandiose and vulnerable narcissism.

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:18.406
There's also narcissistic 
personality disorder,

00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:22.066
a more extreme form,
which we'll return to shortly.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:25.801
Grandiose narcissism 
is the most familiar kind,

00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:27.789
characterized by extroversion,

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:28.956
dominance,

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.531
and attention seeking.
