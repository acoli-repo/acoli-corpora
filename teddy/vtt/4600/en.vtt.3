00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.531
and attention seeking.

00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.812
Grandiose narcissists pursue 
attention and power,

00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:35.457
sometimes as politicians,

00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:36.457
celebrities,

00:01:36.457 --> 00:01:38.290
or cultural leaders.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.636
Of course, not everyone who pursues
these positions of power is narcissistic.

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:44.406
Many do it for very positive reasons,

00:01:44.406 --> 00:01:46.082
like reaching their full potential,

00:01:46.082 --> 00:01:48.491
or helping make people's lives better.

00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:50.777
But narcissistic individuals seek power

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.773
for the status 
and attention that goes with it.

00:01:53.773 --> 00:01:57.919
Meanwhile, vulnerable narcissists
can be quiet and reserved.

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:59.833
They have a strong sense of entitlement,

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:02.793
but are easily threatened or slighted.
