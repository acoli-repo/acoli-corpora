00:04:27.764 --> 00:04:31.235
So can narcissists improve 
on those negative traits?

00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:32.474
Yes!

00:04:32.474 --> 00:04:35.450
Anything that promotes honest reflection
on their own behavior

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.104
and caring for others,

00:04:37.104 --> 00:04:42.116
like psychotherapy or practicing 
compassion towards others, can be helpful.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:44.172
The difficulty is it can be challenging

00:04:44.172 --> 00:04:46.712
for people with 
narcissistic personality disorder

00:04:46.712 --> 00:04:48.911
to keep working at self-betterment.

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:53.763
For a narcissist, self-reflection is hard
from an unflattering angle.
