you instead told everyone 
who tried to help you

that they were wrong.

00:03:32.908 --> 00:03:35.230
So what causes narcissism?

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.969
Twin studies show 
a strong genetic component,

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.023
although we don't know 
which genes are involved.

00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:42.895
But environment matters, too.

can foster grandiose narcissism.

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:53.050
And cold, controlling parents
can contribute to vulnerable narcissism.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.259
Narcissism also seems to be higher

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:59.429
in cultures that value individuality
and self-promotion.

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:01.170
In the United States, for example,
