Every child has the human right
to be taught about food:

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.736
where it comes from,
how it affects their body.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.936
And they should be shown at school,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.016
because it's at the front line
of the fight against obesity.

[Charlton Manor Primary School]

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.376
What happens at Charlton Manor

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.120
is that incredible head teacher
took it to the next level.

Timothy Baker: In the past,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.456
the children weren't
eating the right things.
