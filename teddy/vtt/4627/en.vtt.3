I've been inspired by Jamie
to educate this school

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.056
about the fact that we're feeding
the children the wrong food.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.176
And I thought, well, the timetable
is an already crowded place --

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.856
there are so many lessons
in the primary curriculum.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.760
How can you introduce another subject
for teachers to teach?

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.896
So we looked at English,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.256
we looked at maths, science,
history, geography

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.120
and we saw how we could
put that around food.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.416
(Children laugh)

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.336
Elizabeth: When you incorporate cooking,
it's something everyone looks forward to.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.696
Male teacher: Today we're doing
a little bit of science in the kitchen.
