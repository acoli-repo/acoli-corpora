00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.696
Male teacher: Today we're doing
a little bit of science in the kitchen.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.656
Female teacher: We are going to combine
our lessons on Diwali,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.856
but also our lessons
on shape and symmetry.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.776
Male teacher: Is this a physical change
or a chemical change?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.016
Children: Physical!

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.376
Male teacher: You're right.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.376
TB: For history topics,
we talk about the history of chocolate,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.456
and so we can do
a whole topic around that.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.496
Male teacher: And the Aztecs
have been cooking with chocolate --

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.496
TB: And it's interesting
because it's not made as they think,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.776
with all the milk in
that they would have had --

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.200
and the taste is very, very different.
