their complexes.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.816
So instead of replying,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.136
I gave back one of my largest smiles

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.016
as I saw, in flashing light,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.176
the following sign in my mind's eye.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.256
[Be happy, it drives people crazy.]

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.520
(Applause)

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.096
You see, as a young woman
in these situations, you have two options.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.976
You can either decide
to internalize these negative messages

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.616
that are being thrown at you,
