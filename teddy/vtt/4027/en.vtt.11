00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.296
but I have also often been met
by women, men and couples

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.056
who have clearly had an issue
with my husband and I

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.600
having chosen the path
of a dual-career couple.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.696
So you get this well-meaning couple

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.976
who tells you straight out
at a family gathering

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.256
or at a friends gathering,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.709
that, come on, you must know
you're not a great mom,

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:49.293
given how much you're investing
in your career, right?

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.416
I would lie if I said
these words didn't hurt.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.896
My children are the most
precious thing to me,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.600
and the thought that I could be
failing them in any way is intolerable.
