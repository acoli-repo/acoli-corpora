I use Skype to connect with my children
even if I am miles away.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.256
Our son Burhan is five years old,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.840
and he's learning to read
and do basic maths.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.496
Here's another confession:

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.256
I have found that our daughter
is actually more successful

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.176
at teaching him these skills than I am.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.920
(Laughter)

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.856
It started as a game, but Alia loves
playing teacher to her little brother,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.056
and I have found that these sessions
actually improve Burhan's literacy,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.456
increase Alia's sense of responsibility,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.456
and strengthen the bonding between them,
