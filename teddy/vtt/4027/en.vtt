00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.800
"Mom, who are these people?"

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.096
It was an innocent question
from my young daughter Alia

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.256
around the time when she was three.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.376
We were walking along with my husband

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.176
in one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.496
Alia was peering at a huge poster
standing tall in the middle of the mall.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880
It featured the three rulers
of the United Arab Emirates.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.216
As she tucked in my side,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.456
I bent down and explained
that these were the rulers of the UAE

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.736
who had worked hard
to develop their nation

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.000
and preserve its unity.
