As a result, I would like to think
that we poor, oppressed women

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.320
actually have some useful,
certainly hard-earned lessons to share,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.016
lessons that might turn out useful

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.600
for anyone wishing to thrive
in the modern world.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.736
Here are three of mine.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.616
["Convert their sh*t into your fuel."]

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.856
(Laughter)

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.680
(Applause)

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.656
There is this word that everybody
is touting as the key to success:

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.920
resilience.
