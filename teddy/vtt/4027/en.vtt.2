WEBVTT

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.216
and director of operations
for the Lebanese Airlines

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.040
and a super-supportive
stay-at-home mom and grandma.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.056
My father had encouraged
my sister and I to pursue our education

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.376
even though our culture
emphasized at the time

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.400
that it was sons and not daughters
who should be professionally motivated.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.016
I was one of very few girls
of my generation

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.440
who left home at 18 to study abroad.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.296
My father didn't have a son,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.320
and so I, in a sense, became his.
