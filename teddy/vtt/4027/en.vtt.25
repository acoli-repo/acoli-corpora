Today, I have two senior women on my team,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.240
and I see making them successful
as key to my own success.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.296
Women continue to advance in the world,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.696
not fast enough, but we're moving.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.816
The Arab world, too, is making progress,
despite many recent setbacks.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.456
Just this year, the UAE appointed
five new female ministers to its cabinet,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.800
for a total of eight female ministers.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.056
That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.896
and more than many
developed countries can claim.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.280
This is today my daughter
Alia's favorite picture.
