00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.136
I focus on turning these minutes
into memorable moments,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.376
moments where I'm seeing my kids,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.216
hearing them, connecting with them.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.016

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.816
Arab women of my generation
have not been very visible

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.936
in the public eye as they grew up.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.856
This explains, I think, to some extent,

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.560
why you find so few women
in politics in the Arab world.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.816
The upside of this, however,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.936
is that we have spent a lot of time

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.400
developing a social skill
behind the scenes,

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.816
in coffee shops, in living rooms,

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.056
on the phone,
