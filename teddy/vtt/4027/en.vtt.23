then you can't make room for others,
much less lift them up.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.256
Arab women, generally speaking,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.520
have not fallen
for this psychological trap.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.216
Faced with a patriarchal society,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.576
they have found
that by helping each other out,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.840
all benefit.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.296
In my previous job, I was the most
senior woman in the Middle East,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.176
so one could think that investing
in my network of female colleagues

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.776
couldn't bring many benefits

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.056
and that I should instead invest my time

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.800
developing my relationships
with male seniors and peers.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.320
Yet two of my biggest breaks
came through the support of other women.
