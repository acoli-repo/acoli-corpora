Well, what exactly is resilience,
and how do you develop it?

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.800
I believe resilience is simply
the ability to transform shit into fuel.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.456
In my previous job,
well before my current firm,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.600
I was working with a man
we will call John.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.816
I had teamed up with John
and was working hard,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.816
hoping he would notice how great I was

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.160
and that he would come to support
my case to make partner at the firm.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.216
I was, in addition to delivering
on my consulting projects,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.400
writing passionately on the topic
of women economic empowerment.
