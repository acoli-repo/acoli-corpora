00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.400
writing passionately on the topic
of women economic empowerment.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.920
One day, I got to present my research
to a roomful of MBA students.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.136
John was part of the audience

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.800
listening for the first time
to the details of my study.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.296
As I proceeded with my presentation,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.520
I could see John in the corner of my eye.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.536
He had turned a dark shade of pink

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.360
and had slid under his chair
in apparent shame.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.296
I finished my presentation
to an applauding audience

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.400
and we rushed out and jumped into the car.
