that are being thrown at you,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.616
to let them make you feel like a failure,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.216
like success is way too hard
to ever achieve,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.656
or you can choose to see that others'
negativity is their own issue,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.720
and instead transform it
into your own personal fuel.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.056
I have learned
to always go for option two,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.200
and I have found that it has taken me
from strength to strength.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.256
And it's true what they say:

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.440
success is the best revenge.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.376
Some women in the Middle East

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.816
are lucky enough to be married
to someone supportive of their career.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.296
Correction: I should say "smart enough,"
