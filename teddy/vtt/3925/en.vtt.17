00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.176
And I understood when I stood up
from that chair after three months,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.775
I am not the same anymore.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.576
And I understood
that I have a very strong mission,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.856
that I have to communicate this experience

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.135
to everybody.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.976

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.056
It's not like a painting.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.856
You have the painting on the wall,
the next day it's there.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.576
Performance, if you are missing it,
you only have the memory,
