How to count rice for six hours?

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.096
It's incredibly important.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.256
You know, you go through this whole range
of being bored, being angry,

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.736
being completely frustrated, not finishing
the amount of rice you're counting.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.536
And then this unbelievable
amount of peace you get

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.016
when satisfying work is finished --

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.840
or counting sand in the desert.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.096
Or having the sound-isolated situation --

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.696
that you have headphones,
that you don't hear anything,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.416
and you're just there
together without sound,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.296
with the people experiencing silence,
just the simple silence.
