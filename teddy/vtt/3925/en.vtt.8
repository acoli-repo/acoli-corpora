00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.816
It's all about being there
in the real time,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.696
and you can't rehearse performance,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.040
because you can't do many
of these types of things twice -- ever.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.856
Which is very important,
the performance is --

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.176
you know, all human beings
are always afraid of very simple things.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.576
We're afraid of suffering,
we're afraid of pain,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.680
we're afraid of mortality.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.496
So what I'm doing --

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.736
I'm staging these kinds of fears
in front of the audience.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.936
I'm using your energy,
