00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.736
You go to the long duration chairs
because now you are comfortable.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.136
In the long duration chairs,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.856
you're transported to the big place
where you're going to see the work.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.096
And if you fall asleep,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.656
which is very possible
because it's been a long day,

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.136
you're going to be
transported to the parking lot.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.776
(Laughter)

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.616
And you know, sleeping is very important.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.416
In sleeping, you're still receiving art.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.136
So in the parking lot you stay
for a certain amount of time,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.416
and then after this
you just, you know, go back,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.776
you see more of the things you like to see
