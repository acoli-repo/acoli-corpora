Performance, if you are missing it,
you only have the memory,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.936
or the story of somebody else telling you,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.896
but you actually missed the whole thing.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.136
So you have to be there.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.056
And in my point,
if you talk about immaterial art,

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.456
music is the highest --
absolutely highest art of all,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.256
because it's the most immaterial.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.138
And then after this is performance,
and then everything else.

00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:22.696
That's my subjective way.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.616
This institute is going to happen
in Hudson, upstate New York,

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.640
and we are trying to build
with Rem Koolhaas, an idea.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.216
And it's very simple.
