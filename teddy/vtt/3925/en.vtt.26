with the people experiencing silence,
just the simple silence.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.536
We are always doing things
we like in our life.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.816
And this is why you're not changing.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.296
You do things in life --

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.720
it's just nothing happens
if you always do things the same way.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.296
But my method is to do things
I'm afraid of, the things I fear,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.816
the things I don't know,

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.696
to go to territory
that nobody's ever been.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.576
And then also to include the failure.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.336
I think failure is important

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.096
because if you go,
if you experiment, you can fail.
