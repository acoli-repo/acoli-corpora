This is orientation hall.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.776
The public comes in, and the first thing
you have to do is dress in lab coats.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.016
It's this importance

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.256
of stepping from being
just a viewer into experimenter.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.696
And then you go to the lockers

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.016
and you put your watch,
your iPhone, your iPod, your computer

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.336
and everything digital, electronic.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.696
And you are getting free time
for yourself for the first time.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.096
Because there is nothing
wrong with technology,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.456
our approach to technology is wrong.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.176
We are losing the time
we have for ourselves.
