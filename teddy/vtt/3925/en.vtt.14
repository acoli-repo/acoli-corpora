00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.496
But then something stays in the memory.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.256
I want to show you the one
who really changed my life,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.416
and this was the performance in MoMa,
which I just recently made.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.776
This performance --
when I said to the curator,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.776
"I'm just going to sit at the chair,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.336
and there will be
an empty chair at the front,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.856
and anybody from the public
can come and sit as long as they want."

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.096
The curator said to me,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.776
"That's ridiculous, you know,
this is New York,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.016
this chair will be empty,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.945
nobody has time to sit in front of you."

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:27.136
(Laughter)

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.056
But I sit for three months.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.016
And I sit everyday, eight hours --
