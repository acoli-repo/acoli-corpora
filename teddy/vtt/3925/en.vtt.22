00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.136
After crystal chamber,
you go to eye-gazing chamber,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.256
after eye-gazing chamber, you go to
a chamber where you are lying down.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.736
So it's the three basic positions
of the human body,

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.096
sitting, standing and lying.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.656
And slow walking.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.496
And there is a sound chamber.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.856
And then after you've seen all of this,

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.023
and prepared yourself
mentally and physically,

00:11:17.047 --> 00:11:19.714
then you are ready to see
something with a long duration,

00:11:19.738 --> 00:11:22.096
like in immaterial art.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.976
It can be music, it can be opera,
it can be a theater piece,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.896
it can be film, it can be video dance.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.736
You go to the long duration chairs
because now you are comfortable.
