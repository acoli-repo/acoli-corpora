00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.616
but they would have to wait
for hours and hours and hours

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.798
to get to this position,

00:08:02.823 --> 00:08:04.376
and finally, they sit.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.960
And what happened?

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.576
They are observed by the other people,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.176
they're photographed,
they're filmed by the camera,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.576
they're observed by me

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.760
and they have nowhere to escape
except in themselves.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.816
And that makes a difference.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.656
There was so much pain and loneliness,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.776
there's so much incredible things
when you look in somebody else's eyes,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.776
because in the gaze
with that total stranger,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.800
that you never even say one word --
everything happened.
