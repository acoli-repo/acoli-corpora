00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.416
and we worked on so many subjects,
both male and female energy.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.576
And as every relationship
comes to an end, ours went too.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.256
We didn't make phone calls
like normal human beings do

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.256
and say, you know, "This is over."

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.280
We walked the Great Wall
of China to say goodbye.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.720
I started at the Yellow Sea,
and he started from the Gobi Desert.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.576
We walked, each of us, three months,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.440
two and a half thousand kilometers.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.776
It was the mountains, it was difficult.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.136
It was climbing, it was ruins.
