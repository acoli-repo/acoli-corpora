00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.136
We select the airport,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.536
and it finds the planes in today's image,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.816
and finds the planes
in the whole stack of images before it,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.736
and then outputs this graph of all
the planes in Beijing airport over time.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.336
Of course, you could do this
for all the airports around the world.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.296
And let's look here
in the port of Vancouver.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.856
So, we would do the same,
but this time we would look for vessels.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.016
So, we zoom in on Vancouver,
we select the area,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.096
and we search for ships.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.978
And it outputs where all the ships are.
