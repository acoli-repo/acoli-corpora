(Applause)

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.760
Thank you.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.576
It's taken 21 rocket launches --

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.760
this animation makes it look
really simple -- it was not.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.496
And we now have
over 200 satellites in orbit,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.456
downlinking their data to 31 ground
stations we built around the planet.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.776
In total, we get 1.5 million 29-megapixel
images of the Earth down each day.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.216
And on any one location
of the Earth's surface,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.736
we now have on average
more than 500 images.
