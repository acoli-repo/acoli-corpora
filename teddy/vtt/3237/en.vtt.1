The beautiful Blue Marble image,
taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts in 1972

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.160
had helped humanity become aware
that we're on a fragile planet.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.656
And we wanted to take it
to the next level,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.136
to give people the tools
to take action, to take care of it.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.216
Well, after many
Apollo projects of our own,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.200
launching the largest fleet
of satellites in human history,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.120
we have reached our target.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.736
Today, Planet images
the entire Earth, every single day.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.976
Mission accomplished.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.536
(Applause)
