00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:33.216
Now, imagine how useful this would be
to people in coast guards

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.976
who are trying to track
and stop illegal fishing.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.056
See, legal fishing vessels

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.016
transmit their locations
using AIS beacons.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.656
But we frequently find ships
that are not doing that.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.456
The pictures don't lie.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.176
And so, coast guards could use that

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.376
and go and find
those illegal fishing vessels.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.576
And soon we'll add
not just ships and planes

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.896
but all the other objects,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.816
and we can output data feeds

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.376
of those locations
of all these objects over time

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.456
that can be integrated digitally
from people's work flows.
