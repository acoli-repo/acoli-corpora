You can compare any two days

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.640
and see the dramatic changes
that happen around our planet.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.960
Or you can create a time lapse
through the 500 images that we have

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.160
and see that change
dramatically over time.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.720
And you can share these over social media.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.736
It's pretty cool.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.976
(Applause)

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.200
Thank you.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.896
We initially created this tool
for news journalists,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.656
who wanted to get unbiased information
about world events.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.896
But now we've opened it up
for anyone to use,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.920
for nonprofit or personal uses.
