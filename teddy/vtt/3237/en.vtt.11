00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.536
Well, that's what
we're trying to go towards,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.416
and we call it "Queryable Earth."

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.336
So, Planet's Mission 1 was
to image the whole planet every day

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.696
and make it accessible.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.536
Planet's Mission 2 is to index
all the objects on the planet over time

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.800
and make it queryable.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.896
Let me leave you with an analogy.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.320
Google indexed what's on the internet
and made it searchable.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.336
Well, we're indexing what's on the Earth
and making it searchable.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.696
Thank you very much.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.240
