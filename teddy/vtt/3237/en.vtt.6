00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.016
And we hope it will give people the tools
to find and see the changes on the planet

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.240
and take action.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.176
OK, so humanity now has this database
of information about the planet,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.416
changing over time.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.496
What's our next mission, what's Mission 2?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.960
In short, it's space plus AI.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.896
What we're doing
with artificial intelligence

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.016
is finding the objects
in all the satellite images.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.576
The same AI tools that are used
to find cats in videos online

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.496
can also be used to find
information on our pictures.
