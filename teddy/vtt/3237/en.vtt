Four years ago, here at TED,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.336
I announced Planet's Mission 1:

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.216
to launch a fleet of satellites

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.520
that would image
the entire Earth, every day,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.200
and to democratize access to it.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.736
The problem we were trying
to solve was simple.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.856
Satellite imagery you find online is old,
typically years old,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.816
yet human activity was happening
on days and weeks and months,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.096
and you can't fix what you can't see.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.896
We wanted to give people the tools
to see that change and take action.
