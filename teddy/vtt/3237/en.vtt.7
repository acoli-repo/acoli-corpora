00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.496
can also be used to find
information on our pictures.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.856
So, imagine if you can say,
this is a ship, this is a tree,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.256
this is a car, this is a road,
this is a building, this is a truck.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.016
And if you could do that
for all of the millions of images

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.296
coming down per day,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.056
then you basically create a database

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.736
of all the sizable objects
on the planet, every day.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.320
And that database is searchable.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.616
So that's exactly what we're doing.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.896
Here's a prototype, working on our API.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.376
This is Beijing.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.256
So, imagine if we wanted
to count the planes in the airport.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.136
We select the airport,
