Many people in the United States
and Latin America

00:00:09.773 --> 00:00:14.540
have grown up celebrating the anniversary
of Christopher Columbus's voyage,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.336
but was he an intrepid explorer
who brought two worlds together

00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:22.611
or a ruthless exploiter who brought
colonialism and slavery?

00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:26.252
And did he even discover America at all?

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:32.472
It's time to put Columbus on the stand
in History vs. Christopher Columbus.
