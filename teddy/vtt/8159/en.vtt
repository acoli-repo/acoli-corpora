The number one source of carbon
emissions in the United States

00:00:06.502 --> 00:00:08.004
is coming from transportation.

00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:09.422
Globally, it's number two.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:12.216

from our personal use,

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:13.426
our cars and trucks.

How do we consume less energy
while meeting the needs

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.390
that people have of transportation?
