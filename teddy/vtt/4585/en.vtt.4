00:01:57.933 --> 00:02:00.783
This is the use of law and 
bureaucracy to compel people

00:02:00.783 --> 00:02:04.023
to do or not do certain things.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.628
In a democracy, for example,
we the people, theoretically,

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:10.699
give government its power
through elections.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.792
In a dictatorship, state power emerges
from the threat of force,

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:17.316
not the consent of the governed.

00:02:17.316 --> 00:02:21.942
The fourth type of power is social norms
or what other people think is okay.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:24.672
Norms don't have the centralized
machinery of government.

00:02:24.672 --> 00:02:27.871
They operate in a softer way,
peer to peer.

00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:31.831
They can certainly make people
change behavior and even change laws.
