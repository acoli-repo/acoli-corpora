being taken seriously,
and not being taken advantage of.

00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:04.010
In this lesson, we'll look at where
power comes from,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.784
how it's exercised and what you can do to
become more powerful in public life.

00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:11.982
Let's start with a basic definition.

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:15.741
Power is the ability to make others do
what you would have them do.

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:18.315
Of course, this plays out in 
all arenas of life,

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:24.053
from family to the workplace 
to our relationships.

00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:26.664
Our focus is on the civic arena,

00:01:26.664 --> 00:01:29.415
where power means getting a community
to make the choices

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:32.524
and to take the actions that you want.
