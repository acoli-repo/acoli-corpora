To read power means to pay attention to
as many texts of power as you can.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.709
I don't mean books only.

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:06.013
I mean seeing society as a set of texts.

00:05:06.013 --> 00:05:09.190
Don't like how things are in your campus
or city or country?

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.610
Map out who has what kind of power,
arrayed in what systems.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.926
Understand why it turned out this way,

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:19.449
who's made it so, 
and who wants to keep it so.

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.882
Study the strategies others
in such situations used:

00:05:23.882 --> 00:05:28.471
frontal attack or indirection,

00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:31.803
coalitions or charismatic authority.
