and by asserting legitimacy.

00:03:01.054 --> 00:03:04.232
Think of the Arab Spring
or the rise of the Tea Party.

00:03:04.232 --> 00:03:06.192
Crowds count.

00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:10.297
These are the six main sources of power,
what power is.

00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:13.665
So now, let's think about how
power operates.

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:17.678
There are three laws of power 
worth examining.

00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:21.067
Law number one:
power is never static.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:24.566
It's always either accumulating
or decaying in a civic arena.

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:30.339
So if you aren't taking action,
you're being acted upon.
