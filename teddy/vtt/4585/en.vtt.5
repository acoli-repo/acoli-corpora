They can certainly make people
change behavior and even change laws.

00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:36.131
Think about how norms around marriage
equality today are evolving.

00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:39.418
The fifth form of power is ideas.

00:02:39.418 --> 00:02:42.827
An idea, individual liberties, say,
or racial equality,

00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:45.339
can generate boundless amounts
of power

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:49.620
if it motivates enough people to change
their thinking and actions.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.124
And so the sixth source of 
power is numbers, lots of humans.

00:02:54.124 --> 00:02:56.653
A vocal mass of people creates
power by expressing

00:02:56.653 --> 00:02:58.999
collective intensity of interest

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.054
and by asserting legitimacy.
