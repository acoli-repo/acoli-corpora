00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:34.466
In a democracy, power is supposed to
reside with the people, period.

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.418
Any further talk about power
and who really has it

00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:40.837
seems a little dirty,
maybe even evil.

00:00:40.837 --> 00:00:44.925
But power is no more inherently good or
evil than fire or physics.

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:47.374
It just is.

00:00:47.374 --> 00:00:49.988
It governs how any form of 
government works.

00:00:49.988 --> 00:00:53.408
It determines who gets to determine
the rules of the game.

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:56.778
So learning how power operates is key
to being effective,

00:00:56.778 --> 00:01:01.472
being taken seriously,
and not being taken advantage of.
