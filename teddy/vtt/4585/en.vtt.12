Every day you have a chance to practice,
in your neighborhood and beyond.

00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:03.296
Set objectives, then bigger ones.

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:05.874
Watch the patterns, see what works.

00:06:05.874 --> 00:06:07.737
Adapt, repeat.

00:06:07.737 --> 00:06:12.261
This is citizenship.

00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:15.424
In this short lesson, we've explored where
civic power comes from,

00:06:15.424 --> 00:06:19.167
how it works
and what you can do to exercise it.

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:22.604
One big question remaining
is the "why" of power.

00:06:22.604 --> 00:06:27.929
Do you want power to benefit everyone
or only you?

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:31.023
Are your purposes
pro-social or anti-social?
