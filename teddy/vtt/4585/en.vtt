Every day of your life,

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:15.337
you move through systems of power
that other people made.

00:00:15.337 --> 00:00:16.661
Do you sense them?

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:18.794
Do you understand power?

00:00:18.794 --> 00:00:21.047
Do you realize why it matters?

00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:24.395
Power is something we are often
uncomfortable talking about.

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:28.691
That's especially true in civic life,
how we live together in community.

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:34.466
In a democracy, power is supposed to
reside with the people, period.
