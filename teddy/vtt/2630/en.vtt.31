00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:30.196
and I grab him tight
by his janitor-man shirt collar,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.507
and I pull him to my face

00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:33.611
and he's taller than me
but the cape helps,

00:15:33.635 --> 00:15:36.028
so he listens when I look him
straight in the eyes.

00:15:36.052 --> 00:15:37.773
And I say two words to him:

00:15:38.467 --> 00:15:40.075
"Go home."

00:15:41.282 --> 00:15:42.528
And he does,

00:15:42.552 --> 00:15:45.020
checking behind his shoulder
every 10 feet.

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:47.633
And I swoosh from building
to building on his way there

00:15:47.657 --> 00:15:49.061
'cause I know where he lives.

00:15:49.085 --> 00:15:51.889
And I watch his hands tremble
as he pulls out his key chain

00:15:51.913 --> 00:15:53.622
and opens the door to his building.

00:15:53.646 --> 00:15:54.917
And I'm back in bed

00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:57.213
before he even walks in
through the front door.

00:15:57.548 --> 00:15:59.167
And I hear him turn on the faucet

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:01.447
and pour himself a glass
of warm tap water.
