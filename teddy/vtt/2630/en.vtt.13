00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:31.757
like "Win a Date with a San Diego
Chargers Cheerleader,"

00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:33.957
where you answer a question
about pop culture,

00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:35.874
and if you get it right you win a date,

00:06:35.898 --> 00:06:38.244
which was a chaperoned walk
around the parade deck

00:06:38.268 --> 00:06:40.659
with this already married,
pregnant cheerleader --

00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:41.850
(Laughter)

00:06:41.874 --> 00:06:44.254
Nothing against cheerleaders,
I love cheerleaders.

00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:47.390
The point is more, how great would it
be to have theater presented

00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:50.638
through characters that were accessible
without being condescending.

00:06:50.662 --> 00:06:53.567
So we started this nonprofit
called Arts in the Armed Forces,

00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:55.246
where we tried to do that,

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.188
tried to join these two seemingly
dissimilar communities.

00:06:58.212 --> 00:07:02.027
We pick a play or select monologues
from contemporary American plays
