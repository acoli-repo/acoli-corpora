00:04:58.413 --> 00:05:00.871
(Laughter)

00:05:00.895 --> 00:05:02.569
I was really, for the first time,

00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:04.878
discovering playwrights
and characters and plays

00:05:04.902 --> 00:05:06.865
that had nothing to do with the military,

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.244
but were somehow describing
my military experience

00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:11.815
in a way that before
to me was indescribable.

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:14.230
And I felt myself becoming less aggressive

00:05:14.254 --> 00:05:17.457
as I was able to put words
to feelings for the first time

00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:19.600
and realizing what
a valuable tool that was.

00:05:19.624 --> 00:05:22.104
And when I was reflecting
on my time in the military,

00:05:22.128 --> 00:05:24.539
I wasn't first thinking
on the stereotypical drills

00:05:24.563 --> 00:05:26.015
and discipline and pain of it;

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.253
but rather, the small,
intimate human moments,

00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:29.610
moments of great feeling:

00:05:29.634 --> 00:05:32.259
friends going AWOL
because they missed their families,
