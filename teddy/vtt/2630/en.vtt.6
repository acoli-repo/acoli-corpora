00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.728
"This coffee line is too long."

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:02.307
I was a Marine,

00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:03.482
I knew how to survive.

00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:05.444
I'd go to New York and become an actor.

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:06.729
If things didn't work out,

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.737
I'd live in Central Park
and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.

00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:10.762
(Laughter)

00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:13.476
I re-auditioned for Juilliard
and this time I was lucky,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.651
I got in.

00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:17.216
But I was surprised
by how complex the transition was

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.541
from military to civilian.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:22.040
And I was relatively healthy; I can't
imagine going through that process

00:03:22.064 --> 00:03:23.926
on top of a mental or physical injury.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.541
But regardless, it was difficult.

00:03:25.565 --> 00:03:27.735
In part, because I was in acting school --

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.296
I couldn't justify going
to voice and speech class,
