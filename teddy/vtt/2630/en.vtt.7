00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.296
I couldn't justify going
to voice and speech class,

00:03:31.757 --> 00:03:34.588
throwing imaginary balls of energy
at the back of the room,

00:03:34.612 --> 00:03:37.175
doing acting exercises
where I gave birth to myself --

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.200
(Laughter)

00:03:38.224 --> 00:03:40.958
while my friends were serving
without me overseas.

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:43.591
But also, because I didn't
know how to apply the things

00:03:43.615 --> 00:03:45.968
I learned in the military
to a civilian context.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:48.151
I mean that both practically
and emotionally.

00:03:48.175 --> 00:03:49.744
Practically, I had to get a job.

00:03:49.768 --> 00:03:51.500
And I was an Infantry Marine,

00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:54.080
where you're shooting machine guns
and firing mortars.

00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:57.651
There's not a lot of places you can
put those skills in the civilian world.

00:03:57.675 --> 00:03:58.676
(Laughter)

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.722
Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning.
