00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:01.515
it's a window into a culture

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:03.699
they otherwise would not
have had exposure to.

00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:05.742
And for the military, it's the exact same.

00:08:05.766 --> 00:08:07.753
And in doing this for the past six years,

00:08:07.777 --> 00:08:10.008
I'm always reminded
that acting is many things.

00:08:10.032 --> 00:08:13.237
It's a craft, it's a political act,
it's a business, it's --

00:08:13.888 --> 00:08:16.013
whatever adjective
is most applicable to you.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.476
But it's also a service.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.024
I didn't get to finish mine,

00:08:19.048 --> 00:08:20.680
so whenever I get to be of service

00:08:20.704 --> 00:08:23.981
to this ultimate service industry,
the military, for me, again --

00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:26.052
there's not many things better than that.

00:08:26.076 --> 00:08:27.404
Thank you.

00:08:27.428 --> 00:08:32.016
