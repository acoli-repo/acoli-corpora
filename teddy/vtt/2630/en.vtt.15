00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:31.109
as a rifle on your shoulder.

00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:33.138
And for an organization like the military,

00:07:33.162 --> 00:07:36.089
that prides itself on having
acronyms for acronyms,

00:07:36.113 --> 00:07:37.536
you can get lost in the sauce

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.242
when it comes to explaining
a collective experience.

00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:42.110
And I can think of no better community

00:07:42.134 --> 00:07:44.205
to arm with a new means of self-expression

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:46.251

00:07:46.275 --> 00:07:48.755
We've gone all over
the United States and the world,

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:51.460
from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland,

00:07:51.484 --> 00:07:53.930
to Camp Pendleton,
to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait,

00:07:53.954 --> 00:07:55.663
to USAG Bavaria,

00:07:55.687 --> 00:07:57.727
on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.

00:07:57.751 --> 00:07:59.823
And for the performing artists we bring,

00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:01.515
it's a window into a culture
