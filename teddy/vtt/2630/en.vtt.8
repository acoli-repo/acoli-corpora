00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.722
Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning.

00:04:01.103 --> 00:04:03.064
In the military, everything has meaning.

00:04:03.088 --> 00:04:05.341
Everything you do
is either steeped in tradition

00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:06.693
or has a practical purpose.

00:04:06.717 --> 00:04:08.070
You can't smoke in the field

00:04:08.094 --> 00:04:10.445
because you don't want
to give away your position.

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.764
You don't touch your face --
you have to maintain

00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:14.670
a personal level of health and hygiene.

00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:16.520
You face this way when "Colors" plays,

00:04:16.544 --> 00:04:18.734
out of respect for people
who went before you.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.898
Walk this way, talk this way
because of this.

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:22.802
Your uniform is maintained to the inch.

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:25.319
How diligently you followed
those rules spoke volumes

00:04:25.343 --> 00:04:26.978
about the kind of Marine you were.

00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:29.030
Your rank said something
about your history

00:04:29.054 --> 00:04:30.538
and the respect you had earned.
