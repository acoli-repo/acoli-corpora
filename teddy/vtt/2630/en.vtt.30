00:14:57.801 --> 00:15:01.359
Batman don't like guns 'cause his parents
got iced by guns a long time ago.

00:15:01.383 --> 00:15:02.598
But for just a second,

00:15:02.622 --> 00:15:03.940
my eyes glow white,

00:15:03.964 --> 00:15:05.123
and I hold this thing

00:15:05.147 --> 00:15:07.130
for I could speak to the good-for-nothing

00:15:07.154 --> 00:15:08.900

00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:23.025
And I pick him up,

00:15:23.049 --> 00:15:26.182
and I wipe sweat and cheap perfume
off his forehead.

00:15:26.206 --> 00:15:27.642
And he begs me not to hurt him

00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:30.196
and I grab him tight
by his janitor-man shirt collar,
