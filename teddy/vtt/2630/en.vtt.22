00:10:57.719 --> 00:11:00.549
and that mask that covers like half
my face is on, too,

00:11:00.573 --> 00:11:04.049
and I got, like, bulletproof stuff
all in my chest so no one can hurt me.

00:11:04.073 --> 00:11:05.787
And nobody -- nobody! --

00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:07.850
is gonna come between Batman ...

00:11:07.874 --> 00:11:09.053
and justice.

00:11:09.077 --> 00:11:10.879
(Drums)
(Laughter)

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:12.411
From where I am,

00:11:12.435 --> 00:11:14.022
I can hear everything.

00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:15.212
(Silence)

00:11:15.236 --> 00:11:16.396
Somewhere in the city,

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.636
there's a old lady picking
Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.510
and she's putting a piece
of sesame chicken someone spit out

00:11:22.534 --> 00:11:23.845
into her own mouth.

00:11:23.869 --> 00:11:27.178
And somewhere there's a doctor
with a wack haircut in a black lab coat

00:11:27.202 --> 00:11:29.060
trying to find a cure for the diseases

00:11:29.084 --> 00:11:32.042
that are gonna make us
all extinct for real one day.
