00:04:29.054 --> 00:04:30.538
and the respect you had earned.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.394
In the civilian world there's no rank.

00:04:32.418 --> 00:04:33.857
Here you're just another body,

00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:37.088
and I felt like I constantly had
to prove my worth all over again.

00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:40.112
And the respect civilians were giving me
while I was in uniform

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:41.762

I felt this sense of community.

00:04:47.477 --> 00:04:49.206
How often in the civilian world

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:52.982
are you put in a life-or-death situation
with your closest friends

00:04:53.006 --> 00:04:56.312
and they constantly demonstrate
that they're not going to abandon you?

00:04:56.336 --> 00:04:58.389
And meanwhile, at acting school ...

00:04:58.413 --> 00:05:00.871
