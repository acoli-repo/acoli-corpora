00:13:28.217 --> 00:13:30.453
And suddenly everything gets quiet.

00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:33.065
And the one good-for-nothing left standing

00:13:33.089 --> 00:13:35.026
grips a handgun and aims it straight up,

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.631
like he's holding Jesus hostage,

00:13:36.655 --> 00:13:39.540
like he's threatening maybe
to blow a hole in the moon.

00:13:39.564 --> 00:13:41.836
And the good-for-nothing
who got it to the head,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.128
who tried to jump-kick me,

00:13:43.152 --> 00:13:45.645
and the other good-for-nothing
who got it in the gut,

00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:48.550
is both scrambling back away
from the dark figure before 'em.

00:13:48.574 --> 00:13:50.257
And the drunk man, the janitor man,

00:13:50.281 --> 00:13:52.544
is huddled in a corner,
praying to Saint Anthony

00:13:52.568 --> 00:13:54.684
'cause that's the only one
he could remember.

00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:55.709
(Double beat)

00:13:55.733 --> 00:13:56.885
And there's me:

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.680
eyes glowing white,

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:00.711
cape blowing softly in the wind.
