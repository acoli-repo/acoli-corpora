00:05:29.634 --> 00:05:32.259
friends going AWOL
because they missed their families,

00:05:32.283 --> 00:05:33.518
friends getting divorced,

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.540
grieving together, celebrating together,

00:05:35.564 --> 00:05:37.499
all within the backdrop of the military.

00:05:37.523 --> 00:05:39.805
I saw my friends battling
these circumstances,

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:42.860
and I watched the anxiety
it produced in them and me,

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:45.470
not being able to express
our feelings about it.

00:05:46.026 --> 00:05:49.074
The military and theater communities
are actually very similar.

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:51.823
You have a group of people
trying to accomplish a mission

00:05:51.847 --> 00:05:53.910
greater than themselves;
it's not about you.

00:05:53.934 --> 00:05:56.902
You have a role, you have to know
your role within that team.

00:05:56.926 --> 00:05:59.085
Every team has a leader or director;

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.659
sometimes they're smart,
sometimes they're not.
