00:02:28.362 --> 00:02:31.295
Those never in the military
may find this hard to understand,

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.382
but being told I wasn't getting deployed
to Iraq or Afghanistan

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:35.849
was very devastating for me.

00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:39.114
I have a very clear image of leaving
the base hospital on a stretcher

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:42.008
and my entire platoon is waiting
outside to see if I was OK.

00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:44.466
And then, suddenly,
I was a civilian again.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.695
I knew I wanted to give
acting another shot,

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.523
because -- again, this is me --

00:02:48.547 --> 00:02:52.266
I thought all civilian problems
are small compared to the military.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.047
I mean, what can you really
bitch about now, you know?

00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:56.243
"It's hot.

00:02:56.672 --> 00:02:58.904
Someone should turn
on the air conditioner."

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.728
"This coffee line is too long."
