00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:31.244
in the small town I was raised in
in Northern Indiana,

00:00:31.268 --> 00:00:32.426
called Mishawaka.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.028
I can spell that later
for people who are interested --

00:00:35.052 --> 00:00:36.056
(Laughter)

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.940
Mishawaka is many good things
but cultural hub of the world it is not,

00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:41.860
so my only exposure to theater and film

00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:44.013
was limited to the plays
I did in high school

00:00:44.037 --> 00:00:46.265
and Blockbuster Video,
may she rest in peace.

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.461
(Laughter)

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:49.132
I was serious enough about acting

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:52.464
that I auditioned for Juilliard
when I was a senior in high school,

00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:53.639
didn't get in,

00:00:53.663 --> 00:00:56.389
determined college wasn't for me
and applied nowhere else,

00:00:56.413 --> 00:00:57.706
which was a genius move.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.181
I also did that Hail Mary
LA acting odyssey
