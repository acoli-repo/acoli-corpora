00:10:29.272 --> 00:10:30.273
(Beat)

00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:31.851
Ever.
(Double beat)

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:34.312
'Cause all Batman really wants
to do is save people

00:10:34.336 --> 00:10:36.083
and maybe pay abuela's bills one day

00:10:36.107 --> 00:10:37.258
and die happy.

00:10:37.282 --> 00:10:39.478
And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real.

00:10:39.502 --> 00:10:40.513
(Laughter)

00:10:40.537 --> 00:10:41.874
Oh -- and kill the Joker.

00:10:41.898 --> 00:10:43.358
(Drum roll)

00:10:43.382 --> 00:10:46.040
Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone.

00:10:46.064 --> 00:10:48.257
And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:49.463
like a eagle

00:10:49.487 --> 00:10:50.657
or like a --

00:10:50.681 --> 00:10:52.390
no, yeah, like a eagle.

00:10:52.414 --> 00:10:53.415
(Laughter)

00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:56.257
And my cape is flapping in the wind
cause it's frickin' long

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.695
and my pointy ears are on,

00:10:57.719 --> 00:11:00.549
and that mask that covers like half
my face is on, too,
