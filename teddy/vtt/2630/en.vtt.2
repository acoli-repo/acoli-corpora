00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.181
I also did that Hail Mary
LA acting odyssey

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:02.840
that I always heard stories about,

00:01:02.864 --> 00:01:05.165
of actors moving to LA
with, like, seven dollars

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.132
and finding work and successful careers.

00:01:07.156 --> 00:01:10.512
I got as far as Amarillo, Texas,
before my car broke down.

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:12.263
I spent all my money repairing it,

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:13.932
finally made it to Santa Monica --

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:15.234
not even LA --

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:17.917
stayed for 48 hours wandering
the beach, basically,

00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:19.227
got in my car, drove home,

00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:20.957
thus ending my acting career, so --

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:22.259
(Laughter)

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:24.171
Seventeen, Mishawaka ...

00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:28.023
parents' house, paying rent,
selling vacuums ...

00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:29.602
telemarketing,

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:31.809
cutting grass at the local
4-H fairgrounds.
