sometimes they're smart,
sometimes they're not.

00:06:01.683 --> 00:06:04.287
You're forced to be intimate
with complete strangers

00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:05.596
in a short amount of time;

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.667
the self-discipline, the self-maintenance.

00:06:08.132 --> 00:06:10.615
I thought, how great would it be
to create a space

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.966
that combined these two seemingly
dissimilar communities,

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.225
that brought entertainment
to a group of people

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:18.344
that, considering their occupation,

00:06:18.368 --> 00:06:20.812
could handle something
a bit more thought-provoking

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:22.669
than the typical mandatory-fun events

00:06:22.693 --> 00:06:25.754
that I remember being
"volun-told" to go to in the military --

00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:26.780
(Laughter)

00:06:26.804 --> 00:06:29.082
all well-intended but slightly
offensive events,

00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:31.757
like "Win a Date with a San Diego
Chargers Cheerleader,"
