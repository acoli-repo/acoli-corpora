00:01:58.788 --> 00:02:01.429
for the thing I was looking
for the least when I joined,

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:02.614
which was the people:

00:02:02.638 --> 00:02:06.218
these weird dudes --
a motley crew of characters

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:08.624
from a cross section
of the United States --

00:02:08.648 --> 00:02:10.979
that on the surface I had
nothing in common with.

00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:12.611
And over time,

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:14.461
all the political and personal bravado

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:16.362
that led me to the military dissolved,

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.368
and for me, the Marine Corps
became synonymous with my friends.

00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:21.680
And then, a few years into my service

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:23.783
and months away from deploying to Iraq,

00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:26.672
I dislocated my sternum
in a mountain-biking accident,

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:28.338
and had to be medically separated.

00:02:28.362 --> 00:02:31.295
Those never in the military
may find this hard to understand,
