00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:31.175
And I see janitor man mumble something
in drunk language and turn pale,

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:32.376
and from 87 stories up,

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.508
I can hear his stomach trying
to hurl its way out his Dickies.

00:12:35.532 --> 00:12:37.413
So I swoop down, like, mad-fast

00:12:37.437 --> 00:12:40.452
and I'm like darkness, I'm like, "Swoosh!"

00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:42.931
And I throw a batarang
at the one naked lightbulb.

00:12:42.955 --> 00:12:43.994
(Cymbal)

00:12:44.018 --> 00:12:46.146
And they're all like, "Whoa, muthafucker!

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.761
Who just turned out the lights?"

00:12:47.785 --> 00:12:48.786
(Laughter)

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.479
"What's that over there?"
"What?"

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:52.096
"Gimme me what you got, old man!"

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.286
"Did anybody hear that?"

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.150
"Hear what? There ain't nothing.
No, really -- there ain't no bat!"

00:12:57.174 --> 00:12:58.401
But then ...

00:12:58.425 --> 00:13:01.904
one out of the three good-for-nothings
gets it to the head -- pow!
