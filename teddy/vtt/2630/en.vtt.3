00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:31.809
cutting grass at the local
4-H fairgrounds.

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:34.125
This was my world
going into September, 2001.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.300
So after the 11th,

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:37.526
and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.901
and just being pissed off
in general -- at myself,

00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:41.321
my parents, the government;

00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:43.798
not having confidence,
not having a respectable job,

00:01:43.822 --> 00:01:46.924
my shitty mini-fridge that I just
drove to California and back --

00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:49.921
I joined the Marine Corps and loved it.
I loved being a Marine.

00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:52.983
It's one of the things I'm most proud
of having done in my life.

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:54.173
Firing weapons was cool,

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.632
driving and detonating
expensive things was great.

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:58.764
But I found I loved
the Marine Corps the most

00:01:58.788 --> 00:02:01.429
for the thing I was looking
for the least when I joined,
