00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:02.636
Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.970
and the sky is glowing
like mad, radioactive red.

00:09:04.994 --> 00:09:07.116
And if you squint,
you can maybe see the moon

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.006
through a thick layer of cigarette smoke
and airplane exhaust

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.321
that covers the whole city,

00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:13.643
like a mosquito net
that won't let the angels in.

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:14.707
(Drum beat)

00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:16.217
And if you look up high enough,

00:09:16.241 --> 00:09:19.678
you can see me standing
on the edge of an 87-story building.

00:09:19.702 --> 00:09:23.129
And up there, a place for gargoyles
and broken clock towers

00:09:23.153 --> 00:09:26.129
that have stayed still and dead
for maybe like 100 years,

00:09:26.153 --> 00:09:27.664
up there is me.

00:09:27.688 --> 00:09:28.718
(Beat)

00:09:28.742 --> 00:09:30.326
And I'm frickin' Batman.
