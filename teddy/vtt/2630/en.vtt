00:00:01.227 --> 00:00:03.275
I was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company,

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:04.450
81's platoon,

00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:06.479
out in Camp Pendleton, California.

00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:07.655
Oorah!

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:08.831
Audience: Oorah!

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:09.856
(Laughter)

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.848
I joined a few months after September 11,

00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:14.891
feeling like I think most people
in the country did at the time,

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:18.200
filled with a sense
of patriotism and retribution

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:19.866
and the desire to do something --

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.635
that, coupled with that fact
that I wasn't doing anything.

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:25.905
I was 17, just graduated
from high school that past summer,

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.631
living in the back room
of my parents' house paying rent,

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:31.244
in the small town I was raised in
in Northern Indiana,
