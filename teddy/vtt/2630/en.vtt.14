WEBVTT

00:06:58.212 --> 00:07:02.027
We pick a play or select monologues
from contemporary American plays

00:07:02.051 --> 00:07:05.725
that are diverse in age and race
like a military audience is,

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:08.098
grab a group of incredible
theater-trained actors,

00:07:08.122 --> 00:07:09.975
arm them with incredible material,

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:12.219
keep production value
as minimal as possible --

00:07:12.243 --> 00:07:15.279
no sets, no costumes,
no lights, just reading it --

00:07:15.303 --> 00:07:17.782
to throw all the emphasis on the language

00:07:17.806 --> 00:07:20.521
and to show that theater can
be created at any setting.

00:07:20.545 --> 00:07:21.725
It's a powerful thing,

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:24.635
getting in a room with complete strangers

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:27.307
and reminding ourselves of our humanity,

00:07:27.331 --> 00:07:29.728
and that self-expression
is just as valuable a tool

00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:31.109
as a rifle on your shoulder.
