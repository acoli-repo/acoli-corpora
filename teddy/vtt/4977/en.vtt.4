00:01:58.454 --> 00:02:01.524
and just look at the 
process of egg fusion,

00:02:01.524 --> 00:02:04.984
we might notice something that 
will make this problem simpler.

00:02:04.984 --> 00:02:06.614
When two eggs fuse,

00:02:06.614 --> 00:02:10.844
the number of eggs of each of those 
colors decreases by one,

00:02:10.844 --> 00:02:14.284
and the number of the third 
color increases by one.

00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:17.014
That means they all change parity,

00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:20.814
or evenness and oddness, 
at the same time.

00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:25.954
Right now all three piles are odd, 
but you get to add an egg to one color,

00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:30.154
which means that it’ll be even 
and the other two will be odd.
