It takes 100 eggs to make a single 
animal in genus Wuddly.

00:00:32.524 --> 00:00:35.603
When 100 eggs are placed together 
in an incubator,

00:00:35.603 --> 00:00:40.583
they undergo egg fusion, and combine 
in the following way.

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:43.523
Blue and purple combine to make red eggs.

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:46.313
Red and blue combine to make purple eggs,

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:49.643
and red and purple 
combine to make blue eggs.

00:00:49.643 --> 00:00:52.523
The most plentiful eggs pair up first,

00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:54.253
and if two piles are even,

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:57.253
an egg comes from one of them at random.

00:00:57.253 --> 00:01:00.243
They keep combining until 
there’s just one left.
