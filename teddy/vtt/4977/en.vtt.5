00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:30.154
which means that it’ll be even 
and the other two will be odd.

00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:31.766
Whichever color you choose

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:36.356
will always be the opposite parity 
of the other two piles:

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:39.028
odd when they’re even and 
even when they’re odd,

00:02:39.028 --> 00:02:43.998
since every egg fusion flips each pile’s 
parity simultaneously.

00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:51.163
We want to end with 1 blue, 0 purple,
and 0 red eggs, or odd, even, even.

00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:54.843
That means we want the blue egg pile 
to be the opposite parity

00:02:54.843 --> 00:02:58.353
of the other two piles 
at the start as well.

00:02:58.353 --> 00:03:00.733
So you add a blue egg into the room,
