I'm a physicist,

00:02:32.732 --> 00:02:36.669
and so I wondered, could we take
a physics-based approach --

00:02:36.693 --> 00:02:38.584
a different approach to this problem.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.122
And in that context,

00:02:41.146 --> 00:02:43.797
the first thing we know for sure,

00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:47.154
is that we actually know how to kill
every kind of microbe,

00:02:47.178 --> 00:02:48.767
every kind of virus,

00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:50.422
every kind of bacteria.

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.037
And that's with ultraviolet light.

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:56.326
We've actually known this
for more than 100 years.

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:59.569
I think you all know
what ultraviolet light is.

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:02.632
It's part of a spectrum
that includes infrared,
