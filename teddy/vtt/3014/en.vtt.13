00:06:31.397 --> 00:06:32.563
So that's the theory.

00:06:32.587 --> 00:06:35.299
It should work, should be safe.

00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:37.516
What about in practice?

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.691
Does it really work?

00:06:38.715 --> 00:06:40.093
Is it really safe?

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.005
So that's actually what our lab
has been working on

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:45.246
the past five or six years,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.119
and I'm delighted to say the answer
to both these questions

00:06:48.143 --> 00:06:49.324
is an emphatic yes.

00:06:49.348 --> 00:06:50.628
Yes, it does work,

00:06:50.652 --> 00:06:52.031
but yes, it is safe.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.233
So I'm delighted to say that,

00:06:54.257 --> 00:06:56.496
but actually I'm not very
surprised to say that,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.791
because it's purely the laws
of physics at work.
