00:01:57.316 --> 00:02:00.452
if we carry on on the path we're going,

00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:04.102
which is basically a drugs-based
approach to the problem,

00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:06.722
the best estimate
by the middle of this century

00:02:06.746 --> 00:02:11.596
is that the worldwide death toll
from superbugs will be 10 million.

00:02:12.126 --> 00:02:13.563
10 million.

00:02:13.947 --> 00:02:16.758
Just to put that in context,
that's actually more

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:20.317
than the number of people
that died of cancer worldwide last year.

00:02:20.954 --> 00:02:25.010
So it seems pretty clear
that we're not on a good road,

00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:28.947
and the drugs-based approach
to this problem is not working.
