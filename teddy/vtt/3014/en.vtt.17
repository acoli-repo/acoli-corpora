00:08:29.952 --> 00:08:32.899
and what are the remaining obstacles
to trying to roll out

00:08:32.923 --> 00:08:34.303
and realize this dream?

00:08:34.678 --> 00:08:37.869
David Brenner: Well, I think we now know
that it kills all bacteria,

00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:39.948
but we sort of knew
that before we started,

00:08:39.972 --> 00:08:42.150
but we certainly tested that.

00:08:42.174 --> 00:08:44.888
So we have to do lots and lots
of tests about safety,

00:08:44.912 --> 00:08:48.435
and so it's more about safety
than it is about efficacy.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.244
And we need to do short-term tests,

00:08:51.268 --> 00:08:53.271
and we need to do long-term tests

00:08:53.295 --> 00:08:57.178
to make sure you can't develop
melanoma many years on.

00:08:57.494 --> 00:09:01.374
So those studies
are pretty well done at this point.
