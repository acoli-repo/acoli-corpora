00:03:59.988 --> 00:04:01.419
cause skin cancer,

00:04:01.443 --> 00:04:02.954
it can damage cells in our eye,

00:04:02.978 --> 00:04:06.466
cause eye diseases like cataract.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.945
So you can't use conventional,
germicidal, ultraviolet light

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:11.698
when there are people are around.

00:04:11.722 --> 00:04:12.937
And of course,

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.991
we want to sterilize mostly
when there are people around.

00:04:16.929 --> 00:04:19.596
So the ideal ultraviolet light

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.303
would actually be able
to kill all bacteria,

00:04:23.327 --> 00:04:24.863
including superbugs,

00:04:24.887 --> 00:04:27.401
but would be safe for human exposure.

00:04:28.312 --> 00:04:32.559
And actually that's where my physics
background kicked into this story.
