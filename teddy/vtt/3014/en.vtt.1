In the back, in the red shirt,

00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:32.004
well, that's me,

00:00:32.028 --> 00:00:36.559
and next to me in the red hat,
that's my friend Paul Rice.

00:00:37.168 --> 00:00:40.590
So a couple of years
after this picture was taken,

00:00:40.614 --> 00:00:44.451
Paul went into hospital
for some minor surgery,

00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:48.748
and he developed
a superbug-related infection,

00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:50.076
and he died.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:53.174
And I was truly shocked.

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.612
He was a healthy guy in the prime of life.

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:57.904
So there and then,

00:00:57.928 --> 00:01:01.484
and actually with a lot of encouragement
from a couple of TEDsters,
