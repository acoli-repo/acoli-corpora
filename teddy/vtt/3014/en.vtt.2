00:00:57.928 --> 00:01:01.484
and actually with a lot of encouragement
from a couple of TEDsters,

00:01:01.508 --> 00:01:04.719
I declared my own
personal war on superbugs.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.711
So let's talk about superbugs
for a moment.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.119
The story actually starts in the 1940s

00:01:12.143 --> 00:01:15.214
with the widespread
introduction of antibiotics.

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:17.324
And since then,

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:21.884
drug-resistant bacteria
have continued to emerge,

00:01:21.908 --> 00:01:25.329
and so we've been forced to develop
newer and newer drugs

00:01:25.353 --> 00:01:27.225
to fight these new bacteria.

00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:33.956
And this vicious cycle
actually is the origin of superbugs,
