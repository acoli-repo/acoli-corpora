00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:02.632
It's part of a spectrum
that includes infrared,

00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:04.102
it includes visible light,

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:08.058
and the short-wavelength part
of this group is ultraviolet light.

00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:12.696
The key thing from our perspective here

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.908
is that ultraviolet light kills bacteria
by a completely different mechanism

00:03:17.932 --> 00:03:19.805
from the way drugs kill bacteria.

00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:26.393
So ultraviolet light is just as capable
of killing a drug-resistant bacteria

00:03:26.417 --> 00:03:28.641
as any other bacteria,

00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:33.143
and because ultraviolet light
is so good at killing all bugs,
