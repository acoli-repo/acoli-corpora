00:04:28.312 --> 00:04:32.559
And actually that's where my physics
background kicked into this story.

00:04:33.296 --> 00:04:35.488
Together with my physics colleagues,

00:04:35.512 --> 00:04:41.587
we realized there actually is a particular
wavelength of ultraviolet light

00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:44.104
that should kill all bacteria,

00:04:44.128 --> 00:04:46.288
but should be safe for human exposure.

00:04:46.928 --> 00:04:50.246
That wavelength is called far-UVC light,

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.564
and it's just the short-wavelength part
of the ultraviolet spectrum.

00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:57.506
So let's see how that would work.

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:02.235
