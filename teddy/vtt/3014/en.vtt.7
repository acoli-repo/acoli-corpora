and because ultraviolet light
is so good at killing all bugs,

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:36.302
it's actually used a lot these days
to sterilize rooms,

00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:39.374
sterilize working surfaces.

What you see here is a surgical theater

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.581
being sterilized with germicidal
ultraviolet light.

00:03:47.578 --> 00:03:50.055

00:03:54.028 --> 00:03:57.615
Ultraviolet light
is actually a health hazard,

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.964
so it can damage cells in our skin,

00:03:59.988 --> 00:04:01.419
cause skin cancer,
