00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:02.235
What you're seeing here
is the surface of our skin,

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.602
and I'm going to superimpose on that
some bacteria in the air above the skin.

00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:09.203
Now we're going to see what happens

00:05:09.227 --> 00:05:14.370
when conventional, germicidal,
ultraviolet light impinges on this.

00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:16.781
So what you see is,

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:22.091
as we know, germicidal light
is really good at killing bacteria,

00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:23.425
but what you also see

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.792
is that it penetrates
into the upper layers of our skin,

00:05:26.816 --> 00:05:29.368
and it can damage
those key cells in our skin

00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:32.597
which ultimately, when damaged,
can lead to skin cancer.
