far-UVC light is incredibly, strongly
absorbed by all biological materials,

00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:03.357
so it simply can't go very far.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.637
Now, viruses and bacteria
are really, really, really small,

00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:13.527
so the far-UVC light can certainly
penetrate them and kill them,

00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:16.935
but what it can't do
is penetrate into skin,

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:19.361
and it can't even penetrate
the dead-cell area

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:21.207
right at the very surface of our skin.

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:28.137
So far-UVC light
should be able to kill bacteria,

00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:29.431
but kill them safely.
