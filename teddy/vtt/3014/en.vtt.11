00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:32.597
which ultimately, when damaged,
can lead to skin cancer.

00:05:34.108 --> 00:05:36.956
So let's compare now with far-UVC light --

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.140
same situation,

00:05:38.164 --> 00:05:40.646
skin and some bacteria
in the air above them.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.594
So what you're seeing now

00:05:43.618 --> 00:05:48.414
is that again, far-UVC light's
perfectly fine at killing bacteria,

00:05:48.438 --> 00:05:52.525
but what far-UVC light can't do
is penetrate into our skin.

00:05:53.318 --> 00:05:56.033
And there's a good,
solid physics reason for that:

00:05:56.057 --> 00:06:01.421
far-UVC light is incredibly, strongly
absorbed by all biological materials,
