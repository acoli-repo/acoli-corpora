These days, I find it easy
to look in the mirror.

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:06.956
This used to be the case, too,

00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:09.436
because I learned
to be a drag queen alone,

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:12.436
Back then, in the early noughties,

00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:14.876
there was no cultural mirror
for someone like me.

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:17.916
There was no chance
of switching on Netflix

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:19.876
and finding someone who looks like you,

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:23.596
and Lily Savage never quite made it
to the Woolworths bargain bin

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:26.756
if she ever made it
to the dizzying heights of VHS at all.

00:00:27.196 --> 00:00:29.116
So there was me and a mirror,

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:32.716
and that's the only place
I saw myself for a long time.
