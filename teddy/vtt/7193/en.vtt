00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:04.676
I grew up in Australia's
Tropical North Queensland,

00:00:04.716 --> 00:00:06.476
fishing frogs from the toilet

00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:08.956
and dodging snakes
that hung from the ceiling.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:13.996
Wetting down old sea turtles
stranded at low tide outside our house.

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:18.076
I spent more time outside than in,

00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:20.916
delighting in the wonders of nature.

00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:25.276
By age 11, I wasn't allowed
to watch horror films,

00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:28.436
so I turned to documentaries instead.

00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:33.356
"The Cove," "Food, Inc,"
"An Inconvenient Truth."
