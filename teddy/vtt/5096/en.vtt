Do you remember when you first realized

00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:18.635
that your computer was more

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.718
than just a monitor and keyboard?

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:23.301
That between the mouse click
and the video playing,

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:25.659
there was something
that captured your intention,

00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:26.404
understood it,

00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:27.880
and made it real?

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.246
What is that something?
