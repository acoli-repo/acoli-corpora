Historians have suggested that the tale 
of Sisyphus may stem from ancient myths

00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:51.238
about the rising and setting sun, 
or other natural cycles.

00:03:51.238 --> 00:03:55.717

to endlessly repeat a futile task

00:03:55.717 --> 00:04:00.533
has resonated as an allegory 
about the human condition.
