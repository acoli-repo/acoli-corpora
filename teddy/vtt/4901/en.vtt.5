the shores of the river Styx.

00:02:32.043 --> 00:02:35.884
Now back among the dead, 
Sisyphus approached Persephone,

00:02:35.884 --> 00:02:38.321
queen of the Underworld, and complained

00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:44.034
that his wife had disrespected him 
by not giving him a proper burial.

00:02:44.034 --> 00:02:48.438
Persephone granted him permission to go
back to the land of living

00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:54.397
and punish Merope, on the condition that 
he would return when he was done.

00:02:54.397 --> 00:02:58.065
Of course, Sisyphus refused 
to keep his promise,

00:02:58.065 --> 00:03:03.874
now having twice escaped death
by tricking the gods.
