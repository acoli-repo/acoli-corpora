00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.106
With Thanatos trapped, no one could die, 
and the world was thrown into chaos.

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:07.815
Things only returned to normal 
when the god of war Ares,

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:14.192
upset that battles were no longer fun, 
freed Thanatos from his chains.

00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:18.203
Sisyphus knew his reckoning was at hand.

00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:21.545
But he had another trick up his sleeve.

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:27.574
Before dying, he asked his wife Merope
to throw his body in the public square,

00:02:27.574 --> 00:02:32.043
from where it eventually washed up on 
the shores of the river Styx.
