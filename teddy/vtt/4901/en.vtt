00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.839
Whether it’s being chained to a burning 
wheel, turned into a spider,

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.920
or having an eagle eat one’s liver,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.625
Greek mythology is filled 
with stories of the gods

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:23.377
inflicting gruesome horrors 
on mortals who angered them.

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:26.384
Yet one of their most famous 
punishments is not remembered

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:33.212
for its outrageous cruelty, 
but for its disturbing familiarity.
