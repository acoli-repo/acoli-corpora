00:01:25.095 --> 00:01:30.043
the king told Asopus which way 
Zeus had taken the girl.

00:01:30.043 --> 00:01:35.687
When Zeus found out, he was so furious
that he ordered Thanatos, or Death,

00:01:35.687 --> 00:01:42.417
to chain Sisyphus in the underworld 
so he couldn’t cause any more problems.

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:46.691
But Sisyphus lived up to 
his crafty reputation.

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:48.289
As he was about to be imprisoned,

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.917
the king asked Thanatos to show him 
how the chains worked

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:57.880
– and quickly bound him instead, 
before escaping back among the living.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.106
With Thanatos trapped, no one could die, 
and the world was thrown into chaos.
