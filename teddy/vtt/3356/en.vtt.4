and found him sitting hunched over
on the ground wearing a onesie --

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.000
those kinds of outfits
that zip in the back.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.976
I watched him for about an hour
as he yanked at it,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.400
trying to find a way out of this thing.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.856
And it's supposed to be practical,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.040
but to me it looked like a straightjacket.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.280
And so I ran out.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.080
I left him there.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.696
I sat in my truck -- his old truck --

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.336
hunched over,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.560
this really deep guttural cry
coming out of the pit of my belly.
