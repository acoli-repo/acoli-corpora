00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.936
"You don't want
to live the rest of your life

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.776
knowing that you killed your father.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.896
And you'd be arrested I think,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.496
because he can't condone it.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.776
And you don't even know
how to buy heroin."

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.816
(Laughter)

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.096
It's true, I don't.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.480
(Laughter)

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.256
The truth is we talk
about his death a lot.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.280
When will it happen? What will it be like?

00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:52.376
But I wish that we would have talked
about death when we were all healthy.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.880
What does my best death look like?

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.960
What does your best death look like?

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.840
But my family didn't know to do that.
