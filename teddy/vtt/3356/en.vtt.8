00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.840
But my family didn't know to do that.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.200
And my sister was right.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.760
I shouldn't murder Dad with heroin,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.760
but I've got to get him out of that body.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.920
So I went to a psychic.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.856
And then a priest,
and then a support group,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.495
and they all said the same thing:

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.616
sometimes people hang on
when they're worried about loved ones.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.840
Just tell them you're safe,
and it's OK to go when you're ready.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.840
So I went to see Dad.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.336
I found him hunched over
on the ground in the onesie.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.376
He was staring past me
and just kind of looking at the ground.
