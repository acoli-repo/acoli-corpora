00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.972
a place that had terrestrial
sedimentary rocks of the right age,

00:06:01.996 --> 00:06:03.199
in a desert,

00:06:03.223 --> 00:06:06.485
a place that had been barely visited
by paleontologists.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:08.469
And we found this.

00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:11.319
This is a femur, a thigh bone,

00:06:11.343 --> 00:06:13.712

Now, unfortunately,
that bone was isolated.

00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:24.970
We dug and dug and dug,
and there wasn't another bone around.

00:06:24.994 --> 00:06:27.689
But it made us hungry to go back
the next year for more.

00:06:27.713 --> 00:06:30.316
And on the first day
of that next field season,
