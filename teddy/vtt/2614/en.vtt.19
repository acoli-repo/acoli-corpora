And then came the long ...

00:09:36.044 --> 00:09:37.273

00:09:37.868 --> 00:09:41.186
Epoch after epoch of sameness,

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.154
nonevents without number.

00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:46.923
All the while, the skeleton lay
everlasting and unchanging

00:09:46.947 --> 00:09:49.310
in perfect equilibrium

00:09:49.334 --> 00:09:51.047
within its rocky grave.

00:09:54.036 --> 00:09:56.683
The dinosaurs would reign
for another 12 million years

00:09:56.707 --> 00:10:00.971
before their hegemony was snuffed out
in a fiery apocalypse.
