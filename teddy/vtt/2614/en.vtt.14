00:06:59.513 --> 00:07:02.509
Dreadnoughtus was 85 feet
from snout to tail.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.708
It stood two-and-a-half stories
at the shoulder,

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:10.401
and all fleshed out in life,
it weighed 65 tons.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.872
People ask me sometimes,
"Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?"

00:07:14.896 --> 00:07:17.680
That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.709
Now, one of the really cool things
about being a paleontologist

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.502
is when you find a new species,
you get to name it.

00:07:24.526 --> 00:07:28.360
And I've always thought it a shame
that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs

00:07:28.384 --> 00:07:32.863
are too often portrayed as passive,
lumbering platters of meat
