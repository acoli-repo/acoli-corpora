00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:02.329
or, "If we go up over that hill,
we should find the Cretaceous."

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.984
So now, if you want to find trilobites,

00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:08.137
get yourself a good geological map

00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:10.412
and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic.

00:04:11.023 --> 00:04:13.342
If you want to find dinosaurs like I do,

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:16.420
find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there.

00:04:17.217 --> 00:04:20.316
Now of course, you can only make
a fossil in a sedimentary rock,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.989
a rock made by sand and mud.

00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:23.656
You can't have a fossil

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.004
in an igneous rock formed
by magma, like a granite,

00:04:27.028 --> 00:04:30.090
or in a metamorphic rock
that's been heated and squeezed.
