00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.310
That animal would have been
incredibly dangerous,

00:08:01.334 --> 00:08:06.055
a menace to all around, and itself
would have had nothing to fear.

00:08:06.507 --> 00:08:08.732
And thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus,"

00:08:08.756 --> 00:08:10.457
or, "fears nothing."

00:08:12.047 --> 00:08:13.213
Now, to grow so large,

00:08:13.237 --> 00:08:15.849
an animal like Dreadnoughtus
would've had to have been

00:08:15.873 --> 00:08:17.030
a model of efficiency.

00:08:17.054 --> 00:08:20.817
That long neck and long tail help it
radiate heat into the environment,

00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:23.379
passively controlling its temperature.

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:26.908
And that long neck also serves
as a super-efficient feeding mechanism.

00:08:26.932 --> 00:08:29.712
Dreadnoughtus could stand
in one place and with that neck

00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:32.028
clear out a huge envelope of vegetation,
