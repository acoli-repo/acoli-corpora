00:04:27.028 --> 00:04:30.090
or in a metamorphic rock
that's been heated and squeezed.

00:04:30.773 --> 00:04:32.908
And you have to get yourself in a desert.

00:04:33.378 --> 00:04:36.459
It's not that dinosaurs
particularly lived in deserts;

00:04:36.483 --> 00:04:38.047
they lived on every land mass

00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:40.128
and in every imaginable environment.

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:43.541
It's that you need to go to a place
that's a desert today,

00:04:43.565 --> 00:04:46.739
a place that doesn't have
too many plants covering up the rocks,

00:04:46.763 --> 00:04:50.643
and a place where erosion is always
exposing new bones at the surface.

00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:52.835
So find those three things:

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.414
rocks of the right age,

00:04:54.438 --> 00:04:57.487
that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert,

00:04:57.511 --> 00:04:59.068
and get yourself on the ground,

00:04:59.092 --> 00:05:00.604
and you literally walk
