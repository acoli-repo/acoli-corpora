00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:33.354
Find those three things
and get yourself on the ground,

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:35.783
chances are good
that you will find fossils.

00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:38.403
Now let me break down this formula.

00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:43.183
Organisms exist only during certain
geological intervals.

00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:45.637
So you have to find
rocks of the right age,

00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.829
depending on what your interests are.

00:00:47.853 --> 00:00:49.363
If you want to find trilobites,

00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:52.538
you have to find the really,
really old rocks of the Paleozoic --

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:55.867
rocks between a half a billion
and a quarter-billion years old.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.394
Now, if you want to find dinosaurs,

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:00.775
don't look in the Paleozoic,
you won't find them.
