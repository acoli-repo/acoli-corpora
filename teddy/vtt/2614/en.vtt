How do you find a dinosaur?

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:05.753
Sounds impossible, doesn't it?

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.945
It's not.

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:12.195
And the answer relies on a formula
that all paleontologists use.

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:14.674
And I'm going to tell you the secret.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.290
First, find rocks of the right age.

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:23.320
Second, those rocks
must be sedimentary rocks.

00:00:23.863 --> 00:00:28.303
And third, layers of those rocks
must be naturally exposed.

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:29.919
That's it.

00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:33.354
Find those three things
and get yourself on the ground,
