and dance and music

00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:39.000
and science

00:10:39.793 --> 00:10:44.322
and rocket ships that would eventually
take 12 particularly excellent apes

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:46.197
to the surface of the Moon.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.539

00:10:54.494 --> 00:10:58.532

00:10:58.556 --> 00:11:01.508
buried beneath the badlands
of Southern Patagonia.
