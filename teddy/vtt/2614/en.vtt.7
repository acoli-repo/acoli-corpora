00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.636
that our blinders were removed,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.054
first, with the publication
of James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth,"

00:03:35.078 --> 00:03:38.950
in which he told us that the Earth
reveals no vestige of a beginning

00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:40.752
and no prospect of an end;

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:45.491
and then, with the printing
of William Smith's map of Britain,

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:47.700
the first country-scale geological map,

00:03:47.724 --> 00:03:49.090
giving us for the first time

00:03:49.114 --> 00:03:53.042
predictive insight into where
certain types of rocks might occur.

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:55.527
After that, you could say things like,

00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:58.554
"If we go over there,
we should be in the Jurassic,"

00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:02.329
or, "If we go up over that hill,
we should find the Cretaceous."
