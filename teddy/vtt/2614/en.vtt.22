00:10:58.556 --> 00:11:01.508
buried beneath the badlands
of Southern Patagonia.

00:11:02.614 --> 00:11:03.865
I was that ape.

00:11:05.038 --> 00:11:07.981
And standing there, alone in the desert,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.791
it was not lost on me

00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:13.445
that the chance of any one individual
entering the fossil record

00:11:13.469 --> 00:11:15.142
is vanishingly small.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:18.087
But the Earth is very, very old.

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:22.371
And over vast tracts of time,
the improbable becomes the probable.

00:11:22.395 --> 00:11:25.086
That's the magic of the geological record.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.292
Thus, multitudinous creatures
living and dying on an old planet

00:11:28.316 --> 00:11:30.243
leave behind immense numbers of fossils,
