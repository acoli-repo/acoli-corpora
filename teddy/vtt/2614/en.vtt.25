00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:31.061
innumerable forks in the road
led us to this very particular reality.

The bones of Dreadnoughtus
lay underground for 77 million years.

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:38.070
Who could have imagined

00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:41.058
that a single species of shrew-like mammal

00:12:41.082 --> 00:12:43.126
living in the cracks of the dinosaur world

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.202
would evolve into sentient beings

00:12:45.226 --> 00:12:47.582
capable of characterizing
and understanding

00:12:47.606 --> 00:12:50.613
the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?

00:12:52.775 --> 00:12:55.798
I once stood at the head
of the Missouri River

00:12:57.107 --> 00:12:58.488
and bestraddled it.

00:12:59.123 --> 00:13:01.325
There, it's nothing more
than a gurgle of water
