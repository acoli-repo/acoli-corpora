00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.354
But go up into the Bitterroots
and look at the Missouri,

00:13:33.378 --> 00:13:37.848
and human prospection does not
allow us to see it as anything special.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.984
Now go back to the Cretaceous Period

00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:43.453
and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.

00:13:43.477 --> 00:13:44.914
You would never guess

00:13:44.938 --> 00:13:47.015
that they would amount
to anything special,

00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:48.687
and they probably wouldn't have,

00:13:48.711 --> 00:13:50.948
were it not for that pesky asteroid.

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:55.158
Now, make a thousand more worlds
and a thousand more solar systems

00:13:55.182 --> 00:13:56.468
and let them run.

00:13:57.047 --> 00:13:59.201
You will never get the same result.

00:13:59.225 --> 00:14:02.630
No doubt, those worlds would be
both amazing and amazingly improbable,
