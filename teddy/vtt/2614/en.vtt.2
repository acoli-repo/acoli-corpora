00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:00.775
don't look in the Paleozoic,
you won't find them.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.280
They hadn't evolved yet.

00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:05.391
You have to find the younger
rocks of the Mesozoic,

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:06.812
and in the case of dinosaurs,

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:10.561
between 235 and 66 million years ago.

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:14.670
Now, it's fairly easy to find rocks
of the right age at this point,

00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:17.826
because the Earth is, to a coarse degree,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.180
geologically mapped.

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:21.761
This is hard-won information.

00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:25.127
The annals of Earth history
are written in rocks,

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.452
one chapter upon the next,

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:29.080
such that the oldest pages are on bottom

00:01:29.104 --> 00:01:30.758
and the youngest on top.
