00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.918
It's not.

00:01:36.942 --> 00:01:38.996
The library of Earth is an old one.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.659
It has no librarian to impose order.

00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:45.241
Operating over vast swaths of time,

00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:49.398

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:51.505

Most pages are destroyed
soon after being written.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.162
Some pages are overwritten,

00:01:57.186 --> 00:02:01.756
creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests
of long-gone landscapes.
