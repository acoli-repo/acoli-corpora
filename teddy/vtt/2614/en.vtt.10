00:04:59.092 --> 00:05:00.604
and you literally walk

00:05:00.628 --> 00:05:03.216
until you see a bone
sticking out of the rock.

00:05:04.562 --> 00:05:07.664
Here's a picture that I took
in Southern Patagonia.

00:05:08.347 --> 00:05:11.109
Every pebble that you see
on the ground there

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:12.656
is a piece of dinosaur bone.

00:05:13.478 --> 00:05:15.344
So when you're in that right situation,

00:05:15.368 --> 00:05:18.122
it's not a question of whether
you'll find fossils or not;

00:05:18.146 --> 00:05:19.535
you're going to find fossils.

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:23.607
The question is: Will you find something
that is scientifically significant?

00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:27.601
And to help with that, I'm going to add
a fourth part to our formula,

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:28.802
which is this:

00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:32.891
get as far away from other
paleontologists as possible.
