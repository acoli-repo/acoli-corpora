00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.086
Earth rocks, on the other hand,
face the perils of a living lithosphere.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.694
All will suffer ruination,

00:02:34.718 --> 00:02:37.544
through some combination
of mutilation, compression,

00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:40.074
folding, tearing, scorching and baking.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.192
Thus, the volumes of Earth history
are incomplete and disheveled.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.694
The library is vast and magnificent --

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:53.258
but decrepit.

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:57.139
And it was this tattered complexity
in the rock record

00:02:57.163 --> 00:03:00.194
that obscured its meaning
until relatively recently.
