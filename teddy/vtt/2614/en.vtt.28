No doubt, those worlds would be
both amazing and amazingly improbable,

00:14:02.654 --> 00:14:05.962
but they would not be our world
and they would not have our history.

00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:08.965
There are an infinite number of histories
that we could've had.

00:14:08.989 --> 00:14:11.515
We only get one, and wow,
did we ever get a good one.

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:14.377
Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.

00:14:15.058 --> 00:14:18.423
Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real.

00:14:19.216 --> 00:14:23.312
Dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle
and pill bugs the length of a car

00:14:23.336 --> 00:14:24.899
really existed.

00:14:27.192 --> 00:14:28.795
Why study the ancient past?
