00:12:59.123 --> 00:13:01.325
There, it's nothing more
than a gurgle of water

00:13:01.349 --> 00:13:05.960
that issues forth from beneath a rock
in a boulder in a pasture,

00:13:05.984 --> 00:13:07.681
high in the Bitterroot Mountains.

00:13:08.165 --> 00:13:10.557
The stream next to it
runs a few hundred yards

00:13:11.407 --> 00:13:12.859
and ends in a small pond.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.867
Those two streams -- they look identical.

00:13:17.732 --> 00:13:20.271
But one is an anonymous trickle of water,

00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:22.564
and the other is the Missouri River.

00:13:23.667 --> 00:13:27.164
Now go down to the mouth
of the Missouri, near St. Louis,

00:13:27.188 --> 00:13:29.905
and it's pretty obvious
that that river is a big deal.
