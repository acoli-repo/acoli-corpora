00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:32.891
get as far away from other
paleontologists as possible.

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:34.886
(Laughter)

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.265
It's not that I don't like
other paleontologists.

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.814
When you go to a place
that's relatively unexplored,

00:05:39.838 --> 00:05:42.652
you have a much better chance
of not only finding fossils

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.185
but of finding something
that's new to science.

00:05:45.788 --> 00:05:47.899
So that's my formula
for finding dinosaurs,

00:05:47.923 --> 00:05:49.956
and I've applied it all around the world.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.308
In the austral summer of 2004,

00:05:52.332 --> 00:05:54.157
I went to the bottom of South America,

00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:56.298
to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina,

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.575
to prospect for dinosaurs:

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.972
a place that had terrestrial
sedimentary rocks of the right age,
