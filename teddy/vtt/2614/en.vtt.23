leave behind immense numbers of fossils,

00:11:30.267 --> 00:11:31.909
each one a small miracle,

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:35.224
but collectively, inevitable.

00:11:36.572 --> 00:11:39.445
Sixty-six million years ago,
an asteroid hits the Earth

00:11:39.953 --> 00:11:41.636
and wipes out the dinosaurs.

00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:44.699
This easily might not have been.

00:11:45.312 --> 00:11:48.167
But we only get one history,
and it's the one that we have.

00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:50.467
But this particular reality
was not inevitable.

00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:53.293
The tiniest perturbation
of that asteroid far from Earth

00:11:53.317 --> 00:11:56.318
would have caused it to miss
our planet by a wide margin.

00:11:56.754 --> 00:12:00.107
The pivotal, calamitous day during which
the dinosaurs were wiped out,
