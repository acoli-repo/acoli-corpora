00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:32.028
clear out a huge envelope of vegetation,

00:08:32.052 --> 00:08:35.966
taking in tens of thousands of calories
while expending very few.

00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:40.921
And these animals evolved

00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:42.760
giving them immense stability,

because when you're 65 tons,

00:08:47.725 --> 00:08:49.832
the penalty for falling over

00:08:55.407 --> 00:08:57.988
Dreadnoughtus falls over,
ribs break and pierce lungs.

00:08:58.012 --> 00:08:59.537
Organs burst.

00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:01.347
If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus,
