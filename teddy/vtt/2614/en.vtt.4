00:02:02.384 --> 00:02:06.525
Pages that do find sanctuary
under the advancing sands of time

00:02:07.173 --> 00:02:08.768
are never truly safe.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.754
Unlike the Moon --
our dead, rocky companion --

00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:16.418
the Earth is alive, pulsing
with creative and destructive forces

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:18.893
that power its geological metabolism.

00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:22.237
Lunar rocks brought back
by the Apollo astronauts

00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:25.228
all date back to about the age
of the Solar System.

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.849
Moon rocks are forever.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.086
Earth rocks, on the other hand,
face the perils of a living lithosphere.
