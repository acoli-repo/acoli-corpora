00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.339
All of these concepts,
as rhetorically florid as they are,

00:03:34.363 --> 00:03:35.720
share this basic assumption,

00:03:35.744 --> 00:03:38.248
which is that an idea is a single thing.

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:44.316
It's something that happens often
in a wonderful, illuminating moment.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.764
But, in fact, what I would argue
and what you really need to begin with

00:03:47.788 --> 00:03:52.166
is this idea that an idea is a network
on the most elemental level.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.700
I mean, this is what is happening
inside your brain.

00:03:54.724 --> 00:03:57.262
An idea -- a new idea --
is a new network of neurons

00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:59.626
firing in sync with each other
inside your brain.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.894
It's a new configuration
that has never formed before.
