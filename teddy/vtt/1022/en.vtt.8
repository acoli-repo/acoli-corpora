It's a new configuration
that has never formed before.

00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:06.121
And the question is: How do you
get your brain into environments

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:09.022
where these new networks
are going to be more likely to form?

00:04:09.046 --> 00:04:12.723
And it turns out that, in fact,
the network patterns of the outside world

00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:16.919
mimic a lot of the network patterns
of the internal world of a human brain.

00:04:16.943 --> 00:04:19.908
So the metaphor I'd like to use,

00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:24.355
I can take from a story
of a great idea that's quite recent --

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.968
a lot more recent than the 1650s.

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:30.241
