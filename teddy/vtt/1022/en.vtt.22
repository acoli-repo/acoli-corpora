00:10:58.563 --> 00:11:00.407
Now the challenge for all of us is:

00:11:00.431 --> 00:11:01.873
How do you create environments

00:11:01.897 --> 00:11:04.644
that allow these ideas
to have this long half-life?

00:11:04.668 --> 00:11:06.443
It's hard to go to your boss and say,

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:08.688
"I have an excellent idea
for our organization.

00:11:08.712 --> 00:11:10.083
It will be useful in 2020."

00:11:10.107 --> 00:11:11.526
(Laughter)

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.762
"Could you just give me
some time to do that?"

00:11:13.786 --> 00:11:17.628
Now a couple of companies like Google
have innovation time off, 20 percent time.

00:11:17.652 --> 00:11:20.990
In a sense, those are hunch-cultivating
mechanisms in an organization.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.787
But that's a key thing.

00:11:22.811 --> 00:11:25.214
And the other thing
is to allow those hunches

00:11:25.238 --> 00:11:27.119
to connect with other people's hunches;

00:11:27.143 --> 00:11:28.398
that's what often happens.

00:11:28.422 --> 00:11:31.200
You have half of an idea,
somebody else has the other half,
