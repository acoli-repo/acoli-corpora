00:04:58.216 --> 00:05:01.027
These are standard
in all the industrialized worlds.

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.486
The problem is, if you buy
a $40,000 incubator,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.889
and you send it off
to a midsized village in Africa,

00:05:07.913 --> 00:05:10.424
it will work great
for a year or two years,

00:05:10.448 --> 00:05:12.877
and then something
will go wrong and it will break,

00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:15.037
and it will remain broken forever,

00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:17.798
because you don't have
a whole system of spare parts,

00:05:17.822 --> 00:05:19.989
and you don't have
the on-the-ground expertise

00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:22.456
to fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.528
So you end up having this problem
where you spend all this money

00:05:25.552 --> 00:05:28.685
getting aid and all these advanced
electronics to these countries,

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:30.109
and it ends up being useless.
