00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:00.863
You know, you're sitting there,
thinking a deep thought,

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:04.079
the apple falls from the tree,
and you have the theory of gravity.

00:07:04.103 --> 00:07:08.117
In fact, the spaces that have historically
led to innovation tend to look like this.

00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:11.751
This is Hogarth's famous painting
of a kind of political dinner at a tavern,

00:07:11.775 --> 00:07:14.407
but this is what the coffee shops
looked like back then.

00:07:14.431 --> 00:07:18.370
This is the kind of chaotic environment
where ideas were likely to come together,

00:07:18.394 --> 00:07:22.003
where people were likely to have new,
interesting, unpredictable collisions,

00:07:22.027 --> 00:07:23.648
people from different backgrounds.

00:07:23.672 --> 00:07:26.835
So if we're trying to build organizations
that are more innovative,

00:07:26.859 --> 00:07:30.349
we have to build spaces that, strangely
enough, look a bit more like this.
