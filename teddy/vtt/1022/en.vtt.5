00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:31.659
I've looked at media environments
like the World Wide Web,

00:02:31.683 --> 00:02:33.691
that have been extraordinarily innovative;

00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:36.116
I've gone back to the history
of the first cities;

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.760
I've even gone to biological environments,
like coral reefs and rain forests,

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.355
that involve unusual levels
of biological innovation.

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.267
And what I've been looking for
is shared patterns,

00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:48.750
signature behavior
that shows up again and again

00:02:48.774 --> 00:02:50.175
in all of these environments.

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.831
Are there recurring patterns
that we can learn from,

00:02:52.855 --> 00:02:55.333
that we can take
and apply to our own lives

00:02:55.357 --> 00:02:57.762
or our own organizations
or our own environments

00:02:57.786 --> 00:02:59.794
to make them more creative and innovative?

00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:01.251
And I think I've found a few.
