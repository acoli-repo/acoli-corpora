Fifty-two minutes ago, I took this picture
about 10 blocks from here.

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.903
This is the Grand CafÃ© here in Oxford.

00:00:07.927 --> 00:00:09.225
I took this picture

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:13.994
because this turns out to be
the first coffeehouse to open in England,

00:00:14.018 --> 00:00:15.177
in 1650.

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.318
That's its great claim to fame.

00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:18.850
And I wanted to show it to you,

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:21.456
not because I want to give you
the Starbucks tour

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.662
of historic England --

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:23.795
(Laughter)

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.267
but rather because
the English coffeehouse was crucial

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:32.049
to the development and spread of one
of the great intellectual flowerings
