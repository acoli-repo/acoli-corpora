And what Gruber found was that Darwin had
the full theory of natural selection

00:10:31.376 --> 00:10:32.985
for months and months and months

00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:37.910
before he had his alleged epiphany
reading Malthus in October of 1838.

00:10:37.934 --> 00:10:39.912
There are passages where you can read it,

00:10:39.936 --> 00:10:43.037
and you think you're reading
from a Darwin textbook,

00:10:43.061 --> 00:10:45.515

00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:47.996
And so what you realize
is that Darwin, in a sense,

but was unable to fully think it yet.

00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:55.984
And that is, actually,
how great ideas often happen --

00:10:56.008 --> 00:10:58.539
they fade into view
over long periods of time.

00:10:58.563 --> 00:11:00.407
Now the challenge for all of us is:
