00:13:28.115 --> 00:13:31.078
it was right at 20 MHz,
so you could pick it up really easily,

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:34.352
because they were afraid people
would think it was a hoax, basically,

00:13:34.376 --> 00:13:36.112
so they made it really easy to find.

00:13:36.136 --> 00:13:39.014
So these guys are sitting there,
listening to this signal,

00:13:39.038 --> 00:13:41.433
and people start coming
into the office and saying,

00:13:41.457 --> 00:13:43.055
"That's pretty cool. Can I hear?"

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:46.000
And before long, they think,
"Jeez, this is kind of historic.

00:13:46.024 --> 00:13:49.140
We may be the first people
in the United States listening to this.

00:13:49.164 --> 00:13:50.323
We should record it."

00:13:50.347 --> 00:13:52.895
So they bring in this big,
clunky analog tape recorder

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:55.313
and start recording
these little bleep, bleeps.

00:13:55.337 --> 00:13:57.976
And they start writing down
the date stamp, time stamps

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.323
for each little bleep that they record.
