00:12:29.663 --> 00:12:32.193
And, of course,
this is nerd heaven, right?

00:12:32.217 --> 00:12:34.527
There are all these physics
geeks who are there,

00:12:34.551 --> 00:12:38.246
thinking, "Oh my gosh! This is incredible.
I can't believe this has happened."

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.088
And two of them, two twentysomething
researchers at the APL,

00:12:41.112 --> 00:12:43.200
are there at the cafeteria table,

00:12:43.224 --> 00:12:46.280
having an informal conversation
with a bunch of their colleagues.

00:12:46.304 --> 00:12:48.721
And these two guys
are named Guier and Weiffenbach.

00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:50.704
They start talking, and one of them says,

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:53.641
"Hey, has anybody tried
to listen for this thing?

00:12:53.665 --> 00:12:57.056
There's this, you know, man-made
satellite up there in outer space

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.435
that's obviously broadcasting
some kind of signal.

00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:01.467
We could probably hear it, if we tune in."
