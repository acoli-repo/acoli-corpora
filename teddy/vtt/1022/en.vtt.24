and not just protecting them.

00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:04.237
And I'll leave you with this story,

00:12:04.261 --> 00:12:06.613
which I think captures
a lot of these values.

00:12:06.637 --> 00:12:12.147
It's just a wonderful tale of innovation,
and how it happens in unlikely ways.

00:12:12.171 --> 00:12:15.330
It's October of 1957,

00:12:15.354 --> 00:12:17.457
and Sputnik has just launched.

00:12:17.481 --> 00:12:19.526
And we're in Laurel, Maryland,

associated with Johns Hopkins University.

00:12:24.054 --> 00:12:25.277
It's Monday morning,

00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:28.037
and the news has just
broken about this satellite

00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:29.639
that's now orbiting the planet.

00:12:29.663 --> 00:12:32.193
And, of course,
this is nerd heaven, right?
