You have half of an idea,
somebody else has the other half,

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:33.090
and if you're in the right environment,

00:11:33.114 --> 00:11:35.934
they turn into something larger
than the sum of their parts.

00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.110
So in a sense,

00:11:37.134 --> 00:11:40.362
we often talk about the value
of protecting intellectual property --

00:11:40.386 --> 00:11:41.821
you know, building barricades,

00:11:41.845 --> 00:11:45.695
having secretive R and D labs,
patenting everything that we have

00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:48.186
so that those ideas will remain valuable,

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.065
and people will be incentivized
to come up with more ideas,

00:11:51.089 --> 00:11:53.292
and the culture will be more innovative.

00:11:53.316 --> 00:11:55.092
But I think there's a case to be made

00:11:55.116 --> 00:11:57.752
that we should spend
at least as much time, if not more,

00:11:57.776 --> 00:11:59.717
valuing the premise of connecting ideas

00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:01.567
and not just protecting them.
