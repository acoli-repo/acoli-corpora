we have to build spaces that, strangely
enough, look a bit more like this.

00:07:30.373 --> 00:07:33.780
This is what your office should look like,
it's part of my message here.

00:07:33.804 --> 00:07:37.211
And one of the problems with this is that,
when you research this field,

00:07:37.235 --> 00:07:39.323
people are notoriously unreliable

00:07:39.347 --> 00:07:42.740

or their history of their best ideas.

00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:48.843
And a few years ago, a wonderful
researcher named Kevin Dunbar

00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:52.500
decided to go around
and basically do the Big Brother approach

00:07:52.524 --> 00:07:54.528
to figuring out
where good ideas come from.

00:07:54.552 --> 00:07:56.990
He went to a bunch
of science labs around the world

00:07:57.014 --> 00:08:00.646
and videotaped everyone as they were
doing every little bit of their job:
