00:07:57.014 --> 00:08:00.646
and videotaped everyone as they were
doing every little bit of their job:

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.027
when they were sitting
in front of the microscope,

00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.855
when they were talking to colleagues
at the watercooler ...

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:07.761
And he recorded all these conversations

00:08:07.785 --> 00:08:10.901
and tried to figure out where
the most important ideas happened.

00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:14.236
And when we think about the classic
image of the scientist in the lab,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.447
we have this image -- you know,
they're poring over the microscope,

00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:19.546
and they see something
in the tissue sample,

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.677
and -- "Eureka!" -- they've got the idea.

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:25.010
What happened, actually,
when Dunbar looked at the tape,

00:08:25.034 --> 00:08:28.272
is that, in fact, almost all
of the important breakthrough ideas

00:08:28.296 --> 00:08:31.391
did not happen alone in the lab,
in front of the microscope.
