00:05:58.728 --> 00:06:00.457
And this is what they came up with.

00:06:00.481 --> 00:06:02.120
It's called the NeoNurture device.

00:06:02.144 --> 00:06:04.637
From the outside,
it looks like a normal little thing

00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:06.822
you'd find in a modern Western hospital.

00:06:06.846 --> 00:06:08.479
In the inside, it's all car parts.

00:06:08.503 --> 00:06:10.721
It's got a fan, it's got
headlights for warmth,

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.364
it's got door chimes for alarm,

00:06:12.388 --> 00:06:14.054
it runs off a car battery.

00:06:14.078 --> 00:06:17.065
And so all you need
is the spare parts from your Toyota

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:18.797
and the ability to fix a headlight,

00:06:18.821 --> 00:06:20.330
and you can repair this thing.

00:06:20.354 --> 00:06:21.506
Now that's a great idea,

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.196
but I'd like to say that, in fact,

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.576
this is a great metaphor
for the way ideas happen.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.962
We like to think our breakthrough
ideas, you know,

00:06:27.986 --> 00:06:30.010
are like that $40,000,
brand-new incubator,
