00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:30.109
and it ends up being useless.

00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:32.150
So what Prestero
and his team decided to do

00:05:32.174 --> 00:05:34.949
was to look around and see:
What are the abundant resources

00:05:34.973 --> 00:05:36.673
in these developing world contexts?

00:05:36.697 --> 00:05:37.962
And what they noticed was,

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:41.200
they don't have a lot of DVRs,
they don't have a lot of microwaves,

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:44.625
but they seem to do a pretty good job
of keeping their cars on the road.

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:47.930
There's a Toyota 4Runner
on the street in all these places.

00:05:47.954 --> 00:05:51.285
They seem to have the expertise
to keep cars working.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.594
So they started to think,

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:55.526
"Could we build a neonatal incubator

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.101
that's built entirely
out of automobile parts?"

00:05:58.728 --> 00:06:00.457
And this is what they came up with.
