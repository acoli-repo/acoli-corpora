You would be sharper and more alert.

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:34.809
So it's not an accident that a great
flowering of innovation happened

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.001
as England switched to tea and coffee.

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:39.834
But the other thing
that makes the coffeehouse important

00:01:39.858 --> 00:01:41.869
is the architecture of the space.

00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:44.491
It was a space where people
would get together,

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:47.254
from different backgrounds,
different fields of expertise,

00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:48.439
and share.

00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:51.866
It was a space, as Matt Ridley talked
about, where ideas could have sex.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.371
This was their conjugal bed, in a sense;
ideas would get together there.

00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:58.087
And an astonishing number
of innovations from this period

00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:01.265
have a coffeehouse
somewhere in their story.
