00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:32.049
to the development and spread of one
of the great intellectual flowerings

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:33.839
of the last 500 years,

00:00:33.863 --> 00:00:35.668
what we now call the Enlightenment.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:40.244
And the coffeehouse played such a big role
in the birth of the Enlightenment

00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:42.763
in part because of what people
were drinking there.

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:48.044
Because, before the spread
of coffee and tea through British culture,

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:51.311

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:53.708

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:54.957
was alcohol.

00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:57.030
Alcohol was the daytime
beverage of choice.

00:00:57.054 --> 00:00:59.128
You would drink a little beer
with breakfast

00:00:59.152 --> 00:01:00.707
and have a little wine at lunch,
