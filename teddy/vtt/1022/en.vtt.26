00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:01.467
We could probably hear it, if we tune in."

00:13:01.491 --> 00:13:03.878
So they ask around
to a couple of their colleagues,

00:13:03.902 --> 00:13:06.641
and everybody's like,
"No, I hadn't thought of doing that.

00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:08.007
That's an interesting idea."

00:13:08.031 --> 00:13:11.960
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of
an expert in microwave reception,

00:13:11.984 --> 00:13:15.848
and he's got a little antenna set up
with an amplifier in his office.

00:13:15.872 --> 00:13:18.576
So Guier and Weiffenbach
go back to Weiffenbach's office,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.896
and they start noodling around --
"hacking," as we might call it now.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.021
And after a couple of hours,
they start picking up the signal,

00:13:25.045 --> 00:13:28.091
because the Soviets made Sputnik
very easy to track;

00:13:28.115 --> 00:13:31.078
it was right at 20 MHz,
so you could pick it up really easily,
