A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero

00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:32.896
has an organization
called Design That Matters.

00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:36.970
They decided to tackle
this really pressing problem

00:04:36.994 --> 00:04:40.526
of the terrible problems
we have with infant mortality rates

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.407
in the developing world.

00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:44.880
One of the things
that's very frustrating about this

00:04:44.904 --> 00:04:50.281
is that we know by getting modern
neonatal incubators into any context,

00:04:50.305 --> 00:04:53.608
if we can keep premature babies warm,
basically -- it's very simple --

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:56.375
we can halve infant mortality rates
in those environments.

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.192
So the technology is there.

00:04:58.216 --> 00:05:01.027
These are standard
in all the industrialized worlds.
