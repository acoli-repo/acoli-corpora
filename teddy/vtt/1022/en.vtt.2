00:00:59.152 --> 00:01:00.707
and have a little wine at lunch,

00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:03.029
a little gin, particularly around 1650,

00:01:03.053 --> 00:01:06.161
and top it off with a little beer and wine
at the end of the day.

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:09.409
That was the healthy choice,
because the water wasn't safe to drink.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:12.526
And so, effectively,
until the rise of the coffeehouse,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.694
you had an entire population
that was effectively drunk all day.

00:01:15.718 --> 00:01:16.914
(Laughter)

00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:19.930
And you can imagine what that would
be like in your own life --

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:23.410
and I know this is true of some of you --
if you were drinking all day --

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:24.465
(Laughter)

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:27.766
and then you switched from a depressant
to a stimulant in your life.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.334
You would have better ideas.

00:01:29.358 --> 00:01:31.422
You would be sharper and more alert.
