00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.089
the other half is hidden in places you'd least suspect.

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:34.680
Check the ingredients on ketchup, bologna,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.067
spaghetti sauce, soy milk, sports drinks,

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:40.356
fish sticks, and peanut butter.

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:43.115
You'll find sugar hiding in most of those products.

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:45.016
In fact, you'll find added sugars

00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:48.030
in three-quarters of the more than 600,000 items

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.284

But how is sugar hiding?

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:54.131
Can't you just look on food labels?

00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:55.700
It's not that easy.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.301
Just like your friend Robert

00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:00.512
might go by Bob, Robby, Rob, Bobby, or Roberto,
