00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:31.120
And even though organic evaporated cane juice sounds healthy,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.595
when you evaporate it,

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:34.045
you get sugar!

00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:36.437
Chemically speaking, it's all the same.

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:37.652
And even trickier,

00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:39.336
when multiple added types of sugars

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:41.046
are used in one type of product,

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:44.067
they get buried down in a long list of ingredients,

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:46.470
so the sugar content might appear to be okay,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.925
but when you add them all together,

00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:51.015
sugar can be the single biggest ingredient.

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:53.310
Currently, the FDA doesn't suggest

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.329
a recommended daily limit for sugar,

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.228
so it's hard to tell if this 65 grams in a bottle of soda

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:00.398
is a little or a lot.
