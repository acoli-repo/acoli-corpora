It's sugar that makes cookies chewy

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:03.506
and candy crunchy.

00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:06.408
It even turns bread crust a beautiful, golden brown.

00:03:06.408 --> 00:03:08.468
It's also a great preservative;

00:03:08.468 --> 00:03:10.345
it doesn't spoil or evaporate,

00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:12.100
so the foods it's added to are easier

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.974
to store and ship long distances

00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:15.998
and tend to be cheaper.

00:03:15.998 --> 00:03:18.483

things like: vegetables, eggs, meats,

00:03:25.858 --> 00:03:29.963
fish, fruit, raw nuts, even your kitchen sink.

00:03:29.963 --> 00:03:33.366
