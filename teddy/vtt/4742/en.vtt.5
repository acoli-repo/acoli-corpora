00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:30.681
Glucose is the best source of energy

00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:33.155
for nearly all organisms on Earth.

00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:36.018
It can be metabolized by all organs in the body.

00:02:36.018 --> 00:02:38.103
Fructose, on the other hand,

00:02:38.103 --> 00:02:40.815
is metabolized primarily in the liver,

00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:42.775
and when your liver gets overloaded

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:44.422
with sweet, sweet fructose,

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:47.562
the excess is metabolized to fat.

00:02:47.562 --> 00:02:49.824
Fresh fruits actually contain fructose,

00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:51.479
but it's naturally occurring

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.170
and doesn't cause an overload

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.732
because the fiber in fruit slows its absorption.

00:02:55.732 --> 00:02:57.816
This gives your liver the time it needs

00:02:57.816 --> 00:02:59.421
to do its job.

00:02:59.421 --> 00:03:01.545
It's sugar that makes cookies chewy
