00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:00.398
is a little or a lot.

00:02:00.398 --> 00:02:02.677
But the World Health Organization recommends

00:02:02.677 --> 00:02:05.981
limiting sugar to just 5% of your total calories,

00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:08.146
or about 25 grams per day.

00:02:08.146 --> 00:02:12.121
So, 65 grams is well over twice that amount.

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.204
But just what is sugar?

00:02:14.204 --> 00:02:17.907
What's the difference between glucose and fructose?

00:02:17.907 --> 00:02:19.730
Well, both are carbohydrates

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.297
with the same chemical composition

00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:23.647
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

00:02:23.647 --> 00:02:25.714
But they have very different structures

00:02:25.714 --> 00:02:28.258
and behave quite differently in our bodies.

00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:30.681
Glucose is the best source of energy
