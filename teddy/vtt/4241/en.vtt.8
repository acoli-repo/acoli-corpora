00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters:

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
A, T, C, G; they represent the name of a chemical.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And with these four letters, you can create a language:

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
a language that can describe anything, and very complicated things.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
You know, they are generally put together in pairs,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
creating a word or what we call base pairs.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And you would, you know, when you think about it,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
four letters, or the representation of four things, makes us work.
