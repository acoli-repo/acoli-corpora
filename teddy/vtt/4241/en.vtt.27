00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
They have discovered pathways that create flavors,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
although it's very important to understand

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
that those compounds that it's cranking out

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
have to match a receptor in our genome, in our tongue,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
for us to understand and interpret those flavors.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
They've also discovered that

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
They now are understanding, and the work is going on,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
exactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know,
