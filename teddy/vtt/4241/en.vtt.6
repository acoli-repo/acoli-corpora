inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
what we inherit, what diseases we may get.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
since the beginning of us, of us as creatures.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
There is a historical archive.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Living in your genome is the history of our species,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and you as an individual human being, where you're from,
