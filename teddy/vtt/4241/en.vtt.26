Well, actually, you could do it the other way.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So, you know, by being able to write a genome

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and plug it into an organism,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
the software, if you will, changes the hardware.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And this is extremely profound.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So, last year the French and Italians announced

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.
