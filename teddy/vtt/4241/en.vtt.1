00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In this case, it was picking up bones and creating a tool,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
using it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
running around and eating and doing each other

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
figured out they can make things if they used a tool.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And that moved us to the next level.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And, you know, we in the last 30 years in particular

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And we've seen many seminal moments.
