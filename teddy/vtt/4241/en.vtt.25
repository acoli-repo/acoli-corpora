00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in --

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
does it just boot up and live?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Well, guess what. It does.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Not only does it do that; if you took the genome -- that synthetic genome --

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and you plugged it into a different critter, like yeast,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
It's, sort of, like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Well, actually, you could do it the other way.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So, you know, by being able to write a genome
