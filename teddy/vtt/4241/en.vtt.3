00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We've seen so much change, and we've given ourselves these tools now --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
these high-powered tools --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that are allowing us to turn the lens inward

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
into something that is common to all of us, and that is a genome.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
How's your genome today? Have you thought about it lately?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Heard about it, at least? You probably hear about genomes these days.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's, sort of, like if you ask people,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Well, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?
