In fact -- I'm sorry to inform you --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
that inside of your digestive tract is about 10 pounds of microbes

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
which you're circulating through your body quite a bit.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Our ocean's teaming with microbes;

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
in fact, when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do,
