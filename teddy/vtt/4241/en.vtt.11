00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Well, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
a lot of ways to describe mechanisms.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So, let's talk about what that means.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, if you look at a human genome,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That's a lot.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And they mix up in all different fashions,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and that makes you a human being.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
If you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It's not really all that much data.
