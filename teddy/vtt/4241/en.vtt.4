Well, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
People never want to say, I really don't understand.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So, I will tell you right off of the bat.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
A genome is really a description for 
all of the DNA that is in a living organism.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It doesn't matter whether you're a yeast;

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse;

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
doesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA.
