00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour;

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
you will see that happen in the next five years.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And what that means is, you are going to walk around

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And when you buy medicine,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You will give your genome to the pharmacist,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and your drug will be made for you

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and it will work much better than the ones that were --

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
you won't have side effects.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
All those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
whatever they say in those commercials: forget about that.
