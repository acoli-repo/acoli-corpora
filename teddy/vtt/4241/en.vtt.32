00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
We find microbial life in every part of the planet:

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.000
in ice, in coal, in rocks, in volcanic vents; it's an amazing thing.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
But we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
it is the ecosystem around them,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
it is the microbes that live in their root systems,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
that have just as much impact on the character of those plants
