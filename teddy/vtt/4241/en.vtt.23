We can also look at, at a grander scale, what creates problems,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
what creates disease, and how we may be able to fix them.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Because we can understand this,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
we can fix them, make better organisms.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Most importantly, what we're learning

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
The toolbox exists.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and we now have the ability to use it.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
We are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
