For my wife: eat three times as much and you never put on any weight.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
It's all hidden in this code,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
So, what can we do with genomes now that we can read them,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
now that we're starting to have the book of life?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Well, there's many things. Some are exciting. 


00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me, but that's okay.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
You can do a very simple test: scrape your cheek; send it off.
