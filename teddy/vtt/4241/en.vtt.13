00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
like cancer, we haven't been able to cure

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We are starting to understand that.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So, up to this point we tried to fix it

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and maybe it's going to make it work.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
What is the code?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
What are the exact instructions that are making it do that?
