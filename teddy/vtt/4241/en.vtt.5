doesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And when Watson and Crick in the '50s

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
very long, complicated molecule --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
we then started on this journey to understand that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
what we inherit, what diseases we may get.
