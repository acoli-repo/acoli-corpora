and you as an individual human being, where you're from,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and that's now starting to be understood.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It is the program. It is the code of life.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It is what makes you function;

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
it is what makes every organism function.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
DNA is a very elegant molecule.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It's long and it's complicated.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters:
