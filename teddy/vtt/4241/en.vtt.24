We are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
This company, Synthetic Genomics, I'm involved with,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
If you have a UTI, you've probably -- or ever had a UTI --

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
you've come in contact with this little bug.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Very simple -- only has about 246 genes --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
but we were able to completely synthesize that genome.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in --
