00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000
different races, cultures. We are all 99.9% genetically equal.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that makes the difference between any one of us.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
That's a tiny amount of material,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
but the way that ultimately expresses itself

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
is what makes changes in humans and in all species.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So, we are now able to read genomes.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
The first human genome took 10 years, three billion dollars.
