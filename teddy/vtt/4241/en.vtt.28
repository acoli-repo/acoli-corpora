00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
exactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
to read that entire code and understand how it ticks.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So, then what do you do?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Knowing that we can read it, knowing that we can write it, change it,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
maybe write its genome from scratch. So, what do you do?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Well, one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
(Laughter)

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000

By the way, just so you know:

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms;
