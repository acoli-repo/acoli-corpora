00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
The first human genome took 10 years, three billion dollars.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
It was done by Dr. Craig Venter.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And then James Watson's -- one of the co-founders of DNA --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
genome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And if you think about the computer industry

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and how we've gone from big computers to little ones

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and how they get more powerful and faster all the time,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now:

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour;
