over the past century

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:36.042
has been based on only

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.360
I'm an emergency medicine doctor.

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:42.400
I was trained to be prepared
in a medical emergency.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.389
It's about saving lives. How cool is that?

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:51.652
OK, there's a lot of runny noses
and stubbed toes,

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:55.341

through the door to the ER,

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:57.817
we order the same tests,

00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.975
we prescribe the same medication,

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.401
without ever thinking about the sex
or gender of our patients.
