would be born with ovaries or testes,

00:10:42.999 --> 00:10:46.740
and it was the sex hormones
that those organs produced

00:10:46.764 --> 00:10:51.329
that were responsible for the differences
we see in the opposite sex.

00:10:52.757 --> 00:10:57.591
But we now know that
that theory was wrong --

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.060
