only after a drug has been
released to the market?

00:01:31.496 --> 00:01:37.156
Do you know that it takes years
for a drug to go from an idea

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.337
to being tested on cells in a laboratory,

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:42.329
to animal studies,

00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:44.480
to then clinical trials on humans,

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:48.375
finally to go through
a regulatory approval process,

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.735
to be available for your doctor
to prescribe to you?

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.540
Not to mention the millions and billions
of dollars of funding

00:01:57.564 --> 00:01:59.946
it takes to go through that process.
