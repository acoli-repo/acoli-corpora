even though, as I mentioned,
women do make up half the population.

00:08:03.537 --> 00:08:09.308
And so what is some of the evidence
to help explain some of these differences?

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:12.530
If we look at the anatomy,

00:08:12.554 --> 00:08:18.569
the blood vessels that surround the heart
are smaller in women compared to men,

00:08:18.593 --> 00:08:23.073
and the way that those blood vessels

And the test that we use to determine
