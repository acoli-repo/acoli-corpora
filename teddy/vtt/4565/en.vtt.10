00:04:56.508 --> 00:05:00.733
that men and women
were alike in every way,

00:05:00.757 --> 00:05:04.200
apart from their reproductive organs
and sex hormones.

00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:08.028
So it was decided:

00:05:09.117 --> 00:05:12.633
medical research was performed on men,

00:05:12.657 --> 00:05:15.414
and the results were later
applied to women.

00:05:17.203 --> 00:05:20.744
What did this do to the notion
of women's health?

00:05:20.768 --> 00:05:25.024
Women's health became synonymous
with reproduction:

00:05:25.048 --> 00:05:29.593
breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.
