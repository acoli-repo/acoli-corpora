without ever thinking about the sex
or gender of our patients.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.624
Why would we?

00:01:07.053 --> 00:01:10.794
We were never taught that there were
any differences between men and women.

00:01:10.818 --> 00:01:15.377
A recent Government Accountability study
revealed that 80 percent of the drugs

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.552
withdrawn from the market

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.969
are due to side effects on women.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.391
So let's think about that for a minute.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:27.289
Why are we discovering
side effects on women

00:01:27.313 --> 00:01:30.599
only after a drug has been
released to the market?
