00:02:59.247 --> 00:03:02.671
the Food and Drug Administration
recommended cutting the dose in half

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:05.582
for women only,

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:08.443
because they just realized
that women metabolize the drug

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.380
at a slower rate than men,

00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:13.443
causing them to wake up in the morning

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.661
with more of the active drug
in their system.

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:20.615
And then they're drowsy and they're
getting behind the wheel of the car,

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.606
and they're at risk
for motor vehicle accidents.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:28.899
And I can't help but think,
as an emergency physician,

00:03:28.923 --> 00:03:33.716
how many of my patients
that I've cared for over the years
