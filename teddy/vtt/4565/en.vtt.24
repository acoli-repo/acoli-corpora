WEBVTT

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.474
And to help do this, I'm a co-founder
of a national organization

00:12:04.498 --> 00:12:07.481
called Sex and Gender
Women's Health Collaborative,

00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:12.125
and we collect all of this data
so that it's available for teaching

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:13.554
and for patient care.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.748
And we're working to bring together
the medical educators to the table.

00:12:19.756 --> 00:12:21.224
That's a big job.

00:12:22.162 --> 00:12:27.301
It's changing the way medical training
has been done since its inception.

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:30.882
But I believe in them.
