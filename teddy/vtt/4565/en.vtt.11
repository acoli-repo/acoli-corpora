It's this term we now refer
to as "bikini medicine."

00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:37.105
And this stayed this way
until about the 1980s,

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.614
when this concept was challenged
by the medical community

00:05:40.638 --> 00:05:44.779
and by the public health policymakers
when they realized that

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:49.106
by excluding women
from all medical research studies

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.619
we actually did them a disservice,

00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:54.975
in that apart from reproductive issues,

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.563
virtually nothing was known
about the unique needs

00:05:57.587 --> 00:05:59.305
of the female patient.
