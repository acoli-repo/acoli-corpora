00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:30.838
and the space station,
the size of a football field.

00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:37.577
We arrive when those two craft dock
with a gentle thunk.

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:40.596
We open the hatches,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.114
have sloppy zero-G hugs with each other,

00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:46.367
and now we're six.

00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:49.444
We're a space family, an instant family.

00:01:50.618 --> 00:01:53.911
My favorite part about living up there

00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:55.623
was the flying.

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:57.420
I loved it.

00:01:57.444 --> 00:01:59.174
It was like being Peter Pan.

00:01:59.198 --> 00:02:00.598
It's not about floating.
