It's not about floating.

00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:02.558
Just the touch of a finger

00:02:02.582 --> 00:02:06.357
can actually push you across
the entire space station,

00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:09.122
and then you sort of
tuck in with your toes.

00:02:09.146 --> 00:02:13.331
One of my favorite things
was drifting silently

00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:14.745
through the space station,

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.914
which was humming along at night.

00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:20.447
I wondered sometimes
if it knew I was there,

00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:22.035
just silent.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.579
But sharing the wonder
of that with the crew

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.645
was also part of what was important to me.
