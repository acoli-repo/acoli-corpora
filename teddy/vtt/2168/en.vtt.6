00:02:56.426 --> 00:03:00.104
Our crew was the second ever
to use the Canadian robotic arm

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:03.721
to capture a supply ship
the size of a school bus

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.469
containing about a dozen
different experiments

00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:10.494
and the only chocolate that we would see
for the next four months.

00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:13.552
Now, chocolate aside,
every single one of those experiments

00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:17.829
enables yet one more
scientific question answered

00:03:17.853 --> 00:03:21.086
that we can't do down here on Earth.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.468
And so, it's like a different lens,

00:03:23.492 --> 00:03:26.500
allowing us to see the answers
to questions like,

00:03:26.524 --> 00:03:27.736
"What about combustion?"

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.609
"What about fluid dynamics?"
