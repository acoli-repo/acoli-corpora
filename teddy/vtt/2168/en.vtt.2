00:00:58.196 --> 00:01:03.347
until, after eight and a half minutes,
on purpose, those engines stop --

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.204
kabunk! --

00:01:05.228 --> 00:01:07.386
and we are weightless.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.806
And the mission and the magic begin.

00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:14.516
Dmitry and Paolo and I
are circling the Earth

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.365
in our tiny spacecraft,

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:18.873
approaching the space station carefully.

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:23.647
It's an intricate dance
at 17,500 miles an hour

00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.427
between our capsule,
the size of a Smart Car,

00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:30.838
and the space station,
the size of a football field.
