00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:02.143
and that just a gentle breeze
helps everything go

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:04.380
where it is supposed to.

00:04:04.404 --> 00:04:06.303
Well, in real life it does.

00:04:06.327 --> 00:04:07.405
(Laughter)

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:08.620
Recycling? Of course.

00:04:08.644 --> 00:04:13.891
So we take our urine, we store it,
we filter it and then we drink it.

00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:15.450
And it's actually delicious.

00:04:15.474 --> 00:04:16.489
(Laughter)

00:04:16.513 --> 00:04:18.635
Sitting around the table,

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.481
eating food that looks bad
but actually tastes pretty good.

00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:24.319
But it's the gathering around
the table that's important,

00:04:24.343 --> 00:04:27.619
I think both in space and on Earth,

00:04:27.643 --> 00:04:30.374
because that's what cements
a crew together.
