Now, when the space station
would go over Massachusetts,

00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:02.266
my family would run outside,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.956
and they would watch the brightest star
sailing across the sky.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.629
And when I looked down,
I couldn't see my house,

00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:13.576
but it meant a lot to me to know
that the people I loved the most

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.580
were looking up while I was looking down.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.952
So the space station, for me, is the place
where mission and magic come together.

00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:25.606
The mission, the work are vital steps

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.856
in our quest to go further than our planet

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.951
and imperative for understanding
sustainability here on Earth.
