00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You'd like to have a little advance warning.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
But you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away. It's a problem.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You hear about Mars, it's a problem communicating to Mars

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
because it takes light long enough to go there.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But if you look out to the nearest set of stars,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
to the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But you go and look to the center of the galaxy,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
it's thousands of years ago.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
If you look at Andromeda, which is the nearest big galaxy,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and it's two million years ago.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
there'd be no evidence of humans at all,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because we don't think there were humans yet.
