00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
of what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
some of the play principles and some of the design principles that,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
you know, humans have labored so hard to pick up,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And that is, you start out with very simple ingredients

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and some simple rules,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And then you put in some randomness,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
some fluctuations and some randomness,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and realize a whole bunch of different representations.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So what I'm going to do is show you
