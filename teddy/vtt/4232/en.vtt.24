00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
it's got photons and it's got neutrinos,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
which don't play much role in the later part of the universe.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And it's just a simple fluid and it, over time,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
develops into this complicated structure.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And so you know when you first saw this picture,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
it didn't mean quite so much to you.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and you're seeing billions of galaxies, right, and nodes,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but you realize they're not even the main structure.
