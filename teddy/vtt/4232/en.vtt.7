there'd be no evidence of humans at all,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because we don't think there were humans yet.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I mean, it just gives you the scale.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
hundreds of millions of years to a billion years.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
there's some things even further,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and that was what I did in a lot of my work,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
was to develop the techniques -- we could look out back to even earlier

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And so that's the sort of sequence,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and so I have a more artistic impression of this.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way,
