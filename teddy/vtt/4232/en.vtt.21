00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
but the dark matter we've made visible.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And the stuff that is in the yellow color,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So I'll show you the next movie.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So this -- we're going to zoom in.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We're going to zoom in and zoom in.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And when a number of filaments come together in a knot,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that makes a supercluster of galaxies.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
This one we're zooming in on

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region.
