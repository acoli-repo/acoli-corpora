00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
then to the Dark Ages, and then the first stars turn on,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And it's maturing up to the present time.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And there's some spectacular things.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And this wastebasket part, that's to represent

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
what the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And so this is a pretty weird model, right?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
What kind of evidence do we have for that?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So let me show you some of nature's patterns
