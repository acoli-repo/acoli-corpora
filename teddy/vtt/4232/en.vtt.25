00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but you realize they're not even the main structure.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
There's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
that's out there that's actually holding it all together.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So let's fly through it, and you can see how much harder it is

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
when you're in the middle of something to figure this out.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
So here's that same end result.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You see a filament,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
you see the light is the invisible matter,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and you get a large cluster of galaxies.
