Well, you see this space that's created by designers

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and by the work of people, but what you actually see

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is a lot of material that was already here,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
being reshaped in a certain form.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And so the question is: how did that material get here?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's a question of what's the continuity?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So one of the things I look at is,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
how did the universe begin and shape?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So that's sort of the part, and let me move on then and show you
