I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And so, I have my first slide to talk about

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the dawning of the universe and what I call

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and then following it up and trying to understand it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And so one of the questions that I asked you is,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
when you look around, what do you see?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Well, you see this space that's created by designers
