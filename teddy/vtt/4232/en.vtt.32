00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and then only things that have started forming already

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
are going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
So we're able to do the simulation, but this is two days on a desktop.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
We need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So we have an idea of how to play seriously, creating the universe

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material,
