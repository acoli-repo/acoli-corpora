00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and realize a whole bunch of different representations.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So what I'm going to do is show you

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
the distribution of matter as a function of scales.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
It's called dark matter.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
That is matter that doesn't interact with light

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
the typical way that ordinary matter does,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
the way the light's shining on me or on the stage.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
It's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
we're going to make it white. OK?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
It should be called invisible matter,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
but the dark matter we've made visible.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And the stuff that is in the yellow color,
