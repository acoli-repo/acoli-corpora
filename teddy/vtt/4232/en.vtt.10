00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
but we'll see about how things are going on.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So the way these measurements were done,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
there's been a set of satellites, and this is where you get to see.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So there was the COBE satellite, which was launched in 1989,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and we discovered these variations.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And then in 2000, the MAP satellite was launched -- the WMAP --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and it made somewhat better pictures.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And later this year -- this is the cool stealth version,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and you should look -- the Planck satellite will be launched,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and it will make very high-resolution maps.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And that will be the sequence of understanding
