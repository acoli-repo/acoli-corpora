00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So let me show you some of nature's patterns

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
that are the result of this.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So there's a dot on here for every galaxy.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
They go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
identify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
estimate how far away they are, and plot them up.
