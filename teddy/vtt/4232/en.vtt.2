00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So that's sort of the part, and let me move on then and show you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If you look at this picture,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And everything but -- four of these light objects are stars,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and you can see them there -- little pluses.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So there's a couple of thousand galaxies

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
you can see easily with your eye in here.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And when I look out at particularly this galaxy,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
which looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
an art design college conference going on,
