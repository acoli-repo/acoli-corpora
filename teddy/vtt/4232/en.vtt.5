00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We're going to try and follow it up.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that it's a time machine, in a certain sense.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
just because that's where we're making observations.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And the moon is only two seconds away, so if you take a picture of the moon

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
using ordinary light, it's the moon two seconds ago, and who cares.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Two seconds is like the present.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal, right,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You'd like to have a little advance warning.
