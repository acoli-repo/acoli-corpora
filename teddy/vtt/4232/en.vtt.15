Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Remember, every spot on here is a galaxy, and you see the galaxies,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
you know, sort of in our neighborhood, and you sort of see the structure.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And you see this thing we call the Great Wall,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and you see the complicated structure, and you see these voids.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together, right.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So there's an interesting pattern,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
We only have a million galaxies, right?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
but, what's going on?
