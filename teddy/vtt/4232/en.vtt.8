00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and so I have a more artistic impression of this.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and around that are the Hubble -- you know, nearby kind of galaxies,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and there's a sphere that marks the different times.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And behind that are some more modern galaxies.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You see the whole big picture?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The beginning of time is funny -- it's on the outside, right?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And then there's a part of the universe we can't see

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
because it's so dense and so hot, light can't escape.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun;

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But you can see the edge of the Sun,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and the universe gets that way, and you can see that.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside,
