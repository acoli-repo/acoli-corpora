00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
well, how did this happen?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Suppose you're the cosmic designer.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It's not just throwing them out at random.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
There's a more complicated process going on here.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
How are you going to end up doing that?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And so now we're in for some serious play.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
That is, we have to seriously play God,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
not just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
What's the kind of technique?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
What's the kind of thing you're going to do?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So I'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
of what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially,
