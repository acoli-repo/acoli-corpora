00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
an art design college conference going on,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and intelligent beings there are thinking about, you know,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
what designs they might do, and there might be a few cosmologists

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
trying to understand where the universe itself came from,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
trying to figure out what's going on over here.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But there's a lot of other galaxies, and some are nearby,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and they're kind of the color of the Sun,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But one of the questions is -- this should be, to you --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
how come there are so many galaxies?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is only 1,000 galaxies.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We think there's on the order -- visible to the Hubble Space Telescope,
