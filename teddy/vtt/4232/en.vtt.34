00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So we have a model, and we can calculate it, and we can use it

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And that design is sort of way beyond

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
what our original imagination ever was.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So this is what we started with 15 years ago,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
with the Cosmic Background Explorer -- made the map on the upper right,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Since then we've had WMAP,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
which just gives us higher angular resolution.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
We see the same large-scale structure,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
but we see additional small-scale structure.
