00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
how hard would it be to assemble this, right?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
How big a contractor team would you need

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
to put this universe together, right?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
That's the issue, right?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And so here we are.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
You see how the filament --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
you see how several filaments are coming together,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
therefore making this supercluster of galaxies.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And you have to understand, this is not how it would actually look

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
if you -- first, you can't travel this fast,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
everything would be distorted,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
This is how, if you took billions of years to go around,
