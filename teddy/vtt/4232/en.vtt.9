00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
which is actually incredibly uniform.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The universe is almost a perfect sphere,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
but there are these very tiny variations

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
which we show here in great exaggeration.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to these more advanced galaxies, and eventually the solar system, and so forth.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So it's a big design job,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
but we'll see about how things are going on.
