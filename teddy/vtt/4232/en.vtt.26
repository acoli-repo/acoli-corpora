00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and you get a large cluster of galaxies.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and you can see what it looks like.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It's only when you look at it at a very large scale,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and explore it and so forth, you realize it's a very intricate,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
complicated kind of a design, right?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And it's grown up in some kind of way.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
So the question is,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
how hard would it be to assemble this, right?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
How big a contractor team would you need
