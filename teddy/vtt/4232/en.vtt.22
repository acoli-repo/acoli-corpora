00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So we live in the boonies.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
We don't live in the center of the solar system,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
we don't live in the center of the galaxy

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So we're zooming in.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
This is a region which probably has more than 100,000,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
on the order of a million galaxies in that region.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
We're going to keep zooming in. OK.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And so I forgot to tell you the scale.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
A parsec is 3.26 light years.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So a gigaparsec is three billion light years -- that's the scale.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance.
