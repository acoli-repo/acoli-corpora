00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And that will be the sequence of understanding

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
the very beginning of the universe.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And what we saw was, we saw these variations, and then they told us

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the secrets, both about the structure of space-time,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and about the contents of the universe,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and about how the universe started in its original motions.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent,
