00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
That's the distance between us and Andromeda, right?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
These little specks that you're seeing in here, they're galaxies.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Now we're going to zoom back out,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and you can see this structure that,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
when we get very far out, looks very regular,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So they're simple building blocks.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
There's a very simple fluid to begin with.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter,
