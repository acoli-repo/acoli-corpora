00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is only 1,000 galaxies.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We think there's on the order -- visible to the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
if you had the time to scan it around --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
about 100 billion galaxies. Right?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's a very large number of galaxies.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
more galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
what kind of creative process and what kind of design

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
produced the world like that?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We're going to try and follow it up.
