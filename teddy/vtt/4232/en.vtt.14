00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
estimate how far away they are, and plot them up.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And just put radially they're going out that way.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
but there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Now I'm going to show you this in 3D.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
What happens is, you take pictures

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
as the Earth rotates, you get a fan across the sky.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
or because there are no telescopes available to do it.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?
