00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
but, what's going on?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
There's another survey which is very similar to this,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
called the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And every time there's a galaxy -- at its location there's a galaxy --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and if we know anything about the galaxy, which we do,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
because there's a redshift measurement and everything,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
you put in the type of galaxy and the color,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
so this is the real representation.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And when you're in the middle of the galaxies

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
it's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
it's hard to see the pattern of this.
