00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
This is how, if you took billions of years to go around,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
it might look to you, right?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And if you could see invisible matter, too.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
in a very simple way?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
plus our other instruments,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
was once in a region that was smaller than an atom.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
but expanding at a tremendous rate.
