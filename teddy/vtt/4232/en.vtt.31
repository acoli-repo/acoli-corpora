00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
This is light over density, pulls the material around in.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
That pulls in more material and pulls in more material.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
But the distances on the universe are so large

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
in terms of its expansion.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And at that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see,
