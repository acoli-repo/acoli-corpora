Kim Scott: We all have our biases,

00:00:02.287 --> 00:00:06.121
the set of assumptions that we make
and the things we don't notice

00:00:06.163 --> 00:00:09.038
about people's race, gender, religion,

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.038
sexual orientation, appearance
and other traits.

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.871
They come from the part of our mind
that jumps to conclusions

00:00:15.913 --> 00:00:18.621
that we might not
even be aware that we have.

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:20.413
Trier Bryant: I really can't tell you

00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:23.038
the number of times people assumed
I was a receptionist

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.079
when I was an executive at the company.

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:28.746
KS: That kind of bias gets in the way
of good collaboration,

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:30.871
performance and decision making.
