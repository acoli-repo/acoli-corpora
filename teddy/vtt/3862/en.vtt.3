00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:30.516
the pressure sensor would detect an
increase in pressure caused by body weight

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:33.971
and then wirelessly send an audible alert
to the caregiver's smartphone.

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:36.312
That way, my aunt could sleep
much better at night

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:39.002
without having to worry
about my grandfather's wandering.

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:42.934
So now I'd like to perform
a demonstration of this sock.

00:01:45.134 --> 00:01:47.802
Could I please have
my sock model on the stage?

00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:50.560
Great.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.950
So once the patient
steps onto the floor --

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.510
(Ringing) --

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.182
an alert is sent
to the caregiver's smartphone.
