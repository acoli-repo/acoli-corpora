00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:04.425
When I laid out my plan, I realized
that I faced three main challenges:

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:06.194
first, creating a sensor;

00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:07.773
second, designing a circuit;

00:03:07.773 --> 00:03:09.519
and third, coding a smartphone app.

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.927
This made me realize that my project
was actually much harder to realize

00:03:12.927 --> 00:03:14.982
than I initially had thought it to be.

00:03:14.982 --> 00:03:18.476
First, I had to create a wearable sensor
that was thin and flexible enough


00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:21.237
to be worn comfortably
on the bottom of the patient's foot.

00:03:21.237 --> 00:03:24.656
After extensive research and testing
of different materials like rubber,

00:03:24.656 --> 00:03:28.191
which I realized was too thick to be worn
snugly on the bottom of the foot,

00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:29.758
I decided to print a film sensor

00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:32.660
with electrically conductive
pressure-sensitive ink particles.
