an alert is sent
to the caregiver's smartphone.

00:02:04.571 --> 00:02:06.057
Thank you. (Applause)

00:02:06.057 --> 00:02:09.225
Thank you, sock model.

00:02:12.045 --> 00:02:14.649
So this is a drawing
of my preliminary design.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.441
My desire to create
a sensor-based technology

00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:21.969
perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love
for sensors and technology.

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.465
When I was six years old,

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:25.795
an elderly family friend
fell down in the bathroom

00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:27.505
and suffered severe injuries.

00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:29.606
I became concerned
about my own grandparents

00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:31.958
and decided to invent
a smart bathroom system.
