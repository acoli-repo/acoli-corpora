00:04:29.782 --> 00:04:32.682
I've tested the device on my grandfather
for about a year now,

00:04:32.682 --> 00:04:34.593
and it's had a 100 percent success rate

00:04:34.593 --> 00:04:38.089
in detecting the over 900 
known cases of his wandering.

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.052
Last summer, I was able
to beta test my device

00:04:41.052 --> 00:04:43.598
at several residential
care facilities in California,

00:04:43.598 --> 00:04:45.770
and I'm currently incorporating
the feedback

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.733
to further improve the device 
into a marketable product.

00:04:48.733 --> 00:04:50.841
Testing the device on a number of patients

00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:53.350
made me realize that I needed
to invent solutions

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.235
for people who didn't want
to wear socks to sleep at night.

00:04:56.805 --> 00:04:59.630
So sensor data, collected
on a vast number of patients,

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.959
can be useful for improving patient care
