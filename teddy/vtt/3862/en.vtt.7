00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:32.660
with electrically conductive
pressure-sensitive ink particles.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.236
Once pressure is applied, the connectivity
between the particles increases.

00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:39.200
Therefore, I could design a circuit
that would measure pressure

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.967
by measuring electrical resistance.

00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:44.026
Next, I had to design
a wearable wireless circuit,

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:47.338
but wireless signal transmission
consumes lots of power

00:03:47.338 --> 00:03:49.101
and requires heavy, bulky batteries.

00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:52.728
Thankfully, I was able to find out
about the Bluetooth low energy technology,

00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:56.251
which consumes very little power
and can be driven by a coin-sized battery.

00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:59.880
This prevented the system
from dying in the middle of the night.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.343
Lastly, I had to code a smartphone app
that would essentially transform
