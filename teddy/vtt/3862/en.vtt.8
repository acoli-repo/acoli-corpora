Lastly, I had to code a smartphone app
that would essentially transform

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.821
the care-giver's smartphone
into a remote monitor.

00:04:05.821 --> 00:04:09.497
For this, I had to expand upon
my knowledge of coding with Java and XCode

00:04:09.497 --> 00:04:12.984
and I also had to learn about how to code
for Bluetooth low energy devices

00:04:12.984 --> 00:04:15.860
by watching YouTube tutorials
and reading various textbooks.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.019
Integrating these components, I was able
to successfully create two prototypes,

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.347
one in which the sensor
is embedded inside a sock,

00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:25.743
and another that's
a re-attachable sensor assembly

00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:27.949
that can be adhered anywhere
that makes contact

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.782
with the bottom of the patient's foot.

00:04:29.782 --> 00:04:32.682
I've tested the device on my grandfather
for about a year now,
