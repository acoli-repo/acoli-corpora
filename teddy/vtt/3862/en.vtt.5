00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:31.958
and decided to invent
a smart bathroom system.

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.566
Motion sensors would be installed
inside the tiles of bathroom floors

00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:39.404
to detect the falls of elderly patients
whenever they fell down in the bathroom.

00:02:39.404 --> 00:02:41.416
Since I was only six years old at the time

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:43.739
and I hadn't graduated
from kindergarten yet,

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.073
I didn't have the necessary resources and 
tools to translate my idea into reality,

00:02:48.073 --> 00:02:50.706
but nonetheless, my research experience

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:54.957
really implanted in me a firm desire
to use sensors to help the elderly people.

00:02:54.957 --> 00:02:59.573
I really believe that sensors can improve
the quality of life of the elderly.
