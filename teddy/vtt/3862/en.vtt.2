00:00:57.302 --> 00:01:00.349
really struggled to stay awake at night
to keep an eye on him,

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:03.047
and even then often failed
to catch him leaving the bed.

00:01:03.047 --> 00:01:05.858
I became really concerned
about my aunt's well-being

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:07.599
as well as my grandfather's safety.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:11.130
I searched extensively for a solution
that could help my family's problems,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.490
but couldn't find one.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.693
Then, one night about two years ago,

00:01:15.693 --> 00:01:19.158
I was looking after my grandfather
and I saw him stepping out of the bed.

00:01:19.158 --> 00:01:21.150
The moment his foot landed on the floor,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.412
I thought, why don't I put
a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot?

00:01:24.412 --> 00:01:26.809
Once he stepped onto the floor
and out of the bed,

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:30.516
the pressure sensor would detect an
increase in pressure caused by body weight
