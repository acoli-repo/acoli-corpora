00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:30.967
the struggles of caring
for an Alzheimer's patient.

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:33.107
Growing up in a family
with three generations,

00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:35.262
I've always been very close
to my grandfather.

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:36.689
When I was four years old,

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:39.192
my grandfather and I 
were walking in a park in Japan

00:00:39.192 --> 00:00:40.497
when he suddenly got lost.

00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:43.710
It was one of the scariest moments
I've ever experienced in my life,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.117
and it was also the first
instance that informed us

00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:48.412
that my grandfather
had Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:52.025
Over the past 12 years,
his condition got worse and worse,

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:55.823
and his wandering in particular
caused my family a lot of stress.

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:57.302
My aunt, his primary caregiver,

00:00:57.302 --> 00:01:00.349
really struggled to stay awake at night
to keep an eye on him,
