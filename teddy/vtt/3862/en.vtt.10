00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.959
can be useful for improving patient care

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:04.777
and also leading to a cure
for the disease, possibly.

00:05:04.777 --> 00:05:06.620
For example, I'm currently examining 


00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.848
correlations between the frequency
of a patient's nightly wandering

00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:12.714
and his or her daily activities and diet.

00:05:13.854 --> 00:05:16.615
One thing I'll never forget
is when my device first caught

00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:18.833
my grandfather's wandering
out of bed at night.

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:21.784
At that moment, I was really struck
by the power of technology

00:05:21.784 --> 00:05:23.761
to change lives for the better.

00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.131
People living happily and healthfully --

00:05:26.131 --> 00:05:28.156
that's the world that I imagine.

00:05:28.156 --> 00:05:30.216
Thank you very much.
