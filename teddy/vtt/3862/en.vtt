00:00:00.771 --> 00:00:04.135
What's the fastest growing threat
to Americans' health?

00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:06.973
Cancer? Heart attacks? Diabetes?

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:09.449
The answer is actually none of these;

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.250
it's Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.276
Every 67 seconds,

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:16.221
someone in the United States
is diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:20.149
As the number of Alzheimer's patients
triples by the year 2050,

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:23.446
caring for them, as well as
the rest of the aging population,

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:26.005
will become an overwhelming
societal challenge.

00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:28.465
My family has experienced firsthand

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:30.967
the struggles of caring
for an Alzheimer's patient.
