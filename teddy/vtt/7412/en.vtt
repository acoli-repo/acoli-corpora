In 1995, a fellow named Chris Klebba
decided to open a gym

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:07.962
in his hometown of Northville, Michigan.

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:09.422
Fitness had changed his life,

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:11.507
and he wanted others
in small-town Michigan

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:12.967
to have the same experience.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.596
But the problem with gyms
is they can be intimidating.

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:18.222
It's the ultimate irony.

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:21.100
You go to a gym to get in shape,
but if you're out of shape,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.728
you feel like you need
to get in shape just to show up.

00:00:23.728 --> 00:00:29.067
That's why as many as 50 percent
of gym members quit within the first year,

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:31.444
which is fine if you open
a gym in New York or LA
