“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm
that keeps changing directions.

00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:16.578
You change direction 
but the sandstorm chases you.

00:00:16.578 --> 00:00:19.438
You turn again, but the storm adjusts.

00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:21.428
Over and over you play this out,

00:00:21.428 --> 00:00:25.978
like some ominous dance 
with death just before dawn.

00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:27.173
Why?

00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:31.203
Because this storm isn't something 
that blew in from far away…
