00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
♫ Women of change ♫

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
♫ in these words she said ♫

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
♫ If you're feeling helpless ♫

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
♫ If you're feeling helpless ♫
