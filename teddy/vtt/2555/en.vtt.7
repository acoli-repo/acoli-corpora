00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.096
in the Sundarbans, which is the world's
largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.576
So they were very shocked,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.896
because this is the water they drink,
this is the water they bathe in,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.296
this is the water they fish in --
this is the place where they live.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.216
And also you can see the water is brown,
the mud is brown and oil is brown,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.717
so when everything is mixed up,

00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:48.216
it's really hard to see
what's in the water.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.496
But, there's a technology
that's rather simple,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.056
that's called spectrometry,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.985
that allows you see what's in the water.

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.056
So we built a rough prototype
of a spectrometer,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.016
and you can shine light
through different substances
