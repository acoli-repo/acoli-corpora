00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.536
You can see a progression here --

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.096
we've gone from a local problem
to a remote problem to a global problem.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.073
And it's been super exciting
to work at these different scales,

00:07:38.097 --> 00:07:41.656
with also very simple,
open-source technologies.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.016
But at the same time,
it's been increasingly frustrating

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.736
because we have only started to measure
the damage that we have done.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.840
We haven't even started
to try to solve the problems.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.416
And so I wonder
if we should just take a leap

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.080
and try to invent better ways
to do all these things.
