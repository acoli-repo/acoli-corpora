00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.976
with the help of adults,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.816
and where adults can be kids again.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.976
Student: Acceleration! Acceleration!

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.135
Cesar Harada: We're asking
questions such as,

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.976
can we invent the future of mobility
with renewable energy?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.200
For example.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.616
Or, can we help the mobility
of the aging population

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.040
by transforming very standard wheelchairs
into cool, electric vehicles?

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.776
So plastic, oil and radioactivity
are horrible, horrible legacies,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.320
but the very worst legacy
that we can leave our children is lies.
