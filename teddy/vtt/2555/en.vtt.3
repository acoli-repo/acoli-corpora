00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.576
So we've transformed our tiny
Hong Kong classroom into a workshop.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.256
And so we started building
this small workbench,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.456
with different heights,
so even really short kids can participate.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.656
And let me tell you, kids with power tools
are awesome and safe.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.016
(Laughter)

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.936
Not really.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.176
And so, back to plastic.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.816
We collect this plastic and we grind it
to the size we find it in the ocean,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.016
which is very small
because it breaks down.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.416
And so this is how we work.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.576
I let the imaginations
of my students run wild.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.856
And my job is to try to collect
the best of each kid's idea
