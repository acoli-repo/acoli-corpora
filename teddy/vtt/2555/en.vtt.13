00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.256
And so we built the elevation map,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.896
we sprinkled pigments to represent
real-time data for radioactivity,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.256
and we sprayed water
to simulate the rainfall.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.256
And with this we could see
that the radioactive dust

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.336
was washing from the top of the mountain
into the river system,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.896
and leaking into the ocean.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.520
So it was a rough estimate.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.616
But with this in mind,
we organized this expedition,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.256
which was the closest civilians have been
to the nuclear power plant.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.616
We are sailing 1.5 kilometers away
from the nuclear power plant,
