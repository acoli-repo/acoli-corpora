00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.856
And my job is to try to collect
the best of each kid's idea

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.160
and try to combine it into something
that hopefully would work.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.056
And so we have agreed
that instead of collecting plastic bits,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.056
we are going to collect only the data.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.056
So we're going to get an image
of the plastic with a robot --

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.456
so robots, kids get very excited.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.623
And the next thing we do --
we do what we call "rapid prototyping."

00:02:19.647 --> 00:02:21.336
We are so rapid at prototyping

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.536
that the lunch is still in the lunchbox
when we're hacking it.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.856
(Laughter)

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.136
And we hack table lamps and webcams,
into plumbing fixtures
