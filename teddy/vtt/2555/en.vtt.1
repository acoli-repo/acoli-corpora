00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.496
And growing up, I found out
that adults make a mess,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.320
and they're not very good
at cleaning up after themselves.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.496
Fast forward, I am an adult now,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.496
and I teach citizen science and invention
at the Hong Kong Harbour School.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.856
And it doesn't take too long

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.096
before my students walk on a beach
and stumble upon piles of trash.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.776
So as good citizens,
we clean up the beaches --

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.520
and no, he is not drinking alcohol,
and if he is, I did not give it to him.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.640
(Laughter)

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.176
And so it's sad to say,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.976
but today more than 80 percent 
of the oceans have plastic in them.
