00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.016
and you can shine light
through different substances

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.456
that produce different spectrums,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.336
so that can help you
identify what's in the water.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.256
So we packed this prototype of a sensor,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.520
and we shipped it to Bangladesh.

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.656
So what was cool about this project

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.815
was that beyond addressing
a local problem,

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.269
or looking at a local problem,

00:04:18.293 --> 00:04:22.216
my students used their empathy
and their sense of being creative

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.496
to help, remotely, other kids.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.235
[I can investigate a remote problem]

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.879
So I was very compelled
by doing the second experiments,

00:04:28.903 --> 00:04:31.416
and I wanted to take it even further --
