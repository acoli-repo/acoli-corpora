00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.136
But every night we would report
to "Mission Control" --

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.336
different masks they're wearing.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.736
It could look like they didn't take
the work seriously, but they really did

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.960
because they're going to have to live
with radioactivity their whole life.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.696
And so what we did with them

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.336
is that we'd discuss the data
we collected that day,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.551
and talk about where
we should be going next --

00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:22.696
strategy, itinerary, etc...

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.336
And to do this, we built
a very rough topographical map

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.216
of the region around
the nuclear power plant.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.256
And so we built the elevation map,
