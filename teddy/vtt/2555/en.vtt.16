00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.080
and try to invent better ways
to do all these things.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.096
And so the classroom
started to feel a little bit small,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.816
so we found an industrial
site in Hong Kong,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.096

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.296

It's in central Hong Kong,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.856

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.506
a bit of biology, a bit of optics,

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.022
basically you can build

00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:26.016

adults and kids can play together.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.616
It's a place where
kids' dreams can come true,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.976
with the help of adults,
