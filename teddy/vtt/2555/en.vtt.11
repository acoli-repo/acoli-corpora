If you go outside on the West Coast,
you can measure Fukushima everywhere.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.736
But if you look at the map,
it can look like most of the radioactivity

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.856
has been washed away
from the Japanese coast,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.696
and most of it is now --
it looks like it's safe, it's blue.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.136
Well, reality is a bit
more complicated than this.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.816
So I've been going to Fukushima
every year since the accident,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.376
and I measure independently
and with other scientists,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.256
on land, in the river --

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.016
and this time we wanted to take the kids.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.816
So of course we didn't take the kids,
the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.176
(Laughter)

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.136
But every night we would report
to "Mission Control" --
