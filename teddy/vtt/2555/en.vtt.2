00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.976
but today more than 80 percent 
of the oceans have plastic in them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.280
It's a horrifying fact.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.176
And in past decades,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.656
we've been taking those big ships out
and those big nets,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.016
and we collect those plastic bits
that we look at under a microscope,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.256
and we sort them,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.042
and then we put this data onto a map.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.776
But that takes forever,
it's very expensive,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.936
and so it's quite risky
to take those big boats out.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.896
So with my students, ages six to 15,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.136
we've been dreaming
of inventing a better way.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.576
So we've transformed our tiny
Hong Kong classroom into a workshop.
