00:04:28.903 --> 00:04:31.416
and I wanted to take it even further --

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.040
maybe addressing an even harder problem,
and it's also closer to my heart.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.176
So I'm half Japanese and half French,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.520
and maybe you remember in 2011
there was a massive earthquake in Japan.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.936
It was so violent that it triggered
several giant waves --

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.376
they are called tsunami --

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.360
and those tsunami destroyed many cities
on the eastern coast of Japan.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.040
More than 14,000 people
died in an instant.
