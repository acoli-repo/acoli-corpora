WEBVTT

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.136
And we hack table lamps and webcams,
into plumbing fixtures

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.296
and we assemble that into a floating robot
that will be slowly moving through water

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.416
and through the plastic
that we have there --

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.631
and this is the image
that we get in the robot.

00:02:39.655 --> 00:02:43.376
So we see the plastic pieces
floating slowly through the sensor,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.696
and the computer on board
will process this image,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.816
and measure the size of each particle,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.960
so we have a rough estimate
of how much plastic there is in the water.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.536
So we documented
this invention step by step

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.936
on a website for inventors
called Instructables,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.760
in the hope that somebody
would make it even better.
