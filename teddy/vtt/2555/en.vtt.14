00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.616
We are sailing 1.5 kilometers away
from the nuclear power plant,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.593
and with the help of the local fisherman,

00:07:03.617 --> 00:07:05.856
we are collecting sediment from the seabed

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.336
with a custom sediment sampler
we've invented and built.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.616
We pack the sediment into small bags,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.896
we then dispatch them
to hundreds of small bags

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.856
that we send to different universities,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.856
and we produce the map
of the seabed radioactivity,

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.416
especially in estuaries
where the fish will reproduce,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.496
and I will hope that we will have improved

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.616
the safety of the local fishermen
and of your favorite sushi.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.936
(Laughter)

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.536
You can see a progression here --
