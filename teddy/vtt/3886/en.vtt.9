00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that gives us the quality,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
quantity and shape

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
of material that we desire.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
because then I start to think, wow,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
we could actually imagine

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
growing consumable products.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
What excites me about using microbes

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is their efficiency.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So we only grow what we need.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
There's no waste.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
so for example,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
a waste sugar stream
