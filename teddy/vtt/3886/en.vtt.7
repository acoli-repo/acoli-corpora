00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So if I was to walk outside in the rain

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
wearing this dress today,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I would immediately start to absorb

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
huge amounts of water.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The dress would get really heavy,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and eventually the seams would probably fall apart --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
leaving me feeling rather naked.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Possibly a good performance piece,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
What I'm looking for

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
is a way to give the material

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the qualities that I need.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So what I want to do is say to a future bug,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
