WEBVTT

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
has cooled to below 30 degrees C.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And then we're ready to add the living organism.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And along with that, some acetic acid.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And once you get this process going,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
you can actually recycle

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
your previous fermented liquid.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and a thermostat to regulate it.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So this is my mini fabric farm.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
After about three days,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.
