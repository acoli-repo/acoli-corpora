This is one of the jackets you grew?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
SL: Yes, it is.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
It's probably -- part of the project's still in process

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
because this one

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
(Laughter)

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Suzanne Lee. (SL: Thank you.)

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
