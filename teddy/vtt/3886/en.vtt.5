00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And then you can either cut that out

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and sew it conventionally,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
or you can use the wet material

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
to form it around a three-dimensional shape.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And as it evaporates,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
it will knit itself together, forming seams.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
which intrigues me.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Since it's organic,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I can make it change color without using dye
