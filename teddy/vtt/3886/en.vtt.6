00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I can make it change color without using dye

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
by a process of iron oxidation.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Using fruit and vegetable staining,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
create organic patterning.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And using indigo,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
make it anti-microbial.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And in fact, cotton

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
would take up to 18 dips in indigo

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
to achieve a color this dark.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
it just takes one, and a really short one at that.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So if I was to walk outside in the rain
