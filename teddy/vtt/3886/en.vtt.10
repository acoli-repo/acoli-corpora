00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
so for example,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
a waste sugar stream

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
from a food processing plant.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
along with your vegetable peelings.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
is going to be a replacement

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
for cotton, leather or other textile materials.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
to our increasingly precious natural resources.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
where we see these microbes have their impact.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We could, for example, imagine
