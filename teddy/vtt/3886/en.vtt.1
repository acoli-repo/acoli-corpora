00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which spin cellulose

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in a fermentation process.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Over time, these tiny threads

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
form in the liquid into layers

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and produce a mat on the surface.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So we start by brewing the tea.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We stir this in until it's completely dissolved

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and then pour it into a growth bath.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We need to check that the temperature

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
has cooled to below 30 degrees C.
