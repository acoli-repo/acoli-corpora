"Spin me a thread.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Align it in this direction.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Make it hydrophobic.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And while you're at it,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
just form it around this 3D shape."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and possibly in the future

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
for biocompatible blood vessels,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
possibly even replacement bone tissue.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But with synthetic biology,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to produce something

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that gives us the quality,
