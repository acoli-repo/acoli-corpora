00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And the bacteria are feeding

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
of pure cellulose.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And they're sticking together, forming layers

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and giving us a sheet on the surface.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
After about two to three weeks,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So the bath on the left is after five days,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and on the right, after 10.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And this is a static culture.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You don't have to do anything to it;

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you just literally watch it grow.
