00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So as a fashion designer,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I've always tended to think of materials

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
something like this,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
or this,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
or maybe this.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But then I met a biologist,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and now I think of materials like this --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
green tea, sugar,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a few microbes and a little time.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which is a symbiotic mix

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which spin cellulose
