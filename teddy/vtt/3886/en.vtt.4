00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You don't have to do anything to it;

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you just literally watch it grow.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It doesn't need light.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and you wash it in cold, soapy water.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
At this point, it's really heavy.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It's over 90 percent water,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
so we need to let that evaporate.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Again, you can do that outside

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and just let it dry in the air.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And as it's drying, it's compressing,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so what you're left with, depending on the recipe,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is something that's either

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
like a really light-weight, transparent paper,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.
