We could, for example, imagine

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
growing a lamp, a chair,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a car or maybe even a house.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So I guess what my question to you is:

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
in the future, what would you choose to grow?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Thank you very much.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
(Applause)

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
what you're wearing is not random. (Suzanne Lee: No.)

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This is one of the jackets you grew?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
SL: Yes, it is.
