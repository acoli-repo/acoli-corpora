In February of 1942, 
Mexican farmer Dionisio Pulido

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:15.962
thought he heard thunder 
coming from his cornfield.

00:00:15.962 --> 00:00:19.740
However, the sound wasnâ€™t coming 
from the sky.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.440
The source was a large, smoking crack 
emitting gas and ejecting rocks.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.560
This fissure would come to be known as 
the volcano Paricutin,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.706
and over the next 9 years, its lava 
and ash would cover over 200 square km.
