This illustrates the power
of a conservative climate solution

00:07:31.293 --> 00:07:34.181
based on free markets
and limited government.

00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:37.384
We would end up with less regulation

00:07:37.408 --> 00:07:40.500
and far less pollution at the same time,

00:07:40.524 --> 00:07:44.508
while helping working-class
Americans get ahead.

00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:47.770
Doesn't that sound like something
we could all support?

00:07:47.794 --> 00:07:50.227
(Applause)

00:07:53.903 --> 00:07:58.422
The fourth and final pillar of our program
is a new climate domino effect,

00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.100
based on border carbon adjustments.
