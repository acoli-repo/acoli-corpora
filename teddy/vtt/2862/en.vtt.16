00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.100
based on border carbon adjustments.

00:08:01.124 --> 00:08:03.227
Now that may sound complicated,

00:08:03.251 --> 00:08:05.116
but it, too, is revolutionary,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.001
because it provides us
a whole new strategy

00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:10.573
to reach a global price on carbon,

00:08:10.597 --> 00:08:12.464
which is ultimately what we need.

00:08:12.488 --> 00:08:14.420
Let me show you an example.

00:08:14.444 --> 00:08:17.945
Suppose Country A adopts
a carbon dividends plan,

00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:19.416
and Country B does not.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.843
Well, to level the playing field

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:25.102
and protect the competitiveness
of its industries,

00:08:25.126 --> 00:08:29.024
Country A would tax imports from Country B

00:08:29.048 --> 00:08:30.887
based on their carbon content.
