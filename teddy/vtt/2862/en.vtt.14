00:06:58.442 --> 00:07:02.599

all of those regulations.

00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:06.386
That assumes a carbon tax
starting at 40 dollars per ton,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.403
which translates into roughly
an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.

00:07:12.062 --> 00:07:14.571
Our plan by itself

00:07:14.595 --> 00:07:18.168
would meet the high end
of America's commitment

00:07:18.192 --> 00:07:20.470
under the Paris Climate Agreement,

00:07:20.494 --> 00:07:22.168
and as you can see,

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:25.178
the emissions reductions
would continue over time.

00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:31.269
This illustrates the power
of a conservative climate solution
