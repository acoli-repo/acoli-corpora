00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.455
with border carbon adjustments,

00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:03.938
other countries are compelled
to follow suit.

00:09:03.962 --> 00:09:06.874
One by one the dominoes fall.

00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:09.227
And this domino effect
could start anywhere.

00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:12.661
My preference, strongly,
is the United States,

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:15.212
but it could also start
in the United Kingdom,

00:09:15.236 --> 00:09:17.444
in Germany or another European country,

00:09:17.468 --> 00:09:18.996
or even in China.

00:09:20.012 --> 00:09:22.022
Let's take China as an example.

00:09:22.046 --> 00:09:26.590
China is committed to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions,

00:09:26.614 --> 00:09:28.955
but what its leaders care even more about

00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:33.956
is transitioning their economy
to consumer-led economic development.
