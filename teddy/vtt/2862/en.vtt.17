00:08:29.048 --> 00:08:30.887
based on their carbon content.

00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:32.428
Fair enough.

00:08:32.452 --> 00:08:34.596
But here's where it gets
really interesting,

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.258
because the money raised at the border
would increase the dividends

00:08:38.282 --> 00:08:40.536
going to the citizens of Country A.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.732
Well, how long do you think it would take
the public in Country B to realize

00:08:44.756 --> 00:08:46.688
that that money should be going to them,

00:08:46.713 --> 00:08:49.702
and to push for a carbon
dividends plan in their own land?

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:51.225
Add a few more countries,

00:08:51.249 --> 00:08:54.706
and we get a new climate domino effect.

00:08:55.517 --> 00:08:59.806
Once one major country or region
adopts carbon dividends

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.455
with border carbon adjustments,
