Our Secretary of State will be asking
other countries for NATO contributions,

00:12:33.451 --> 00:12:36.352
and they'll be saying,
"No, give us our Paris commitment.

00:12:36.377 --> 00:12:39.289
Come through on your commitments,
we'll come through on ours."

00:12:39.313 --> 00:12:42.607
So, international, business
and even the Republican base

00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:46.396
will all be calling for
a Republican replacement plan.

00:12:46.577 --> 00:12:49.269
And, hopefully, we've provided one.

00:12:49.531 --> 00:12:50.817
CA: Thank you so much, Ted.

00:12:50.842 --> 00:12:51.992
TH: Thank you, Chris.

00:12:52.017 --> 00:12:55.579
