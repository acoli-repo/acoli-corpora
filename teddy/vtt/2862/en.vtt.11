00:05:28.643 --> 00:05:30.886
According to the US Treasury Department,

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.669
the bottom 70 percent of Americans
would receive more in dividends

00:05:36.693 --> 00:05:39.984
than they would pay
in increased energy prices.

00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:47.001
That means 223 million Americans
would win economically

00:05:47.025 --> 00:05:49.035
from solving climate change.

00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:50.973
And that --

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:52.052
(Applause)

00:05:52.076 --> 00:05:53.626
is revolutionary,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.381
and could fundamentally
alter climate politics.

00:05:58.778 --> 00:06:01.595
But there's another
revolutionary element here.
