00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.418
I'm convinced that the road
to climate progress in the United States

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:33.057
runs through the Republican Party

00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:35.165
and the business community.

00:02:36.252 --> 00:02:39.008
So in launching
the Climate Leadership Council,

00:02:39.032 --> 00:02:42.946
I started by reaching out to a who's who
of Republican elder statesmen

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.160
and business leaders,

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:47.561
including James Baker and George Schultz,

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:51.705
the two most respected Republican
elder statesmen in America;

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:53.598
Martin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw,

00:02:53.622 --> 00:02:57.264
the two most respected
conservative economists in the country;

00:02:57.288 --> 00:02:59.381
and Henry Paulson and Rob Walton,

00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:02.374
two of the most successful
and admired business leaders.
