00:03:27.645 --> 00:03:31.523
Almost every leading
editorial board in the country

00:03:31.547 --> 00:03:33.794
has since endorsed our plan,

00:03:33.818 --> 00:03:38.503
and Fortune 100 companies
from a wide range of industries

00:03:38.527 --> 00:03:40.878
are now getting behind it.

00:03:40.902 --> 00:03:42.863
So by now you're probably wondering,

00:03:42.887 --> 00:03:45.289
what exactly is this plan?

00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:49.681
Well, our carbon dividends solution
is based on four pillars.

00:03:49.705 --> 00:03:53.615
The first is a gradually
rising carbon tax.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.166
Although capitalism is a wonderful system,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.365
like many operating systems,
it's prone to bugs,

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.582
which, in this case, are called
"market failures."
