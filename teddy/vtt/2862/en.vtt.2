00:00:55.867 --> 00:01:00.284
In the technology world, a killer app
is an application so transformative

00:01:00.308 --> 00:01:01.787
that it creates its own market,

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.376
like Uber.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.027
In the climate world,

00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:09.976
a killer app is a new
solution so promising

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.547
that it can break through
the seemingly insurmountable

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:15.432
barriers to progress.

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:18.981
These include the psychological barrier.

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.218
Climate advocates have long
been encouraging their fellow citizens

00:01:22.242 --> 00:01:24.152
to make short-term sacrifices now

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:26.213
for benefits that accrue to other people

00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:29.581
in other countries 30 or 40
years in the future.

00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:33.908
It just doesn't fly because it runs
contrary to basic human nature.
