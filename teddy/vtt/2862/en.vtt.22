I've seen a conservative
get a standing O at TED before that.

00:11:01.497 --> 00:11:02.925

00:11:03.734 --> 00:11:05.559
The logic seems really powerful,

00:11:05.584 --> 00:11:07.653
but some people you talk to in politics

00:11:07.678 --> 00:11:11.749
say it's hard to imagine this
still getting through Congress.

00:11:11.773 --> 00:11:13.987
How are you feeling
about momentum behind this?

00:11:14.312 --> 00:11:17.936
Ted Halstead: So I understand
that many are very pessimistic

00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:21.010
about what's happening in
the United States with President Trump.

00:11:21.034 --> 00:11:22.612
I'm less pessimistic; here's why.

00:11:22.637 --> 00:11:25.642
The actions of this White House,
the early actions on climate,

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:31.246
are just the first move
in a complex game of climate chess.
