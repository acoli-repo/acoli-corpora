the Walt Disney Concert Hall,
designed by Frank Gehry,

00:09:01.823 --> 00:09:03.554
one of my all-time heroes.

00:09:04.208 --> 00:09:07.565
In 2018, I had a call
from the LA Philharmonic

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.500
who was looking for an installation

00:09:09.524 --> 00:09:13.614
to help mark the celebrated symphony's
hundred-year anniversary.

00:09:13.638 --> 00:09:17.010
For this, we decided to ask the question,

00:09:17.034 --> 00:09:19.974
"Can a building learn? Can it dream?"

00:09:20.614 --> 00:09:21.791
To answer this question,

00:09:21.815 --> 00:09:27.646
we decided to collect everything recorded
in the archives of the LA Phil and WDCH.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:32.535
To be precise, 77 terabytes
of digitally archived memories.
