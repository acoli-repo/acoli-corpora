00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.017
when starting our journey
to embed media arts into architecture,

00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:03.699
to collide virtual and physical worlds.

00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:09.294
So we began to imagine
what I would call the poetics of data.

00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:12.841
One of our first projects,
"Virtual Depictions,"

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:14.964
was a public data sculpture piece

00:03:14.988 --> 00:03:17.688
commissioned by the city of San Francisco.

00:03:17.712 --> 00:03:19.918
The work invites the audience

00:03:19.942 --> 00:03:23.157
to be part of a spectacular
aesthetic experience

00:03:23.181 --> 00:03:24.820
in a living urban space

00:03:24.844 --> 00:03:30.415
by depicting a fluid network
of connections of the city itself.
