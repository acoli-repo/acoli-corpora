an AI exploring approximately
1.7 million documents that span 270 years.

00:06:01.788 --> 00:06:04.630
One of our inspirations
during this process

00:06:04.654 --> 00:06:08.081
was a short story
called "The Library of Babel"

00:06:08.105 --> 00:06:11.312
by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges.

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:17.065
In the story, the author conceives
a universe in the form of a vast library

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:23.000
containing all possible 410-page books
of a certain format and character set.

00:06:23.024 --> 00:06:24.493
Through this inspiring image,

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:29.247
we imagine a way to physically explore
the vast archives of knowledge

00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.762
in the age of machine intelligence.
