00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:01.651
I rented a car and drove downtown

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:04.721
to see that wonderful world
of the near future.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.128
I remember a specific line

00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:10.221
that kept playing
over and over in my head:

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:12.340
the scene when the android Rachael

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:16.079
realizes that her memories
are actually not hers,

00:01:16.103 --> 00:01:20.754
and when Deckard tells her
they are someone else's memories.

00:01:20.778 --> 00:01:22.011
Since that moment,

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:24.915
one of my inspirations
has been this question.

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:29.900
What can a machine do
with someone else's memories?

00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:32.627
Or, to say that in another way,
