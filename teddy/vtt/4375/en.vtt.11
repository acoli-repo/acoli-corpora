Research in artificial intelligence
is growing every day,

00:05:32.208 --> 00:05:36.086
leaving us with the feeling
of being plugged into a system

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.404
that is bigger and more knowledgeable

00:05:38.428 --> 00:05:39.880
than ourselves.

00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:43.508
In 2017, we discovered
an open-source library

00:05:43.532 --> 00:05:46.174
of cultural documents in Istanbul

00:05:46.198 --> 00:05:49.658
and began working on "Archive Dreaming,"

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:53.976
one of the first AI-driven
public installations in the world,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.975
an AI exploring approximately
1.7 million documents that span 270 years.
