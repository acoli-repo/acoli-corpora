to transform wind speed,
gust and direction

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.303
into an ethereal data pigment.

00:04:36.387 --> 00:04:40.418
The result was a meditative
yet speculative experience.

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.212
This kinetic data sculpture,
titled "Bosphorus,"

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:48.553
was a similar attempt to question
our capacity to reimagine

00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:49.982
natural occurrences.

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:55.736
Using high-frequency radar collections
of the Marmara Sea,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.990
we collected sea-surface data

00:04:58.014 --> 00:05:01.195
and projected its dynamic movement
with machine intelligence.
