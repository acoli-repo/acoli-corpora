Every image that you are seeing in here

00:10:31.873 --> 00:10:34.945
represents unique moments
from those talks.

00:10:34.969 --> 00:10:36.842
By using machine intelligence,

00:10:36.866 --> 00:10:41.167
we processed a total of 487,000 sentences

00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:45.580
into 330 unique clusters of topics
like nature, global emissions,

00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:48.890
extinction, race issues, computation,

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:52.454
trust, emotions, water and refugees.

00:10:52.478 --> 00:10:55.327
These clusters are then
connected to each other

00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:56.613
by an algorithm,

00:10:56.637 --> 00:11:00.479
[that] generated 113 million
line segments,
