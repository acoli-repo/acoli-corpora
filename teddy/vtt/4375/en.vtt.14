00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:02.256
to find and process over
100 million photographs of the city.

00:07:03.008 --> 00:07:06.090
We designed an innovative narrative system

00:07:06.114 --> 00:07:12.317
to use artificial intelligence
to predict or to hallucinate new images,

00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:16.264
allowing the viewer
to step into a dreamlike fusion

00:07:16.288 --> 00:07:18.412
of past and future New York.

00:07:19.832 --> 00:07:21.651
As our projects delve deeper

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:25.351
into remembering
and transmitting knowledge,

00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:30.333
we thought more about how memories
were not static recollections
