00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:32.535
To be precise, 77 terabytes
of digitally archived memories.

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:34.726
By using machine intelligence,

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.166
the entire archive, going back 100 years,

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.195
became projections on the building's skin,

00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:45.163
42 projectors to achieve
this futuristic public experience

00:09:45.187 --> 00:09:47.362
in the heart of Los Angeles,

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:51.369
getting one step closer
to the LA of "Blade Runner."

00:09:52.146 --> 00:09:54.660
If ever a building could dream,

00:09:54.684 --> 00:09:56.361
it was in this moment.

00:09:59.703 --> 00:10:04.449
Now, I am inviting you to one last journey
into the mind of a machine.
