00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:31.956
as a child growing up in Istanbul.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.371
One day, my mom brought home
a videocassette

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:38.078
of the science-fiction movie
"Blade Runner."

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:41.077
I clearly remember being mesmerized

00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:46.010
by the stunning architectural vision
of the future of Los Angeles,

00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:48.586
a place that I had never seen before.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.007
That vision became
a kind of a staple of my daydreams.

00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:56.793
When I arrived in LA in 2012

00:00:56.817 --> 00:00:59.237
for a graduate program
in Design Media Arts,

00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:01.651
I rented a car and drove downtown
