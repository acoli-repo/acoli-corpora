00:03:59.327 --> 00:04:03.833
through the vast potential
of machine intelligence,

00:04:03.857 --> 00:04:09.072
we also pondered the connection
between human senses

00:04:09.096 --> 00:04:12.747
and the machines' capacity
for simulating nature.

00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:17.771
These inquiries began
while working on wind-data paintings.

00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:20.755
They took the shape of visualized poems

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.593
based on hidden data sets
that we collected from wind sensors.

00:04:25.617 --> 00:04:28.430
We then used generative algorithms

00:04:28.454 --> 00:04:32.645
to transform wind speed,
gust and direction
