the artwork generated by EEG data

00:08:37.882 --> 00:08:41.184
explored the materiality of remembering

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:45.588
and stood as a tribute
to what my uncle had lost.

00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:51.487
Almost nothing about contemporary LA

00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:55.272
matched my childhood
expectation of the city,

00:08:55.296 --> 00:08:58.386
with the exception
of one amazing building:

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.799
the Walt Disney Concert Hall,
designed by Frank Gehry,
