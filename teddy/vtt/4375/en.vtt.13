00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.762
in the age of machine intelligence.

00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:33.844
The resulting work, as you can see,

00:06:33.868 --> 00:06:36.491
was a user-driven immersive space.

00:06:36.515 --> 00:06:41.390
"Archive Dreaming" profoundly transformed
the experience of a library

00:06:41.414 --> 00:06:44.163
in the age of machine intelligence.

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:48.255
"Machine Hallucination"
is an exploration of time and space

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:52.732
experienced through New York City's
public photographic archives.

00:06:52.756 --> 00:06:55.382
For this one-of-a-kind immersive project,

00:06:55.406 --> 00:06:58.070
we deployed machine-learning algorithms

00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:02.256
to find and process over
100 million photographs of the city.
