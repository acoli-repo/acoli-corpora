If machines can learn or process memories,

00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:05.134
can they also dream?

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.644
Hallucinate?

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.082
Involuntarily remember,

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:13.059
or make connections
between multiple people's dreams?

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:19.106
Does being an AI in the 21st century
simply mean not forgetting anything?

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:21.548
And, if so,

00:02:21.572 --> 00:02:25.826
isn't it the most revolutionary thing
that we have experienced

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.762
in our centuries-long effort
to capture history across media?
