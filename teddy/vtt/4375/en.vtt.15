were not static recollections

00:07:30.357 --> 00:07:33.718
but ever-changing
interpretations of past events.

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:36.350
We pondered how machines

00:07:36.374 --> 00:07:40.404

such as dreaming,
remembering and hallucinating.

00:07:45.356 --> 00:07:48.260

00:07:48.284 --> 00:07:50.705
to visualize the moment of remembering.

00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:58.026

00:07:59.602 --> 00:08:02.023
At that time, all I could think about
