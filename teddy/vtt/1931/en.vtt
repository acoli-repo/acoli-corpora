00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:03.714
I thought I'd talk a little bit
about how nature makes materials.

00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:05.928
I brought along with me an abalone shell.

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:08.527
This abalone shell
is a biocomposite material

00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:11.400
that's 98 percent by mass
calcium carbonate

00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:13.955
and two percent by mass protein.

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:17.675
Yet, it's 3,000 times tougher
than its geological counterpart.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.138
And a lot of people might use
structures like abalone shells,

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:22.314
like chalk.

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:25.129
I've been fascinated
by how nature makes materials,

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:28.508
and there's a lot of secrets
to how they do such an exquisite job.

00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:32.800
Part of it is that these materials
are macroscopic in structure,
