It changes quickly
as the water and animals move.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.600
And it's deep and dark and cold,
and the pressures there are enormous.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.400
What we do know is fascinating.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.200
You may be imagining
huge monsters lurking in the deep sea,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.840
but most of the animals are very small,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.560
like this lantern fish.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.096
And this fierce-looking fish
is called a bristlemouth.
