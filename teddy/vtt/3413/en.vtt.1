give us a clue that
these waters teem with life:

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.576
microbes, plankton, fish.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.856
Everything that lives here
has amazing adaptations

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.000
for the challenges
of such an extreme environment.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.976
These animals help support
top predators such as whales, tuna,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.800
swordfish and sharks.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.496
There could be 10 times
more fish biomass here

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.176
than previously thought.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.120
In fact, maybe more
than all the rest of the ocean combined.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.856
There are countless
undiscovered species in deep waters,
