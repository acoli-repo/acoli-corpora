00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.280
and remain isolated from the atmosphere
for hundreds or even thousands of years.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.776
In this way, the migration
may help keep carbon dioxide

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.456
out of our atmosphere

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.720
and limit the effects
of global warming on our climate.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.136
But we still have many questions.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.416
We don't know which species are migrating,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.976
what they're finding to eat,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.776
who is trying to eat them

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.240
or how much carbon
they are able to transport.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.040
So I'm a scientist
who studies life in the ocean.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.480
For me, curiosity about these things
is a powerful driver,
