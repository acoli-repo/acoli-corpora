00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.616
We now know those tiny cells
are the most abundant

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.880
photosynthetic organisms on earth.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.336
This amazing discovery happened
because we used new technology

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.200
to see life in the ocean in a new way.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.616
I am convinced that the discoveries
awaiting us in the twilight zone

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.840
will be just as breathtaking.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.296
We know so little about the twilight zone
because it's difficult to study.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.136
It's exceedingly large,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.336
spanning from the Arctic
to the Southern Ocean

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.696
and around the globe.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.136
It's different from place to place.
