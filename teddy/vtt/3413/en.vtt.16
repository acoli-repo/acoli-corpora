00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.976
We will deploy cameras
and samplers on smart robots

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.840
to patrol the depths and help us track
the secret lives of animals like salps.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.576
We will use advanced sonar

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.560
to figure out how many fish
and other animals are down there.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.696
We will sequence DNA from the environment
in a kind of forensic analysis

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.936
to figure out which species are there

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.200
and what they are eating.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.936
With so much that's still
unknown about the twilight zone,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.400
there's an almost unlimited
opportunity for new discovery.
