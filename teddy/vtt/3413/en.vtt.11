and for nutraceuticals such as krill oil.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.736
Industry is on the brink
of deepening fisheries such as these

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.456
into the mid-water

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.896
in what could start
a kind of twilight zone gold rush

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.280
operating outside the reach
of national fishing regulations.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.656
This could have irreversible
global-scale impacts

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.080
on marine life and food webs.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.016
We need to get out
ahead of fishing impacts

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.040
and work to understand
this critical part of the ocean.
