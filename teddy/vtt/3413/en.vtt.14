We used to think these animals
found all of their food in surface waters.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.760
We now believe they depend
on the twilight zone.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.456
But we still need to figure out
how they find the best areas to feed,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.976
what they're eating there

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.880
and how much their diets depend
on twilight zone species.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.400
We will also need new technologies
to explore the links with climate.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.760
Remember these particles?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.640
Some of them are produced
by gelatinous animals called salps.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.536
Salps are like superefficient
vacuum cleaners,
