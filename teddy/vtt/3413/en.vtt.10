For me, curiosity about these things
is a powerful driver,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.280
but there's more to the motivation here.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.736
We need to answer these questions
and answer them quickly,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.360
because the twilight zone is under threat.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.136
Factory ships in the open ocean

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.576
have been vacuuming up

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.520
hundreds of thousands of tons of small,
shrimp-like animals called krill.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.176
The animals are ground into fish meal

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.416
to support increasing demands
for aquaculture

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.416
and for nutraceuticals such as krill oil.
