00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.776
At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.000
I'm really fortunate to be surrounded
by colleagues who share this passion.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.336
Together, we are ready
to launch a large-scale exploration

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.600
of the twilight zone.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.216
We have a plan to begin right away

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.136
with expeditions in the North Atlantic,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.256
where we'll tackle the big challenges

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.440
of observing and studying
the twilight zone's remarkable diversity.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.576
This kind of multiscale,
multidimensional exploration

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.200
means we need to integrate
new technologies.
