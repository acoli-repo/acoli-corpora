00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.280
Let me show you a recent example
that has changed our thinking.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.616
Satellite tracking devices
on animals such as sharks

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.496
are now showing us that many top predators

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.440
regularly dive deep
into the twilight zone to feed.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.136
And when we map their swimming patterns
and compare them to satellite data,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.176
we find that their feeding hot spots

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.120
are linked to ocean currents
and other features.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.840
We used to think these animals
found all of their food in surface waters.
