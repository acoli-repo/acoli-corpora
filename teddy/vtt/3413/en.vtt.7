00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.576
around 400 meters in these data.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.576
So much sound bounces off this layer,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.880
it's been mistaken for the ocean bottom.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.696
But if we look, it can't be,
because the layer is deep during the day,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.736
it rises up at night

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.200
and the pattern repeats day after day.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.656
This is actually the largest
animal migration on earth.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.136
It happens around the globe every day,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.896
sweeping through the world's oceans
in a massive living wave

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.656
as twilight zone inhabitants
travel hundreds of meters

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.296
to surface waters to feed at night
