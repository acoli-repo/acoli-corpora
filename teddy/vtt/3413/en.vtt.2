00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.856
There are countless
undiscovered species in deep waters,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.600
and life in the twilight zone
is intertwined with earth's climate.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.256
Yet the twilight zone
is virtually unexplored.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.920
There are so many things
we still don't know about it.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.760
I think we can change that.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.296
I was drawn to oceanography
by just this kind of challenge.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.496
To me it represents
the perfect intersection

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.656
of science, technology and the unknown,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.640
the spark for so many breakthrough
discoveries about life on our planet.
