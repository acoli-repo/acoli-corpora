to surface waters to feed at night

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.480
and return to the relative safety
of deeper, darker waters during the day.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.616
These animals and their movements
help connect the surface and deep ocean

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.920
in important ways.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.696
The animals feed near the surface,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.495
they bring carbon in their food
into the deep waters,

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.336
where some of that carbon can stay behind

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.280
and remain isolated from the atmosphere
for hundreds or even thousands of years.
