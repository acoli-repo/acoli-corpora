00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.640
the spark for so many breakthrough
discoveries about life on our planet.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.816
As a college student,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.536
I went on an expedition
across the Atlantic

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.136
with a team of scientists
using a high-powered laser

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.000
to measure microscopic algae.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.416
The wild thing that happened on that trip

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.960
is that we discovered what everyone
who looked before had completely missed:

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.520
photosynthetic cells
smaller than anyone thought possible.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.616
We now know those tiny cells
are the most abundant
