00:01:56.968 --> 00:02:00.840
until finally, he broke right through.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.600
King Minos's wife, Pasiphaë,
had been cursed by the god Poseidon

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.870
to fall in love
with the king's prized bull.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.329
Under this spell, she asked Daedalus
to help her seduce it.

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.929
With characteristic audacity, he agreed.

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.802
Daedalus constructed a hollow
wooden cow

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:23.091
so realistic that it fooled the bull.

00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:26.441
With Pasiphaë hiding inside
Daedalus's creation,

00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:32.165
she conceived and gave birth
to the half-human half-bull minotaur.
