00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:32.979
Daedalus was welcomed 
with open arms by Crete's King Minos.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.558
There, acting as the palace 
technical advisor,

00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:38.819
Daedalus continued to push the boundaries.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.129
For the king's children,

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:44.559
he made mechanically animated toys
that seemed alive.

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:50.118
He invented the ship's sail and mast,
which gave humans control over the wind.

00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:53.228
With every creation, Daedalus challenged
human limitations

00:01:53.228 --> 00:01:56.968
that had so far kept mortals
separate from gods,

00:01:56.968 --> 00:02:00.840
until finally, he broke right through.
