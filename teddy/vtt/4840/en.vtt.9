00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:32.194
Just as Daedalus had many times ignored

00:04:32.194 --> 00:04:36.413
the consequences of defying 
the natural laws of mortal men

00:04:36.413 --> 00:04:38.533
in the service of his ego,

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:43.744
Icarus was also carried away
by his own hubris.

00:04:43.744 --> 00:04:44.742
In the end,

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:49.533
both men paid for their departure 
from the path of moderation dearly,

00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:51.134
Icarus with his life

00:04:51.134 --> 00:04:53.843
and Daedalus with his regret.
