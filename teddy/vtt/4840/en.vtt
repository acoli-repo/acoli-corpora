00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:09.386
In mythological ancient Greece,

00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:13.569
soaring above Crete on wings made
from wax and feathers,

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:19.346
Icarus, the son of Daedalus,
defied the laws of both man and nature.

00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:23.137
Ignoring the warnings of his father,
he rose higher and higher.

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:26.368
To witnesses on the ground,
he looked like a god,

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:30.677
and as he peered down from above,
he felt like one, too.
