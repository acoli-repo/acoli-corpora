00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:34.842
flying too near the ocean 
would dampen the wings

00:03:34.842 --> 00:03:37.201
and make them too heavy to use.

00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:39.122
Flying too near the sun,

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:43.802
the heat would melt the wax
and the wings would disintegrate.

00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:47.192
In either case, they surely would die.

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:52.578
Therefore, the key to their escape
would be in keeping to the middle.

00:03:52.578 --> 00:03:56.553
With the instructions clear,
both men leapt from the tower.

00:03:56.553 --> 00:04:00.113
They were the first mortals ever to fly.
