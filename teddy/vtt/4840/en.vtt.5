she conceived and gave birth
to the half-human half-bull minotaur.

00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:34.661
This, of course, enraged the king

00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:40.955
who blamed Daedalus for enabling
such a horrible perversion of natural law.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:45.691
As punishment, Daedalus was forced
to construct an inescapable labyrinth

00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:49.894
beneath the palace for the minotaur.

00:02:49.894 --> 00:02:52.962
When it was finished, Minos then
imprisoned Daedalus

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:54.951
and his only son Icarus

00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:58.710
within the top of the tallest tower
on the island

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.085
where they were to remain 
for the rest of their lives.
