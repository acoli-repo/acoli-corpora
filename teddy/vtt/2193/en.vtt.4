00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:01.553
physical inactivity and poor nutrition,

00:02:01.577 --> 00:02:04.934
that we can prevent
80 percent of heart disease,

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.264
80 percent of type 2 diabetes

00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:09.419
and 40 percent of cancer.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.322
But we also know

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:16.339
that changing health behaviors
is very difficult.

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:18.187
So we asked the question:

00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:22.538
What if we could create a resource

00:02:22.562 --> 00:02:26.752
that could motivate people
to change health behavior?

00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:31.746
The truth is, there are a lot
of these resources out there
