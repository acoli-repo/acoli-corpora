00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.908
illnesses like heart disease,
asthma, diabetes --

00:00:30.932 --> 00:00:34.171
and needed more than just
handing them a prescription

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:38.122
or providing grief counseling
in the office to get the job done.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.174
Fast-forward 15 years later:

00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:43.065
I'm in Atlanta, Georgia;

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.186
it's a different world,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.038
but it was déjà vu all over again.

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:52.228
As doctors, we see our patients
who have chronic illnesses

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.537
in an episodic way.

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:55.842
In between,

00:00:55.866 --> 00:01:00.413
the patients have to learn how to make
a lot of decisions for themselves.
