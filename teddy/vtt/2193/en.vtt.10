My team and I call this
"culturally congruent coaching."

00:05:02.253 --> 00:05:05.374
To illustrate this concept
of culturally congruent coaching,

00:05:05.398 --> 00:05:07.532
I want to tell you about
one of our patients.

00:05:07.556 --> 00:05:09.185
I'll call her Ms. Bertha.

00:05:09.933 --> 00:05:14.278
So Ms. Bertha is an 83-year-old lady
with diabetes and hypertension.

00:05:14.302 --> 00:05:17.638
She was assigned to Anne,
her health coach in the church.

00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:22.050
Anne also happened to be a family friend
to Ms. Bertha for many years,

00:05:22.074 --> 00:05:24.005
and they were fellow congregants.

00:05:25.394 --> 00:05:28.113
Anne observed after the first few visits

00:05:28.137 --> 00:05:31.631
that even though Ms. Bertha
faithfully recorded her stats,
