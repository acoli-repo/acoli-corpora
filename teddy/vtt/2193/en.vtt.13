00:06:28.574 --> 00:06:32.390
Within three months, Ms. Bertha's numbers
were all in the green.

00:06:32.414 --> 00:06:37.478
No one was more excited
or surprised than Ms. Bertha herself.

00:06:37.502 --> 00:06:40.350
Now, Anne was successful as a health coach

00:06:40.374 --> 00:06:43.928
because she cared enough
to go below the surface

00:06:43.952 --> 00:06:46.553
and probe Ms. Bertha's deep culture

00:06:46.577 --> 00:06:48.867
and was able to reach her at that level.

00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:50.298
She knew how to listen,

00:06:50.322 --> 00:06:52.343
and she knew how to ask
the right questions

00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:54.309
to get to what was needed.

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:57.663
We all have deep unconscious rules

00:06:57.687 --> 00:07:00.703
that drive the way we make
our health decisions.
