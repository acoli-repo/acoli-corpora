WEBVTT

00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:01.459
have created a
technology-based application

00:03:01.483 --> 00:03:04.147
to assist with chronic illness care.

00:03:04.171 --> 00:03:06.530
It's freely available on the web

00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:07.815
and as an app.

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:11.132
And what we do is get people
to track variables --

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:12.921
blood pressure, blood sugar --

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:17.276
and then report it back to them
in a color-coded format.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.899
So green would indicate a healthy range,

00:03:19.923 --> 00:03:24.086
and red would indicate a problem
that needs something done about it.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.812
We link these stats to a curriculum.

00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:32.071
The curriculum helps the individual
learn about their health condition,
