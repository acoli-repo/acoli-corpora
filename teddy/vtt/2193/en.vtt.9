00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:31.059
was that the group from the church
did just as well or even better

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:33.964
than the group that were
under purely medical care.

00:04:33.988 --> 00:04:36.725
And we wanted to learn why that was.

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:39.270
So we looked a little further
into the research --

00:04:39.294 --> 00:04:42.403
400 hours of recorded conversation --

00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:46.331
and what we learned was that
the coaches from the church

00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:49.969
did have more time to spend
with the patients,

00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:52.483
they had access to the patients' families,

00:04:52.507 --> 00:04:55.062
and so they could figure out
what people needed

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.753
and provide those resources for them.

00:04:57.777 --> 00:05:01.634
My team and I call this
"culturally congruent coaching."
