00:00:00.095 --> 00:00:01.874
I'm really excited to be here today.

00:00:01.898 --> 00:00:05.000
I'll show you some stuff
that's just ready to come out of the lab,

00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:07.800
literally, and I'm really glad
that you guys

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:10.296
are going to be among
the first to see it in person,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.809
because I really think this is going
to really change

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.315
the way we interact
with machines from this point on.

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.014
Now, this is a rear-projected
drafting table.

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:19.260
It's about 36 inches wide

00:00:19.284 --> 00:00:21.367
and it's equipped
with a multi-touch sensor.

00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:23.035
Normal touch sensors that you see,

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:25.196
like on a kiosk
or interactive whiteboards,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.803
can only register one point
of contact at a time.

00:00:28.137 --> 00:00:31.852
This thing allows you to have
multiple points at the same time.
