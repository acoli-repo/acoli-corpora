00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a medical illustrator,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and I come from a slightly different point of view.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've been watching, since I grew up,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and truth and beauty in the sciences.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And while these are both wonderful things in their own right --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
they both have very wonderful things going for them --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins
