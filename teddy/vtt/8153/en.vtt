People often confuse food allergies
and food intolerances.

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:05.877
But it's important to know the difference

00:00:05.918 --> 00:00:08.171
because they each require
a different treatment.

00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:10.256
So what is the difference?

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.888
A food allergy is your body's
immune system

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.141
responding to specific proteins
in certain foods.

00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:21.684
For instance, in shellfish,

00:00:21.726 --> 00:00:25.772
one of the triggers for allergic reactions
is a protein called tropomyosin.

00:00:25.813 --> 00:00:30.068
And with peanuts, it can be a reaction
to one of its many proteins.
