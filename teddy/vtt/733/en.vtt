00:00:00.146 --> 00:00:01.824
I'll never forget that day

00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:05.723
back in the spring of 2006.

00:00:05.723 --> 00:00:07.302
I was a surgical resident

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:09.733
at The Johns Hopkins Hospital,

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.510
taking emergency call.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.873
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning

00:00:14.873 --> 00:00:16.900
to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.694
on her foot.

00:00:18.694 --> 00:00:22.395
I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:26.022
as I pulled the curtain back to see her.

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:28.367
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:29.719
and she needed to be in the hospital.

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.319
That wasn't being asked.
