00:08:58.523 --> 00:09:02.287
why do we give 100 percent
of our streets to cars?

00:09:02.928 --> 00:09:06.107
What if we gave 70 percent of the streets

00:09:06.131 --> 00:09:08.306
to car-free, to everybody else,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.575
so that the transit
could move well for them,

00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:12.924
so that they could walk,
so they could bike?

00:09:12.948 --> 00:09:14.346
Why not have --

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.823
(Applause)

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.000
geographic equity

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:20.395
in our circulation system?

00:09:20.698 --> 00:09:24.091
And quite frankly,
cities would function better.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.770
No matter what they do,

00:09:25.794 --> 00:09:28.224
no matter how many ring roads
they build in Beijing,

00:09:28.248 --> 00:09:31.176
they just can't overcome
complete gridlock.
