00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:02.924
and it isn't just ExxonMobil
and oil companies.

00:01:02.948 --> 00:01:04.661
It's us; how we live.

00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:07.560
How we live.

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:09.609
There's a villain in this story.

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:13.146
It's called sprawl,
and I'll be upfront about that.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.955
But it's not just the kind of sprawl
you think of, or many people think of,

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.609
as low-density development

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:21.281
out at the periphery
of the metropolitan area.

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:26.652
Actually, I think sprawl can happen
anywhere, at any density.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.497
The key attribute
is that it isolates people.
