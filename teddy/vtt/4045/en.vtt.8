from somewhere
in the mid-26,000 per household,

00:04:05.064 --> 00:04:09.944
has a huge impact
not just on air quality and carbon

00:04:09.968 --> 00:04:12.539
but also on the household pocketbook.

00:04:12.563 --> 00:04:15.556
It's very expensive to drive that much,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.972
and as we've seen,

00:04:16.996 --> 00:04:19.511
the middle class is struggling to hold on.

00:04:20.313 --> 00:04:24.298
Health care: we were talking about
how do you fix it once we broke it --

00:04:24.322 --> 00:04:25.481
clean the air.

00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:27.496
Why not just stop polluting?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.948
Why not just use our feet and bikes more?
