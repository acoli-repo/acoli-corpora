But in order to move inventory,

00:05:01.466 --> 00:05:04.672
you can discount the financing
and get it sold.

00:05:04.696 --> 00:05:06.544
I think that's a lot of what happened.

00:05:06.568 --> 00:05:09.234
Reducing cost by 10,000 dollars --

00:05:09.258 --> 00:05:12.095
remember, in California
the median is 50,000 --

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:14.000
this is a big element.

00:05:14.024 --> 00:05:16.653
That's just cars and utility costs.

00:05:16.677 --> 00:05:20.877
So the affordable housing advocates,
who often sit off in their silos

00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:25.365
separate from the environmentalists,
separate from the politicians,

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.367
everybody fighting with everyone,

00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:29.309
now begin to see common cause,

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:32.769
and I think the common cause
is what really brings about the change.
