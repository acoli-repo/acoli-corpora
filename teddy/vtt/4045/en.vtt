00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:02.656
So, let me add to the complexity

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.246
of the situation we find ourselves in.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.596
At the same time that we're solving
for climate change,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.423
we're going to be building cities
for three billion people.

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:17.185
That's a doubling
of the urban environment.

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:19.580
If we don't get that right,

00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:24.135
I'm not sure all the climate solutions
in the world will save mankind,

00:00:24.807 --> 00:00:28.582
because so much depends
on how we shape our cities:

00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:30.836
not just environmental impacts,
