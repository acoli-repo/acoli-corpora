00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:33.499
It's just more of the same:
shopping malls, subdivisions,

00:02:33.523 --> 00:02:34.707
office parks.

00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:38.521
The other one was dominated by,
not everybody moving to the city,

00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:40.228
but just compact development,

00:02:40.252 --> 00:02:42.810
what we used to think of
as streetcar suburbs,

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:44.073
walkable neighborhoods,

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:48.362
low-rise, but integrated,
mixed-used environments.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.405
And the results are astounding.

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.592
They're astounding not just
for the scale of the difference

00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:58.851
of this one shift
in our city-making habit

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:03.589
but also because each one represents
a special interest group,
