00:09:28.248 --> 00:09:31.176
they just can't overcome
complete gridlock.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.888
So this is an auto-free street,
mixed use along the edge.

00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:37.525
It has transit running down the middle.

00:09:37.549 --> 00:09:40.653
I'm happy to make that transit
autonomous vehicles,

00:09:40.677 --> 00:09:43.587
but maybe I'll have a chance
to talk about that later.

00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:47.334
So there are seven principles
that have now been adopted

00:09:47.358 --> 00:09:50.058
by the highest levels
in the Chinese government,

00:09:50.082 --> 00:09:51.877
and they're moving to implement them.

00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:53.063
And they're simple,

00:09:53.087 --> 00:09:55.700
and they are globally,
I think, universal principles.

00:09:55.724 --> 00:09:59.377
One is to preserve
the natural environment, the history

00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:01.368
and the critical agriculture.
