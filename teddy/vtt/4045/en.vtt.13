00:06:26.777 --> 00:06:30.305
and of course this amazing smog
that was just spoken to.

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:33.558
Twelve percent of GDP
in China now is spent

00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:35.779
on the health impacts of that.

00:06:35.803 --> 00:06:39.068
The history, of course,
of Chinese cities is robust.

00:06:39.092 --> 00:06:40.344
It's like any other place.

00:06:40.368 --> 00:06:43.380
Community was all about small, local shops

00:06:43.404 --> 00:06:47.547
and local services and walking,
interacting with your neighbors.

00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:49.695
It may sound utopian, but it's not.

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.686
It's actually what people really want.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.257
The new superblocks --

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:57.201
these are blocks that would have
5,000 units in them,

00:06:57.225 --> 00:07:01.037
and they're gated as well,
because nobody knows anybody else.
