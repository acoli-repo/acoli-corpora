physical footprint.

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.104
Greenhouse gas: tremendous savings,

00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:43.943
because in California, our biggest
carbon emission comes from cars,

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:47.667
and cities that don't depend
on cars as much

00:03:47.691 --> 00:03:50.738
obviously create huge savings.

00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:54.677
Vehicle miles traveled:

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:59.686
Just reducing the average 10,000 miles
per household per year,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.040
from somewhere
in the mid-26,000 per household,
