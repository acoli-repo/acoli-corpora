Chris Anderson: So, OK:
autonomous driving, self-driving cars.

00:12:11.479 --> 00:12:14.824
A lot of people here
are very excited about them.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:18.402
What are your concerns
or issues about them?

00:12:18.426 --> 00:12:21.568
Peter Calthorpe: Well, I think
there's almost too much hype here.

00:12:21.592 --> 00:12:25.166
First is, everybody says
we're going to get rid of a lot of cars.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.484
What they don't say is you're going
to get a lot more vehicle miles.

00:12:28.508 --> 00:12:31.055
You're going to get a lot more
cars moving on streets.
