00:08:27.484 --> 00:08:30.055
until these set of practices

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:32.633
began experimentation there.

00:08:33.063 --> 00:08:35.018
The urban fabric, small blocks,

00:08:35.042 --> 00:08:37.658
maybe 500 families per block.

00:08:37.682 --> 00:08:38.951
They know each other.

00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:41.338
The street perimeter has shops

00:08:41.362 --> 00:08:43.284
so there's local destinations.

00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:45.663
And the streets themselves become smaller,

00:08:45.687 --> 00:08:47.217
because there are more of them.

00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:48.792
Very simple,

00:08:48.816 --> 00:08:51.371
straightforward urban design.

00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:54.605
Now, here you have something
I dearly love.

00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:55.903
Think of the logic.

00:08:56.352 --> 00:08:58.499
If only a third of the people have cars,

00:08:58.523 --> 00:09:02.287
why do we give 100 percent
of our streets to cars?
