00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.590
So let me take you through one exercise.

00:02:00.614 --> 00:02:04.380
We developed the model
for the state of California

00:02:04.404 --> 00:02:07.487
so they could get on
with reducing carbon emissions.

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:13.542
We did a whole series of scenarios
for how the state could grow,

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.689
and this is just one
overly simplified one.

00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:19.509
We mixed different development prototypes

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:23.344
and said they're going to carry us
through the year 2050,

00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:28.124
10 million new crew
in our state of California.

00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:29.943
And one was sprawl.

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:33.499
It's just more of the same:
shopping malls, subdivisions,
