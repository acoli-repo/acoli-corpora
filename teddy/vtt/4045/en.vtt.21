00:10:26.506 --> 00:10:30.254
China has now adopted policies
that put six meters of bike lane

00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:31.607
on every street.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.573
They're serious about getting back
to their biking history.

00:10:35.597 --> 00:10:37.053
(Applause)

00:10:37.077 --> 00:10:39.380
Complicated planner-ese here:

00:10:39.404 --> 00:10:40.733
connect.

00:10:40.757 --> 00:10:44.269
It's a street network
that allows many routes

00:10:44.293 --> 00:10:46.104
instead of singular routes

00:10:46.128 --> 00:10:49.675
and provides many kinds of streets
instead of just one.

00:10:50.752 --> 00:10:52.096
Ride.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.430
We have to invest more in transit.

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.229
There's no silver bullet.

00:10:56.253 --> 00:10:59.317
Autonomous vehicles are not
going to solve this for us.

00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:04.507
As a matter of fact, they're going
to generate more traffic, more VMT,
