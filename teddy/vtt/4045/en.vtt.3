The key attribute
is that it isolates people.

00:01:31.054 --> 00:01:34.944
It segregates people
into economic enclaves

00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:36.560
and land-use enclaves.

00:01:36.584 --> 00:01:38.680
It separates them from nature.

00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:41.858
It doesn't allow the cross-fertilization,

00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:43.146
the interaction,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.593
that make cities great places

00:01:45.617 --> 00:01:47.863
and that make society thrive.

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:53.131
So the antidote to sprawl is really
what we all need to be thinking about,

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:57.578
especially when we're taking on
this massive construction project.

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.590
So let me take you through one exercise.
