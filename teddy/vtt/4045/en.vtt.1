00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:30.836
not just environmental impacts,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.496
but our social well-being,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.802
our economic vitality,

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.625
our sense of community and connectedness.

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:41.325
Fundamentally, the way we shape cities
is a manifestation

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:44.008
of the kind of humanity we bring to bear.

00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:47.142
And so getting it right is, I think,

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.812
the order of the day.

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:52.464
And to a certain degree, getting it right
can help us solve climate change,

00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:53.640
because in the end,

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:57.092
it's our behavior that seems
to be driving the problem.

00:00:57.116 --> 00:00:58.994
The problem isn't free-floating,

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:02.924
and it isn't just ExxonMobil
and oil companies.
