As a matter of fact, they're going
to generate more traffic, more VMT,

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:05.893
than the alternative.

00:11:05.917 --> 00:11:07.131
And focus.

00:11:07.155 --> 00:11:11.311
We have a hierarchy of the city
based on transit

00:11:11.335 --> 00:11:14.498
rather than the old armature of freeways.

00:11:14.522 --> 00:11:16.672
It's a big paradigm shift,

00:11:17.245 --> 00:11:19.912
but those two things
have to get reconnected

00:11:19.936 --> 00:11:24.456
in ways that really shape
the structure of the city.

00:11:25.443 --> 00:11:27.676
So I'm very hopeful.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.473
In California, the United States, China --
these changes are well accepted.
