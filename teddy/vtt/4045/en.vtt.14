and they're gated as well,
because nobody knows anybody else.

00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:04.561
And of course, there isn't even
a sidewalk, no ground floor shops --

00:07:04.585 --> 00:07:06.449
a very sterile environment.

00:07:07.018 --> 00:07:11.634
I found this one case
here in one of the superblocks

00:07:11.658 --> 00:07:14.884
where people had illicitly set up
shops in their garages

00:07:14.908 --> 00:07:18.606
so that they could have that kind
of local service economy.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.387
The desire of people
to get it right is there.

00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:26.699
We just have to get the planners
on board and the politicians.

00:07:27.162 --> 00:07:30.969
All right. Some technical planning stuff.
