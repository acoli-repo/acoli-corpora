If they don't share them,

00:13:00.964 --> 00:13:06.161
you can end up with a 90 percent
increase in vehicle miles traveled.

00:13:06.597 --> 00:13:07.918
If you share them,

00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:11.472
you're still at around
a 30 percent increase in VMT.

00:13:11.496 --> 00:13:14.534
CA: Sharing them, meaning
having multiple people riding at once

00:13:14.558 --> 00:13:16.534
in some sort of intelligent ride-sharing?

00:13:16.558 --> 00:13:19.089
PC: Yeah, so the Uber share
without a steering wheel.

00:13:19.113 --> 00:13:22.962
The reality is, the efficiency
of vehicles -- you can do it

00:13:22.986 --> 00:13:25.477
with or without a steering wheel,
it doesn't matter.

00:13:25.501 --> 00:13:28.994
They claim they're the only ones
that are going to be efficient electric,

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:30.172
but that's not true.
