00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.473
In California, the United States, China --
these changes are well accepted.

00:11:32.497 --> 00:11:35.132
I'm hopeful for two reasons.

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:37.235
One is, most people get it.

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:39.141
They understand intrinsically

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:41.807
what a great city can and should be.

00:11:41.831 --> 00:11:46.672
The second is that the kind of analysis
we can bring to bear now

00:11:46.696 --> 00:11:49.424
allows people to connect the dots,

00:11:49.936 --> 00:11:52.905
allows people to shape
political coalitions

00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:54.358
that didn't exist in the past.

00:11:54.719 --> 00:11:58.459
That allows them to bring into being
the kinds of communities we all need.

00:11:58.483 --> 00:11:59.672
Thank you.

00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:06.273
