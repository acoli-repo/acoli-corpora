00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So my name is Taylor Wilson.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I am 17 years old

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and I am a nuclear physicist,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which may be a little hard to believe, but I am.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I would like to make the case

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that nuclear fusion

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
will be that point,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
will get us to.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So nuclear fusion is our energy future.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And the second point,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
making the case that kids can really change the world.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So you may ask --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
