My name is Mwende Katwiwa

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.136
and I am a poet,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.576
a Pan-Africanist

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.080
and a freedom fighter.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.376
I was 23 years old

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.680
when I first heard
about Reproductive Justice.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.576
I was working at Women with a Vision,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.656
where I learned that Reproductive Justice
was defined by Sister Song as:

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.096
One: A woman's right to decide
if and when she will have a baby

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.736
and the conditions
under which she will give birth.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.336
Two: A woman's right
to decide if she will not have a baby
