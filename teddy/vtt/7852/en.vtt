00:00:07.628 --> 00:00:11.090
Your plan to set up your friend Carey
with your acquaintance Emerson

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.259
is finally coming together.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.887
Both individuals have heard 
all about each other

00:00:15.887 --> 00:00:17.680
and they’re eager to meet for dinner.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.183
You’ve just made them
a reservation for Friday night,

00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:22.310
and you’re about to text Carey 
the details

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.063
when an unsettling thought
crosses your mind:

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:27.106
Carey is always<i> </i>late.

00:00:27.106 --> 00:00:29.108
And not just by 5 minutes;

00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:31.652
we’re talking 20 or even 30 minutes late.
