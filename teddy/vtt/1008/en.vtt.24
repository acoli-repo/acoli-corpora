00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and a sort of dense urban location.

This is our first architectural model.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
This is an aerial photo taken last summer.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And essentially, the apartments cover the parking.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Laughter)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And the facade of the parking,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated,
