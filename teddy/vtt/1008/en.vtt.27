00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
into a Cambodian temple ruin,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
completely covered in green.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So, the Mountain is like our first built example

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
This idea that you can actually create, if not gold,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
then at least added value by mixing

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
traditional ingredients, like normal apartments

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and normal parking,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and in this case actually offer people

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
the chance that they don't have to choose between

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
a life with a garden or a life in the city.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
They can actually have both.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
As an architect, it's really hard to set the agenda.
