00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
state financed propaganda,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
images, statements, but no real experience.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
You can try it.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Like with the water, instead of talking about it,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
we're going to sail a million liters of harbor water

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
from Copenhagen to Shanghai,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
so the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and feel how clean it is.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
This is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
to sail water from Copenhagen to China.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But in fact, the container ships go

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
full of goods from China to Denmark,
