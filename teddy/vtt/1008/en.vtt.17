00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But in fact, the container ships go

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
full of goods from China to Denmark,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and then they sail empty back.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So quite often you load water for ballast.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So we can actually hitch a ride for free.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
we're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So the real Mermaid, the real water, and the real bikes.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And when she's gone, we're going to invite

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
a Chinese artist to reinterpret her.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
of exhibition and bikes.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
When you go to the exhibition, you'll see the Mermaid and the pool.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You'll walk around, start looking for a bicycle on the roof,
