00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
but we discovered that in the People's Republic

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
public school curriculum,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
they have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
or Hans Christian Anderson, as we call him.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
have grown up with "The Emperor's New Clothes,"

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
"The Matchstick Girl" and "The Little Mermaid."

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It's almost like a fragment of Danish culture

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
integrated into Chinese culture.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours.
