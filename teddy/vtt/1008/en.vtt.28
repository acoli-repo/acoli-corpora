As an architect, it's really hard to set the agenda.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
You can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable city

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
in central Asia,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
because that's not really how you get commissions.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
You always have to sort of adapt and improvise

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
to the opportunities and accidents that happen,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and the sort of turmoil of the world.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
One last example is that recently we,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
like last summer, we won the competition

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
to design a Nordic national bank.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
This was the director of the bank when he was still smiling.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
