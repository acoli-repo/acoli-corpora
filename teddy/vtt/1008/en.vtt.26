00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
(Applause)

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So if you go back into the parking, into the corridors,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
it's almost like traveling into a parallel universe

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
from cars and colors,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
into this sort of south-facing urban oasis.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
If you go even further, it turns into this green garden.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And all the rainwater that drops on the Mountain

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
is actually accumulated.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And there is an automatic irrigation system

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
in one or two years it will sort of transform

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
into a Cambodian temple ruin,
