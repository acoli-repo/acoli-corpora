00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
(Laughter)

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Copenhagen, Shanghai,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
modern, European.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
But then we looked at recent urban development,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
30 years ago. All bikes, no cars.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
This is how it looks today; all traffic jam.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Bicycles have become forbidden many places.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Meanwhile, in Copenhagen we're actually expanding the bicycle lanes.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
A third of all the people commute by bike.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
We have a free system of bicycles called the City Bike

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that you can borrow if you visit the city.
