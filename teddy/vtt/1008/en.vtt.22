00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
in a vertical radius of 10 meters.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
The house is sort of a distortion of a square block.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Trying to zigzag it to make sure

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
that all of the apartments look at the straight views,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
instead of into each other.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Until recently, this was the view from my apartment,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
onto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And he said that he was going to do an apartment block

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
next to a parking structure.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And we thought, rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
looking straight into a big boring block of cars,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
why don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses,
