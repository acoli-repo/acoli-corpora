But Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
As you can see, sometimes a subspecies branches off.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And quite often we sit in a design meeting

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and we discover that there is this great idea.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
It doesn't really work in this context.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But for another client in another culture,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
it could really be the right answer to a different question.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So as a result, we never throw anything out.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We keep our office almost like an archive

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
of architectural biodiversity.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You never know when you might need it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And what I'd like to do now, in an act of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
warp-speed storytelling,
