00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You'll walk around, start looking for a bicycle on the roof,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So when we actually won the competition

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And to our surprise we got one of our boards back

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
with corrections from the Chinese state censorship.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
The first thing, the China map missed Taiwan.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
It's a very serious political issue in China. We will add on.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The second thing, we had compared the swan to the dragon,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and then the Chinese state said,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
"Suggest change to panda."
