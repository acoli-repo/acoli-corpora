00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to actually sort of tell stories about architecture.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And we discovered that we didn't have to invent it,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
it already existed in the form of a comic book.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So we basically copied the format of the comic book

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
how our projects actually evolve through adaptation

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and improvisation.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the incidents of the real world.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We call this comic book "Yes is More,"

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More.
