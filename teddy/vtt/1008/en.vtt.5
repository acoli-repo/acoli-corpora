00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
we arrive at a design.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
A very literal way of showing it is a project we did

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
for a library and a hotel in Copenhagen.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The design process was really tough,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
almost like a struggle for survival,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
but gradually an idea evolved:

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
this sort of idea of a rational tower

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that melts together with the surrounding city,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but sort of public on the outside, as well as on the inside,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
with the library.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea.
