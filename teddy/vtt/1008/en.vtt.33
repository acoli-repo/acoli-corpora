00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
So, you can say where an urban development

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
normally happens at the expense of nature,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
in this case it's actually creating nature.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And the buildings, they don't only sort of

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
invoke the imagery of the mountains,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
they also operate like mountains.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
They create shelter from the wind.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
They accumulate the solar energy.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
They accumulate the water.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
So they actually transform the entire island

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
into a single ecosystem.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
So we recently presented the master plan,
