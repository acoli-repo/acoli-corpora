00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
"Suggest change to panda."

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
(Laughter)

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
(Applause)

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So, when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
move our national monument,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the National People's Party sort of rebelled against it.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So for the first time, I got invited to speak at the National Parliament.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
It was kind of interesting because in the morning, from 9 to 11,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
they were discussing the bailout package --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
how many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues.
