00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
(Laughter)

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So the second story that I'd like to tell

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
is, actually starts in my own house.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
This is my apartment.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
This is the view from my apartment,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
that our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And they form this sort of vertical backyard

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
where, on a nice summer day, you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
in a vertical radius of 10 meters.
