00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
as who or what we are against.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The cliche of the radical architect

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Or this idea of the misunderstood genius,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Rather than revolution, we're much more interested in evolution,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
this idea that things gradually evolve

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
by adapting and improvising

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to the changes of the world.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In fact, I actually think that Darwin is one of the people

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
who best explains our design process.
