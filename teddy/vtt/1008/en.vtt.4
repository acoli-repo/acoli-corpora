00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
who best explains our design process.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
His famous evolutionary tree

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
could almost be a diagram of the way we work.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
As you can see, a project evolves through

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
a series of generations of design meetings.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
At each meeting, there's way too many ideas.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Only the best ones can survive.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And through a process of architectural selection,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
we might choose a really beautiful model

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
or we might have a very functional model.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And through these sort of generations of design meetings

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
we arrive at a design.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
A very literal way of showing it is a project we did
