00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And with the People's Building, he saw an architecture

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and the progressive future of China.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
(Applause)

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Unfortunately, Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
(Laughter)
