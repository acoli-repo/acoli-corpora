00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The public debate about architecture

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
quite often just stays on contemplating the final result,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the architectural object.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Is the latest tower in London

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
a gherkin or a sausage

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
or a sex tool?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So recently, we asked ourselves

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
if we could invent a format

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that could actually tell the stories behind the projects,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
maybe combining images and drawings and words

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to actually sort of tell stories about architecture.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And we discovered that we didn't have to invent it,
