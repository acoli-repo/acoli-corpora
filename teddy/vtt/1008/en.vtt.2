00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
He triggered the modernist revolution.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
After him followed the post-modern counter-revolution,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Robert Venturi saying, "Less is a bore."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
After him, Philip Johnson sort of introduced

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
(Laughter)

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
you could say promiscuity, or at least openness

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to new ideas with, "I am a whore."

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Recently, Obama has introduced optimism

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
at a sort of time of global financial crisis.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And what we'd like to say with "Yes is More"

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is basically trying to question this idea

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
as who or what we are against.
