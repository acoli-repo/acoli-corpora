00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
how many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And then from 11 to 1,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
they were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
(Laughter)

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
(Applause)

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
But to conclude, if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
next year, don't come to Copenhagen,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
because she's going to be in Shanghai.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
If you do come to Copenhagen,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
you will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But if the Chinese government intervenes, it might even be a panda.
