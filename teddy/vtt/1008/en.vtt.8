00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
for a hotel in the north of Sweden.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
When we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
it was a really cool scheme, but it didn't exactly

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
look like something from the north of Sweden.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The Swedish jury didn't think so either. So we lost.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
as in the People's Republic of China.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
We even double checked.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And at the same time, we got invited to exhibit

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So we thought like, this is too much of an opportunity,
