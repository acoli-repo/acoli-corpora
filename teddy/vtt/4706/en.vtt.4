00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:00.400
Let's revisit the anglerfish

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.402
moments before it tried to eat you.

00:02:02.402 --> 00:02:04.196
That glowing bait on top of its head?

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:07.181
It comes from a pocket of skin called the esca.

00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:10.035
The esca holds bioluminescent bacteria.

00:02:10.035 --> 00:02:12.290
The anglerfish can't glow there by itself,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.327
so it holds a sack of glowing bacteria instead.

00:02:16.327 --> 00:02:18.001
Remember the firefly?

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.083
It can actually make itself glow.

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:22.674
Inside its lantern are two chemicals,

00:02:22.674 --> 00:02:25.190
a luciferin and a luciferase.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.095
When firefly luciferase and luciferin mix together

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:29.389
in the presence of oxygen

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.474
and fuel for the cell, called ATP,
