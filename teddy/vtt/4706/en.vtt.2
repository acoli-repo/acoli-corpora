00:00:59.862 --> 00:01:02.230
It's like nature made them ready to rave.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.203
Why?

00:01:03.203 --> 00:01:04.539
In one way or another,

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:08.601
bioluminescence improves a living thing's chances of survival.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.044
Take the firefly.

00:01:10.044 --> 00:01:11.603
It's ability to glow green

00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:14.434
helps it attract a mate on a warm, summer night,

00:01:14.434 --> 00:01:17.342
but it's just one of many living things that can glow.

00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:20.054
The railroad worm, Phrixothrix hirtus,

00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:21.936
can light up its body in two colors:

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:23.171
red and green.

00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:24.261
Would you eat something

00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:26.561
that looks like an airport runway?

00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:28.813
Neither would any sensible predator.

00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:31.719
The flashing lights keep the worm safe.
