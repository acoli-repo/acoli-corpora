00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:31.719
The flashing lights keep the worm safe.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.778
Then there's the deep sea shrimp,

00:01:33.778 --> 00:01:35.527
Acantherphyra purpurea.

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:36.862
When it feels threatened,

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:40.027
it spews a cloud of glowing goo from its mouth.

00:01:40.027 --> 00:01:41.326
Who doesn't run the other way

00:01:41.326 --> 00:01:43.600
when they've just been puked on?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.143
Plus, that puke attracts bigger predators

00:01:46.143 --> 00:01:48.386
who want to eat the shrimp's enemy.

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:50.687
So what if you can't bioluminesce?

00:01:50.687 --> 00:01:51.741
No problem!

00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:53.322
There are other ways for living things

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:55.524
to make bioluminescence work for them,

00:01:55.524 --> 00:01:58.556
even if they weren't born with the equipment to glow.

00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:00.400
Let's revisit the anglerfish
