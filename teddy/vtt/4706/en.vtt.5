00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.474
and fuel for the cell, called ATP,

00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:35.184
the chemical reaction gives off energy in the form of light.

00:02:35.184 --> 00:02:36.644
Once scientists figured out

00:02:36.644 --> 00:02:39.606
how the firefly creates its luciferase and luciferin,

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:41.193
they used genetic engineering

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:43.110
to make this light-producing reaction

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.259
occur inside other living things that can't glow.

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.461
For example, they inserted the genes,

00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:50.123
or instructions, for a cell

00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:54.363
to create firefly luciferase and luciferin into a tobacco plant.

00:02:54.363 --> 00:02:57.216
Once there, the tobacco plant followed the instructions

00:02:57.216 --> 00:03:01.231
slipped into its DNA and lit up like a Christmas tree.
