00:02:57.216 --> 00:03:01.231
slipped into its DNA and lit up like a Christmas tree.

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:02.794
The beauty of bioluminescence,

00:03:02.794 --> 00:03:05.544
unlike the light from the sun or an incandescent bulb,

00:03:05.544 --> 00:03:07.136
is that it's not hot.

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:09.422
It takes place in a range of temperatures

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:11.406
that don't burn a living thing.

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:12.844
And unlike a glow stick,

00:03:12.844 --> 00:03:15.720
which fades out as the chemicals inside get used up,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.466
bioluminescent reactions use replenishable resources.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:20.931
That's one reason engineers

00:03:20.931 --> 00:03:24.221
are trying to develop bioluminescent trees.

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:26.767
Just think, if planted on the side of highways,

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:28.817
they could light the way, using only oxygen

00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:32.464
and other freely available, clean resources to run.
