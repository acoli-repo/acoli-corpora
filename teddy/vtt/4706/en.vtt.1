00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.212
a blue light flits around you.

00:00:30.212 --> 00:00:32.396
"I could watch this forever," you think.

00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:33.417
But you can't

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:36.268
because the mouth of an anglerfish has just sprung open

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.471
and eaten you alive.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.046
You are just one of many creatures

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:42.352
at the bottom of the ocean who learn too late

00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:45.939
to appreciate the power of bioluminescence.

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:48.233
Bioluminescence refers to the ability

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:50.858
of certain living things to create light.

00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:52.535
The human body can make stuff

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:55.626
like ear wax and toe nails,

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:57.214
but these organisms can turn

00:00:57.214 --> 00:00:59.862
parts of their body into glow sticks.

00:00:59.862 --> 00:01:02.230
It's like nature made them ready to rave.
