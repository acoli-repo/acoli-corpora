00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:32.464
and other freely available, clean resources to run.

00:03:32.464 --> 00:03:34.539
Talk about survival advantage!

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.157
That could help our planet live longer.

00:03:37.157 --> 00:03:39.494
Do you find yourself thinking of other ways

00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:42.363
to put bioluminescence to good use?

00:03:42.363 --> 00:03:44.402
That glow stick you swing at a rave

00:03:44.402 --> 00:03:46.001
may help you find a mate,

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:49.754
but how else can bioluminescence improve your survival?

00:03:49.754 --> 00:03:51.631
If you start thinking in this way,

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:53.466
you have seen the light.
