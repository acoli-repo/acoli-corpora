00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:02.623
I was born and raised
in Caracas, Venezuela,

00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:04.042
back in the '80s and '90s.

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:05.668
Venezuela is a beautiful country,

00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:09.297
rich with natural treasures
from beaches to rainforests.

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:12.008
But one thing that people
don't quite realize

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:14.343
is that we also have
really tall mountains.

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:15.720
These are part of the Andes,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.514
and they stretch all the way down
from Chile and Argentina.

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:21.517
And they're also home to some
of the very few tropical glaciers

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:22.685
in the world.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:25.146
Back in 1910, when the first
map was drawn,

00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:27.648
Venezuela used to have
five tropical glaciers,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.817
which we used to call
the five white eagles.
