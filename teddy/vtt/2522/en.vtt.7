only one century after Lord Byron
used it to describe himself at 36.

00:03:30.853 --> 00:03:33.130
(Laughter)

00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:36.773
I was mindful, too, that life
can swing wildly and unpredictably

00:03:36.797 --> 00:03:38.585
from one year to the next,

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.384
and that people may experience
the same age differently.

00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:45.619
But even so, as the list coalesced,

00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:49.032
so, too, on the page, clear
as the reflection in the mirror,

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:50.972
did the life that I had been living:

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.129
finding at 20 that "... one is less
and less sure of who one is;"

00:03:56.002 --> 00:04:00.517
emerging at 30 from the "... wasteland
of preparation into active life;"
