the entirety of that same great sequence

00:02:03.464 --> 00:02:06.028
through which the luckiest among us pass.

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:09.797
I was then 37 years old,

"an age of discretion,"

00:02:15.074 --> 00:02:18.298

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.474
had long made clear that growing old
could not be assumed.

00:02:25.056 --> 00:02:28.691

only postponed the inevitable,

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.392
time seeing through
what circumstance did not.
