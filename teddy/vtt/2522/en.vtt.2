the empowerments
and millstones of adulthood;

00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:07.714
the recognitions
and resignations of old age.

00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:10.293
There are patterns to life,

00:01:10.317 --> 00:01:11.651
and they are shared.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.029
As Thomas Mann wrote:
"It will happen to me as to them."

00:01:17.772 --> 00:01:19.989
We don't simply live these patterns.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.742
We record them, too.

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.973
We write them down in books,
where they become narratives

00:01:24.997 --> 00:01:27.191
that we can then read and recognize.

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:29.960
Books tell us who we've been,

00:01:29.984 --> 00:01:32.826
who we are, who we will be, too.
