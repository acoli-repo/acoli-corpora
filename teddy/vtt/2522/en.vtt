00:00:00.774 --> 00:00:03.166
I'm turning 44 next month,

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.670
and I have the sense that 44
is going to be a very good year,

00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:10.595
a year of fulfillment, realization.

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:12.895
I have that sense,

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.966
not because of anything
particular in store for me,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.750
but because I read it would be a good year

00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:21.775
in a 1968 book by Norman Mailer.

00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:25.449
"He felt his own age, forty-four ..."

00:00:25.473 --> 00:00:28.391
wrote Mailer in "The Armies of the Night,"

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:30.877
"... felt as if he were a solid embodiment
