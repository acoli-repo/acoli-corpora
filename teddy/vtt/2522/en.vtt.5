00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.392
time seeing through
what circumstance did not.

00:02:31.947 --> 00:02:33.755
It was all a bit disheartening.

00:02:34.413 --> 00:02:36.834
A list, though, would last.

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:40.479
To chronicle a life
year by vulnerable year

00:02:40.503 --> 00:02:43.740
would be to clasp and to ground
what was fleeting,

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:47.107
would be to provide myself and others
a glimpse into the future,

00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:48.909
whether we made it there or not.

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:53.661
And when I then began to compile my list,
I was quickly obsessed,

00:02:53.685 --> 00:02:56.878
searching pages and pages
for ages and ages.

00:02:57.702 --> 00:03:01.937
Here we were at every annual step
through our first hundred years.
