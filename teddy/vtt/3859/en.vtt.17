00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.697
and they use this to develop
expectations about the world:

00:08:31.697 --> 00:08:33.879
what squeaks and what doesn't,

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:37.024
what to explore and what to ignore.

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:40.450
Let me show you another example now,

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.180
this time about a problem
of causal reasoning.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.619
And it starts with a problem
of confounded evidence

00:08:45.619 --> 00:08:47.291
that all of us have,

00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:49.311
which is that we are part of the world.

00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:52.747
And this might not seem like a problem
to you, but like most problems,

00:08:52.747 --> 00:08:55.084
it's only a problem when things go wrong.

00:08:55.464 --> 00:08:57.275
Take this baby, for instance.

00:08:57.275 --> 00:08:58.980
Things are going wrong for him.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.251
He would like to make
this toy go, and he can't.
