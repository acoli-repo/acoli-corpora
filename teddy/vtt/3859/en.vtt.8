00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.295
is the statistical evidence
the babies are going to observe.

00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:04.608
We're going to show babies
a box of blue and yellow balls,

00:04:04.608 --> 00:04:09.228
and my then-graduate student,
now colleague at Stanford, Hyowon Gweon,

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:12.305
is going to pull three blue balls
in a row out of this box,

00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:15.428
and when she pulls those balls out,
she's going to squeeze them,

00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:17.541
and the balls are going to squeak.

00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:20.304
And if you're a baby,
that's like a TED Talk.

00:04:20.304 --> 00:04:22.208
It doesn't get better than that.

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:24.769
(Laughter)

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:30.627
But the important point is it's really
easy to pull three blue balls in a row
