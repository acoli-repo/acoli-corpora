He would like to make
this toy go, and he can't.

00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:03.780
I'll show you a few-second clip.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.260
And there's two possibilities, broadly:

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.894
Maybe he's doing something wrong,

00:09:13.894 --> 00:09:18.110
or maybe there's something
wrong with the toy.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.221
So in this next experiment,

00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:23.518
we're going to give babies
just a tiny bit of statistical data

00:09:23.518 --> 00:09:26.100
supporting one hypothesis over the other,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.555
and we're going to see if babies
can use that to make different decisions

00:09:29.555 --> 00:09:31.389
about what to do.
