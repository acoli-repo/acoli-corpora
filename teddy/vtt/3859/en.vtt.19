00:09:29.555 --> 00:09:31.389
about what to do.

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:33.411
Here's the setup.

00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:37.101
Hyowon is going to try to make
the toy go and succeed.

00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:40.421
I am then going to try twice
and fail both times,

00:09:40.421 --> 00:09:43.533
and then Hyowon is going
to try again and succeed,

00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:46.705
and this roughly sums up my relationship
to my graduate students

00:09:46.705 --> 00:09:49.540
in technology across the board.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.322
But the important point here is
it provides a little bit of evidence

00:09:53.322 --> 00:09:56.990
that the problem isn't with the toy,
it's with the person.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.340
Some people can make this toy go,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.299
and some can't.
