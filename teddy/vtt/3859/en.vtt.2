00:00:55.716 --> 00:01:00.475
In particular, in my lab in the Department
of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT,

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:04.129
I have spent the past decade
trying to understand the mystery

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.106
of how children learn so much
from so little so quickly.

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.644
Because, it turns out that
the fascinating thing about science

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:15.173
is also a fascinating
thing about children,

00:01:15.173 --> 00:01:17.754
which, to put a gentler
spin on Mark Twain,

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:22.404
is precisely their ability
to draw rich, abstract inferences

00:01:22.404 --> 00:01:27.065
rapidly and accurately
from sparse, noisy data.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.753
I'm going to give you
just two examples today.
