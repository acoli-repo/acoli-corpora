00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:30.627
But the important point is it's really
easy to pull three blue balls in a row

00:04:30.627 --> 00:04:32.932
out of a box of mostly blue balls.

00:04:32.932 --> 00:04:34.992
You could do that with your eyes closed.

00:04:34.992 --> 00:04:37.988
It's plausibly a random sample
from this population.

00:04:37.988 --> 00:04:41.720
And if you can reach into a box at random
and pull out things that squeak,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.559
then maybe everything in the box squeaks.

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:48.209
So maybe babies should expect
those yellow balls to squeak as well.

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:50.728
Now, those yellow balls
have funny sticks on the end,

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:53.585
so babies could do other things
with them if they wanted to.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.416
They could pound them or whack them.

00:04:55.416 --> 00:04:58.002
But let's see what the baby does.
