If you've been following my world,
the field of brain and cognitive sciences,

00:14:03.738 --> 00:14:05.665
for the past few years,

00:14:05.665 --> 00:14:08.080
three big ideas will have come
to your attention.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.516
The first is that this is
the era of the brain.

00:14:11.516 --> 00:14:15.185
And indeed, there have been
staggering discoveries in neuroscience:

00:14:15.185 --> 00:14:18.621
localizing functionally specialized
regions of cortex,

00:14:18.621 --> 00:14:21.222
turning mouse brains transparent,

00:14:21.222 --> 00:14:24.998
activating neurons with light.

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.994
A second big idea

00:14:26.994 --> 00:14:31.098
is that this is the era of big data
and machine learning,
