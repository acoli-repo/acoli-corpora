00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.165
We see how a handful of patients
responds to treatment in a clinical trial,

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:07.230
and we bring drugs to a national market.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.595
But this only works if our sample
is randomly drawn from the population.

00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:14.330
If our sample is cherry-picked
in some way --

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.402
say, we poll only urban voters,

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:20.790
or say, in our clinical trials
for treatments for heart disease,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.671
we include only men --

00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:25.829
the results may not generalize
to the broader population.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.060
So scientists care whether evidence
is randomly sampled or not,
