00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.437
of children's choices in each condition,

00:13:00.437 --> 00:13:04.988
and you'll see that the distribution
of the choices children make

00:13:04.988 --> 00:13:07.775
depends on the evidence they observe.

00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:09.632
So in the second year of life,

00:13:09.632 --> 00:13:12.209
babies can use a tiny bit
of statistical data

00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:15.576
to decide between two
fundamentally different strategies

00:13:15.576 --> 00:13:17.457
for acting in the world:

00:13:17.457 --> 00:13:20.200
asking for help and exploring.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.134
I've just shown you
two laboratory experiments

00:13:25.134 --> 00:13:28.825
out of literally hundreds in the field
that make similar points,

00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:31.217
because the really critical point
