shoes and ships and sealing wax
and cabbages and kings.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.161
So do babies care whether
the tiny bit of evidence they see

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:08.853
is plausibly representative
of a larger population?

00:03:09.763 --> 00:03:11.663
Let's find out.

00:03:11.663 --> 00:03:13.386
I'm going to show you two movies,

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:15.848
one from each of two conditions
of an experiment,

00:03:15.848 --> 00:03:18.286
and because you're going to see
just two movies,

00:03:18.286 --> 00:03:20.422
you're going to see just two babies,

00:03:20.422 --> 00:03:24.369
and any two babies differ from each other
in innumerable ways.

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.420
But these babies, of course,
here stand in for groups of babies,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.315
and the differences you're going to see

00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:34.510
represent average group differences
in babies' behavior across conditions.
