00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:34.510
represent average group differences
in babies' behavior across conditions.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.743
In each movie, you're going to see
a baby doing maybe

00:03:37.743 --> 00:03:41.203
just exactly what you might
expect a baby to do,

00:03:41.203 --> 00:03:45.220
and we can hardly make babies
more magical than they already are.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.100
But to my mind the magical thing,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.189
and what I want you to pay attention to,

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.300
is the contrast between
these two conditions,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.829
because the only thing
that differs between these two movies

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.295
is the statistical evidence
the babies are going to observe.
