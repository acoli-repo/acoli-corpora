because the really critical point

00:13:31.217 --> 00:13:36.325
is that children's ability
to make rich inferences from sparse data

00:13:36.325 --> 00:13:41.666
underlies all the species-specific
cultural learning that we do.

00:13:41.666 --> 00:13:46.263
Children learn about new tools
from just a few examples.

00:13:46.263 --> 00:13:50.980
They learn new causal relationships
from just a few examples.

00:13:51.928 --> 00:13:56.799
They even learn new words,
in this case in American Sign Language.

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:59.110
I want to close with just two points.
