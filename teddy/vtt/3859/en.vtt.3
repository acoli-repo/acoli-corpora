00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.753
I'm going to give you
just two examples today.

00:01:30.753 --> 00:01:33.040
One is about a problem of generalization,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.890
and the other is about a problem
of causal reasoning.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.415
And although I'm going to talk
about work in my lab,

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:41.875
this work is inspired by
and indebted to a field.

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:46.158
I'm grateful to mentors, colleagues,
and collaborators around the world.

00:01:47.308 --> 00:01:50.282
Let me start with the problem
of generalization.

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:54.785
Generalizing from small samples of data
is the bread and butter of science.

00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:57.339
We poll a tiny fraction of the electorate

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:59.660
and we predict the outcome
of national elections.
