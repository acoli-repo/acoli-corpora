00:07:59.414 --> 00:08:03.401
and pull out something that squeaks,
maybe everything in the box squeaks.

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:08.320
So even though babies are going to see
much less evidence for squeaking,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.562
and have many fewer actions to imitate

00:08:10.562 --> 00:08:13.905
in this one ball condition than in
the condition you just saw,

00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:17.797
we predicted that babies themselves
would squeeze more,

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:20.691
and that's exactly what we found.

00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:25.102
So 15-month-old babies,
in this respect, like scientists,

00:08:25.102 --> 00:08:28.190
care whether evidence
is randomly sampled or not,

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.697
and they use this to develop
expectations about the world:
