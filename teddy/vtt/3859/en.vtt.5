00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.060
So scientists care whether evidence
is randomly sampled or not,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.075
but what does that have to do with babies?

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:37.206
Well, babies have to generalize
from small samples of data all the time.

00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:40.364
They see a few rubber ducks
and learn that they float,

00:02:40.364 --> 00:02:43.939
or a few balls and learn that they bounce.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.890
And they develop expectations
about ducks and balls

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.606
that they're going to extend
to rubber ducks and balls

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:51.485
for the rest of their lives.

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:55.224
And the kinds of generalizations
babies have to make about ducks and balls

00:02:55.224 --> 00:02:57.313
they have to make about almost everything:

00:02:57.313 --> 00:03:01.230
shoes and ships and sealing wax
and cabbages and kings.
