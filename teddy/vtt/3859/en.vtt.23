00:11:26.909 --> 00:11:30.996
This time, babies are going to see the toy
work and fail in exactly the same order,

00:11:30.996 --> 00:11:33.411
but we're changing
the distribution of evidence.

00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:37.822
This time, Hyowon is going to succeed
once and fail once, and so am I.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:43.459
And this suggests it doesn't matter
who tries this toy, the toy is broken.

00:11:43.459 --> 00:11:45.345
It doesn't work all the time.

00:11:45.345 --> 00:11:47.310
Again, the baby's going to have a choice.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.706
Her mom is right next to her,
so she can change the person,

00:11:50.706 --> 00:11:53.910
and there's going to be another toy
at the end of the cloth.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.288
Let's watch what she does.

00:11:55.288 --> 00:11:59.636

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:04.620
Let me try one more time.
One, two, three, go!
