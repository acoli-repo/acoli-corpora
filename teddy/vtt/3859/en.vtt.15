00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:30.805
who squeezed the ball in each condition,

00:07:30.805 --> 00:07:34.520
and as you'll see, babies are much
more likely to generalize the evidence

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.655
when it's plausibly representative
of the population

00:07:37.655 --> 00:07:41.393
than when the evidence
is clearly cherry-picked.

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:43.808
And this leads to a fun prediction:

00:07:43.808 --> 00:07:48.676
Suppose you pulled just one blue ball
out of the mostly yellow box.

00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:52.765
You [probably won't] pull three blue balls
in a row at random out of a yellow box,

00:07:52.765 --> 00:07:55.220
but you could randomly sample
just one blue ball.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.190
That's not an improbable sample.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.414
And if you could reach into
a box at random

00:07:59.414 --> 00:08:03.401
and pull out something that squeaks,
maybe everything in the box squeaks.
