The really interesting question

00:06:00.217 --> 00:06:03.069
is what happens when we show babies
exactly the same thing,

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.680
and we can ensure it's exactly the same
because we have a secret compartment

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.790
and we actually pull the balls from there,

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.268
but this time, all we change
is the apparent population

00:06:12.268 --> 00:06:15.170
from which that evidence was drawn.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.723
This time, we're going to show babies
three blue balls

00:06:18.723 --> 00:06:22.107
pulled out of a box
of mostly yellow balls,

00:06:22.107 --> 00:06:23.429
and guess what?

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:26.269
You [probably won't] randomly draw
three blue balls in a row

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:28.753
out of a box of mostly yellow balls.

00:06:28.753 --> 00:06:32.500
That is not plausibly
randomly sampled evidence.
