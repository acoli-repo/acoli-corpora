00:00:00.835 --> 00:00:02.990
Mark Twain summed up
what I take to be

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.110
one of the fundamental problems
of cognitive science

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.820
with a single witticism.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.492
He said, "There's something
fascinating about science.

00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:14.720
One gets such wholesale
returns of conjecture

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.924
out of such a trifling
investment in fact."

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:19.509
(Laughter)

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.803
Twain meant it as a joke,
of course, but he's right:

00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:25.679
There's something
fascinating about science.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.940
From a few bones, we infer
the existence of dinosuars.
