00:14:26.994 --> 00:14:31.098
is that this is the era of big data
and machine learning,

00:14:31.098 --> 00:14:34.239
and machine learning promises
to revolutionize our understanding

00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:38.906
of everything from social networks
to epidemiology.

00:14:38.906 --> 00:14:41.599
And maybe, as it tackles problems
of scene understanding

00:14:41.599 --> 00:14:43.592
and natural language processing,

00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:46.916
to tell us something
about human cognition.

00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:49.693
And the final big idea you'll have heard

00:14:49.693 --> 00:14:53.080
is that maybe it's a good idea we're going
to know so much about brains

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.997
and have so much access to big data,

00:14:54.997 --> 00:14:57.504
because left to our own devices,

00:14:57.504 --> 00:15:01.335
humans are fallible, we take shortcuts,
