People often think the word "doubt" spelling is a little crazy

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:20.607
because of the letter "b".

00:00:20.607 --> 00:00:22.234

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:25.440
most folks can't figure out what it's doing there.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.780

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.268
sound is &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; the most important aspect
