00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:02.782
just how revealing that "b" can be.

00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:05.508
There are only two base words in all of English

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:08.796
that have the letters "d-o-u-b":

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:10.574
one is doubt,

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:12.528
and the other is double.

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:14.372
We can build lots of other words

00:02:14.372 --> 00:02:16.020
on each of these bases,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.990
like doubtful

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.344
and doubtless,

00:02:18.344 --> 00:02:19.513
or doublet,

00:02:19.513 --> 00:02:20.564
and redouble,

00:02:20.564 --> 00:02:22.066
and doubloon.

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:24.508
It turns out that if we look into their history,

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:26.807
we can see that they both derive

00:02:26.807 --> 00:02:29.287
from the same Latin forms.

00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:31.260
The meaning of double,
