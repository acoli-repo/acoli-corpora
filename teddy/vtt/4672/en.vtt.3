00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:30.189
Over time, even as fewer literate people knew Latin,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.756
the "b" was kept because it marked important,

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:35.339
meaningful connections to other related words,

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:38.158
like "dubious" and "indubitalbly,"

00:01:38.158 --> 00:01:40.372
which were subsequently borrowed into English

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:43.802
from the same Latin root, "dubitare".

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:46.098
Understanding these historical connections

00:01:46.098 --> 00:01:48.399
not only helped us to spell "doubt,"

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.403
but also to understand the meaning

00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:53.068
of these more sophisticated words.

00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:55.197
But the story doesn't end there.

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:56.431
If we look even deeper,

00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:59.462
we can see beyond the shadow of a doubt,

00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:02.782
just how revealing that "b" can be.
