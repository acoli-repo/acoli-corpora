00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.723
then we create a tool
to satisfy that need,

00:04:32.747 --> 00:04:34.787
like the loom, in this case,

00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:37.202
and then we study how people use that tool

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:38.711
to automate that user.

00:04:39.242 --> 00:04:42.303
That's how we came
from the mechanical loom

00:04:42.327 --> 00:04:44.223
to the autonomous loom,

00:04:44.247 --> 00:04:46.367
and that took us a thousand years.

00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:48.462
Now, it's taken us only a hundred years

00:04:48.486 --> 00:04:51.697
to use the same script
to automate the car.

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:55.738
But the thing is that, this time around,

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:57.891
automation is kind of for real.

00:04:57.915 --> 00:05:01.236

from Toshiba shared with me
