00:09:28.599 --> 00:09:30.715
to make political decisions
on your behalf.

00:09:31.264 --> 00:09:35.244
Then you take that data and you choose
a training algorithm,

00:09:35.268 --> 00:09:36.831
because it's an open marketplace

00:09:36.855 --> 00:09:39.641
in which different people
can submit different algorithms

00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:44.059
to predict how you're going to vote,
based on the data you have provided.

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:47.538
And the system is open,
so nobody controls the algorithms;

00:09:47.562 --> 00:09:49.674
there are algorithms
that become more popular

00:09:49.698 --> 00:09:51.421
and others that become less popular.

00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:53.252
Eventually, you can audit the system.

00:09:53.276 --> 00:09:55.157
You can see how your avatar is working.

00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:57.333
If you like it,
you can leave it on autopilot.

00:09:57.357 --> 00:09:59.419
If you want to be
a little more controlling,

00:09:59.443 --> 00:10:01.411
you can actually choose that they ask you
