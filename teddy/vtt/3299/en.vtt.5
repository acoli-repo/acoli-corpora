If you look at the 114th US Congress,

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:34.263
you will have seen that
the House of Representatives

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:37.176
considered more than 6,000 bills,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.856
the Senate considered
more than 3,000 bills

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.688
and they approved more than 300 laws.

00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:44.291
Those would be many decisions

00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:46.502
that each person would have to make a week

00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:48.668
on topics that they know little about.

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:51.510
So there's a big cognitive
bandwidth problem

00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:55.526
if we're going to try to think about
direct democracy as a viable alternative.

00:02:56.205 --> 00:03:00.640
So some people think about the idea
of liquid democracy, or fluid democracy,
