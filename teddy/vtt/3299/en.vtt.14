some of the communication

00:07:02.072 --> 00:07:06.219
and help, maybe, make better decisions
or decisions at a larger scale.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.579
And the thing is that the idea
of software agents is also not new.

00:07:10.603 --> 00:07:12.712
We already use them all the time.

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:14.737
We use software agents

00:07:14.761 --> 00:07:18.436
to choose the way that we're going
to drive to a certain location,

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.171

00:07:21.758 --> 00:07:24.779
or to get suggestions
for the next books that we should read.

00:07:25.994 --> 00:07:28.568
So there is an obvious idea
in the 21st century

00:07:28.592 --> 00:07:31.235
that was as obvious as the idea
