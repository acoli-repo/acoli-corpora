So some people think about the idea
of liquid democracy, or fluid democracy,

00:03:00.664 --> 00:03:04.440
which is the idea that you endorse

who can endorse it to someone else,

00:03:06.188 --> 00:03:08.729
and, eventually, you create
a large follower network

00:03:08.753 --> 00:03:12.047
in which, at the end, there's a few people
that are making decisions

00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:15.214
on behalf of all of their followers
and their followers.

00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:20.455
But this idea also doesn't solve
the problem of the cognitive bandwidth

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:24.356
and, to be honest, it's also quite similar

I'm going to be a little bit provocative,

00:03:28.277 --> 00:03:30.577
and I'm going to ask you, well:
