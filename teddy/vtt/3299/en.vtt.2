00:00:57.434 --> 00:01:01.860
And you cannot blame them
because people are tired of politicians.

00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:05.771
And people are tired of other people
using the data that they have generated

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:07.993
to communicate with
their friends and family,

00:01:08.017 --> 00:01:10.111
to target political propaganda at them.

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.247
But the thing about this
is that this is not new.

00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:16.496
Nowadays, people use likes
to target propaganda at you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.893
before they use your zip code
or your gender or your age,

00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:23.487
because the idea of targeting people
with propaganda for political purposes

00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:25.103
is as old as politics.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.808
And the reason why that idea is there

00:01:27.832 --> 00:01:31.304
is because democracy
has a basic vulnerability.
