He was a French weaver and merchant

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.419
that married the loom
with the steam engine

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:05.633

00:04:08.434 --> 00:04:12.319
He could now make fabrics that were

were able to do by hand.

00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:17.825

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.411

00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:29.515
we first identify a need,

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.723
then we create a tool
to satisfy that need,
