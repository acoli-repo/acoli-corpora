This is a video that a colleague of mine
from Toshiba shared with me

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.519
that shows the factory
that manufactures solid state drives.

00:05:04.543 --> 00:05:06.561
The entire factory is a robot.

00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:08.510
There are no humans in that factory.

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:11.254
And the robots are soon
to leave the factories

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:13.300
and become part of our world,

00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:15.159
become part of our workforce.

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:16.956
So what I do in my day job

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.972
is actually create tools that integrate
data for entire countries

00:05:20.996 --> 00:05:24.462
so that we can ultimately have
the foundations that we need

00:05:24.486 --> 00:05:28.173
for a future in which we need
to also manage those machines.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:32.101
But today, I'm not here
to talk to you about these tools
