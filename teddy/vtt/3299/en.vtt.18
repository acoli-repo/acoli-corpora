It would be a very simple system.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.518
Imagine a system that you log in
and you create your avatar,

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:05.998
and then you're going
to start training your avatar.

00:09:06.022 --> 00:09:08.704
So you can provide your avatar
with your reading habits,

00:09:08.728 --> 00:09:10.589
or connect it to your social media,

00:09:10.613 --> 00:09:13.021
or you can connect it to other data,

00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:15.317
for example by taking
psychological tests.

00:09:15.341 --> 00:09:18.309
And the nice thing about this
is that there's no deception.

00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:21.672
You are not providing data to communicate
with your friends and family

00:09:21.696 --> 00:09:24.847
that then gets used in a political system.

00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:28.575
You are providing data to a system
that is designed to be used

00:09:28.599 --> 00:09:30.715
to make political decisions
on your behalf.
