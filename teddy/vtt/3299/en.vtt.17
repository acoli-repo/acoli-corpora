00:08:27.822 --> 00:08:30.778
So there's an obvious idea
that maybe we want to consider.

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:33.224
But I understand that in this day and age,

00:08:33.248 --> 00:08:35.137
this idea might be quite scary.

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:39.831
In fact, thinking of a robot
coming from the future

00:08:39.855 --> 00:08:41.528
to help us run our governments

00:08:41.552 --> 00:08:43.183
sounds terrifying.

00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:45.874
But we've been there before.

00:08:45.898 --> 00:08:47.171
(Laughter)

00:08:47.195 --> 00:08:49.690
And actually he was quite a nice guy.

00:08:51.677 --> 00:08:58.111
So what would the Jacquard loom
version of this idea look like?

00:08:58.135 --> 00:09:00.036
It would be a very simple system.
