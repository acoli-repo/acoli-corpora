WEBVTT

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:32.754
and we look at people that participated
in EU parliamentary elections,

00:00:32.778 --> 00:00:34.849
the median turnout in those elections

00:00:34.873 --> 00:00:36.977
is just 42 percent.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:39.794
Now let's go to New York,

00:00:39.818 --> 00:00:44.499
and let's see how many people voted
in the last election for mayor.

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:48.340
We will find that only
24 percent of people showed up to vote.

00:00:49.063 --> 00:00:52.158
What that means is that,
if "Friends" was still running,

00:00:52.182 --> 00:00:55.530
Joey and maybe Phoebe
would have shown up to vote.

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:56.844
(Laughter)

00:00:57.434 --> 00:01:01.860
And you cannot blame them
because people are tired of politicians.
