00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:01.051
that have different points of view,

00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:03.688
require participation, require debate,

00:06:03.712 --> 00:06:05.190
require deliberation.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:09.045
And for a long time,
we have thought that, well,

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.529
what we need to improve democracy
is actually more communication.

00:06:12.553 --> 00:06:16.262
So all of the technologies that we have
advanced in the context of democracy,

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:19.064
whether they are newspapers
or whether it is social media,

00:06:19.088 --> 00:06:21.470
have tried to provide us
with more communication.

00:06:22.103 --> 00:06:23.925
But we've been down that rabbit hole,

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.697
and we know that's not
what's going to solve the problem.

00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:28.717
Because it's not a communication problem,

00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:30.489
it's a cognitive bandwidth problem.
