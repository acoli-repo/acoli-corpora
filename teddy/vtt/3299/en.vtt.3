00:01:27.832 --> 00:01:31.304
is because democracy
has a basic vulnerability.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.642
This is the idea of a representative.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.993
In principle, democracy is the ability
of people to exert power.

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:41.835
But in practice, we have to delegate
that power to a representative

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.114
that can exert that power for us.

00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:46.386
That representative is a bottleneck,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.707
or a weak spot.

00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:51.680
It is the place that you want to target
if you want to attack democracy

00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:55.193
because you can capture democracy
by either capturing that representative

00:01:55.217 --> 00:01:57.365
or capturing the way
that people choose it.

00:01:58.065 --> 00:01:59.481
So the big question is:

00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:01.209
Is this the end of history?
