you can actually choose that they ask you

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:03.503
every time they're going
to make a decision,

00:10:03.527 --> 00:10:05.162
or you can be anywhere in between.

00:10:05.186 --> 00:10:07.591
One of the reasons
why we use democracy so little

00:10:07.615 --> 00:10:11.183
may be because democracy
has a very bad user interface.

00:10:11.207 --> 00:10:13.690
And if we improve the user
interface of democracy,

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:15.841
we might be able to use it more.

00:10:16.452 --> 00:10:19.659
Of course, there's a lot of questions
that you might have.

00:10:20.473 --> 00:10:22.634
Well, how do you train these avatars?

00:10:22.658 --> 00:10:24.552
How do you keep the data secure?

00:10:24.576 --> 00:10:27.824
How do you keep the systems
distributed and auditable?

00:10:27.848 --> 00:10:29.910
How about my grandmother,
who's 80 years old

00:10:29.946 --> 00:10:31.906
and doesn't know how to use the internet?
