00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:30.489
it's a cognitive bandwidth problem.

00:06:30.513 --> 00:06:32.879
So if the problem is one
of cognitive bandwidth,

00:06:32.903 --> 00:06:35.490
well, adding more communication to people

00:06:35.514 --> 00:06:38.258
is not going to be
what's going to solve it.

00:06:38.282 --> 00:06:41.395
What we are going to need instead
is to have other technologies

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:44.465
that help us deal with
some of the communication

00:06:44.489 --> 00:06:46.731
that we are overloaded with.

00:06:46.755 --> 00:06:48.454
Think of, like, a little avatar,

00:06:48.478 --> 00:06:49.817
a software agent,

00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:51.719
a digital Jiminy Cricket --

00:06:51.743 --> 00:06:52.981
(Laughter)

00:06:53.005 --> 00:06:57.017
that basically is able
to answer things on your behalf.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.546
And if we had that technology,

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.048
we would be able to offload
some of the communication
