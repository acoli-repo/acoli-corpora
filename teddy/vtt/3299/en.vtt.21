and doesn't know how to use the internet?

00:10:32.262 --> 00:10:34.483
Trust me, I've heard them all.

00:10:34.507 --> 00:10:39.067
So when you think about an idea like this,
you have to beware of pessimists

00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:43.410
because they are known to have
a problem for every solution.

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:45.259
(Laughter)

00:10:45.283 --> 00:10:48.323
So I want to invite you to think
about the bigger ideas.

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:51.973
The questions I just showed you
are little ideas

00:10:51.997 --> 00:10:54.899
because they are questions
about how this would not work.

00:10:55.502 --> 00:10:57.483
The big ideas are ideas of:

00:10:57.507 --> 00:10:59.314
What else can you do with this

00:10:59.338 --> 00:11:01.227
if this would happen to work?
