00:10:59.338 --> 00:11:01.227
if this would happen to work?

00:11:01.774 --> 00:11:05.219
And one of those ideas is,
well, who writes the laws?

00:11:05.854 --> 00:11:10.077
In the beginning, we could have
the avatars that we already have,

00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:13.598
voting on laws that are written
by the senators or politicians

00:11:13.622 --> 00:11:14.973
that we already have.

00:11:15.491 --> 00:11:17.205
But if this were to work,

00:11:17.902 --> 00:11:20.252
you could write an algorithm

00:11:20.276 --> 00:11:22.426
that could try to write a law

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.871
that would get a certain
percentage of approval,

00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:26.677
and you could reverse the process.

00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:30.213
Now, you might think that this idea
is ludicrous and we should not do it,
