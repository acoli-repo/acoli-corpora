Now, you might think that this idea
is ludicrous and we should not do it,

00:11:30.237 --> 00:11:33.023
but you cannot deny that it's an idea
that is only possible

00:11:33.047 --> 00:11:36.067
in a world in which direct democracy
and software agents

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:38.747
are a viable form of participation.

00:11:40.596 --> 00:11:43.349
So how do we start the revolution?

00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:47.548
We don't start this revolution
with picket fences or protests

00:11:47.572 --> 00:11:51.762
or by demanding our current politicians
to be changed into robots.

00:11:51.786 --> 00:11:53.335
That's not going to work.

00:11:53.359 --> 00:11:54.971
This is much more simple,

00:11:54.995 --> 00:11:56.154
much slower

00:11:56.178 --> 00:11:57.592
and much more humble.

00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:01.965
We start this revolution by creating
simple systems like this in grad schools,
