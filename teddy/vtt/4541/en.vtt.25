00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:30.407
I go, "Great!"

00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:32.126
They get me out on the tarmac,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.618
and there was this red, white and blue
airplane -- it was beautiful.

00:12:35.642 --> 00:12:39.428
They had to slide me up on the wing
to put me in the cockpit.

00:12:39.452 --> 00:12:42.211
They sat me down. There are buttons
and dials everywhere.

00:12:42.235 --> 00:12:45.840
I'm going, "Wow, how do you ever know
what all these buttons and dials do?"

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:48.515
Andrew got in the front,
started the plane, and said,

00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:50.517
"Would you like to have a go at taxiing?"

00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:53.287
That's when you use your feet
to control the rudder pedals

00:12:53.311 --> 00:12:55.158
to control the airplane on the ground.

00:12:55.182 --> 00:12:57.057
I said, "No, I can't use my legs."

00:12:57.081 --> 00:12:58.264
He went, "Oh."

00:12:58.288 --> 00:13:01.090
I said, "But I can use
my hands," and he said, "OK."
