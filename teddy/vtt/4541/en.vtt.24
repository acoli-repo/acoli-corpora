00:11:59.563 --> 00:12:01.213
I made a booking, and weeks later,

00:12:01.237 --> 00:12:04.010
my friend Chris and my mom
drove me out to the airport,

00:12:04.034 --> 00:12:06.432
all 80 pounds of me covered
in a plaster body cast

00:12:06.456 --> 00:12:07.890
in a baggy pair of overalls.

00:12:07.914 --> 00:12:09.012
(Laughter)

00:12:09.036 --> 00:12:11.792
I can tell you, I did not
look like the ideal candidate

00:12:11.816 --> 00:12:13.182
to get a pilot's license.

00:12:13.206 --> 00:12:14.800
(Laughter)

00:12:14.824 --> 00:12:17.277
I'm holding on to the counter
because I can't stand.

00:12:17.301 --> 00:12:19.365
I said, "Hi, I'm here
for a flying lesson."

00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:23.023
They took one look and ran
out the back to draw short straws.

00:12:23.047 --> 00:12:25.990
"You get her." "No, no, you take her."

00:12:26.014 --> 00:12:29.209
Finally a guy goes, "Hi, I'm Andrew.
I'm going to take you flying."

00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:30.407
I go, "Great!"
