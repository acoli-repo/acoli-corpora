00:07:27.053 --> 00:07:30.281
"How could I ever
have taken this for granted?"

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.201
I felt so incredibly grateful for my life.

00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:36.583
But before I left hospital,

00:07:36.607 --> 00:07:39.639
the head nurse had said to me,
"Janine, I want you to be ready,

00:07:39.663 --> 00:07:42.348
because when you get home,
something's going to happen."

00:07:42.372 --> 00:07:43.537
And I said, "What?"

00:07:43.561 --> 00:07:46.274
And she said, "You're going
to get depressed."

00:07:46.298 --> 00:07:49.284
And I said, "Not me,
not Janine the Machine,"

00:07:49.308 --> 00:07:51.022
which was my nickname.

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:54.129
She said, "You are, because,
see, it happens to everyone.

00:07:54.153 --> 00:07:58.404
In the spinal ward, that's normal.
You're in a wheelchair. That's normal.

00:07:58.428 --> 00:08:02.023
But you're going to get home
and realize how different life is."
