00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:30.878
I broke some bones in my feet.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.405
My whole right side was ripped open,
filled with gravel.

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.810
My head was cut open
across the front, lifted back,

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:38.507
exposing the skull underneath.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.633
I had head injures.
I had internal injuries.

00:01:40.657 --> 00:01:41.987
I had massive blood loss.

00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:44.090
In fact, I lost
about five liters of blood,

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:46.669
which is all someone my size
would actually hold.

00:01:46.693 --> 00:01:50.263
By the time the helicopter arrived
at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney,

00:01:50.287 --> 00:01:52.867
my blood pressure was 40 over nothing.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:55.987
I was having a really bad day.

00:01:56.011 --> 00:02:02.342
