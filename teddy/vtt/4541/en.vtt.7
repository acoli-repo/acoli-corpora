They took out two of my broken ribs
and they rebuilt my back --

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.043
L1, they rebuilt it,
they took out another broken rib,

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:41.456
they fused T12, L1 and L2 together.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.661
Then they stitched me up;
they took an entire hour to stitch me up.

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:46.314
I woke up in intensive care,

00:03:46.338 --> 00:03:49.970
and the doctors were really excited

I had a little bit of movement

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:53.747
in one of my big toes,

00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:56.811
and I thought, "Great,
because I'm going to the Olympics!"

00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:58.871
(Laughter)

00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:00.501
I had no idea.
