00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:02.137
The next concern
was whether I would walk again,

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:04.471
because I was paralyzed
from the waist down.

00:03:04.962 --> 00:03:08.154
They said to my parents
that the neck break was a stable fracture,

00:03:08.178 --> 00:03:09.919
but the back was completely crushed:

00:03:09.943 --> 00:03:13.329
the vertebra at L1
was like you'd dropped a peanut,

00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:16.444
stepped on it, smashed it
into thousands of pieces.

00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:17.860
They'd have to operate.

00:03:19.043 --> 00:03:21.382
They went in. They put me on a beanbag.

00:03:21.406 --> 00:03:23.490
They cut me -- literally cut me in half.

00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:25.948
I have a scar that wraps
around my entire body.

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:29.717
They picked as much
broken bone as they could

00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:31.418
that had lodged in my spinal cord.
