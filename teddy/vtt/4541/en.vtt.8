00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:00.501
I had no idea.

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:04.057
That's the sort of thing that happens
to someone else, not me, surely.

00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:06.462
But then the doctor
came over to me and she said,

00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:09.296
"Janine, the operation was a success,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.058
and we've picked as much bone
out of your spinal cord as we could.

00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:14.471
But the damage is permanent.

00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:17.543
The central nervous system
nerves -- there is no cure.

00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:20.416
You're what we call a partial paraplegic,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.408
and you'll have all of the injuries
that go along with that.

00:04:23.432 --> 00:04:26.295
You'll have no feeling
from the waist down,

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.346
and at most, you might get
10 or 20 percent return.
