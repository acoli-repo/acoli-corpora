00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:33.365
sunshine, the smell
of eucalypt and a dream.

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:34.634
Life was good.

00:00:35.257 --> 00:00:37.861
We'd been on our bikes
for around five-and-a-half hours

00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:40.311
when we got to the part
of the ride that I loved,

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:43.056
and that was the hills,
because I loved the hills.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.981
I got up off the seat of my bike
and I started pumping my legs,

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.823
and as I sucked in the cold mountain air,
I could feel it burning my lungs,

00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:53.953
and I looked up to see
the sun shining in my face.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.998
And then everything went black.

00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:00.691
Where was I? What was happening?
