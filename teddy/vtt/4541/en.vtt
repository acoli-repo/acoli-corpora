00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:05.698
Life is about opportunities --
creating them and embracing them.

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:08.809
And for me, that was the Olympic dream.

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:11.638
That's what defined me. That was my bliss.

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.677
As a cross-country skier
and member of the Australian ski team

00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:17.808
headed towards the Winter Olympics,

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:21.212
I was on a training bike ride
with my fellow teammates.

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:25.540
As we made our way up
towards the spectacular Blue Mountains

00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:26.715
west of Sydney,

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.179
it was the perfect autumn day:

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:33.365
sunshine, the smell
of eucalypt and a dream.
