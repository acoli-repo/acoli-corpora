00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.553
I shared the ward with five other people,

00:05:32.577 --> 00:05:33.879
and the amazing thing is,

00:05:33.903 --> 00:05:37.449
because we were all lying paralyzed
in a spinal ward,

00:05:37.473 --> 00:05:39.879
we didn't know
what each other looked like.

00:05:39.903 --> 00:05:41.697
How amazing is that?

00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:47.855
How often in life do you get to make
friendships, judgment-free,

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.845
purely based on spirit?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.433
And there were
no superficial conversations

00:05:53.457 --> 00:05:56.507
as we shared our innermost
thoughts, our fears,

00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:59.483
and our hopes for life
after the spinal ward.
