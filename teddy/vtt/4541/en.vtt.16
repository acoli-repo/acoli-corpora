00:07:58.428 --> 00:08:02.023
But you're going to get home
and realize how different life is."

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.086
And I got home.

00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:06.729
And something happened.

00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:10.714
I realized Sister Sam was right.

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:13.388
I did get depressed.

00:08:14.943 --> 00:08:16.696
I was in my wheelchair.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.573
I had no feeling from the waist down,

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:20.050
attached to a catheter bottle.

00:08:20.074 --> 00:08:21.224
I couldn't walk.

00:08:21.813 --> 00:08:23.980
I'd lost so much weight in hospital,

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.576
I now weighed about 80 pounds.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.886
And I wanted to give up.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.982
All I wanted to do was put my running
shoes on and run out the door.
