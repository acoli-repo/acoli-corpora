00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:01.437
And then I remembered

00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:05.752
my friends that were still
in the spinal ward,

00:09:05.776 --> 00:09:07.086
particularly Maria.

00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:09.348
Maria was in a car accident,

00:09:09.372 --> 00:09:11.297
and she woke up on her 16th birthday

00:09:11.321 --> 00:09:14.416
to the news that she was
a complete quadriplegic,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.709
had no movement from the neck down,

00:09:16.733 --> 00:09:19.731
had damage to her vocal chords,
and she couldn't talk.

00:09:20.747 --> 00:09:23.100
They told me, "We're going
to move you next to her

00:09:23.124 --> 00:09:25.160
because we think it will be good for her."

00:09:26.193 --> 00:09:29.926
I was worried. I didn't know
how I'd react to being next to her.
