I remember one night,
one of the nurses came in, Jonathan,

00:06:04.977 --> 00:06:08.027
with a whole lot of plastic straws.

00:06:08.051 --> 00:06:10.313
He put a pile on top
of each of us, and he said,

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:12.513
"Start threading them together."

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:16.463
Well, there wasn't much else to do
in the spinal ward, so we did.

00:06:16.487 --> 00:06:17.512
(Laughter)

00:06:17.536 --> 00:06:20.353
And when we'd finished,
he went around silently

00:06:20.377 --> 00:06:25.693
and he joined all of the straws up
till it looped around the whole ward.

00:06:25.717 --> 00:06:26.884
And then he said,

00:06:26.908 --> 00:06:29.752
"OK everybody, hold on to your straws."
