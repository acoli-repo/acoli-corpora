00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:30.641
We have some video of that

00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:32.145
courtesy of the University of Washington.

00:02:32.145 --> 00:02:36.501
(Video) Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54! Mice 54!

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:38.984
Blue 8! Blue 8! Go!

00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:42.645
Oh!

00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:46.076
CK: So again, this takes you a little bit closer

00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:48.026
to what it's like to be on that field,

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:49.999
but this is nowhere what it's like

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.437
to be on the NFL.

00:02:52.437 --> 00:02:54.198
Fans want that experience.

00:02:54.198 --> 00:02:55.442
Fans want to be on that field.

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:57.606
They want to be their favorite players,

00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:00.338
and they've already talked to me on YouTube,
