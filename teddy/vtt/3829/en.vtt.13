and data-mining is not for nerds anymore.

00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:32.598
It's also for jocks. Who knew?

00:06:32.598 --> 00:06:34.474
What would that look like on the field?

00:06:34.474 --> 00:06:36.583
Well, imagine you're the quarterback.

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:38.077
You take the snap and you drop back.

You step up into the pocket.

00:06:51.132 --> 00:06:53.258
Another flash alerts you to an open receiver.

00:06:53.258 --> 00:06:55.556
You throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.

00:06:55.556 --> 00:06:57.325
The ball comes off track.

00:06:57.325 --> 00:06:58.783
You don't know where it's going to land.
