00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:31.711
in our lifetime, and it will happen

00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:33.422
because we have the tools to make it happen,

00:00:33.422 --> 00:00:35.205
and people need to be aware of that,

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:37.686
because augmented reality will change our lives

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:41.469
just as much as the Internet and the cell phone.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.070
Now how do we get to augmented reality?

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.126
Step one is the step I'm wearing right now,

00:00:46.126 --> 00:00:47.530
Google Glass.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.150
I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.597
What you may not be familiar with

00:00:51.597 --> 00:00:54.037
is that Google Glass is a device

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:57.679
that will allow you to see what I see.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.695
It will allow you to experience what it is like

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:01.991
to be a professional athlete on the field.
