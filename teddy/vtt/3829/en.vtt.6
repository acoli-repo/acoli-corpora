00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:00.338
and they've already talked to me on YouTube,

00:03:00.338 --> 00:03:01.414
they've talked to me on Twitter, saying,

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:03.362
"Hey, can you get this on a quarterback?

00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:04.554
Can you get this on a running back?

00:03:04.554 --> 00:03:06.147
We want that experience."

00:03:06.147 --> 00:03:08.292
Well, once we have that experience with GoPro

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:09.615
and Google Glass,

00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:11.006
how do we make it more immersive?

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:12.201
How do we take that next step?

00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:14.120
Well, we take that step

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.789
by going to something called the Oculus Rift,

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:18.896
which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with.

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:20.883
The Oculus Rift has been described as one of

00:03:20.883 --> 00:03:23.790
the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.273
and that is not empty hype.

00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:27.433
I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:30.230
with this video.
