00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.385
Well, a very simple setup would be a camera

00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:04.040
on each corner of the stadium looking down,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.304
giving you a bird's-eye view

00:06:05.304 --> 00:06:06.858
of all the people down there.

00:06:06.858 --> 00:06:09.432
You also have information from helmet sensors

00:06:09.432 --> 00:06:10.540
and accelerometers,

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.473
technology that's being worked on right now.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:16.032
You take all that information,
and you stream it to your players.

00:06:16.032 --> 00:06:18.226
The good teams stream it in a
way that the players can use.

00:06:18.226 --> 00:06:20.208
The bad ones have information overload.

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:22.264
That determines good teams from bad.

00:06:22.264 --> 00:06:25.010
And now, your I.T. department

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.582
is just as important as your scouting department,

00:06:27.582 --> 00:06:30.167
and data-mining is not for nerds anymore.
