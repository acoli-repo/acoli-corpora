00:03:58.663 --> 00:04:01.775
of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line,

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.513
shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm

00:04:03.513 --> 00:04:05.607
before sprinting in for a touchdown?

00:04:05.607 --> 00:04:07.000
What do you think that fan's experience

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.156
is going to be when he's Messi

00:04:09.156 --> 00:04:10.376
sprinting down the pitch

00:04:10.376 --> 00:04:11.878
putting the ball in the back of the net,

00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:14.160
or Federer serving in Wimbledon?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.492
What do you think his experience is going to be

00:04:16.492 --> 00:04:18.430
when he is going down the side of a mountain

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.207
at over 70 miles an hour

00:04:20.207 --> 00:04:23.226
as an Olympic downhill skier?

00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:25.551
I think adult diaper sales may surge.

00:04:25.551 --> 00:04:26.460
(Laughter)

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.391
But this is not yet augmented reality.

00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:31.307
This is only virtual reality, V.R.
