00:01:56.685 --> 00:02:00.160
So let's pull up some video.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.560
(Video) Chris Kluwe: Go.

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:09.429
Ugh, getting tackled sucks.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.387
Hold on, let's get a little closer.

00:02:12.387 --> 00:02:13.765
All right, ready?

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:16.814
Go!

00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:19.459
Chris Kluwe: So as you can see,

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.726
small taste of what it's like to get tackled

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:22.848
on the football field

00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:24.727
from the perspective of the tacklee.

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:25.980
Now, you may have noticed there are

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.075
some people missing there:

00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:28.901
the rest of the team.

00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:30.641
We have some video of that
