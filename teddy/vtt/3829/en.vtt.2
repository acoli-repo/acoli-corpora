00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:01.991
to be a professional athlete on the field.

00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:05.512
Right now, the only way you can be on the field

00:01:05.512 --> 00:01:07.288
is for me to try and describe it to you.

00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:08.799
I have to use words.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.147
I have to create a framework that you then fill in

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:13.098
with your imagination.

00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:17.275
With Google Glass, we can put that

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:18.885
underneath a helmet,

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:21.031
and we can get a sense of what it's like

00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.130
to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.203
your blood pounding in your ears.

00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:28.110
You can get a sense of what it's like

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.997
to have a 250-pound man
