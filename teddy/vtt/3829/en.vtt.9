This is only virtual reality, V.R.

00:04:31.307 --> 00:04:33.721
How do we get to augmented reality, A.R.?

00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:35.830
We get to augmented reality

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.403
when coaches and managers and owners

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.557
look at this information streaming in

00:04:40.557 --> 00:04:41.943
that people want to see, and they say,

00:04:41.943 --> 00:04:44.915
"How do we use this to make our teams better?

00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:46.940
How do we use this to win games?"

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.402
Because teams always use technology to win games.

00:04:49.402 --> 00:04:51.180
They like winning. It makes them money.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.156
So a brief history of technology in the NFL.

00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:56.167
In 1965, the Baltimore Colts

00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:57.820
put a wristband on their quarterback

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.114
to allow him to call plays quicker.
