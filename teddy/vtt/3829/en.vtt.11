00:05:29.468 --> 00:05:31.335
No more having to worry about forgetting plays.

00:05:31.335 --> 00:05:33.996
No more worrying about having
to memorize your playbook.

00:05:35.923 --> 00:05:37.371
And coaches really want this,

to enhance how you play the game.

00:05:57.773 --> 00:05:59.830
What would that be like?

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.385
Well, a very simple setup would be a camera
