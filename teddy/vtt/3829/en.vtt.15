00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.496
because it's too profitable not to.

00:07:30.496 --> 00:07:33.395
But the question I ask you is,

00:07:33.395 --> 00:07:36.746
is that's all that we're content
to use augmented reality for?

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:39.454
Are we going to use it solely for our panem,

00:07:39.454 --> 00:07:41.902
our circenses, our entertainment as normal?

00:07:41.902 --> 00:07:44.708
Because I believe that we can use augmented reality

00:07:44.718 --> 00:07:46.119
for something more.

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:48.286
I believe we can use augmented reality

00:07:48.286 --> 00:07:50.279
as a way to foster more empathy

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.583
within the human species itself,

00:07:52.583 --> 00:07:54.245
by literally showing someone

00:07:54.245 --> 00:07:55.684
what it looks like

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.970
to walk a mile in another person's shoes.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.712
We know what this technology is worth
