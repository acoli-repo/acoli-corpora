00:08:27.297 --> 00:08:30.040
trying to inspire a generation of children

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.806
to think more about space and science

00:08:32.806 --> 00:08:36.511
instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians?

00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:39.256
Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality

00:08:39.256 --> 00:08:41.426
is coming.

00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:45.264
The questions we ask, the choices we make,

00:08:45.264 --> 00:08:46.897
and the challenges we face

00:08:46.897 --> 00:08:49.267
are, as always, up to us.

00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:51.020
Thank you.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.267
(Applause)
