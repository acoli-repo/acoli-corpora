00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.198
What do augmented reality

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:04.604
and professional football

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:06.798
have to do with empathy?

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:08.983
And what is the air speed velocity

00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:11.158
of an unladen swallow?

00:00:11.158 --> 00:00:13.778
Now unfortunately, I'm only going to answer

00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:14.895
one of those questions today,

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:17.186
so please, try and contain your disappointment.

00:00:17.186 --> 00:00:19.658
When most people think about augmented reality,

00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:22.063
they think about "Minority Report" and Tom Cruise

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.973
waving his hands in the air,

00:00:23.973 --> 00:00:27.232
but augmented reality is not science fiction.

00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:29.507
Augmented reality is something that will happen

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:31.711
in our lifetime, and it will happen
