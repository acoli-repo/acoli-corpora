WEBVTT

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.997
to have a 250-pound man

00:01:30.997 --> 00:01:32.658
sprinting at you

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:34.634
trying to decapitate you

00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:36.465
with every ounce of his being.

00:01:36.465 --> 00:01:37.851
And I've been on the receiving end of that,

00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:39.408
and it doesn't feel very good.

00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:41.987
Now, I have some footage to show you of what it's like

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:43.914
to wear Google Glass underneath the helmet

00:01:43.914 --> 00:01:45.148
to give you a taste of that.

00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:48.059
Unfortunately, it's not NFL practice footage

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:50.474
because the NFL thinks emergent technology

00:01:50.474 --> 00:01:52.722
is what happens when a submarine surfaces,

00:01:52.722 --> 00:01:56.685
but — (Laughter) — we do what we can.

00:01:56.685 --> 00:02:00.160
So let's pull up some video.
