00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.712
We know what this technology is worth

00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:01.930
to sports leagues.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.158
It's worth revenue, to the tune
of billions of dollars a year.

00:08:05.158 --> 00:08:07.208
But what is this technology worth

00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:09.080
to a teacher in a classroom

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.516
trying to show a bully

00:08:10.516 --> 00:08:12.232
just how harmful his actions are

00:08:12.232 --> 00:08:14.839
from the perspective of the victim?

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:16.485
What is this technology worth

00:08:16.485 --> 00:08:18.417
to a gay Ugandan or Russian

trying to show the world what it's like

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.790
living under persecution?

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.723
What is this technology worth

00:08:23.723 --> 00:08:27.297
to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson

00:08:27.297 --> 00:08:30.040
trying to inspire a generation of children
