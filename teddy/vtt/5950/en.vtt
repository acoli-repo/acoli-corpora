00:00:07.288 --> 00:00:10.621
For most humans, farts
are a welcome relief,

00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:15.704
an embarrassing incident, or 
an opportunity for a gas-based gag.

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:20.454
But for many other creatures, 
farts are no laughing matter.

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:25.329
Deep in the bowels of the animal kingdom,
farts can serve as tools of intimidation,

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.913
acts of self-defense, and even
weapons of malodorous murder.
