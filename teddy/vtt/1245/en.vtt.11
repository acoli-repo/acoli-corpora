00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.710
and it's where a group of LGBT patrons

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.392
fought back against police beatings

00:05:34.392 --> 00:05:36.348
at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked

00:05:36.348 --> 00:05:38.540
three days of rioting.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.266
Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:43.197
were at the forefront of this rebellion,

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:45.466
and it's a really interesting example

00:05:45.466 --> 00:05:48.677
of the intersection of our struggles against racism,

00:05:48.677 --> 00:05:53.370
homophobia, gender identity and police brutality.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.932
After Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups

00:05:56.932 --> 00:05:59.271
sprang up all over the country,

00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:03.891
and the modern gay rights 
movement as we know it took off.
