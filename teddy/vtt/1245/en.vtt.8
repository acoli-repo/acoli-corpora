is that it's used some of the same tactics

00:04:01.193 --> 00:04:04.880
and strategies that were first laid down

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.740
by the civil rights movement.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.493
Let's just look at a few of these strategies.

00:04:10.493 --> 00:04:12.772
First off, it's really interesting to see,

00:04:12.772 --> 00:04:14.740
to actually visually see, how quick

00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:28.523
in the civil rights movement,

00:04:28.523 --> 00:04:30.416
but the first one we're going to start with
