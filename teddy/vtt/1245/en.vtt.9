00:04:28.523 --> 00:04:30.416
but the first one we're going to start with

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:34.312
is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.

00:04:34.312 --> 00:04:36.900
This was a protest campaign

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.845
against Montgomery, Alabama's segregation

00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:41.852
on their public transit system,

00:04:41.852 --> 00:04:44.711
and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks

00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:47.839
refused to give up her seat to a white person.

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.117
The campaign lasted a year,

00:04:50.117 --> 00:04:52.216
and it galvanized the civil rights movement

00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:55.183
like nothing had before it.

00:04:55.183 --> 00:04:58.035
And I call this strategy the

00:04:58.035 --> 00:05:02.962
"I'm tired of your foot on my neck" strategy.
