00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.496
This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said

00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:32.255
that blacks had voted for the measure

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:34.740
by something like 70 percent.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.455
This turned out not to be true,

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:42.029
but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in,

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:45.286
and was grabbed on by the media.

00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:47.972
I couldn't tear myself away from the coverage.

00:01:47.972 --> 00:01:50.999
I listened to some gay commentator say

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:53.388
that the African-American community

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:55.403
was notoriously homophobic,

00:01:55.403 --> 00:01:58.677
and now that civil rights had been achieved for us,

00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:00.810
we wanted to take away other people's rights.
