Election night 2008

00:00:03.612 --> 00:00:06.971
was a night that tore me in half.

00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:11.360
It was the night that Barack Obama was elected.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.733
[One hundred and forty-three] 
years after the end of slavery,

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.010
and [43] years after the passage

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.750
of the Voting Rights Act,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.790
an African-American was elected president.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.537
Many of us never thought that this was possible

00:00:27.537 --> 00:00:30.309
until the moment that it happened.
