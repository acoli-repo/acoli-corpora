00:02:55.928 --> 00:03:00.280
And what guided me in making this film was,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.078
how was this happening?

00:03:02.078 --> 00:03:05.278
How was it that the gay rights movement

00:03:05.278 --> 00:03:08.589
was being pitted against the civil rights movement?

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.834
And this wasn't just an abstract question.

00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:14.189
I'm a beneficiary of both movements,

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.273
so this was actually personal.

00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:18.868
But then something else happened

00:03:18.868 --> 00:03:21.829
after that election in 2008.

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.217
The march towards gay equality

00:03:24.217 --> 00:03:26.266
accelerated at a pace

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:29.288
that surprised and shocked everyone,

00:03:29.288 --> 00:03:33.910
and is still reshaping our laws and our policies,
