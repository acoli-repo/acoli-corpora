00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
"I gotta call my mother."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I have a little Cuban mother -- she's about that big.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You still with me? (Laughter)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I called her up.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
"Hello, how're you doing, baby?"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?"

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I said, "I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to the White House."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"Ma, don't start!"
