00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:35.216
how many will host a civilization
capable of contemplating like us

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.440
projects such as Breakthrough Starshot?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.736
Habitability --

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.576
right sort of planet
around the right sort of star --

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.936
the trillion becomes a billion.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.296
Stability --

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.736
a climate that stays benign for eons --

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.616
the billion becomes a million.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.840
Life must start --

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.816
the million becomes a thousand.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.096
Complex life forms must arise --

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.696
the thousand becomes one.
