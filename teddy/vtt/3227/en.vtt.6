collaborate on a Wikipedia Galactica,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.480
or just shout out
to the universe, "We're here"?

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.120
So where is everybody?

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.176
It's a puzzle because we do expect
these civilizations to exist, don't we?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.376
After all, there could be
a trillion planets in the galaxy --

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.760
maybe more.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.976
You don't need any special knowledge
to consider this question,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.896
and I've explored it
with lots of people over the years.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.896
And I've found they often
frame their thinking

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.016
in terms of the barriers
that would need to be cleared
