00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.016
in terms of the barriers
that would need to be cleared

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.280
if a planet is to host
a communicative civilization.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.936
And they usually identify
four key barriers.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.336
Habitability --

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.776
that's the first barrier.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.416
We need a terrestrial planet
in that just right "Goldilocks zone,"

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.680
where water flows as a liquid.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.656
They're out there.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.256
In 2016, astronomers confirmed
there's a planet in the habitable zone

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.736
of the closest star,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.536
Proxima Centauri --
