00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.816
Why don't we see
flying saucers flitting around?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.056
At the very least,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.936
why don't we see life
out there in the cosmos?

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.176
It's a puzzle,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.656
and I've discussed it
with dozens of experts

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.816
from different disciplines
over the past three decades.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.696
And there's no consensus.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.056
Frank Drake began searching
for alien signals back in 1960 --

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.976
so far, nothing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.416
And with each passing year,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.976
this nonobservation,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.656
this lack of evidence
for any alien activity gets more puzzling
