You can still have some fun
playing with the idea aliens are here.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.856
Some say a summer civilization
did colonize the galaxy

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.880
and seeded Earth with life ...

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.656
others, that we're living
in a cosmic wilderness preserve --

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.920
a zoo.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.976
Yet others --

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.176
that we're living in a simulation.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.520
Programmers just haven't
revealed the aliens yet.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.016
Most of my colleagues though
argue that E.T. is out there,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.656
we just need to keep looking,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.256
and this makes sense.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.056
Space is vast.
