00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.776
because technology itself
forms the barrier

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.736
to the development
of a truly advanced civilization.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.200
Depressing, right?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.920
I'm arguing the exact opposite.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.136
I grew up watching "Star Trek"
and "Forbidden Planet,"

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.936
and I saw a UFO once,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.040
so this idea of cosmic loneliness
I certainly find slightly wistful.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.336
But for me,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.296
the silence of the universe is shouting,

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.040
"We're the creatures who got lucky."

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.656
All barriers are behind us.
