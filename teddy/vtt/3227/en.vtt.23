00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.136
One planet in a trillion galaxies,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.920
just as in the visible universe.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.680
I think we're alone.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.536

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.976
bioterror,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.560
global warming, war.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.336
A universe that's silent

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.776
because technology itself
forms the barrier
