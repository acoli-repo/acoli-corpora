00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.536
Proxima Centauri --

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.616
so close that Breakthrough Starshot
project plans to send probes there.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.520
We'd become a starfaring species.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.096
But not all worlds are habitable.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.456
Some will be too close to a star
and they'll fry,

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.600
some will be too far away
and they'll freeze.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.016
Abiogenesis --

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.815
the creation of life from nonlife --

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.120
that's the second barrier.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.896
The basic building blocks of life
aren't unique to Earth:

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.656
amino acids have been found in comets,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.776
complex organic molecules
in interstellar dust clouds,
