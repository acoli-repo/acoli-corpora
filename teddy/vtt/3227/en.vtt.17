00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.056
because the prevailing theory is

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.576
that the moon came into being when Theia,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.216
a body the size of Mars,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.976
crashed into a newly formed Earth.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.120
The outcome of that crash could have been
a quite different Earth-Moon system.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.376
We ended up with a large moon

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.256
and that permitted Earth
to have both a stable axial tilt

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.456
and a slow rotation rate.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.136
Both factors influence climate

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.760
and the suggestion is that they've helped
moderate climate change.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.680
Great for us, right?

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.096
But Waltham showed that if the moon
were just a few miles bigger,
