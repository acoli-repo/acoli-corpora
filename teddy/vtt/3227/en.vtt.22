00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.696
the thousand becomes one.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.576
Sophisticated tool use must develop --

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.600
that's one planet in a thousand galaxies.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.056
To understand the universe,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.296
they'll have to develop the techniques
of science and mathematics --

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.416
that's one planet in a million galaxies.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.096
To reach the stars,
they'll have to be social creatures,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.936
capable of discussing
abstract concepts with each other

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.856
using complex grammar --

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.096
one planet in a billion galaxies.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.856
And they have to avoid disaster --

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.936
not just self-inflicted
but from the skies, too.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.896
That planet around Proxima Centauri,
