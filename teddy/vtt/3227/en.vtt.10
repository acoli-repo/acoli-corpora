A 2010 study showed

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.680
that an octopus in captivity
can recognize different humans.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.256
2017 studies show that ravens
can plan for future events --

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.016
wonderful, clever creatures --

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.256
but they can't contemplate
the Breakthrough Starshot project,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.536
and if we vanished today,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.416
they wouldn't go on
to implement Breakthrough Starshot --

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.816
why should they?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.600
Evolution doesn't have
space travel as an end goal.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.720
There will be worlds where life
doesn't give rise to advanced technology.
