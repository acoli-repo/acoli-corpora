00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.696
As for the height of the barriers,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.120
your guess is as good as anyone's.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.336
In my experience,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.416
when people sit down and do the math,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.320
they typically conclude there are
thousands of civilizations in the galaxy.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.360
But then we're back to the puzzle:
Where is everybody?

00:06:20.055 --> 00:06:21.416
By definition,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.776
UFOs -- including the one I saw --

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.096
are unidentified.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.856
We can't simply infer they're spacecraft.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.360
You can still have some fun
playing with the idea aliens are here.
