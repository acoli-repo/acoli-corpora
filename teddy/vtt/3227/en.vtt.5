00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.600

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.216
Intergalactic colonization

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.480
it just takes longer.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.016
A civilization from any one
of millions of galaxies

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.400
could have colonized our galaxy.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.696
Seems far-fetched?

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.936
Maybe it is,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.336
put worldlets around a star
to capture free sunlight,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.536
