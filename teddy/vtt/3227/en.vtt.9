The ingredients are there,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.096
we just don't know
how they combine to create life,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.280
and presumably there will be worlds
on which life doesn't start.

The development of technological
civilization is a third barrier.

Some say we already share our planet
with alien intelligences.

can cooperate to solve problems.
