00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.656
All barriers are behind us.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.096
We're the only species
that's cleared them --

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.536
the only species capable
of determining its own destiny.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.760
And if we learn to appreciate
how special our planet is,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.976
how important it is to look after our home

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.816
and to find others,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.656
how incredibly fortunate we all are
simply to be aware of the universe,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.016
humanity might survive for a while.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.696
And all those amazing things

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.576
we dreamed aliens
might have done in the past,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.800
that could be our future.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.896
Thank you very much.
