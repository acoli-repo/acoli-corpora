00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.896
Communication across space --
that's a fourth barrier.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.696
Maybe advanced civilizations
choose to explore inner space

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.056
rather than outer space,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.600
or engineer at small distances
rather than large.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.456
Or maybe they just don't want
to risk an encounter

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.616
with a potentially more advanced
and hostile neighbor.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.816
There'll be worlds where,
for whatever reason,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.480
civilizations either stay silent
or don't spend long trying to communicate.
