Imagine a summer civilization

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.616
developing a level of technology
more advanced than ours,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.776
but tech based on accepted physics though,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.736
I'm not talking wormholes
or warp drives -- whatever --

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.280
just an extrapolation
of the sort of tech that TED celebrates.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.456
That civilization could program
self-replicating probes

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.120
to visit every planetary
system in the galaxy.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.360
If they launched the first probes
just after midnight one August day,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.456
then before breakfast same day,
