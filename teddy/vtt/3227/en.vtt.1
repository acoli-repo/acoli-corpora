00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.856
I got my own back a few years later:

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.376
one of those grown-ups told me,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.216
"Last night I saw a flying saucer.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.816
I was coming out of the pub
after a few drinks."

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.656
I stopped him there.
I said, "I can explain that sighting."

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.696
(Laughter)

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.616
Psychologists have shown
we can't trust our brains

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.856
to tell the truth.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.696
It's easy to fool ourselves.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.336
I saw something,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.736
but what's more likely --

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.776
that I saw an alien spacecraft,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.720
or that my brain misinterpreted
the data my eyes were giving it?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.776
Ever since though I've wondered:

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.816
Why don't we see
flying saucers flitting around?
