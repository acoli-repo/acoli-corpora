00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.096
But Waltham showed that if the moon
were just a few miles bigger,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.736
things would be different.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.096
Earth's spin axis
would now wander chaotically.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.016
There'd be episodes
of rapid climate change --

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.416
not good for complex life.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.656
The moon is just the right size:

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.736
big but not too big.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.176
A "Goldilocks" moon around
a "Goldilocks" planet --

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.720
a barrier perhaps.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.016
You can imagine more barriers.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.256
For instance,

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.320
simple cells came into being
billions of years ago ...
