00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.056
Space is vast.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.896
Identifying a signal is hard,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.520
and we haven't been looking that long.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.296
Without doubt, we should
spend more on the search.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.656
It's about understanding
our place in the universe.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.000
It's too important a question to ignore.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.936
But there's an obvious answer:

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.256
we're alone.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.896
It's just us.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.416
There could be a trillion
planets in the galaxy.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.920
Is it plausible we're the only creatures
capable of contemplating this question?
