00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.936
let me suggest four more barriers
to add to the four

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.880
that people said blocked the path
to communicative civilization.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.016
Again, purely for the purposes
of illustration,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.296
suppose there's a one-in-a-thousand chance
of making it across each of the barriers.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.456
Of course there might be
different ways of navigating the barriers,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.256
and some chances will be better
than one in a thousand.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.136
Equally, there might be more barriers

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.416
and some chances
might be one in a million.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.520
Let's just see
what happens in this picture.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.696
If the galaxy contains a trillion planets,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:35.216
how many will host a civilization
capable of contemplating like us
