00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.776
but perhaps the development
of complex life

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.696
needed a series of unlikely events.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.296
Once life on Earth
had access to multicellularity

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.376
and sophisticated genetic structures,

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.656
and sex,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.216
new opportunities opened up:

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.600
animals became possible.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.056
But maybe it's the fate of many planets

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.920
for life to settle
at the level of simple cells.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.856
Purely for the purposes of illustration,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.936
let me suggest four more barriers
to add to the four
