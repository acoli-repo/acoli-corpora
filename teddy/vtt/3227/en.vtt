00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.376
I saw a UFO once.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.296
I was eight or nine,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.656
playing in the street with a friend
who was a couple of years older,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.336
and we saw a featureless silver disc
hovering over the houses.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.136
We watched it for a few seconds,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.416
and then it shot away incredibly quickly.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.656
Even as a kid,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.520
I got angry it was ignoring
the laws of physics.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.416
We ran inside to tell the grown-ups,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.016
and they were skeptical --

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.120
you'd be skeptical too, right?
