00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I had a fire nine days ago.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
My archive:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
175 films, my 16-millimeter negative,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
all my books, my dad's books, my photographs.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'd collected --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I was a collector, major, big-time.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's gone.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I just looked at it,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and I didn't know what to do.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I mean, this was --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
was I my things?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I always live in the present -- I love the present.
