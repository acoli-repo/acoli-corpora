00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.896
See, we've long ago let go of the language

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.136
with which we describe our softer parts.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.296
We learn early that those
with softer hearts suffer.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.976
So we allow lean emotion to reign,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.416
never noticing that only strain
has been the fruit of our restraints.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.336
We haven't escaped pain.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.656
And our battle scars are far from faint.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.176
Yet and still, despite our desire
and willingness to heal,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.416
we often find ourselves
fighting hard in the paint,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.040
holding onto false images
of everything we ain't.
