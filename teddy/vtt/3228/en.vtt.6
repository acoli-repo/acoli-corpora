00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.096
our egos so easily flattered.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.336
We're enslaved, yet think
of our shackles as gifts.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.736
Rather than resist our masters,
we let them widen our rifts,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.016
like mindless, material junkies,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.720
we seek that which lowers, not lifts.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.976
But somewhere in our midst,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.880
there's been a paradigm shift.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.216
Justice is getting restless in its chains.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.176
Our youth find it useless
to separate their souls from their brains,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.576
their truth is ingrained,
their integrity insustained.
