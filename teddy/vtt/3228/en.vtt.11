00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.296
and the support of our local,
federal and philanthropic partners,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.296
as the city celebrates 300 years
of transforming the world,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.816
we will get to transform 19 blocks
under the Interstate into community space,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.576
into black-owned businesses,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.656
in the form of the Claiborne Corridor
Cultural Innovation District.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.496
(Cheers)

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.936
(Applause)

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.136
We will be bridging time,
we will bridge memory,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.136
we will bridge disparity and injustice,
