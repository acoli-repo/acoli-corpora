00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.480
There are some chasms so deep and so wide,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.040
we find it hard to imagine
how we'll ever make it to the other side.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.360

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.736
the gaps between our high ideals

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.640
and our base realities.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.896
The distance between what we say

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.360
and what we really mean.
