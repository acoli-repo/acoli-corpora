00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.656
The raging river that flows
between what actually happened

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.456
and our convenient memories.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.336
The lies we tell ourselves are lakes,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.736
overflowing their banks,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.240
flooding our speech with waters,
caustic and rank.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.416
The only bridge is the truth,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.080
passing through me and you,
as we look one another eye to eye.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.656
But so often, that look
is filled with our hesitations,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.080
and we can't help but glance to the side.
