00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.040
holding onto false images
of everything we ain't.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.816
So while our dream coincide,
our fears collide.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.160
And we want to know one another,
but think we can't.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.256
The gulf between empathy and equity

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.936
is as unfathomable as the fissures
that line our collective integrity.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.216
And we spend eternal eternities

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.080
trying to translate that into virtue.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.120
Perhaps you have met one or two
of the virtuous on your path.
