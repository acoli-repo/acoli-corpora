00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.360
our bridge to cross
when we look one another in the eye.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.480
But the tongue,
like the heart, gets tired.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.576
The weak make it hard
for the strong to stay inspired,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.096
like the lost prevent the found
from escaping the mire,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.016
and the degraded stop the enlightened
from taking us higher.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.576
But no matter what you hear
from the mouths of these liars,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.576
we are one people

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.416
with one destiny and the common enemy,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.456
that's why it really stresses me
to see our hearts so tattered,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.856
our minds so scattered,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.096
our egos so easily flattered.
