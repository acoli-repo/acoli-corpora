For the past three years,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.496
I've had the privilege
of codesigning with my neighbors

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.440
a space in New Orleans
known as Under the Bridge.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.896
In 1966, Interstate 10
landed on the Tremé neighborhood,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.176
displacing 326 black-owned businesses,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.696
over 300 live oak trees,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.456
effectively destroying the region's

disrupting intergenerational wealth
