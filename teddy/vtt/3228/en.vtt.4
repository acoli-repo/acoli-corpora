Perhaps you have met one or two
of the virtuous on your path.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.736
They are only very few,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.936
and I know that I have, from time to time,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.616
mistaken pretenders for real,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.480
yet still make room for the possibility
that it's I who's been pretending.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.336
Please, bear with me, I'm still mending,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.696
but I'm no longer bending
to the will of my injuries,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.816
nor my injurers.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.856
I much prefer to stretch my arms
like Nüt until I become the sky.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.256
I'd rather stretch my tongue with truth,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.360
our bridge to cross
when we look one another in the eye.
