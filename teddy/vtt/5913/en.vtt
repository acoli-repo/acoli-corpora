00:00:06.804 --> 00:00:12.165
In 1917, doctors proposed 
an outlandish treatment for syphilis,

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:17.004
the incurable bacterial infection 
that had ravaged Europe for centuries.

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:22.118
Step 1: Infect patients suffering 
from the later stages of syphilis

00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:24.928
with the parasite that causes malaria,

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:28.870
the deadly but curable 
mosquito-borne disease.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.851
Step 2: Hope that malarial fevers 
clear the syphilis.
