00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.546
It’s spring 2021.

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:11.758
The Alpha variant of the coronavirus
has spread rapidly,

00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:14.218
becoming the dominant variant worldwide.

00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:18.181
But another, more transmissible
variant is about to appear—

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:19.348
Delta.

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:22.101
What happens when two variants clash?

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.895
Let’s do a thought experiment.

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:28.024
Suppose that the variants reach 
a hypothetical isolated city

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:31.944
of 1 million people who are 
completely susceptible to both viruses
