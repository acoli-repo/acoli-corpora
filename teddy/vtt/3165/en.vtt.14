00:06:58.442 --> 00:07:02.014
who had written that I was
a talentless propaganda hack.

00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:04.871
(Audio) Did the conversation
we just had --

00:07:04.895 --> 00:07:08.244
does it, like, make you feel differently
about how you write online?

00:07:08.268 --> 00:07:10.495
Doug: Yeah! You know,
when I said this to you,

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:12.472
when I said you were a "talentless hack,"

00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:14.833
I had never conversed
with you in my life, really.

00:07:14.857 --> 00:07:17.071
I didn't really know anything
really about you.

00:07:17.095 --> 00:07:18.838
And I think that a lot of times,

00:07:18.862 --> 00:07:20.923
that's what the comment
sections really are,

00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:25.066
it's really a way to get
your anger at the world out

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.518
on random profiles
of strangers, pretty much.

00:07:28.542 --> 00:07:30.042
DM (Laughing): Yeah, right.
