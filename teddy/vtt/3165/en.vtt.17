And it's their answer to this question
that allows me to empathize with them.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.504
And empathy, it turns out,

00:08:35.528 --> 00:08:39.068
is a key ingredient in getting
these conversations off the ground,

00:08:39.092 --> 00:08:41.433
but it can feel very vulnerable

00:08:41.457 --> 00:08:45.148
to be empathizing with someone
you profoundly disagree with.

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:48.696
So I established
a helpful mantra for myself.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.672
Empathy is not endorsement.

00:08:52.735 --> 00:08:55.490
Empathizing with someone
you profoundly disagree with

00:08:55.514 --> 00:08:59.141
does not suddenly compromise
your own deeply held beliefs

00:08:59.165 --> 00:09:00.323
and endorse theirs.
