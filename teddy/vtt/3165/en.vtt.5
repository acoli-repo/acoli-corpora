00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:30.315
for men who have been
cheated on by their wives.

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.570
But friends, I am so gay,

00:02:32.594 --> 00:02:36.458
that if I had a wife, I would
encourage her to cheat on me.

00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:38.688
(Laughter)

00:02:38.712 --> 00:02:39.862
Thank you.

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:44.349
Let's take a look at some
of this negativity in action.

00:02:45.093 --> 00:02:46.625
Sometimes it's direct.

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:48.070
Like Marcos, who wrote,

00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:50.390
"You're everything I hate
in a human being."

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:52.023
Thank you, Marcos.

00:02:52.395 --> 00:02:54.276
Others are more concise.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.795
Like Donovan, who wrote,
"gaywad fagggggg."

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.482
Now, I do need to point out,
Donovan is not wrong, OK?
