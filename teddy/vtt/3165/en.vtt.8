Because most of these messages I received
were through social media,

00:04:01.046 --> 00:04:04.566
I could often click on the profile picture
of the person who sent them

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.979
and learn everything about them.

00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:08.971
I could see pictures they were tagged in,

00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:11.130
posts they'd written, memes they'd shared,

00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:14.974
and somehow, seeing that it was
a human on the other side of the screen

00:04:14.998 --> 00:04:16.641
made me feel a little better.

00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:19.474
Not to justify what they wrote, right?

00:04:19.498 --> 00:04:21.365
But just to provide context.

00:04:22.538 --> 00:04:25.355
Still, that didn't feel like enough.

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.379
So, I called some of them --

00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:30.926
only the ones I felt safe talking to --
