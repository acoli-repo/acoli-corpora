Now, I do need to point out,
Donovan is not wrong, OK?

00:03:02.506 --> 00:03:06.561
In fact, he's right on both counts,
so credit where credit is due.

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:07.737
Thank you, Donovan.

00:03:07.761 --> 00:03:10.992
Others write to me with questions,
like Brian, who asked,

00:03:11.016 --> 00:03:15.133
"Were you born a bitch or did you
just learn to be one over time?"

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:17.498
But my favorite thing about this

00:03:17.522 --> 00:03:21.228
is that once Brian was done typing,
his finger must have slipped

00:03:21.252 --> 00:03:24.739
because then he sent me
the thumbs-up emoji.

00:03:24.763 --> 00:03:26.033
(Laughter)

00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:28.560
So, babe, thumbs up to you, too.

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:31.080
(Laughter)
