DM (Laughing): Yeah, right.

Doug: But it definitely
has made me rethink

00:07:33.624 --> 00:07:37.212
the way that I interact
with people online.

00:07:38.934 --> 00:07:41.791
DM: So I've collected these
conversations and many others

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:45.363
for my podcast "Conversations
with People Who Hate Me."

00:07:45.387 --> 00:07:46.537
(Laughter)

00:07:47.776 --> 00:07:49.625
Before I started this project,

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:52.839

to bring about change

00:07:52.863 --> 00:07:55.760
was to shut down opposing viewpoints

00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:59.903
through epically worded
video essays and comments and posts,

00:07:59.927 --> 00:08:02.434
but I soon learned
those were only cheered on
