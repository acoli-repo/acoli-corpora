00:07:59.927 --> 00:08:02.434
but I soon learned
those were only cheered on

00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:05.005
by the people who already agreed with me.

00:08:05.355 --> 00:08:06.791
Sometimes -- bless you.

00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:09.863
Sometimes, the most subversive
thing you could do --

00:08:09.887 --> 00:08:11.228
yeah, clap for him.

00:08:11.252 --> 00:08:13.985
(Laughter)

00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:17.799
Sometimes, the most subversive
thing you could do

00:08:17.823 --> 00:08:21.339
was to actually speak
with the people you disagreed with,

00:08:21.363 --> 00:08:22.896
and not simply at them.

00:08:23.777 --> 00:08:25.252
Now in every one of my calls,

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:28.936
I always ask my guests
to tell me about themselves.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.356
And it's their answer to this question
that allows me to empathize with them.
