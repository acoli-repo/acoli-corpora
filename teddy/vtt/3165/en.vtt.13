00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:30.265
DM: You tagged me in this post.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.095
Did you want me to see it?

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:34.908
Matthew (Laughing): I honestly
didn't think that you would.

00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:37.453
DM: Have you ever been publicly dragged?

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.032
Matthew: I have been.

00:06:39.056 --> 00:06:41.737
And I just said, "No, I don't care."

00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:43.007
DM: And did you not care?

00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:44.253
Matthew: But it was hard.

00:06:44.277 --> 00:06:45.483
DM: Did you not care?

00:06:45.507 --> 00:06:47.240
Matthew: Oh, I cared, yes.

00:06:48.652 --> 00:06:50.462
DM: At the end of these conversations,

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.962
there's often a moment of reflection.

00:06:52.986 --> 00:06:54.256
A reconsideration.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.248
And that's exactly what happened

00:06:56.272 --> 00:06:58.418
at the end of my call
with a guy named Doug

00:06:58.442 --> 00:07:02.014
who had written that I was
a talentless propaganda hack.
