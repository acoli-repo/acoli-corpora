00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:30.926
only the ones I felt safe talking to --

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.553
with a simple opening question:

00:04:33.577 --> 00:04:35.111
"Why did you write that?"

00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.474
The first person I spoke to was Josh.

00:04:38.498 --> 00:04:40.843
He had written to tell me
that I was a moron,

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:43.331
I was a reason this country
was dividing itself,

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:47.287
and he added at the end
that being gay was a sin.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:51.357
I was so nervous
for our first conversation.

00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:53.032
This wasn't a comments section.

00:04:53.056 --> 00:04:56.228
So I couldn't use tools
like muting or blocking.

00:04:56.252 --> 00:04:59.684
Of course, I guess,
I could have hung up on him.
