00:01:27.356 --> 00:01:30.537
I got millions of views,
a ton of great press

00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:32.428
and a slew of new followers.

00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:35.783
But the flip side of success
on the internet

00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:37.370
is internet hate.

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.538
I was called everything.

00:01:39.562 --> 00:01:45.355
From "beta" to "snowflake"
and, of course, the ever-popular "cuck."

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:48.034
Don't worry, I will break
these terms down for you.

00:01:48.058 --> 00:01:49.228
(Laughter)

00:01:49.252 --> 00:01:51.736
So, "beta," for those of you unfamiliar,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.013
is shorthand online lingo for "beta male."

00:01:55.434 --> 00:01:57.776
But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.085
and my fashion aesthetic
is rich-white-woman-running-errands,
