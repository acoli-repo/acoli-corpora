Hi.

00:00:02.848 --> 00:00:06.071
I've received hate online.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:07.539
A lot of it.

00:00:07.563 --> 00:00:10.203
And it comes
with the territory of my work.

00:00:10.227 --> 00:00:11.782
I'm a digital creator,

00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:14.660
I make things specifically
for the internet.

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:19.087
Like, a few years ago, I made
a video series called "Every Single Word"

00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:21.229
where I edited down popular films

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:24.101
to only the words
spoken by people of color,

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:28.469
as a way to empirically and accessibly
talk about the issue of representation

00:00:28.493 --> 00:00:29.643
in Hollywood.
