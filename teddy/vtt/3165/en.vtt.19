that they justifiably don't feel
that they have any empathy to give.

00:09:33.153 --> 00:09:34.533
I totally get that.

00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:37.342
This is just what I feel
well-suited to do.

00:09:37.787 --> 00:09:40.770
You know, I've reached out
to a lot of people for this podcast.

00:09:40.794 --> 00:09:42.680
And some have politely declined,

00:09:42.704 --> 00:09:44.712
others have read my message
and ignored it,

00:09:44.736 --> 00:09:48.132
some have blocked me automatically
when I sent the invitation

00:09:48.156 --> 00:09:49.942
and one guy actually agreed to do it

00:09:49.966 --> 00:09:51.728
and then, five minutes into the call,

00:09:51.752 --> 00:09:52.902
hung up on me.

00:09:53.522 --> 00:09:57.112
I'm also aware that this talk
will appear on the internet.

00:09:57.556 --> 00:09:59.665
And with the internet comes
comment sections,

00:09:59.689 --> 00:10:02.952
and with comment sections
inevitably comes hate.
