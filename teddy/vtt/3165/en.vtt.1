Then, later, as transphobic bathroom bill

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:37.045
started gaining media attention
around the United States,

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:39.689
I hosted and produced an interview series

00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:42.482
called "Sitting in Bathrooms
with Trans People"

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:44.172
where I did exactly that.

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:45.363
(Laughter)

00:00:45.387 --> 00:00:46.578
And then --

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:48.069
Sure, I'll take applause.

00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:49.998
(Applause)

00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:51.172
Thank you.

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:55.805
And then, are you familiar
with those unboxing videos on YouTube

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.396
where YouTubers open up
the latest electronic gadgets?

00:00:59.797 --> 00:01:02.791
Great, so I satirized those
in a weekly series,
