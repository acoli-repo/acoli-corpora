and cure systemic injustice?

00:06:00.157 --> 00:06:02.751
No, absolutely not, right?

00:06:03.466 --> 00:06:06.331
But did our conversation
humanize us to each other

00:06:06.355 --> 00:06:09.536
more than profile pictures
and posts ever could?

00:06:09.927 --> 00:06:11.077
Absolutely.

00:06:11.411 --> 00:06:12.957
I didn't stop there.

00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:16.783
Because some of the hate I received
was from "my side."

00:06:17.123 --> 00:06:21.046
So when Matthew,
a queer liberal artist like me

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.826
publicly wrote that I represented
some of the worst aspects of liberalism,

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.517
I wanted to ask him this.

00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:30.265
