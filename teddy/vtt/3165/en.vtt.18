00:08:59.165 --> 00:09:00.323
and endorse theirs.

00:09:00.347 --> 00:09:04.672
Empathizing with someone who, for example,
believes that being gay is a sin

00:09:04.696 --> 00:09:07.363
doesn't mean that I'm suddenly
going to drop everything,

00:09:07.387 --> 00:09:10.420
pack my bags and grab
my one-way ticket to hell, right?

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:12.768
It just means that I'm acknowledging

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:16.686
the humanity of someone who was raised
to think very differently from me.

00:09:17.617 --> 00:09:20.085
I also want to be super clear
about something.

00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:22.776
This is not a prescription for activism.

00:09:23.498 --> 00:09:25.888
I understand that
some people don't feel safe

00:09:25.912 --> 00:09:27.260
talking to their detractors

00:09:27.284 --> 00:09:29.283
and others feel so marginalized

00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:33.129
that they justifiably don't feel
that they have any empathy to give.
