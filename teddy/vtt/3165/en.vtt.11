00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:32.552
but I am a little bit bigger
than a lot of my classmates

00:05:32.576 --> 00:05:36.514
and they seem to judge me
before they even got to know me.

00:05:36.538 --> 00:05:37.807
DM: That's awful.

00:05:38.173 --> 00:05:40.569
I mean, I also just want
to let you know, Josh,

00:05:40.593 --> 00:05:43.251
I was bullied in high school, too.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.466
So did our common ground
of being bullied in high school

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.023
erase what he wrote me?

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:51.752
No.

00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:54.903
And did our single phone conversation

00:05:54.927 --> 00:05:57.808
radically heal a politically
divided country

00:05:57.832 --> 00:06:00.133
and cure systemic injustice?
