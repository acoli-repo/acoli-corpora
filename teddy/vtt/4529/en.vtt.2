00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.976
You see, James Madison enslaved
more than 100 people

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.212
over the course of his lifetime.

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:05.522
And he never freed a single soul,

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:07.226
not even upon his death.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:11.537
The centerpiece of Montpelier
is Madison's mansion.

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:13.959
Now this is where James Madison grew up,

00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:17.379
this is where he returned to
after his presidency,

00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:19.466
this is where he eventually died.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.418
And the centerpiece
of Madison's mansion is his library.

00:01:23.442 --> 00:01:25.121
This room on the second floor,

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:30.506
where Madison conceived
and conceptualized the Bill of Rights.
