00:09:58.713 --> 00:10:00.212
That's a lot of money.

00:10:00.236 --> 00:10:02.283
(Laughter)

00:10:02.815 --> 00:10:04.863
So that means,

00:10:04.887 --> 00:10:07.299
as their single and sole asset,

00:10:07.323 --> 00:10:12.189
when the time comes for them
to pass that asset on to my brother and I,

00:10:12.213 --> 00:10:16.783
that will be the first time
in my family's history,

00:10:16.807 --> 00:10:20.562
more than 150 years
after the end of slavery,

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:24.610
that there will be a meaningful
transfer of wealth in my family.

00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:28.570
And it's not because family
members haven't saved,

00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:29.958
haven't worked hard,

00:10:29.982 --> 00:10:31.886
haven't valued education.
