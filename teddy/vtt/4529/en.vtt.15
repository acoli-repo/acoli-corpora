00:07:28.665 --> 00:07:32.380
My great-great-grandfather
was born enslaved

00:07:32.404 --> 00:07:35.696
in Jasper County, Georgia, in the 1850s.

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:40.076
While enslaved, he was never allowed
to accumulate anything,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.950
and he was emancipated with nothing.

00:07:41.974 --> 00:07:45.878
He was never compensated
for the bricks that he made.

00:07:46.363 --> 00:07:51.466
My great-grandfather was also born
in Jasper County, Georgia, in the 1870s,

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.985
and he actually managed
to accumulate a fair bit of land.

00:07:55.548 --> 00:07:59.937
But then, in nineteen-teens,
Jim Crow took that land from him.
