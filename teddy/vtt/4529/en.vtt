00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:02.873
Not that long ago,

00:00:02.897 --> 00:00:04.904
I received an invitation

00:00:04.928 --> 00:00:10.003
to spend a few days at the historic
home of James Madison.

00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:11.640
James Madison, of course,

00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:14.418
was the fourth president
of the United States,

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:16.846
the father of the Constitution,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.400
the architect of the Bill of Rights.

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:21.036
And as a historian,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.630
I was really excited
to go to this historic site,

00:00:24.654 --> 00:00:30.403
because I understand and appreciate
the power of place.
