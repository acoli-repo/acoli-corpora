00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:32.676
I can't tell you how many times
I've heard people say,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.288
"It's hard to imagine slavery
existing outside of the plantation South."

00:05:37.312 --> 00:05:38.462
No, it ain't.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.471
Slavery existed in every American colony,

00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:44.363
slavery existed in my home
state of New York

00:05:44.387 --> 00:05:47.835
for 50 years after
the American Revolution.

00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:50.176
So why do we do this?

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.763
Why do we avoid confronting hard history?

00:05:54.232 --> 00:05:56.887
Literary performer
and educator Regie Gibson

00:05:56.911 --> 00:05:59.283
had the truth of it when he said

00:05:59.307 --> 00:06:05.081
that our problem as Americans
is we actually hate history.
