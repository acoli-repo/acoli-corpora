Sometimes, we try
to rationalize hard history.

00:05:01.095 --> 00:05:02.722
When people visit Montpelier --

00:05:02.746 --> 00:05:05.452
and by "people," in this instance,
I mean white people --

00:05:05.476 --> 00:05:06.790
when they visit Montpelier

00:05:06.814 --> 00:05:10.690
and learn about Madison enslaving people,

00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:12.680
they often ask,

00:05:12.704 --> 00:05:14.704
"But wasn't he a good master?"

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.132
A "good master?"

00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:20.292
There is no such thing as a good master.

00:05:20.316 --> 00:05:23.151
There is only worse and worser.

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:26.453
And sometimes,

00:05:26.477 --> 00:05:29.444
we just pretend the past didn't happen.
