00:03:57.173 --> 00:04:00.235
And this is hard history.

00:04:01.164 --> 00:04:03.918
It's hard history,
because it's difficult to imagine

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:06.362
the kind of inhumanity

00:04:06.386 --> 00:04:08.403
that leads one to enslave children

00:04:08.427 --> 00:04:11.226
to make bricks for your comfort
and convenience.

00:04:11.582 --> 00:04:12.749
It's hard history,

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:16.737
because it's hard to talk
about the violence of slavery,

00:04:16.761 --> 00:04:19.193
the beatings, the whippings,
the kidnappings,

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.724
the forced family separations.

00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:26.403
It's hard history, because it's hard
to teach white supremacy,

00:04:26.427 --> 00:04:29.577
which is the ideology
that justified slavery.
