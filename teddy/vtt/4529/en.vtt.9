00:04:30.157 --> 00:04:33.871
And so rather than confront hard history,

00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:36.210
we tend to avoid it.

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:41.780
Now, sometimes that means
just making stuff up.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.606
I can't tell you how many times
I've heard people say

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.359
that "states' rights" was the primary
cause of the Civil War.

00:04:50.058 --> 00:04:51.884
That would actually come as a surprise

00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:53.955
to the people who fought in the Civil War.

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.312
(Laughter)

00:04:55.336 --> 00:05:00.404
Sometimes, we try
to rationalize hard history.
