00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:30.416
are tiny hand prints.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.903
Because all of the bricks
at James Madison's estate

00:03:35.927 --> 00:03:39.404
were made by the children
that he enslaved.

00:03:40.373 --> 00:03:42.262
And that's when it hit me

00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:43.873
that the library

00:03:43.897 --> 00:03:49.817
in which James Madison conceives
and conceptualizes the Bill of Rights

00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:52.461
rests on a foundation of bricks

00:03:53.206 --> 00:03:56.236
made by the children that he enslaved.

00:03:57.173 --> 00:04:00.235
And this is hard history.
