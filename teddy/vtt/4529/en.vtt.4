Now, in the cellars of the mansion,

00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:05.189
that's where the enslaved
African Americans who managed the house

00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:06.781
spent most of their time.

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:11.630
It's also where they were installing
a new exhibition on slavery in America.

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:13.800
And while we were there,

00:02:13.824 --> 00:02:17.387
Christian instructed me to do something
I thought was a little bit strange.

00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:18.729
He told me to take my hand

00:02:18.753 --> 00:02:23.696
and place it on the brick walls
of the cellar and to slide it along,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.283
until I felt these impressions or ridges
in the face of the brick.

00:02:28.632 --> 00:02:29.790
Now look,

00:02:29.814 --> 00:02:33.030
I was going to be staying on-site
on this former slave plantation
