00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:33.283
Now as a historian, I spend a lot of time
thinking about this very statement,

00:06:33.307 --> 00:06:36.855
and in a sense,
it applies to us in America.

00:06:37.165 --> 00:06:38.845
But in a way, it doesn't.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.942
Because, inherent in this statement,

00:06:41.966 --> 00:06:44.906
is the notion that at some point,

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.112
we stopped doing the things

00:06:47.136 --> 00:06:50.532
that have created inequality
in the first place.

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.421
And a harsh reality is,

00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:54.595
we haven't.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.307
Consider the racial wealth gap.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:03.506
Wealth is generated by accumulating
resources in one generation
