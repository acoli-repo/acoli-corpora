00:02:57.204 --> 00:03:00.315
she would take her hand
and slide it along the outside,

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:02.355
which is absolutely disgusting.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.736
And then --

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.387
and then, if I couldn't get
to her in time,

00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:08.896
she would take her fingers
and pop them in her mouth,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.744
which would drive me absolutely crazy.

00:03:10.768 --> 00:03:14.188
So this is what I'm thinking about
while I'm supposed to be a historian.

00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:15.513
(Laughter)

00:03:15.537 --> 00:03:20.932
But then, I actually do feel
these impressions in the brick.

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:23.138
I feel these ridges in the brick.

00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:26.797
And it takes a second
to realize what they are.

00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:28.417
What they are

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:30.416
are tiny hand prints.
