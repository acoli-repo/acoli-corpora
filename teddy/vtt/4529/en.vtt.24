To do nothing is to be complicit

00:12:04.989 --> 00:12:06.139
in inequality.

00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:09.990
History reminds us

00:12:10.014 --> 00:12:12.331
that we, as a nation,

00:12:12.355 --> 00:12:16.521
stand on the shoulders of political giants

00:12:16.545 --> 00:12:18.065
like James Madison.

00:12:18.752 --> 00:12:24.506

that we, as a nation,

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:30.480
also stand on the shoulders
of enslaved African American children.
