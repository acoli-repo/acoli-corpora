00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.276
(Laughter)

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.839
And as a result of gentrification,

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:35.512
not only did all their neighbors
mysteriously disappear,

00:09:36.823 --> 00:09:38.798
but the value of their home

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.638
skyrocketed.

00:09:42.466 --> 00:09:45.760
So that home that they purchased
for 55,000 dollars --

00:09:45.784 --> 00:09:48.490
at 29 percent interest, by the way --

00:09:48.514 --> 00:09:53.848
that home is now worth
30 times what they paid it for.

00:09:54.285 --> 00:09:55.458
Thirty times.

00:09:55.482 --> 00:09:56.642
Do the math with me.

00:09:56.666 --> 00:09:58.689
That's 55,000 times 30, carry the zeros --

00:09:58.713 --> 00:10:00.212
That's a lot of money.
