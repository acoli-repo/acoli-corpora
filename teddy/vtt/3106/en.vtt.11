00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:30.808
However, all of this
that took decades to produce

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:33.834
is just one snapshot of the subsurface.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.433
It does not give us any indication
of how the ice sheet is changing in time.

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:41.755
Now, we're working on that,
because it turns out

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.228
that the very first radar observations
of Antarctica were collected

00:05:45.252 --> 00:05:47.630
using 35 millimeter optical film.

00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:50.212
And there were thousands
of reels of this film

00:05:50.236 --> 00:05:53.490
in the archives of the museum
of the Scott Polar Research Institute

00:05:53.514 --> 00:05:55.016
at the University of Cambridge.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.621
So last summer, I took
a state-of-the-art film scanner

00:05:57.645 --> 00:06:01.201
that was developed for digitizing
Hollywood films and remastering them,
