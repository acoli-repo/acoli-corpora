00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.531
And by teaching engineering students
to think like earth scientists

00:10:03.555 --> 00:10:06.233
and earth-science students
who can think like engineers,

00:10:06.257 --> 00:10:10.490
my lab is building an environment in which
we can build custom radar sensors

00:10:10.514 --> 00:10:12.124
for each problem at hand,

00:10:12.148 --> 00:10:15.585
that are optimized for low cost
and high performance

00:10:15.609 --> 00:10:17.077
for that problem.

00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:20.578
And that's going to totally change
the way we observe ice sheets.

00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:26.079
Look, the sea level problem and the role
of the cryosphere in sea level rise

00:10:26.103 --> 00:10:27.688
is extremely important

00:10:27.712 --> 00:10:29.386
and will affect the entire world.

00:10:29.815 --> 00:10:31.903
But that is not why I work on it.
