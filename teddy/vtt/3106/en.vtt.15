00:07:28.753 --> 00:07:30.190
And if we're going to do that,

00:07:30.214 --> 00:07:33.221
we're going to need totally new ways
of observing the ice sheet.

00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:35.966
And ideally, those should be
extremely low-cost

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.225
so that we can take lots
of measurements from lots of sensors.

00:07:39.871 --> 00:07:42.014
Well, for existing radar systems,

00:07:42.038 --> 00:07:45.082
the biggest driver of cost
is the power required

00:07:45.106 --> 00:07:47.403
to transmit the radar signal itself.

00:07:48.187 --> 00:07:51.482
So it’d be great if we were able
to use existing radio systems

00:07:51.506 --> 00:07:54.228
or radio signals
that are in the environment.

00:07:54.252 --> 00:07:57.101
And fortunately, the entire field
of radio astronomy

00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:00.910
is built on the fact that there
are bright radio signals in the sky.
