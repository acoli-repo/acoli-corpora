00:08:58.244 --> 00:09:00.733
to using ambient seismic noise
in the environment.

00:09:00.757 --> 00:09:04.590
And defense radars use TV signals
and radio signals all the time,

00:09:04.614 --> 00:09:07.193
so they don't have to transmit
a signal of radar

00:09:07.217 --> 00:09:08.868
and give away their position.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.878
So what I'm saying is,
this might really work.

00:09:11.902 --> 00:09:15.104
And if it does, we're going to need
extremely low-cost sensors

00:09:15.128 --> 00:09:18.717
so we can deploy networks of hundreds
or thousands of these on an ice sheet

00:09:18.741 --> 00:09:19.892
to do imaging.

00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:23.522
And that's where the technological stars
have really aligned to help us.

00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:25.950
Those earlier radar systems I talked about

00:09:25.974 --> 00:09:29.607
were developed by experienced
engineers over the course of years

00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:30.980
at national facilities
