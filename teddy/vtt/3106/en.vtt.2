00:00:55.863 --> 00:01:00.537
However, beyond that, this plot comes
with the asterisk and the caveat,

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.482
"... unless the West Antarctic
Ice Sheet collapses."

00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:07.069
And in that case, we would be talking
about dramatically higher numbers.

00:01:07.093 --> 00:01:09.061
They'd literally be off the chart.

00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:12.736
And the reason we should take
that possibility seriously

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.340
is that we know from the geologic
history of the Earth

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:17.522
that there were periods in its history

00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:20.187
when sea level rose
much more quickly than today.

00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:22.236
And right now, we cannot rule out

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.712
the possibility of that
happening in the future.

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:28.761
So why can't we say with confidence

00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:33.982
whether or not a significant portion
of a continent-scale ice sheet
