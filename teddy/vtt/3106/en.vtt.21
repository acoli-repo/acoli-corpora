00:10:29.815 --> 00:10:31.903
But that is not why I work on it.

00:10:32.458 --> 00:10:35.573
I work on it for the opportunity
to teach and mentor

00:10:35.597 --> 00:10:37.384
extremely brilliant students,

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.913
because I deeply believe
that teams of hypertalented,

00:10:40.937 --> 00:10:43.429
hyperdriven, hyperpassionate young people

00:10:43.453 --> 00:10:46.000
can solve most of the challenges
facing the world,

00:10:46.577 --> 00:10:50.589
and that providing the observations
required to estimate sea level rise

00:10:50.613 --> 00:10:54.303
is just one of the many such problems
they can and will solve.

00:10:54.768 --> 00:10:55.920
Thank you.
