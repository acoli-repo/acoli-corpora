00:06:29.443 --> 00:06:30.498
(Laughter)

00:06:30.522 --> 00:06:32.219
And as amazing as it is

00:06:32.243 --> 00:06:35.879
that we can look at what was happening
under the ice sheet 50 years ago,

00:06:35.903 --> 00:06:38.585
this is still just one more snapshot.

00:06:38.609 --> 00:06:40.726
It doesn't give us observations

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.923
of the variation at the annual
or seasonal scale,

00:06:43.947 --> 00:06:45.283
that we know matters.

00:06:45.926 --> 00:06:47.490
There's some progress here, too.

00:06:47.514 --> 00:06:51.038
There are these recent ground-based
radar systems that stay in one spot.

00:06:51.062 --> 00:06:53.675
So you take these radars
and put them on the ice sheet

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:55.589
and you bury a cache of car batteries.

00:06:55.613 --> 00:06:58.423
And you leave them out there
for months or years at a time,

00:06:58.447 --> 00:07:00.559
and they send a pulse down
into the ice sheet
