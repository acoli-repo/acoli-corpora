00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:30.005
about this type of fieldwork,

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.176
where people imagine
scientists peering out the window,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.114
contemplating the landscape,
its geologic context

00:03:36.138 --> 00:03:37.856
and the fate of the ice sheets.

00:03:38.327 --> 00:03:41.950
We actually had a guy from the BBC's
"Frozen Planet" on one of these flights.

00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:44.696
And he spent, like, hours
videotaping us turn knobs.

00:03:45.046 --> 00:03:47.649
(Laughter)

00:03:47.673 --> 00:03:51.049
And I was actually watching the series
years later with my wife,

00:03:51.073 --> 00:03:54.496
and a scene like this came up,
and I commented on how beautiful it was.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.931
And she said, "Weren't you
on that flight?"

00:03:57.955 --> 00:03:59.114
(Laughter)

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:02.083
I said, "Yeah, but I was looking
at a computer screen."
