00:08:27.585 --> 00:08:31.381
Now, I know you're thinking,
"There are no glaciers at Big Sur."

00:08:31.405 --> 00:08:32.490
(Laughter)

00:08:32.514 --> 00:08:33.672
And that's true.

00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:34.876
(Laughter)

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.600
But it turns out that detecting
the reflection of the sun

00:08:38.624 --> 00:08:39.982
off the surface of the ocean

00:08:40.006 --> 00:08:42.808
and detecting the reflection
off the bottom of an ice sheet

00:08:42.832 --> 00:08:44.573
are extremely geophysically similar.

00:08:44.597 --> 00:08:45.796
And if this works,

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.225
we should be able to apply the same
measurement principle in Antarctica.

00:08:49.249 --> 00:08:51.289
And this is not
as far-fetched as it seems.

00:08:51.313 --> 00:08:55.066
The seismic industry has gone through
a similar technique-development exercise,

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.220
where they were able to move
from detonating dynamite as a source,

00:08:58.244 --> 00:09:00.733
to using ambient seismic noise
in the environment.
