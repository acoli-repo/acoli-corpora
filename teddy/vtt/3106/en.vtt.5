00:02:28.577 --> 00:02:32.363
but they're also changing
over the scale of years and days.

00:02:32.387 --> 00:02:36.696
So what we want is observations
beneath kilometers of ice

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.649
at the scale of a continent,

00:02:38.673 --> 00:02:40.318
and we want them all the time.

00:02:41.014 --> 00:02:42.414
So how do we do this?

00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:46.870
Well, we're not totally blind
to the subsurface.

00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:49.564
I said in the beginning
that I was a radio glaciologist,

00:02:49.588 --> 00:02:51.466
and the reason that that's a thing

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.260
is that airborne ice-penetrating radar
is the main tool we have

00:02:55.284 --> 00:02:56.880
to see inside of ice sheets.

00:02:57.212 --> 00:03:01.058
So most of the data used by my group
is collected by airplanes
