00:06:58.447 --> 00:07:00.559
and they send a pulse down
into the ice sheet

00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:02.081
every so many minutes or hours.

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:04.512
So this gives you
continuous observation in time --

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.108
but at one spot.

00:07:06.418 --> 00:07:10.808
So if you compare that imaging to the 2-D
pictures provided by the airplane,

00:07:10.832 --> 00:07:12.689
this is just one vertical line.

00:07:13.498 --> 00:07:16.354
And this is pretty much
where we are as a field right now.

00:07:16.378 --> 00:07:19.036
We can choose between
good spatial coverage

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.553
with airborne radar sounding

00:07:20.577 --> 00:07:24.386
and good temporal coverage in one spot
with ground-based sounding.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.721
But neither gives us what we really want:

00:07:26.745 --> 00:07:28.086
both at the same time.

00:07:28.753 --> 00:07:30.190
And if we're going to do that,
