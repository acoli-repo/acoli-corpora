00:04:27.776 --> 00:04:30.006
And it's amazing
that this works this well.

00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:32.339
The ground-penetrating
radars that are used

00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:35.291
to investigate infrastructures of roads
or detect land mines

00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:37.474
struggle to get through
a few meters of earth.

00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:40.254
And here we're peering
through three kilometers of ice.

00:04:40.278 --> 00:04:44.118
And there are sophisticated, interesting,
electromagnetic reasons for that,

00:04:44.142 --> 00:04:48.293
but let's say for now that ice
is basically the perfect target for radar,

00:04:48.317 --> 00:04:51.545
and radar is basically
the perfect tool to study ice sheets.

00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:53.920
These are the flight lines

00:04:53.944 --> 00:04:56.988
of most of the modern airborne
radar-sounding profiles

00:04:57.012 --> 00:04:58.726
collected over Antarctica.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.720
This is the result
of heroic efforts over decades
