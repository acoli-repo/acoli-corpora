00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.332
When most scientists
talk about sea level rise,

00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:33.737
they show a plot like this.

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:36.547
This is produced using ice sheet
and climate models.

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.307
On the right, you can see
the range of sea level

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:42.529
predicted by these models
over the next 100 years.

00:00:42.553 --> 00:00:45.505
For context, this is current sea level,

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:46.927
and this is the sea level

00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:50.505
above which more than 4 million people
could be vulnerable to displacement.

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:52.633
So in terms of planning,

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:55.839
the uncertainty in this plot
is already large.

00:00:55.863 --> 00:01:00.537
However, beyond that, this plot comes
with the asterisk and the caveat,
