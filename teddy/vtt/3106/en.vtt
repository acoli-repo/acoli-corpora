00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:03.016
I'm a radio glaciologist.

00:00:03.397 --> 00:00:07.269
That means that I use radar
to study glaciers and ice sheets.

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:09.728
And like most glaciologists right now,

00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:11.820
I'm working on the problem of estimating

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:16.004
how much the ice is going to contribute
to sea level rise in the future.

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:18.142
So today, I want to talk to you about

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.903
why it's so hard to put good numbers
on sea level rise,

00:00:21.927 --> 00:00:25.967
and why I believe that by changing
the way we think about radar technology

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:27.379
and earth-science education,

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:29.157
we can get much better at it.
