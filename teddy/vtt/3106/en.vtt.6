00:02:57.212 --> 00:03:01.058
So most of the data used by my group
is collected by airplanes

00:03:01.082 --> 00:03:03.307
like this World War II-era DC-3,

00:03:03.331 --> 00:03:05.783
that actually fought
in the Battle of the Bulge.

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:08.387
You can see the antennas
underneath the wing.

00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:12.141
These are used to transmit
radar signals down into the ice.

00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:14.618
And the echos that come back
contain information

00:03:14.642 --> 00:03:17.579
about what's happening inside
and beneath the ice sheet.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.847
While this is happening,

00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:22.156
scientists and engineers
are on the airplane

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.667
for eight hours at a stretch,

00:03:23.691 --> 00:03:25.560
making sure that the radar's working.

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:28.537
And I think this is actually
a misconception

00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:30.005
about this type of fieldwork,
