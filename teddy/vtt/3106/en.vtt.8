I said, "Yeah, but I was looking
at a computer screen."

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:03.363
(Laughter)

00:04:03.387 --> 00:04:05.594
So when you think
about this type of fieldwork,

00:04:05.618 --> 00:04:07.641
don't think about images like this.

00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:09.356
Think about images like this.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.543
(Laughter)

00:04:10.567 --> 00:04:13.909
This is a radargram, which is
a vertical profile through the ice sheet,

00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:15.417
kind of like a slice of cake.

00:04:15.768 --> 00:04:18.617
The bright layer on the top
is the surface of the ice sheet,

00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:21.971
the bright layer on the bottom
is the bedrock of the continent itself,

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.521
and the layers in between
are kind of like tree rings,

00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:27.752
in that they contain information
about the history of the ice sheet.

00:04:27.776 --> 00:04:30.006
And it's amazing
that this works this well.
