00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:02.683
than we do of what's beneath
the Antarctic ice sheet.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.036
And this is even more challenging
in that we need these observations

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.256
at a gigantic scale
in both space and time.

00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:12.935
In terms of space, this is a continent.

00:02:13.322 --> 00:02:15.442
And in the same way that in North America,

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:19.506
the Rocky Mountains, Everglades
and Great Lakes regions are very distinct,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.521
so are the subsurface
regions of Antarctica.

00:02:22.545 --> 00:02:24.188
And in terms of time, we now know

00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:28.553
that ice sheets not only evolve over
the timescale of millennia and centuries,

00:02:28.577 --> 00:02:32.363
but they're also changing
over the scale of years and days.
