00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:33.982
whether or not a significant portion
of a continent-scale ice sheet

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:36.107
will or will not collapse?

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.784
Well, in order to do that, we need models

00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:42.389
that we know include all of the processes,
conditions and physics

00:01:42.413 --> 00:01:44.811
that would be involved
in a collapse like that.

00:01:45.206 --> 00:01:46.666
And that's hard to know,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.424
because those processes
and conditions are taking place

00:01:49.448 --> 00:01:51.287
beneath kilometers of ice,

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:53.861
and satellites, like the one
that produced this image,

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:55.310
are blind to observe them.

00:01:55.713 --> 00:01:59.997
In fact, we have much more comprehensive
observations of the surface of Mars
