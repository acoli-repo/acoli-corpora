00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:30.980
at national facilities

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:32.980
with expensive specialized equipment.

00:09:33.354 --> 00:09:36.244
But the recent developments
in software-defined radio,

00:09:36.268 --> 00:09:38.514
rapid fabrication and the maker movement,

00:09:38.538 --> 00:09:41.490
make it so that it's possible
for a team of teenagers

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:44.156
working in my lab over the course
of a handful of months

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.625
to build a prototype radar.

00:09:46.045 --> 00:09:48.854
OK, they're not any teenagers,
they’re Stanford undergrads,

00:09:48.878 --> 00:09:50.525
but the point holds --

00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:51.973
(Laughter)

00:09:51.997 --> 00:09:55.300
that these enabling technologies
are letting us break down the barrier

00:09:55.324 --> 00:09:59.135
between engineers who build instruments
and scientists that use them.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.531
And by teaching engineering students
to think like earth scientists
