00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have had the distinct blessing in my life

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
But the coolest I ever worked on

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
was around this guy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This guy's name is TEMPT.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And he came up home from a run one day

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And that was the onset of ALS.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
He only has use of his eyes.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I was exposed to him.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I have a company that does design and animation,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part
