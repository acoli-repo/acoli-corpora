that's already stretched
beyond imagination.

00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:37.629
But what's most important to us

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:42.257
is that our work helps restore
the rights and the dignity

00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:45.832
that refugees lose throughout
resettlement and integration

00:05:45.856 --> 00:05:50.173
by giving them the resources that
they need in order to help themselves.

00:05:50.197 --> 00:05:51.429
Thank you.

00:05:51.453 --> 00:05:54.037
