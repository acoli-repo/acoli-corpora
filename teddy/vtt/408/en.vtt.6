As another member of our team,
himself also a refugee, put it:

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:05.279
"In Canada, a SIM card
is more important than food,

00:03:05.303 --> 00:03:07.292
because we will not die from hunger."

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.291
But getting access to the right
resources and information

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:14.571
can be the difference
between life and death.

00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:16.894
Let me say that again:

00:03:16.918 --> 00:03:20.049
getting access to the right
resources and information

00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:23.967
can be the difference
between life and death.

00:03:25.347 --> 00:03:26.958

00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:28.668
we built Atar,
