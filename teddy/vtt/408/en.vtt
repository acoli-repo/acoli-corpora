About two years ago,

00:00:02.477 --> 00:00:04.568
I got a phone call that changed my life.

00:00:05.687 --> 00:00:08.549
"Hey, this is your cousin Hassen."

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:10.668
I froze.

00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:14.207
You see, I have well over
30 first cousins,

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:16.323
but I didn't know anybody named Hassen.

00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:20.347
It turned out that Hassen
was actually my mom's cousin

00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:22.748
and had just arrived
in Montreal as a refugee.

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:24.934
And over the next few months,

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:28.291
I would have three more relatives
coming to Canada to apply for asylum

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:30.700
with little more than
the clothes on their back.
