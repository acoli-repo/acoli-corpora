00:03:28.692 --> 00:03:31.602
the first-ever AI-powered virtual advocate

00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:34.240
that guides you step-by-step
through your first week

00:03:34.264 --> 00:03:35.754
of arriving in a new city.

00:03:35.778 --> 00:03:37.781
Just tell Atar what you need help with.

00:03:38.747 --> 00:03:40.835
Atar will then ask you
some basic questions

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.903
to understand your unique circumstances

00:03:42.927 --> 00:03:45.823
and determine your eligibility
for resources.

00:03:45.847 --> 00:03:48.654
For example: Do you have
a place to stay tonight?

00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:52.498
If not, would you prefer
an all-women's shelter?

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:54.623
Do you have children?

00:03:55.442 --> 00:03:58.584
Atar will then generate
a custom, step-by-step to-do list

00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:00.897
that tells you everything
that you need to know,
