00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:00.897
that tells you everything
that you need to know,

00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:03.646
from where to go, how to get there,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.872
what to bring with you

00:04:04.896 --> 00:04:06.122
and what to expect.

00:04:06.924 --> 00:04:09.311
You can ask a question at any time,

00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:11.028
and if Atar doesn't have an answer,

00:04:11.052 --> 00:04:13.721
you'll be connected
with a real person who does.

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:16.323
But what's most exciting

00:04:17.077 --> 00:04:20.152
is that we help humanitarian
and service organizations

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:24.211
collect the data and the analytics
that's necessary to understand

00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:25.856
the changing needs of newcomers

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.315
in real time.

00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:29.338
That's a game changer.
