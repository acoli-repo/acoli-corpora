My family's refugee experience
is not unique.

00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:06.155
According to the UNHCR,

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:09.249
every minute, 20 people
are newly displaced

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:11.653
by climate change, economic crisis

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:13.743
and social and political instability.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:17.233
And it was while volunteering
at a local YMCA shelter

00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:20.227
that my cousin Hassen
and other relatives were sent to

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:22.565
that we saw and learned to appreciate

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:26.676
how much effort and coordination
resettlement requires.
