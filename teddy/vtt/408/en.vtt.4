and even if communities do their best

00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:05.288
to help more people
with limited resources,

00:02:05.312 --> 00:02:07.939
newcomers end up spending
more time waiting in limbo,

00:02:07.963 --> 00:02:09.566
not knowing where to turn.

00:02:10.457 --> 00:02:11.912
In Montreal, for example,

00:02:11.936 --> 00:02:15.644
despite millions of dollars being spent
to support resettlement efforts,

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.200
nearly 50 percent of newcomers
still don't know

00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:20.526
that there are free resources that exist

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.143
to help them with everything
from filling out paperwork

00:02:23.167 --> 00:02:24.477
to finding a job.

00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:28.347
The challenge is not
that this information doesn't exist.

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:33.464
On the contrary, those in need are often
bombarded with so much information
