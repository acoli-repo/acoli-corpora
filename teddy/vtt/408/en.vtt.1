00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:30.700
with little more than
the clothes on their back.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.669
And in the two years
since that phone call,

00:00:33.693 --> 00:00:35.630
my life has completely changed.

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:37.388
I left academia

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:41.838
and now lead a diverse team
of technologists, researchers and refugees

00:00:41.862 --> 00:00:45.646
that is developing customized
self-help resources for newcomers.

00:00:46.418 --> 00:00:50.468
We want to help them overcome
language, cultural and other barriers

00:00:50.492 --> 00:00:54.046
that make them feel like they've lost
control over their own lives.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.234
And we feel that AI can help restore
the rights and the dignity

00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:59.368
that many people lose when seeking help.
