00:04:55.193 --> 00:05:00.351
By 2050, there will be
an additional 140 million people

00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:03.797
who are at risk of being displaced
due to environmental degradation.

00:05:04.412 --> 00:05:09.200
And today -- that is today --
there are nearly one billion people

00:05:09.224 --> 00:05:12.234
who already live in illegal
settlements and slums.

00:05:13.356 --> 00:05:15.300
Resettlement and integration

00:05:15.324 --> 00:05:17.953
is one of the greatest
challenges of our time.

00:05:18.883 --> 00:05:23.077
and our hope is that Atar can provide
every single newcomer an advocate.

00:05:24.212 --> 00:05:27.629
Our hope is that Atar
can amplify existing efforts

00:05:28.507 --> 00:05:31.165
and alleviate pressure
on a social safety net
