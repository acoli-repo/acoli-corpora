As of 2018, there are around 
2.5 billion smartphone users in the world.

00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:15.981
If we broke open all their newest phones,

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:19.019
which are just a fraction 
of the total thatâ€™ve been built,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.110
and split them into their component parts,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.819
that would produce 
around 85,000 kilograms of gold,

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.150
875,000 of silver,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.286
and 40 million kilograms of copper.
