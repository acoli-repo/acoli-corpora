00:00:01.615 --> 00:00:04.115
So I grew up in East Los Angeles,

00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:06.286
not even realizing I was poor.

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:10.403
My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.

00:00:10.403 --> 00:00:11.702
Everyone knew who I was,

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:15.152
so I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected,

00:00:15.152 --> 00:00:17.721
and even though my dad spent most of my life

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:19.070
in and out of jail,

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.571
I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.

00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:25.080
She worked at the local high school

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.635
as a secretary in the dean's office,

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:30.325
so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class,
