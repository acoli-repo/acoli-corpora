00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.549
she eventually was able to move to Paris
to study at the reputed Sorbonne.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.660
There, Marie earned both a physics
and mathematics degree

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.940
surviving largely on bread and tea,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.010
and sometimes fainting 
from near starvation.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.840
In Paris, Marie met the physicist 
Pierre Curie,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.099
who shared his lab and his heart with her.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:17.620
But she longed to be back in Poland.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.239
Upon her return to Warsaw, though,

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:21.879
she found that securing 
an academic position as a woman

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:23.620
remained a challenge.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.020
All was not lost.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.401
Back in Paris, 
the lovelorn Pierre was waiting,

00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:31.141
and the pair quickly married and became
a formidable scientific team.
