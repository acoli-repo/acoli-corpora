00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:00.781
and was not affected by physical
or chemical changes.

00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:04.492
This led her to conclude that radiation
was coming from something fundamental

00:02:04.492 --> 00:02:07.371
within the atoms of each element.

00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:08.663
The idea was radical

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:14.041
and helped to disprove the long-standing
model of atoms as indivisible objects.

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:18.442
Next, by focusing on a super radioactive 
ore called pitchblende,

00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:23.914
the Curies realized that uranium alone
couldn't be creating all the radiation.

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:28.524
So, were there other radioactive elements
that might be responsible?

00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:32.455
In 1898, they reported two new elements,
