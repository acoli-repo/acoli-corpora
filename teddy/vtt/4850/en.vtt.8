00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.218
changing the landscape of medical research
and treatments.

00:04:02.218 --> 00:04:05.347
She opened mobile radiology units
during World War I,

00:04:05.347 --> 00:04:08.779
and investigated radiation's
effects on tumors.

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.768
However, these benefits to humanity
may have come at a high personal cost.

00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:15.979
Curie died in 1934 of 
a bone marrow disease,

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.679
which many today think was caused
by her radiation exposure.

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:22.764
Marie Curie's revolutionary research

00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:26.016
laid the groundwork for our understanding
of physics and chemistry,

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:31.319
blazing trails in oncology, technology, 
medicine, and nuclear physics,
