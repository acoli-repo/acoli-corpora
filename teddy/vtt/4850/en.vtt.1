00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:31.078
Growing up in Warsaw 
in Russian-occupied Poland,

00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:34.671
the young Marie, originally named
Maria Sklodowska,

00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:38.868
was a brilliant student,
but she faced some challenging barriers.

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:42.498
As a woman, she was barred from pursuing
higher education,

00:00:42.498 --> 00:00:44.519
so in an act of defiance,

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.479
Marie enrolled in the Floating University,

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.859
a secret institution that provided
clandestine education to Polish youth.

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.679
By saving money and working
as a governess and tutor,

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.549
she eventually was able to move to Paris
to study at the reputed Sorbonne.
