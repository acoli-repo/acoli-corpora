In 1898, they reported two new elements,

00:02:32.455 --> 00:02:35.407
polonium, named for Marie's native Poland,

00:02:35.407 --> 00:02:38.433
and radium, the Latin word for ray.

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:42.384
They also coined the term radioactivity
along the way.

00:02:42.384 --> 00:02:48.715
By 1902, the Curies had extracted a tenth
of a gram of pure radium chloride salt

00:02:48.715 --> 00:02:51.287
from several tons of pitchblende,

00:02:51.287 --> 00:02:53.536
an incredible feat at the time.

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:56.476
Later that year, Pierre Curie 
and Henri Becquerel

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:59.336
were nominated for 
the Nobel Prize in physics,

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:01.105
but Marie was overlooked.
