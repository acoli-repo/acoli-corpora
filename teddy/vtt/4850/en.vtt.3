00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:31.141
and the pair quickly married and became
a formidable scientific team.

00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:35.119
Another physicist's work sparked
Marie Curie's interest.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.181
In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered
that uranium spontaneously emitted

00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:47.070
a mysterious X-ray-like radiation that
could interact with photographic film.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.551
Curie soon found that the element
thorium emitted similar radiation.

00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:55.001
Most importantly, 
the strength of the radiation

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.262
depended solely on the element's quantity,

00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:00.781
and was not affected by physical
or chemical changes.
