So whenever I tell people
I’m an Arctic scientist,

00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:08.129
the first thing that they always ask me
is: How cold is it up there?

00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:09.172
(Laughter)

00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:11.340
And yeah, the Arctic can get pretty cold.

00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:12.717
Trust me when I tell you

00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:17.096
that working outside at -40 degrees
is really, really challenging.

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:20.433
But in the summer of 2019,

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:22.351
it was anything but cold.

00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.481
So that summer I was working
with my research team

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:29.358
in Alaska’s Yukon Kuskokwim Delta

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:32.236
on the traditional lands
of the Yup’ik and Cup’ik people.
