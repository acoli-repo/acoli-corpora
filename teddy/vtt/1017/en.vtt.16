00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
over time, this notion of the Han emerged --

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
of course, nurtured

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
by a growing and very powerful sense

Now the great advantage of this historical experience

of cultural difference.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
