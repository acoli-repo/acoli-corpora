00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And, apart from the Mao period,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that has remained more or less the case ever since.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
But this is combined

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
The state is everywhere in China.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I mean, it's leading firms --

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
many of them are still publicly owned.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000

depend in many ways on state patronage.

Targets for the economy and so on

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
are set by the state.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
as we are familiar with --

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
with something like the one-child policy.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Moreover, this is a very old state tradition,
