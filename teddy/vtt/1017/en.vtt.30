00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
to understand other cultures,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
other civilizations.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Because, at the end of the day,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
it could, if necessary by force,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
get its own way.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Whereas those cultures --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
virtually the rest of the world, in fact,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West --

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
have been thereby forced to understand the West,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
because of the West's presence in those societies.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And therefore, they are, as a result,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I mean, take the question of East Asia.
