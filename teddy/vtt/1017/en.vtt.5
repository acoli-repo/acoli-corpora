00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Now the big question here is obviously,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
how do we make sense of China?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
How do we try to understand what China is?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
is that the conventional approach

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
is that we understand it really in Western terms,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
using Western ideas.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We can't.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now I want to offer you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
three building blocks

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
for trying to understand what China is like,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
just as a beginning.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The first is this:

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that China is not really a nation-state.
