Indonesia, Brazil --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
all of them are multiracial.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
The Chinese don't feel like that.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
China is only multiracial

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000

a history of conquest, occupation,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
absorption, assimilation and so on,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
led to the process by which,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
over time, this notion of the Han emerged --

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
of course, nurtured
