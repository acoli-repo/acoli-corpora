00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
So there's a long history

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
of extraordinary state infrastructural projects

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
in China,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
which is something like the Three Gorges Dam

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and many other expressions

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
of state competence

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
within China.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
So there we have three building blocks

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
for trying to understand the difference that is China --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
the civilization-state,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
the notion of race

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and the nature of the state

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and its relationship to society.
