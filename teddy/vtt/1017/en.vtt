00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The world is changing

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
with really remarkable speed.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If you look at the chart at the top here,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
you'll see that in 2025,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
these Goldman Sachs projections

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
suggest that the Chinese economy

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
will be almost the same size as the American economy.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And if you look at the chart

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for 2050,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
it's projected that the Chinese economy

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
will be twice the size of the American economy,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and the Indian economy will be almost the same size

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
as the American economy.
