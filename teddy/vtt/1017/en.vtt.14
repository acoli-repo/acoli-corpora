00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
The Chinese have a very, very different

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
conception of race

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Do you know,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
of the 1.3 billion Chinese,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
think they belong to the same race,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
the Han?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Now, this is completely different

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
from the world's [other] most populous countries.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
India, the United States,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Indonesia, Brazil --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
all of them are multiracial.
