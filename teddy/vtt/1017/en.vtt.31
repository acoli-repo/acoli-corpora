00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I mean, take the question of East Asia.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
East Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. --

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
a third of the world's population lives there.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Now the largest economic region in the world.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000

Now this point is very germane, I'm afraid,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to the present.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Because what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
the Goldman Sachs chart.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
What is happening
