00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that barely anyone in the West believed them.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
"Window dressing.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that won't be the case."

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Thirteen years on,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the political and legal system in Hong Kong

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
is as different now as it was in 1997.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
We were wrong. Why were we wrong?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
We were wrong because we thought, naturally enough,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
in nation-state ways.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Think of German unification, 1990.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
What happened?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
One nation, one system.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
That is the nation-state mentality.
