00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
as the American economy.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And we should bear in mind here

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that these projections were drawn up

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
before the Western financial crisis.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
A couple of weeks ago,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I was looking at the latest projection

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
by BNP Paribas

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
for when China

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
will have a larger economy

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
than the United States.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Goldman Sachs projected 2027.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The post-crisis projection

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is 2020.
