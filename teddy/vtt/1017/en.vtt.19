00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
is because --

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
well, there are two reasons, I think.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And the reason for this is,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
firstly, because the state in China

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
is given a very special --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
it enjoys a very special significance

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
as the representative,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
the embodiment and the guardian

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
of Chinese civilization,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
of the civilization-state.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
This is as close as China gets

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
to a kind of spiritual role.
