Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that as countries modernize,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
they also westernize.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This is an illusion.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's an assumption that modernity

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is a product simply of competition, markets and technology.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It is not. It is also shaped equally

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
by history and culture.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
China is not like the West,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and it will not become like the West.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It will remain in very fundamental respects

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
very different.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Now the big question here is obviously,
