00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that China is not really a nation-state.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Okay, it's called itself a nation-state

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
for the last hundred years,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000

knows it's a lot older than this.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty

still 2,000 years ago.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And you can see already it occupies

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
most of what we now know as Eastern China,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then
