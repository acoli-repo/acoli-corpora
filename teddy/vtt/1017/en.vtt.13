00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
That is the nation-state mentality.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
But you can't run a country like China,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
a civilization-state,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
on the basis of one civilization, one system.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It doesn't work.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So actually the response of China

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to the question of Hong Kong --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
as it will be to the question of Taiwan --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
was a natural response:

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
one civilization, many systems.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Let me offer you another building block

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
to try and understand China --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
maybe not sort of a comfortable one.
