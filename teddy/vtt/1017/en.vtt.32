00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
the Goldman Sachs chart.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
What is happening

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
is that, very rapidly in historical terms,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
the world is being driven

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and shaped,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
not by the old developed countries,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000

in terms of the G20

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000

First, the West

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
is rapidly losing
