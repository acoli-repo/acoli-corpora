00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
This is as close as China gets

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
to a kind of spiritual role.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And the second reason is because,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
whereas in Europe

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and North America,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
the state's power is continuously challenged --

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I mean in the European tradition,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
historically against the church,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
against other sectors of the aristocracy,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
against merchants and so on --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
for 1,000 years,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
the power of the Chinese state

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
has not been challenged.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
It's had no serious rivals.
