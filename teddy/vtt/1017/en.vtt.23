00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
in the West.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
in the Chinese context,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
is a new kind of paradigm,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
which is different from anything

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
we've had to think about in the past.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Know that China believes in the market and the state.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I mean, Adam Smith,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
already writing in the late 18th century, said,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
"The Chinese market is larger and more developed

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and more sophisticated

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
than anything in Europe."

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And, apart from the Mao period,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that has remained more or less the case ever since.
