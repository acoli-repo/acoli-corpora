00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Of course we know China's big, huge,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
demographically and geographically,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
with a population of 1.3 billion people.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
What we often aren't really aware of

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
is the fact

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that China is extremely diverse

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and very pluralistic,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and in many ways very decentralized.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
even though we think this to be the case.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It's never been the case.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So this is China, a civilization-state,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
rather than a nation-state.
