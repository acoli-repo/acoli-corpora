00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
this is the reason.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Unfortunately, I think,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I have to say that I think

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
attitude towards China

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
It's kind of arrogant.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
It's arrogant in the sense

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
that we think that we are best,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and therefore we have the universal measure.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And secondly, it's ignorant.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
We refuse to really address

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
the issue of difference.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
You know, there's a very interesting passage

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
in a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian.
