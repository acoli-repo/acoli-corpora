00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:34.445
And we discovered that the groups
that include highly confident grays

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.962
are much more likely to reach consensus.

00:05:36.986 --> 00:05:39.464
We do not know yet exactly why this is.

00:05:39.488 --> 00:05:41.251
These are only the first experiments,

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:44.687
and many more will be needed
to understand why and how

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.533
some people decide to negotiate
their moral standings

00:05:47.557 --> 00:05:49.079
to reach an agreement.

00:05:49.103 --> 00:05:51.572
Now, when groups reach consensus,

00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:53.182
how do they do so?

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:55.787
The most intuitive idea
is that it's just the average

00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:57.841
of all the answers in the group, right?

00:05:57.865 --> 00:06:01.438
Another option is that the group
weighs the strength of each vote
