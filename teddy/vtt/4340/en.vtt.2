that foster a more thoughtful
and reasonable exchange of information.

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:04.592
To test this idea,

00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:07.863
we recently performed an experiment
in Buenos Aires, Argentina,

00:01:07.887 --> 00:01:10.892
with more than 10,000
participants in a TEDx event.

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:12.948
We asked them questions like,

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.925
"What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?"

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:17.676
and "How many times

in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?"

00:01:20.024 --> 00:01:22.315
Each person wrote down their own estimate.

00:01:22.774 --> 00:01:25.270
Then we divided the crowd
into groups of five,

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:28.020
and invited them
to come up with a group answer.

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:31.492
We discovered that averaging
the answers of the groups
