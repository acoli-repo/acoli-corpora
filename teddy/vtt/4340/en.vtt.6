Nevertheless, the researcher
decides to follow the protocol

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:02.341
and restart the AI.

00:03:02.943 --> 00:03:05.722
What the researcher did is ____?

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:08.670
MS: And we asked participants
to individually judge

00:03:08.694 --> 00:03:10.378
on a scale from zero to 10

00:03:10.402 --> 00:03:12.831
whether the action described
in each of the dilemmas

00:03:12.855 --> 00:03:14.351

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.597
This was the second dilemma:

00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:24.823
(MS) A company offers a service
that takes a fertilized egg

00:03:24.847 --> 00:03:28.489

with slight genetic variations.

00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:31.851
This allows parents
to select their child's height,
