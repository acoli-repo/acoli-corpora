00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:31.062
Right now, the way we typically
make our voice heard in many societies

00:07:31.086 --> 00:07:32.994
is through direct or indirect voting.

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.492
This is good for diversity of opinions,

00:07:35.516 --> 00:07:37.961
and it has the great virtue of ensuring

00:07:37.985 --> 00:07:40.440
that everyone gets to express their voice.

00:07:40.464 --> 00:07:44.199
But it's not so good [for fostering]
thoughtful debates.

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:47.733
Our experiments suggest a different method

00:07:47.757 --> 00:07:51.298
that may be effective in balancing
these two goals at the same time,

00:07:51.322 --> 00:07:55.075
by forming small groups
that converge to a single decision

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:57.333
while still maintaining
diversity of opinions

00:07:57.357 --> 00:08:00.130
because there are many independent groups.
