00:06:57.407 --> 00:07:00.148
Groups gave much less weight
to the outliers,

of the individual answers.

00:07:05.356 --> 00:07:07.347
The most remarkable thing

00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:10.558
is that this was a spontaneous
behavior of the group.

00:07:10.582 --> 00:07:15.057
It happened without us giving them
any hint on how to reach consensus.

00:07:15.513 --> 00:07:17.053
So where do we go from here?

00:07:17.432 --> 00:07:20.569
This is only the beginning,
but we already have some insights.

00:07:20.984 --> 00:07:23.901
Good collective decisions
require two components:

00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:26.674
deliberation and diversity of opinions.

00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:31.062
Right now, the way we typically
make our voice heard in many societies
