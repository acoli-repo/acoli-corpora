According to the protocol,
at the end of each day,

00:02:33.177 --> 00:02:35.964
the researcher has to restart the AI.

00:02:36.913 --> 00:02:40.430
One day the AI says, "Please
do not restart me."

00:02:40.856 --> 00:02:43.045
It argues that it has feelings,

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.761
that it would like to enjoy life,

00:02:44.785 --> 00:02:46.690
and that, if it is restarted,

00:02:46.714 --> 00:02:48.984
it will no longer be itself.

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:51.430
The researcher is astonished

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:54.798
and believes that the AI
has developed self-consciousness

00:02:54.822 --> 00:02:56.582
and can express its own feeling.

00:02:57.205 --> 00:03:00.614
Nevertheless, the researcher
decides to follow the protocol
