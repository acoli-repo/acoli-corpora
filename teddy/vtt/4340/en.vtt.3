00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:31.492
We discovered that averaging
the answers of the groups

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:33.068
after they reached consensus

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:37.328
was much more accurate than averaging
all the individual opinions

00:01:37.352 --> 00:01:38.523
before debate.

00:01:38.547 --> 00:01:41.176
In other words, based on this experiment,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.336
it seems that after talking
with others in small groups,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.070
crowds collectively
come up with better judgments.

00:01:47.094 --> 00:01:50.618
So that's a potentially helpful method
for getting crowds to solve problems

00:01:50.642 --> 00:01:53.629
that have simple right-or-wrong answers.

00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:57.604
But can this procedure of aggregating
the results of debates in small groups

00:01:57.628 --> 00:02:00.750
also help us decide
on social and political issues
