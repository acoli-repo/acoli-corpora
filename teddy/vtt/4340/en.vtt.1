00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:33.016
On the other hand, by talking,
a group could exchange knowledge,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.822
correct and revise each other

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:36.639
and even come up with new ideas.

00:00:36.663 --> 00:00:37.959
And this is all good.

00:00:38.502 --> 00:00:43.168
So does talking to each other
help or hinder collective decision-making?

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:45.542
With my colleague, Dan Ariely,

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:49.137
we recently began inquiring into this
by performing experiments

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:50.942
in many places around the world

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:55.240
to figure out how groups can interact
to reach better decisions.

00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:58.811
We thought crowds would be wiser
if they debated in small groups

00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:02.762
that foster a more thoughtful
and reasonable exchange of information.
