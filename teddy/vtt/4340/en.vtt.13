00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.700
let's say a group has these answers:

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:36.332
250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400

00:06:36.356 --> 00:06:40.140
and one totally absurd answer
of 300 million meters.

00:06:40.547 --> 00:06:44.840
A simple average of these numbers
would inaccurately skew the results.

00:06:44.864 --> 00:06:48.034
But the robust average is one
where the group largely ignores

00:06:48.058 --> 00:06:49.298
that absurd answer,

00:06:49.322 --> 00:06:52.691
by giving much more weight
to the vote of the people in the middle.

00:06:53.305 --> 00:06:55.181
Back to the experiment in Vancouver,

00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:56.972
that's exactly what happened.

00:06:57.407 --> 00:07:00.148
Groups gave much less weight
to the outliers,
