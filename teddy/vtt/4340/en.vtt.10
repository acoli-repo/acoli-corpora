00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:03.554
Instead, those who respond
closer to the middle

00:05:03.578 --> 00:05:07.015
are often unsure of whether
something is right or wrong,

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.167
so their confidence level is lower.

00:05:09.505 --> 00:05:12.448
However, there is another set of people

00:05:12.472 --> 00:05:16.090
who are very confident in answering
somewhere in the middle.

00:05:16.657 --> 00:05:20.373
We think these high-confident grays
are folks who understand

00:05:20.397 --> 00:05:22.009
that both arguments have merit.

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:25.230
They're gray not because they're unsure,

00:05:25.254 --> 00:05:27.942
but because they believe
that the moral dilemma faces

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:29.953
two valid, opposing arguments.
