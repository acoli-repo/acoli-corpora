Another option is that the group
weighs the strength of each vote

00:06:01.462 --> 00:06:03.910
based on the confidence
of the person expressing it.

Imagine Paul McCartney
is a member of your group.

00:06:07.352 --> 00:06:09.496
You'd be wise to follow his call

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.961
on the number of times

which, by the way -- I think it's nine.

00:06:14.723 --> 00:06:17.104
But instead, we found that consistently,

00:06:19.518 --> 00:06:21.683
even on different continents --

00:06:21.707 --> 00:06:25.450

00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:29.856
In the case of the height

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.700
