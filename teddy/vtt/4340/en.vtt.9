00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:31.219
(Audience debates)

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.222
(Gong sound)

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:39.985
(DA) OK.

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.801
(MS) It's time to stop.

00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:43.136
People, people --

00:04:43.747 --> 00:04:46.420
MS: And we found that many groups
reached a consensus

00:04:46.444 --> 00:04:50.373
even when they were composed of people
with completely opposite views.

00:04:50.843 --> 00:04:53.367
What distinguished the groups
that reached a consensus

00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:54.729
from those that didn't?

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:58.083
Typically, people that have
extreme opinions

00:04:58.107 --> 00:04:59.947
are more confident in their answers.
