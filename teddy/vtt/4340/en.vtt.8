This is how diverse we humans are
when it comes to morality.

00:04:01.476 --> 00:04:04.189
But within this broad diversity
we found a trend.

00:04:04.213 --> 00:04:07.292
The majority of the people at TED
thought that it was acceptable

00:04:07.316 --> 00:04:10.071
to ignore the feelings of the AI
and shut it down,

00:04:10.095 --> 00:04:12.608
and that it is wrong
to play with our genes

00:04:12.632 --> 00:04:15.952
to select for cosmetic changes
that aren't related to health.

00:04:16.402 --> 00:04:19.376
Then we asked everyone
to gather into groups of three.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.437
And they were given two minutes to debate

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.755
and try to come to a consensus.

00:04:24.838 --> 00:04:26.412
(MS) Two minutes to debate.

00:04:26.436 --> 00:04:28.555
I'll tell you when it's time
with the gong.

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:31.219
(Audience debates)
