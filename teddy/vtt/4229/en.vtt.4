00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
best characterized as, what's the finance term? Ick pooey.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Let me give you an example of this. The year is 1976,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The next year they march forward and they introduce Qube,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the first interactive cable TV system,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the New York Times heralds this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
as telecommunications moving to the home,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
convergence, great things are happening.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Everybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures --

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Citicorp, Penney, RCA -- all getting into this big vision.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
By the way, this is about when I enter the picture.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm going to do a summer internship at Time Warner.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
That summer I'm all -- I'm at Warner that summer --
