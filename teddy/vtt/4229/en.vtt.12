00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
say at the end of 40 seconds, the amount of fuel remaining,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and the velocity at that set instant.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
JF: Over on the left-hand side,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And on the right-hand side, there's a scale

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
that shows the rocket's velocity.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that we're now looking at.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
the velocity, you will notice, has dropped off to a minimum.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Then, as the rocket dives down, velocity picks up again
