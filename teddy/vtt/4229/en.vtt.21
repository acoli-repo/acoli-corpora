00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But it gives you the kind of power that people have, that the audience has,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and the reasons these transformations are happening.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
All of this stuff starts moving into industry.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It shows up at places like MIT, and then a mutation happens.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Spacewar! is built, the first computer game, and all of a sudden,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Actually, many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
DEC knew a good thing about wasting time.
