00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
You saw how huge it was, and to give you a sense for this --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
because we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things small

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
at this conference, so let's talk about making things large.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
If we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
say, Century City, it would fit beautifully.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
You'd kind of have to take Century City out, but it could fit in there.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But like, let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the latest Core 2 Extreme, which is a four-core processor

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
that Intel's working on, it will be our laptop tomorrow.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
To build that, what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is
