00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
why don't we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and let the Navy's research chief, Admiral Bolster,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
give Whirlwind the workout?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Calvin Bolster: Well, Ed, this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
This rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Now, at the standard rate of fuel consumption,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and see how it can determine, at any instant,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
say at the end of 40 seconds, the amount of fuel remaining,
