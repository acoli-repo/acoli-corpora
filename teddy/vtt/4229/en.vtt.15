00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
deploy it all across the frozen north,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and spend nearly three times as much on this computer

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
as was spent on the Manhattan Project

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
building the A-Bomb in the first place.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Here's their marketing video.
