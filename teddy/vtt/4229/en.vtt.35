00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
How the '60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry."

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
The title was taken from the lyrics

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
to a Jefferson Airplane song. The lyrics go,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
"Remember what the dormouse said.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Feed your head, feed your head, feed your head." (Music)
