Journalist: Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Forrester and the MIT lab.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
PH: You know, so much was worked out: the first real-time interaction,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the video display, pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
but unfortunately, it was too pricey for the Navy,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and all of this would have been lost

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
if it weren't for a happy coincidence.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Enter the atomic bomb.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and knowing a good thing when it sees it,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us.
