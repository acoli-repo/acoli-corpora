That summer I'm all -- I'm at Warner that summer --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'm all excited to work on convergence, and then the bottom falls out.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Doesn't work out too well for them, they lose money.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And I had a happy brush with convergence

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
until, kind of, Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
That's when I leave graduate school, and I can't work in New York

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
on kind of entertainment and technology

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
because I have to be exiled to California, where the remaining jobs are,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
almost to the sea, to go to work for Apple Computer.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Warner, of course, writes off more than 400 million dollars.
