at Stanford University, between 1960 and 1975.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
In the midst of revolution in the streets

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and rock and roll concerts in the parks,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
a group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
but while he was beginning to do his work,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
There was LSD leaking out of Kesey's Veterans' Hospital experiments
