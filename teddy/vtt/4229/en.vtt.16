00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
(Video) Narrator: In a mass raid, high-speed bombers could be in on us

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
before we could determine their tracks.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And then it would be too late to act.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
We cannot afford to take that chance.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
It is to meet this threat that the Air Force has been developing SAGE,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to strengthen our air defenses.
