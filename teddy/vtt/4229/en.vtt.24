(Video) Jack Berry: Boys and girls, I think you all know how to get your magic windows

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
up on the set, you just get them out.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
First of all, get your Winky Dink kits out.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Put out your Magic Window and your erasing glove, and rub it like this.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
That's the way we get some of the magic into it, boys and girls.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and rub it out from the center to the corners, like this.
