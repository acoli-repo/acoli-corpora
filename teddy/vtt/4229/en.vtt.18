There's an interesting marketing lesson from it,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
which is basically, when you market a product,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
you can either say, this is going to be wonderful,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
it will make you feel better and enliven you.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Or there's one other marketing proposition: if you don't use our product, you'll die.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This is a really good example of that.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
This had the first pointing device. It was distributed,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
so all these things could talk to each other.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
About 20 percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes.
