RCA had David Sarnoff, who basically commercialized radio,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
said this, "I don't say that radio networks must die.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Every effort has been made and will continue to be made

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
to find a new pattern, new selling arrangements

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
but I don't know how."

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And of course, as the computer industry develops interactively,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
producers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And they fake it.
