00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, good morning.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You know, the computer and television both recently turned 60,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and today I'd like to talk about their relationship.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Despite their middle age, if you've been following the themes

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
of this conference or the entertainment industry,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
it's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So it's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or why the invention of the atomic bomb

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
unleashed forces that lead to the writers' strike.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And it's not just what these are doing to each other,
