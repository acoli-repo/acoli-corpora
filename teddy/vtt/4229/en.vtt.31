00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
But all that was about to change.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
You know, the expression of technology

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
it's not just a joke about messianism, it's actually what we do.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
But for this part of the story, I'd actually like to throw it

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
to America's leading technology correspondent, John Markoff.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
(Video) John Markoff: Do you want to know what the counterculture

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
in drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll and the anti-war movement

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
had to do with computing? Everything.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
It all happened within five miles of where I'm standing,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
at Stanford University, between 1960 and 1975.
