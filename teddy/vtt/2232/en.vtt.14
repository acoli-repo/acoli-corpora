reliability and integrity of information

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.708
is just critical for operations.

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.726
For instance,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.059
if someone changes
your medical health record,

00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:11.101
let's say allergies,

00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:13.684
without you or your doctor knowing,

00:07:13.708 --> 00:07:15.750
treatment could be deadly.

00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:20.518
That's why in a digital society,
a system like an Estonian one,

00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:23.309
when there's almost no paper originals,

00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:26.934
there's almost only digital originals,

00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.059
integrity of data,

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.934
data exchange rules, software components
