00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:01.059
I'm looking at the tax return amount.

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:05.393
It actually feels like
a quite rewarding experience.

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.434
No tax advisors,

00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:09.726
no collecting receipts,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.292
no doing the math.

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:15.393
And have I mentioned
that I have not visited a state office

00:02:15.417 --> 00:02:16.958
for almost seven years?

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:21.976
Indeed, one of the features
of the modern life

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.184
that has no reason to exist anymore,

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:27.018
considering technological
possibilities of today,

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:29.684
is the labyrinth of bureaucracy.

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:32.351
We've almost got rid of it
completely in Estonia,
