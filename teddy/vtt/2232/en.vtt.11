00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:32.393
making sure we avoid
centralization of data,

00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:34.184
duplication of data,

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:37.208
and guarantee that it's
actually up to date.

00:05:38.792 --> 00:05:42.268
This distributed approach
also avoids the problem

00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:45.059
of the single point of failure.

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:48.226
But since the data cannot be replicated,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.351
or collected more than once,

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:53.309
it means that the design
has to keep in mind

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:56.851
secure and robust access
to that information at all times,

00:05:56.875 --> 00:06:00.083
so the public institution
can offer a service.
