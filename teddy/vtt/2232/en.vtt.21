00:10:29.583 --> 00:10:31.226
We survived.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:36.476
But this event put cybersecurity
at the very top of agenda,

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.917
both in terms of strengthening
the platform and backing it up.

00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:46.518
So how do you back up
a country-wide system in a small state

00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:48.667
where everything is super close?

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.768
Well for instance,
you can export a copy of the data

00:10:53.792 --> 00:10:55.893
outside the country territory

00:10:55.917 --> 00:10:59.542
to an extraterritorial
space of an embassy.
