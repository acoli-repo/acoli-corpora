such as childbirth, unemployment
or starting a business.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.518
Now, of course,

00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:07.851
running a digital society
with no paper backup

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:09.417
can be an issue, right?

00:10:10.417 --> 00:10:13.434
Even though we trust
our systems to be solid,

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:18.768
but one can never be too cautious
as we experienced back in 2007,

00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:22.559
when the first cyberincident happened,

00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:25.309
and it literally blocked
part of our networks,

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.667
making access to the services
impossible for hours.

00:10:29.583 --> 00:10:31.226
We survived.
