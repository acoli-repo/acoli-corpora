so the public institution
can offer a service.

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:05.559
This is exactly the role
of the data exchange platform

00:06:05.583 --> 00:06:07.768
called the X-Road

00:06:07.792 --> 00:06:10.708
that has been in use since 2001.

00:06:11.708 --> 00:06:13.351
Just like a highway,

00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:17.018
it connects public sector
databases and registries,

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:19.851
local municipalities and businesses,

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:25.309
organizing a real-time, secure
and regulated data exchange,

00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:29.542
saving an auditable trace after each move.
