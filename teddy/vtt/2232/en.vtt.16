Aren't you worried by the fact
that governments, tech companies

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:14.018

00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:17.434
claim data they've collected
about you is theirs,

00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:21.601
generally refuse to give access
to that information,

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:24.976
and often fail to prove how it was used

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.167
or shared with third parties?
