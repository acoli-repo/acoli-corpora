00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.809
Almost 30 years ago,

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:06.750
my country was facing the need
to rebuild everything from scratch.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.518
After years of Soviet occupation,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:13.768
Estonia regained its independence,
but we were left with nothing.

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:18.226
No infrastructure,
no administration, no legal code.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.125
Organizational chaos.

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:21.976

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.434

had to make some daring choices.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.018

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:30.934
There was a lot of
experimentation and uncertainty
