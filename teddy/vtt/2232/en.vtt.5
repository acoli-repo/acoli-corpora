We've almost got rid of it
completely in Estonia,

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:36.518
in an effort coordinated by the government
that has also digitized itself.

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:41.458
For instance, cabinet of ministers' work
in e-Cabinet is absolutely paperless.

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:46.476
The central idea behind this development

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.184
is transformation of the state role

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:52.125
and digitalization of trust.

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:54.101
Think about it.

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:57.976
In most countries, people
don't trust their governments.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.059
And the governments don't trust them back.
