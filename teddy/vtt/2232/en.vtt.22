00:11:00.542 --> 00:11:03.851
Today, we have those data embassies

00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:08.309
that are holding the most critical
digital assets of Estonia,

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:11.393
guaranteeing continuity of operations,

00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:12.934
protection of our data,

00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.226
and most importantly, our sovereignty.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.250
Even in case of a physical attack
on our territory.

00:11:22.042 --> 00:11:24.018
Some of you might be thinking by now:

00:11:24.042 --> 00:11:25.958
Where are the downsides?

00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:29.559
Well, going all digital

00:11:29.583 --> 00:11:34.851
is administratively, and let's be honest,
financially more efficient.
