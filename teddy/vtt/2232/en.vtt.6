And all the complicated
paper-based formal procedures

00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:06.851
are supposed to solve that problem.

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:09.143
Except that they don't.

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:12.393
They just make life more complicated.

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:17.101
I believe Estonian experience is showing
that technology can be the remedy

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:18.934
for getting the trust back,

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.934
while creating an efficient,

00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.976
user-centric service delivery system

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.458
that actively responds to citizens' needs.

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:33.768
We did not do it by digitizing
bureaucracy as it is.
