There was a lot of
experimentation and uncertainty

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.768
but also a bit of luck involved,

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:35.434
particularly in the fact
that we could count on a number

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:37.018
of brilliant visionaries,

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:40.184
cryptographers and engineers.

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:42.476
I was just a kid back then.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.792
Today, we are called
the most digital society on earth.

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:49.434
I'm from Estonia,

00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:53.559
and we've been declaring
taxes online since 2001.

00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:58.309
We have been using digital identity
and signature since 2002.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:01.684
We've been voting online since 2005.
