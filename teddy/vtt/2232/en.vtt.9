When the system can properly
and securely identify who is using it,

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:37.018
after logging in, it will provide access
to the personal data of the citizen

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:40.809
and all the public services
within one tool,

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:44.625
and allow to authorize anything
by signing digitally.

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:50.226
A second principle,
and one of the most transformative,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.268
is called "Once only."

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:57.184
It means that the state
cannot ask for the same data

00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:59.059
more than once,

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:02.893
nor can store it in more than one place.
