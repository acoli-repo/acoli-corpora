I don't know, for me it seems
like a quite disturbing situation.

00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:37.684
The Estonian system
is based on the principle

00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:42.226
that an individual is the owner
of the data collected about him,

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.309
thus has an absolute right
to know what information is collected

00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:50.184
and who has been accessing it.

00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:54.309
Every time a policeman,
a doctor or any state officer

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:57.893
is accessing personal information
of the citizens online,

00:08:57.917 --> 00:09:02.309
first they only get to access it
after logging in
