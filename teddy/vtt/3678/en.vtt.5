00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:30.871
One day, I came across
the phrase "affirmative action"

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:32.206
in a book I was reading.

00:02:33.377 --> 00:02:36.004
And when I asked her what the term meant,

00:02:36.028 --> 00:02:38.147
she spent what felt like an hour

00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:40.369
giving me a thorough
and thoughtful explanation

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:42.297
that would make sense to a small child.

00:02:42.792 --> 00:02:46.364
She even made the topic sound
at least as interesting

00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:48.035
as any of my professors have.

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:53.172
She explained the many reasons
why people of various political views

00:02:53.196 --> 00:02:55.378
challenge and support affirmative action,

00:02:55.823 --> 00:02:59.688
stressing that, while she strongly
supported it herself,

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:03.123
it was important for me to view the issue
as a controversial one
