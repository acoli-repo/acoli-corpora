My work also hurt the feelings of many,

00:06:30.536 --> 00:06:31.733
and I understood that.

00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:35.740
Of course, no one likes being offended,

00:06:35.764 --> 00:06:38.914
and I certainly don't like hearing
controversial speakers

00:06:38.938 --> 00:06:42.321
argue that feminism has become
a war against men

00:06:42.345 --> 00:06:44.727
or that blacks have lower IQs than whites.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.177
I also understand

00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:52.107
that some people have experienced
traumatic experiences in their lives.

00:06:53.688 --> 00:06:56.759
And for some, listening to offensive views

00:06:56.783 --> 00:07:00.984
can be like reliving the very traumas
that they've worked so hard to overcome.
