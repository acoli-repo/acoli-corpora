In 1994,

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:08.047
Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein
coauthored "The Bell Curve,"

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:10.172
an extremely controversial book

00:00:10.196 --> 00:00:12.117
which claims that on average,

00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:15.624
some races are smarter
and more likely to succeed than others.

00:00:16.117 --> 00:00:18.807
Murray and Herrnstein also suggest

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:23.423
that a lack of critical intelligence
explains the prominence of violent crime

00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:25.894
in poor African-American communities.

00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:31.587
But Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein
are not the only people who think this.
