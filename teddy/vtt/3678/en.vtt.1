00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:37.714
a writer, journalist and political
commentator named John Derbyshire

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:42.077
wrote an article that was supposed to be
a non-black version of the talk

00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:45.379
that many black parents feel
they have to give their kids today:

00:00:45.403 --> 00:00:47.423
advice on how to stay safe.

00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:54.983
"Do not attend events
likely to draw a lot of blacks,"

00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:57.277
"Stay out of heavily black neighborhoods"

00:00:57.847 --> 00:01:00.975
and "Do not act the Good Samaritan
to blacks in distress."
