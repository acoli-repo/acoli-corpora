00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.726
when I think about the individual
interactions that I've been able to have

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.910
with students who both support
the work that I'm doing

00:09:06.934 --> 00:09:10.059
and who feel challenged by it
and who do not support it.

00:09:11.447 --> 00:09:12.610
What I've found is that,

00:09:12.634 --> 00:09:15.545
while it can be difficult to change
the values of a community,

00:09:15.569 --> 00:09:18.632
we can gain a lot
from individual interactions.

00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:22.727
While I didn't get to engage
with John Derbyshire

00:09:22.751 --> 00:09:24.848
due to my president's disinvitation,

00:09:24.872 --> 00:09:28.948
I was able to have dinner
with Charles Murray before his talk.
