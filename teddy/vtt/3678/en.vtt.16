00:08:00.275 --> 00:08:01.715
But soon after I announced

00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:04.537
that John Derbyshire
would be speaking on campus,

00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:07.537
student backlash erupted on social media.

00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:10.236
The tide of resistance,
in fact, was so intense,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.998
that my college president
rescinded the invitation.

00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:16.696
I was deeply disappointed by this
because, as I saw it,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.482
there would be nothing
that any of my peers or I could do

00:08:20.506 --> 00:08:22.585
to silence someone who agreed with him

00:08:22.609 --> 00:08:25.267
in the office environment
of our future employers.

00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:29.130
I look out at what's happening
on college campuses,

00:08:29.154 --> 00:08:30.321
and I see the anger.
