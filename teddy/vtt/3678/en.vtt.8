00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.149
As a black student attending
predominantly white private schools,

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:04.109
I've encountered attitudes and behaviors
that reflected racial stereotypes.

00:04:05.157 --> 00:04:09.521
Several of my friends' parents
assumed within minutes of meeting me

00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:12.345
that my best skill was playing basketball.

00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:16.536
And it really upset me to think
that my race made it harder for them

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.391
to see me as a student who loved
reading, writing and speaking.

00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:25.077
Experiences like this motivated me
to work tirelessly

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.465
to disprove what I knew
people had assumed.
