00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.171
I knew the conversation
would be difficult.

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:35.045
And I didn't expect it to be pleasant.

00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:39.361
But it was cordial, and I did gain
a deeper understanding of his arguments.

00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:45.390
I found that he, like me,
believed in creating a more just society.

00:09:46.224 --> 00:09:50.192
The thing is, his understanding
of what justice entailed

00:09:50.216 --> 00:09:51.820
was very different from my own.

00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:55.549
The way in which he wanted
to understand the issue,

00:09:55.573 --> 00:09:58.503
the way in which he wanted
to approach the issue of inequality

00:09:58.527 --> 00:10:00.260
also differed from my own.
