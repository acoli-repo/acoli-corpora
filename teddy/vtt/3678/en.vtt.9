My mother even said that,
in order to put my best foot forward,

00:04:34.514 --> 00:04:38.029

and excruciatingly well-mannered.

00:04:38.053 --> 00:04:42.299
To prove that I belonged,
I had to show poise and confidence,

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.998
the ability to speak well
and listen closely.

00:04:45.022 --> 00:04:48.099
Only then would my peers see
that I deserved to be there

00:04:48.123 --> 00:04:49.456
as much as they did.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:54.264
Despite this racial stereotyping
and the discomfort I often felt,

00:04:55.387 --> 00:04:59.578
the learning I gained from other aspects
of being at an elite private school

00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:00.996
were incredibly valuable.
