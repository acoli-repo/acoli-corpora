By engaging with controversial
and offensive ideas,

00:07:31.244 --> 00:07:33.593
I believe that we can find common ground,

00:07:34.403 --> 00:07:37.339
if not with the speakers themselves,

00:07:37.363 --> 00:07:40.296
then with the audiences
they may attract or indoctrinate.

00:07:41.268 --> 00:07:46.506
Through engaging, I believe
that we may reach a better understanding,

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.998
a deeper understanding,

00:07:48.022 --> 00:07:49.673
of our own beliefs

00:07:49.697 --> 00:07:52.395
and preserve the ability
to solve problems,

00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:56.085
which we can't do
if we don't talk to each other

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:58.776
and make an effort to be good listeners.
