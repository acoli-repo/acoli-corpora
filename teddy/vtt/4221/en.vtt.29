I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Another thing is, maybe we need a treaty.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
A treaty that decides who gets to do this.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Right now we may think of a big, rich country like the U.S. doing this.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
But it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
that the climate impacts are just unacceptable,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered world

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
than a non-geo-engineered world.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision.
