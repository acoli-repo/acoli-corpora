A debate that involves musicians, scientists, philosophers, writers,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
who get engaged with this question about climate engineering

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and think seriously about what its implications are.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So here's one way to think about it,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It's not a good idea, but it's just important. (Laughter)

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big.
