the oceans in the next 100 years,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and remove some of the biggest cities from the map.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
That's an absolutely possible scenario.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
We might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And that's a very different way to look at the problem.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It's using this as risk control, not instead of action.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
It's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to take the worst of the heat off, not that you'd use it as a substitute for action.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But there is a problem with that view.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And the problem is the following:

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes
