00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The fact is -- uh-uh.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We've known about this problem for 50 years, depending on how you count it.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And we've accomplished close to zip.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You've seen this in various forms,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but maybe you haven't seen this one.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And that it's accelerating even faster

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said
