00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Should we have a national research program that looks at this?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Not just at how you would do it better,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
but also what all the risks and downsides of it are.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
some in a negative side -- but that's a dangerous state to be in

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
A very small amount of money would get us some.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But I have a lot of reservations.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.
