00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
because, of course, while we can adapt to climate change --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Oh, yes, I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
But, of course, the natural world, polar bears.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
They will completely lose.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And there's no adaption.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So this problem is absolutely soluble.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
This geo-engineering idea, in it's simplest form, is basically the following.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
You could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates --
