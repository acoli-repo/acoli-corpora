It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But in the last year, Paul Crutzen published this essay

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
saying roughly what's all been said before: that maybe, given our very slow rate

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
we should think about things like this.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
He said roughly what's been said before.

The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away.

There was all sorts of press coverage, all over the world,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
going right down to "Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth," from the Economist.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off,
