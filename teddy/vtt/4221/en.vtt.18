00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
it's amazing how we can affect the planet.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This improved science and engineering will, whether we like it or not,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
give us more and more leverage to affect the planet,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
to control the planet,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to give us weather and climate control -- not because we plan it,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
not because we want it, just because science delivers it to us bit by bit,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
with better knowledge of the way the system works

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and better engineering tools to effect it.
