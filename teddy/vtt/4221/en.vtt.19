00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and better engineering tools to effect it.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Now, suppose that space aliens arrived.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot --

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
but suppose they arrive and they give you a box.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And the box has two knobs.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
We have no global governance.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And different people will have different places they want it set.
