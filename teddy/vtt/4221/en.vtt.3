burning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
in fact, you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
because it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel. (Laughter)

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
No, no! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
this very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we've really hardly started.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Really, we're doing this, basically. Really, not very much.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I don't want to depress you too much.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care.
