00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No, this is really important to have this sense of scale.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So the problem is soluble, and the way we should go about solving it is, say,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
dealing with electricity production,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
which causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work.
