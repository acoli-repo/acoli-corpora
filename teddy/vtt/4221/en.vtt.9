00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
like slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
because concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
is the sum of emissions over time.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So you can't step on the brakes very quickly.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But if you do this, it's quick.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And there are times you might like to do something quick.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Another thing you might wonder about is, does it work?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally?
