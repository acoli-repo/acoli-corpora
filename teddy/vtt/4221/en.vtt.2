00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the environmentalists only put in the projections

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to make the projections look as bad as possible,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But in fact, they're growing faster.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Here's some data from actually just 10 days ago,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice, and it's the lowest by far.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
burning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
in fact, you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative,
