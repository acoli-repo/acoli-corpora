I'm sure there will be other problems that arise.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Finally, we could make the particles migrate to over the poles,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
where we live, and do the maximum job of what we might need to do,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency, if you like.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
This is a new idea that's crept up that may be, essentially,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I think it's almost certain we will

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in.
