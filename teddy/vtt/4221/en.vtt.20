00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
We have no global governance.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And different people will have different places they want it set.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Now, I don't think that's going to happen. It's not very likely.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
But we're building that box.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
The scientists and engineers of the world

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
are building it piece by piece, in their labs.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Even when they're doing it for other reasons.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it -- I do not --

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously.
