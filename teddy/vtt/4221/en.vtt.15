00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So it seems there are already fine particles

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
that already have this effect.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I'll tell you very quickly how the effect works.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
There are a lot of fun complexities

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
that I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So the side facing the sun is warmer; the side away, cooler.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Gas molecules that bounce off the warm side

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
bounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm.
