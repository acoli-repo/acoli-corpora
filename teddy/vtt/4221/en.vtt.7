You could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
into the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And I know for certain that that will work.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Not that there aren't side effects, but I know for certain it will work.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And the reason is, it's been done.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And it was done not by us, not by me, but by nature.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Here's Mount Pinatubo in the early '90s. That put a whole bunch of sulfur

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The result of that was pretty dramatic.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
After that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you see

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere.
