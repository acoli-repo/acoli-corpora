00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but not so much technically. And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And I thought about this child's toy -- hence, the title of my talk --

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
in the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and make them stay there.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
The other problem is they're right in the ozone layer,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and I'd prefer them above the ozone layer.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
It was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published
