We should, but it made exactly this point.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So, in a sense, there's not much new.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The one new thing is this essay.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So I should say, I guess, that since the time of that original President Johnson report,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy --

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
1977, 1982, 1990 -- people always talked about this idea.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Not as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
But when climate became, politically, a hot topic -- if I may make the pun --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
in the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it.
