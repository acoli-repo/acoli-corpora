00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and eventually reduce concentrations.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And maybe someday -- like 2075, October 23 --

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and are rolling down the other side.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And we have global celebrations, and we've actually started to -- you know,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
we've seen the worst of it.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
is really melting unacceptably fast, fast enough to put meters of sea level on

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
the oceans in the next 100 years,
