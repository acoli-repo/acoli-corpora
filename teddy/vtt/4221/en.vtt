You've all seen lots of articles on climate change,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and here's yet another New York Times article,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
just like every other darn one you've seen.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And the reason I'm saying this

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That people have just sort of figured out about it, and now

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we may be on the road to a solution.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The fact is -- uh-uh.
