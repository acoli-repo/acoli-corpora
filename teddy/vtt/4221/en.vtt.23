It's not a good idea, but it's just important. (Laughter)

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And that calculation isn't much in dispute.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
You might argue about the sanity of it, but the leverage is real. (Laughter)

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So because of this, we could deal with the problem

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
simply by stopping reducing emissions,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and just as the concentrations go up, we can increase

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
the amount of geo-engineering.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I don't think anybody takes that seriously.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Because under this scenario, we walk further and further away
