00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
After that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you see

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and it heats up after these volcanoes.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
But you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphere

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
There's no big mystery about it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
There's lots of mystery in the details, and there's some bad side effects,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
like it partially destroys the ozone layer -- and I'll get to that in a minute.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But it clearly cools down.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And one other thing: it's fast.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
like slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time
