00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And the problem is the following:

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
the climate impacts look less fearsome,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
This is what economists call a moral hazard.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and, in general, I think it's the underlying reason

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I'll leave you with three questions, and then one final quote.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Should we do serious research on this topic?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Should we have a national research program that looks at this?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Not just at how you would do it better,
