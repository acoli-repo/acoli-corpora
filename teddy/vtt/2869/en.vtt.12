Last summer, mosquito control officials
in Dorchester County, South Carolina,

00:06:13.698 --> 00:06:17.603
authorized spraying of Naled,
an insecticide,

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.507
early one morning,
as recommended by the manufacturer.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.205
Later that day, a beekeeper told reporters

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.030
