There were outbreaks in the Cook
Islands, in New Caledonia,

00:03:33.704 --> 00:03:36.124
in Vanuatu, in the Solomon Islands

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:41.036
and almost all the way around to the coast
of South America and Easter Island.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.512
And then, in early 2015,

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:48.901
there was an upsurge of cases
of a dengue-like syndrome

00:03:49.393 --> 00:03:52.821
in the city of Natal
in northeastern Brazil.

00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:58.733
The virus wasn't dengue, it was Zika,
and it spread rapidly --

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:04.797
Recife down the coast, a big metropolitan
center, soon became the epicenter.
