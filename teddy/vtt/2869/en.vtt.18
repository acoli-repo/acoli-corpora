00:08:58.781 --> 00:09:05.126
so that when it mates with a wild female,
its eggs don't develop to adulthood.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.300
Let me show you.

00:09:06.657 --> 00:09:09.181
This is the normal reproductive cycle.

00:09:09.895 --> 00:09:14.141
Oxitec designed the mosquito so that
when the male mates with the wild female

00:09:15.077 --> 00:09:16.283
the eggs don't develop.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.200
Sounds impossible?

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.152
Well let me show you
just diagrammatically how they do it.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.992
Now this represents the nucleus
of a mosquito cell,

00:09:26.016 --> 00:09:28.968
and that tangle in the middle
represents its genome,

00:09:28.992 --> 00:09:31.492
the sum total of its genes.
