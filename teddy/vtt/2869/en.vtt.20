Tetracycline shuts off that gene
and allows normal development.

00:10:02.024 --> 00:10:06.357
They added another little wrinkle
so that they could study what happens.

00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:13.144
And that is they added a gene
that makes the insect glow under UV light

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:16.978
so that when they released it
they could follow exactly how far it went

00:10:17.002 --> 00:10:20.756
how long it lived
and all of the kinds of data

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.272
for a good scientific study.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.308
Now this is the pupal stage,
and at this stage

00:10:27.286 --> 00:10:30.007
the females are larger than the males.
