literally by the hundreds of millions
from little airplanes,

eventually eliminating
that terrible insect pest

00:08:06.682 --> 00:08:08.760
for most of the Western Hemisphere.

00:08:10.175 --> 00:08:12.579
Our real purpose in writing this editorial

00:08:12.603 --> 00:08:15.587
was to introduce readers
to how we can do that today --

00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:20.054
not with radiation
but with our knowledge of genetics.

00:08:20.078 --> 00:08:21.228
Let me explain.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.386
This is the bad guy: Aedes aegypti.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:29.071
It's the most common insect
vector of diseases,

00:08:29.095 --> 00:08:32.889
not just Zika but dengue,
Chikungunya, West Nile virus
