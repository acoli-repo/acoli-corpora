00:04:27.763 --> 00:04:31.180
The virus is being locally transmitted
by mosquitoes

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:34.465
virtually throughout South America,
Central America, Mexico

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:35.910
and the Caribbean Islands

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.067
Until this year, the many
thousands of cases

00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:43.910
that have been diagnosed in the US
were contracted elsewhere.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:50.234
But as of this summer, it's being
transmitted locally in Miami.

00:04:50.258 --> 00:04:51.499
It's here.

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:52.808
So what do we do about it?

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.543
Well, preventing infection

00:04:58.035 --> 00:05:01.892
is either about protecting people
or about eliminating the mosquitoes.
