00:09:28.992 --> 00:09:31.492
the sum total of its genes.

00:09:31.516 --> 00:09:34.865
Scientists added a single gene

00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:39.198
that codes for a protein represented
by this orange ball

00:09:39.222 --> 00:09:44.714
that feeds back on itself
to keep cranking out more of that protein.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.993
The extra copies, however,
go and gum up the mosquitoes' genes,

00:09:50.017 --> 00:09:51.295
killing the organism.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.128
To keep it alive in the laboratory
they use a compound called tetracycline.

00:09:56.636 --> 00:10:02.000
Tetracycline shuts off that gene
and allows normal development.
