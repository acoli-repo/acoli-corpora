but with less downsides
than toxic chemicals?

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.821
I'm a huge fan of biological controls,

00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:12.338
and I share that view with Rachel Carson,
author of "Silent Spring,"

00:07:12.362 --> 00:07:17.376
the book that is credited with starting
the environmental movement.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.956
In this book she tells the story,
as an example,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.638
of how a very nasty insect
pest of livestock

00:07:26.662 --> 00:07:29.702
was eliminated in the last century.
