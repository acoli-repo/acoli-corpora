Oops.

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.211
Bees are the good guys.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.640
The citizens of Florida protested,
but spraying continued.

00:06:41.251 --> 00:06:45.465
Unfortunately, so did the increase
in the number of Zika fever cases.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.703
That's because insecticides
aren't very effective.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.651
So are there any approaches that are
perhaps more effective than spraying

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.893
but with less downsides
than toxic chemicals?
