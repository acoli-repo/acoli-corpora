No one knows that
extraordinary story today.

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:36.865
So Jack Block and I,
when we were writing an editorial

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:40.103
about the mosquito problem today,
retold that story.

00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:44.793
And in capsule form, it's that pupae --
that's the immature form of the insect --

00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:49.596
were irradiated until they were sterile,
grown to adulthood

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.230
and then released from planes
all over the Southwest,

00:07:53.254 --> 00:07:57.667
the Southeast and down into Mexico
and into Central America

00:07:57.691 --> 00:08:01.500
literally by the hundreds of millions
from little airplanes,
