00:00:01.047 --> 00:00:02.197
Zika fever:

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.826
our newest dread disease.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.846
What is it? Where'd it come from?

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.100
What do we do about it?

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.300
Well for most adults,
it's a relatively mild disease --

00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:20.625
a little fever, a little headache,
joint pain, maybe a rash.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.320
In fact, most people who get it
don't even know they've had it.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.534
But the more we find out
about the Zika virus

00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:30.106
the more terrifying it becomes.
