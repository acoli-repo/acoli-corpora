00:10:27.286 --> 00:10:30.007
the females are larger than the males.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.468
That allows them to sort them
into the males and the females

00:10:34.492 --> 00:10:39.214
and they allow only the males
to grow to adulthood.

00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:41.556
And let me remind you
that males don't bite.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.176
From there it's pretty simple.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.802
They take beakers full of male mosquitoes,

00:10:46.826 --> 00:10:49.406
load them into milk cartons,
and drive around the city,

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.017
releasing them guided by GPS.

00:10:52.858 --> 00:10:55.375
Here's the mayor of a city
releasing the first batch

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:58.386
of what they call the "friendly Aedes."

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.671
Now I wish I could tell you
this is an American city, but it's not.
