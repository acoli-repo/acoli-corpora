00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:31.670
In fact in the 60 years between the time
it was first identified in 1947 and 2007

00:02:31.694 --> 00:02:35.297
there were only 13 reported cases
of human Zika fever.

00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:41.676
And then something extraordinary happened
on the tiny Micronesian Yap islands.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.985
There was an outbreak that affected
fully 75 percent of the population.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:50.635
How did it get there? By air.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.316
Today we have two billion
commercial airline passengers.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.583
An infected passenger can board a plane,
fly halfway around the world

00:02:59.607 --> 00:03:03.138
before developing symptoms --
if they develop symptoms at all.
