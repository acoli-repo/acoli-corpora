00:01:56.578 --> 00:02:00.864
identified an unknown virus
in a monkey in the Zika forest

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.888
which is how it got its name.

00:02:03.593 --> 00:02:05.806
The first human cases of Zika fever

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.805
surfaced a few years later
in Uganda-Tanzania.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.370
The virus then spread through West Africa

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:19.630
and east through equatorial Asia --
Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia.

00:02:20.344 --> 00:02:24.336
But it was still mostly in monkeys
and, of course, mosquitoes.

00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:31.670
In fact in the 60 years between the time
it was first identified in 1947 and 2007
