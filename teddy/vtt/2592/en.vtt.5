00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:30.263
(Applause)

00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:35.576
And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.529
were the elderly --

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:42.441
these men and women whose young backs
had been bent under hot suns

00:02:42.465 --> 00:02:44.446
in the cotton fields of East Texas,

00:02:45.137 --> 00:02:48.853
and whose skin seemed to be burnt
a creaseless noble brown,

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.551
just like the clay of East Texas,

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.604
and whose hopes and dreams
for what life might become

00:02:53.628 --> 00:02:54.779
outside of East Texas

00:02:54.803 --> 00:02:56.446
had sometimes been bent and broken

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.969
even further than their backs.

00:02:57.993 --> 00:03:01.873
Yes, these men and women
were the stars of the show for me.
