00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:00.958
for a very long time:

00:09:00.982 --> 00:09:02.656
"What if we took a road trip?"

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.724
(Laughter)

00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:08.729
We didn't know where'd we go
or how we'd get there,

00:09:08.753 --> 00:09:10.514
but we knew we had to do it.

00:09:11.108 --> 00:09:14.124
Because all our lives we yearned,
as Jack Kerouac wrote,

00:09:14.148 --> 00:09:18.100
to "sneak out into the night
and disappear somewhere,"

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.044
and go find out what everybody was doing

00:09:21.068 --> 00:09:22.340
all over the country.

00:09:23.242 --> 00:09:25.519
So even though there were
other voices who said

00:09:25.543 --> 00:09:27.996
that the risk was too great
and the proof too thin,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.376
we went on anyhow.
