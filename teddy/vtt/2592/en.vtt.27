00:13:26.647 --> 00:13:30.316
I realized that my story
stood in for all those

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.182
who were expected to pick
themselves up by their bootstraps,

00:13:33.206 --> 00:13:35.352

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.855
that my organization stood in

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:41.629

too unwashed, too unaccommodated.

00:13:55.273 --> 00:13:56.538
And the shame of that,

00:13:57.721 --> 00:13:59.108
that shame washed over me

00:13:59.132 --> 00:14:01.993
like the shame of sitting
in front of the television,
