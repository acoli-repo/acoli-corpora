00:13:59.132 --> 00:14:01.993
like the shame of sitting
in front of the television,

00:14:02.898 --> 00:14:05.397
watching Peter Jennings
announce the new millennium

00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:06.629
again

00:14:06.653 --> 00:14:07.803
and again

00:14:08.257 --> 00:14:09.407
and again.

00:14:09.796 --> 00:14:10.946
I had been duped,

00:14:12.084 --> 00:14:13.234
hoodwinked,

00:14:13.696 --> 00:14:14.846
bamboozled.

00:14:15.403 --> 00:14:18.477
But this time, the false savior was me.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.302
You see, I've come a long way 
from that altar

00:14:23.326 --> 00:14:25.422
on the night I thought
the world would end,

00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:28.576
from a world where people spoke in tongues

00:14:29.107 --> 00:14:31.745
and saw suffering
as a necessary act of God
