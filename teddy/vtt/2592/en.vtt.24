00:11:58.432 --> 00:12:01.680
Some of them came to Tony's program,

00:12:01.704 --> 00:12:03.051
called Harlem Grown,

00:12:03.677 --> 00:12:06.024
to get the only meal they had each day.

00:12:07.465 --> 00:12:12.080
Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown
with money from his pension,

00:12:12.954 --> 00:12:15.207
after 20 years as a cab driver.

00:12:16.232 --> 00:12:18.551
He told me that he didn't give
himself a salary,

00:12:19.342 --> 00:12:23.184
because despite success,
the program struggled for resources.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.100
He told me that he would take any help

00:12:26.665 --> 00:12:27.822
that he could get.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.136
And I was there as that help.
