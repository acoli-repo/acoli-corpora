00:07:57.856 --> 00:08:02.316
I had knelt faithfully at the altar
of the American Dream,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.518
praying to the gods of my time

00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:06.411
of success,

00:08:06.834 --> 00:08:07.984
and money,

00:08:08.358 --> 00:08:09.508
and power.

00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:12.037
But over and over again,

00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:15.662
midnight struck, and I opened my eyes

00:08:15.686 --> 00:08:18.154
to see that all of these gods were dead.

00:08:19.447 --> 00:08:20.828
And from that graveyard,

00:08:20.852 --> 00:08:22.297
I began the search once more,

00:08:22.321 --> 00:08:23.591
not because I was brave,

00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:27.020
but because I knew
that I would either believe

00:08:27.044 --> 00:08:28.271
or I would die.

00:08:28.963 --> 00:08:31.754
So I took a pilgrimage
to yet another mecca,
