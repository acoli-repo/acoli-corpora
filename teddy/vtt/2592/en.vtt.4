00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:02.289
and my pastor called us
out of the pews and down to the altar

00:02:02.313 --> 00:02:06.449
because he wanted to be praying
when midnight struck.

00:02:07.808 --> 00:02:09.818
So every faction of the congregation

00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:11.145
took its place.

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.915
The choir stayed in the choir stand,

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.412
the deacons and their wives --

00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:16.939
or the Baptist Bourgeoisie
as I like to call them --

00:02:16.963 --> 00:02:18.249
(Laughter)

00:02:18.273 --> 00:02:20.480
took first position in front of the altar.

00:02:20.504 --> 00:02:22.189
You see, in America,

00:02:22.824 --> 00:02:25.885
even the Second Coming of Christ
has a VIP section.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.239
(Laughter)

00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:30.263
(Applause)
