00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:32.368
why are people still suffering so bad?

00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:37.764
This doubt leads me to share
that we are putting my organization,

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.054
MBAs Across America,

00:16:39.078 --> 00:16:40.706
out of business.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.222
We have shed our staff
and closed our doors

00:16:43.246 --> 00:16:45.274
and we will share our model freely

00:16:45.298 --> 00:16:48.184
with anyone who sees
their power to do this work

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.056
without waiting for our permission.

00:16:50.434 --> 00:16:52.755
This doubt compels me

00:16:53.236 --> 00:16:55.009
to renounce the role of savior

00:16:55.033 --> 00:16:56.428
that some have placed on me,

00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:59.996
because our time is too short
and our odds are too long
