00:03:59.256 --> 00:04:01.625
And then a voice rang out above us:

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.443
"Amen."

00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:06.628
It was over.

00:04:08.044 --> 00:04:09.346
I looked at the clock.

00:04:10.643 --> 00:04:11.936
It was after midnight.

00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:15.018
I looked at the elder believers

00:04:15.697 --> 00:04:17.565
whose savior had not come,

00:04:18.205 --> 00:04:21.022
who were too proud to show
any signs of disappointment,

00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:23.439
who had believed too much and for too long

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.585
to start doubting now.

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:29.842
But I was upset on their behalf.
