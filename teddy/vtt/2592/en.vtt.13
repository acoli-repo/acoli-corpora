00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:31.479
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,

00:06:32.318 --> 00:06:34.832
with the faith that my journey
from Oak Cliff, Texas

00:06:34.856 --> 00:06:38.545
was a chance to leave behind
all the challenges I had known,

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.400
the broken dreams
and broken bodies I had seen.

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:46.079
But when I found myself back home
one winter break,

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:49.208
with my face planted in the floor,

00:06:50.268 --> 00:06:52.603
my hands tied behind my back

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.512
and a burglar's gun pressed to my head,

00:06:55.536 --> 00:06:59.379
I knew that even the best education
couldn't save me.
