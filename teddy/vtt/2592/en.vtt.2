00:01:00.742 --> 00:01:02.542
And once I stopped complaining

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.017
about how unfair it was
that Jesus would return

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:08.530
as soon as I had to be accountable
for all that I had done,

00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:11.517
I figured I had better get
my house in order very quickly.

00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:14.391
So I went to church as often as I could.

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:19.247
I listened for silence as anxiously
as one might listen for noise,

00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:22.361
trying to be sure that the Lord
hadn't pulled a fast one on me

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:23.960
and decided to come back early.

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:26.304
And just in case he did,

00:01:26.988 --> 00:01:28.614
I built a backup plan,

00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:33.158
by reading the "Left Behind" books
that were all the rage at the time.
