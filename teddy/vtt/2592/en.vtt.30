WEBVTT

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.752
when we worship right here
at the church of TED,

00:15:03.347 --> 00:15:05.528
but we desperately want to believe,

00:15:05.552 --> 00:15:07.098
we need to believe.

00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:10.186
We speak in the tongues
of charismatic leaders

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.402
that promise to solve all our problems.

00:15:12.426 --> 00:15:16.506
We see suffering as a necessary act
of the capitalism that is our god,

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.762
we take the text of technological progress

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.233
to be infallible truth.

00:15:22.034 --> 00:15:25.650
And we hardly realize
the human price we pay

00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:28.762
when we fail to question one brick,

00:15:29.692 --> 00:15:32.641
because we fear it might shake
our whole foundation.
