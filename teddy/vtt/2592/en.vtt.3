00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:33.158
by reading the "Left Behind" books
that were all the rage at the time.

00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:35.115
And I found in their pages

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.880
that if I was not taken
in the rapture at midnight,

00:01:37.904 --> 00:01:39.158

It was 11:50pm.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:59.271
We had 10 minutes left,

00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:02.289
