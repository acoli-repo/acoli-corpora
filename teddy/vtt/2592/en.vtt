00:00:00.823 --> 00:00:02.109
There we were,

00:00:03.354 --> 00:00:06.738
souls and bodies packed
into a Texas church

00:00:07.428 --> 00:00:09.649
on the last night of our lives.

00:00:10.856 --> 00:00:12.699
Packed into a room just like this,

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:18.294
but with creaky wooden pews
draped in worn-down red fabric,

00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:21.958
with an organ to my left
and a choir at my back

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:24.862
and a baptism pool
built into the wall behind them.

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:28.271
A room like this, nonetheless.

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:32.060
With the same great feelings of suspense,
