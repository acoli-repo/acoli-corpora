00:09:58.412 --> 00:10:02.150
growing into a nonprofit
called MBAs Across America,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.229
a movement that landed me here
on this stage today.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.797
It spread because we found
a great hunger in our generation

00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:14.264
for purpose, for meaning.

00:10:15.317 --> 00:10:18.015
It spread because we found
countless entrepreneurs

00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:19.947
in the nooks and crannies of America

00:10:19.971 --> 00:10:22.424
who were creating jobs and changing lives

00:10:22.448 --> 00:10:23.977
and who needed a little help.

00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:28.368
But if I'm being honest, it also spread

00:10:28.392 --> 00:10:30.094
because I fought to spread it.
