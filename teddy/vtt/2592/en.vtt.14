00:07:00.181 --> 00:07:03.293
I held on when I showed up
at Lehman Brothers

00:07:03.317 --> 00:07:05.331
as an intern in 2008.

00:07:07.048 --> 00:07:11.715
(Laughter)

00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:13.054
So hopeful --

00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:16.340
(Laughter)

00:07:16.364 --> 00:07:18.383
that I called home to inform my family

00:07:18.407 --> 00:07:19.957
that we'd never be poor again.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.071
(Laughter)

00:07:22.767 --> 00:07:24.801
But as I witnessed this temple of finance

00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:26.640
come crashing down before my eyes,

00:07:26.664 --> 00:07:29.940
I knew that even the best job
couldn't save me.
