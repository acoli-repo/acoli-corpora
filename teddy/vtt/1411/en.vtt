00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I want to take you on a trip

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to an alien world.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And it's not a trip

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that requires light-years of travel,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but it's to a place

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
where it's defined by light.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So it's a little-appreciated fact

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that most of the animals in our ocean

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
make light.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I've spent most of my career

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I study it because I think understanding it
