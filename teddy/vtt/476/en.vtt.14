JD: Yeah, I mean, I think you're spot on,

00:07:03.595 --> 00:07:05.481
but that goes back to the incentives.

00:07:05.505 --> 00:07:08.137
Like, one of the choices
we made in the early days was

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:12.862
we had this number that showed
how many people follow you.

00:07:12.886 --> 00:07:15.845
We decided that number
should be big and bold,

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:19.609
and anything that's on the page
that's big and bold has importance,

00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:21.911
and those are the things
that you want to drive.

00:07:21.935 --> 00:07:23.842
Was that the right decision at the time?

00:07:23.866 --> 00:07:25.019
Probably not.

00:07:25.043 --> 00:07:26.848
If I had to start the service again,

00:07:26.872 --> 00:07:29.270
I would not emphasize
the follower count as much.

00:07:29.294 --> 00:07:31.589
I would not emphasize
the "like" count as much.
