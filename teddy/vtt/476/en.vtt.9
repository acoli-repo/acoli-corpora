00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.214
it's incented a lot of outrage,
it's incented a lot of mob behavior,

00:04:34.238 --> 00:04:36.697
it's incented a lot of group harassment.

00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:40.369
And we have to look a lot deeper
at some of the fundamentals

00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:43.351
of what the service is doing
to make the bigger shifts.

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:47.406
We can make a bunch of small shifts
around technology, as I just described,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.816
but ultimately, we have to look deeply
at the dynamics in the network itself,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.208
and that's what we're doing.

00:04:53.232 --> 00:04:55.292
CA: But what's your sense --

00:04:55.316 --> 00:04:59.279
what is the kind of thing
that you might be able to change

00:04:59.303 --> 00:05:02.052
that would actually
fundamentally shift behavior?
