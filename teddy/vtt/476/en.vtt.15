I would not emphasize
the "like" count as much.

00:07:31.613 --> 00:07:34.733
I don't think I would even
create "like" in the first place,

00:07:34.757 --> 00:07:38.024
because it doesn't actually push

00:07:38.048 --> 00:07:41.227
what we believe now
to be the most important thing,

00:07:41.251 --> 00:07:44.290
which is healthy contribution
back to the network

00:07:44.314 --> 00:07:46.966
and conversation to the network,

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.062
participation within conversation,

00:07:49.086 --> 00:07:51.579
learning something from the conversation.

00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:54.427
Those are not things
that we thought of 13 years ago,

00:07:54.451 --> 00:07:56.890
and we believe are extremely
important right now.

00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:59.937
So we have to look at
how we display the follower count,

00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:02.326
how we display retweet count,
