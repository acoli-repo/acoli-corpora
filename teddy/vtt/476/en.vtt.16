00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:02.326
how we display retweet count,

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.751

00:08:23.868 --> 00:08:26.304
CA: Let's see what you guys are asking.

00:08:26.328 --> 00:08:29.622
I mean, this is -- generally, one
of the amazing things about Twitter

00:08:29.646 --> 00:08:31.940
is how you can use it for crowd wisdom,
