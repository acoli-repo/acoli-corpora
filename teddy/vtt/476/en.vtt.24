00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.557
We have a toxicity score,
a toxicity model, on our system

00:12:02.581 --> 00:12:06.705
that can actually measure
whether you are likely to walk away

00:12:06.729 --> 00:12:09.042
from a conversation
that you're having on Twitter

00:12:09.066 --> 00:12:10.699
because you feel it's toxic,

00:12:10.723 --> 00:12:13.235
with some pretty high degree.

00:12:14.369 --> 00:12:16.568
We're working to measure the rest,

00:12:16.592 --> 00:12:18.556
and the next step is,

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.939
as we build up solutions,

00:12:21.963 --> 00:12:25.454
to watch how these measurements
trend over time

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.351
and continue to experiment.

00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:31.416
And our goal is to make sure
that these are balanced,
