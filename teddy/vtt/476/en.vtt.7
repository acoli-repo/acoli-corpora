00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:31.105
which was a lot of work for them,
a lot of work for us

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.147
and just ultimately unfair.

00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:38.308
The other thing that we're doing
is making sure that we, as a company,

00:03:38.332 --> 00:03:41.665
have representation of all the communities
that we're trying to serve.

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.848
We can't build a business
that is successful

00:03:43.872 --> 00:03:47.172
unless we have a diversity
of perspective inside of our walls

00:03:47.196 --> 00:03:50.928
that actually feel these issues
every single day.

00:03:50.952 --> 00:03:54.690
And that's not just with the team
that's doing the work,

00:03:54.714 --> 00:03:56.810
it's also within our leadership as well.

00:03:56.834 --> 00:04:02.591
So we need to continue to build empathy
for what people are experiencing
