"You know, I wish I had
a few more 'likes,' followers, retweets."

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.937
And so they're constantly experimenting,

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:35.922
trying to find the path to do that.

00:06:35.946 --> 00:06:40.072
And what we've all discovered
is that the number one path to do that

00:06:40.096 --> 00:06:43.502
is to be some form of provocative,

00:06:43.526 --> 00:06:46.506
obnoxious, eloquently obnoxious,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.046
like, eloquent insults
are a dream on Twitter,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.673
where you rapidly pile up --

00:06:52.697 --> 00:06:57.305
and it becomes this self-fueling
process of driving outrage.

00:06:57.329 --> 00:06:59.680
How do you defuse that?
