WEBVTT

00:12:57.655 --> 00:13:04.650
So we have policies
around violent extremist groups,

00:13:04.674 --> 00:13:09.100
and the majority of our work
and our terms of service

00:13:09.124 --> 00:13:12.853
works on conduct, not content.

00:13:12.877 --> 00:13:15.428
So we're actually looking for conduct.

00:13:15.452 --> 00:13:18.466
Conduct being using the service

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.357
to repeatedly or episodically
harass someone,

00:13:22.381 --> 00:13:24.874
using hateful imagery

00:13:24.898 --> 00:13:27.004
that might be associated with the KKK

00:13:27.028 --> 00:13:30.309
or the American Nazi Party.
