CA: Because isn't it the case

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:10.916
that one reason why you have
so much content on there

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.531
is a result of putting millions
of people around the world

00:06:14.555 --> 00:06:17.697
in this kind of gladiatorial
contest with each other

00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:19.811
for followers, for attention?

00:06:19.835 --> 00:06:23.952

of people who just read Twitter,

00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:25.131
that's not an issue,

00:06:25.155 --> 00:06:28.505
but for the people who actually create it,
everyone's out there saying,

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.765
"You know, I wish I had
a few more 'likes,' followers, retweets."
