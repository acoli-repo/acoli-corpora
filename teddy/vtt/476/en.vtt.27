00:13:27.028 --> 00:13:30.309
or the American Nazi Party.

00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:34.489
Those are all things
that we act on immediately.

00:13:35.002 --> 00:13:40.454
We're in a situation right now
where that term is used fairly loosely,

00:13:40.478 --> 00:13:45.791
and we just cannot take
any one mention of that word

00:13:45.815 --> 00:13:47.932
accusing someone else

00:13:47.956 --> 00:13:51.711
as a factual indication that they
should be removed from the platform.

00:13:51.735 --> 00:13:54.362
So a lot of our models
are based around, number one:

00:13:54.386 --> 00:13:57.526
Is this account associated
with a violent extremist group?

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.533
And if so, we can take action.

00:13:59.557 --> 00:14:03.409
And we have done so on the KKK
and the American Nazi Party and others.
