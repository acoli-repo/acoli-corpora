00:08:56.476 --> 00:09:01.849
And on Twitter, for example,
in fact, we have some work

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:04.631
that's come from our friends
at Zignal Labs,

00:09:04.655 --> 00:09:07.311
and maybe we can even see that
to give us an example

00:09:07.335 --> 00:09:09.262
of what exactly I'm talking about,

00:09:09.286 --> 00:09:12.490
where you have these bots, if you will,

00:09:12.514 --> 00:09:17.064
or coordinated automated
malicious account activity,

00:09:17.088 --> 00:09:19.852
that is being used to influence
things like elections.

00:09:19.876 --> 00:09:23.719
And in this example we have
from Zignal which they've shared with us

00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:25.941
using the data that
they have from Twitter,

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:28.406
you actually see that in this case,

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.800
white represents the humans --
human accounts, each dot is an account.
