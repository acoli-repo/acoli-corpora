00:05:30.217 --> 00:05:33.614
What we could do instead
is allow you to follow an interest,

00:05:33.638 --> 00:05:35.741
follow a hashtag, follow a trend,

00:05:35.765 --> 00:05:37.519
follow a community,

00:05:37.543 --> 00:05:42.180
which gives us the opportunity
to show all of the accounts,

00:05:42.204 --> 00:05:45.527
all the topics, all the moments,
all the hashtags

00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:49.543
that are associated with that
particular topic and interest,

00:05:49.567 --> 00:05:54.167
which really opens up
the perspective that you see.

00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:56.348
But that is a huge fundamental shift

00:05:56.372 --> 00:06:00.164
to bias the entire network
away from just an account bias
