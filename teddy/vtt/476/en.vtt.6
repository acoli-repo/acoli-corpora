About 38 percent of abusive tweets
are now proactively identified

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.995
by machine learning algorithms

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.353
so that people don't actually
have to report them.

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:13.682
But those that are identified
are still reviewed by humans,

00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:19.090
so we do not take down content or accounts
without a human actually reviewing it.

00:03:19.114 --> 00:03:21.873
But that was from zero percent
just a year ago.

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:23.828
So that meant, at that zero percent,

00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:27.502
every single person who received abuse
had to actually report it,

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:31.105
which was a lot of work for them,
a lot of work for us
