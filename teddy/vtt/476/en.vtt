Chris Anderson:
What worries you right now?

00:00:03.563 --> 00:00:06.416
You've been very open
about lots of issues on Twitter.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.739
What would be your top worry

00:00:08.763 --> 00:00:10.812
about where things are right now?

00:00:11.447 --> 00:00:14.376
Jack Dorsey: Right now,
the health of the conversation.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.060
So, our purpose is to serve
the public conversation,

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:23.140
and we have seen
a number of attacks on it.

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:25.589
We've seen abuse, we've seen harassment,

00:00:25.613 --> 00:00:28.835
we've seen manipulation,

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.124
automation, human coordination,
misinformation.
