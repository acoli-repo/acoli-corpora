00:14:56.614 --> 00:15:00.111
but how many people do you currently have
monitoring these accounts,

00:15:00.135 --> 00:15:02.681
and how do you figure out what's enough?

00:15:02.705 --> 00:15:04.977
JD: They're completely flexible.

00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:07.942
Sometimes we associate folks with spam.

00:15:07.966 --> 00:15:11.811
Sometimes we associate folks
with abuse and harassment.

00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:14.897
We're going to make sure that
we have flexibility in our people

00:15:14.921 --> 00:15:17.271
so that we can direct them
at what is most needed.

00:15:17.295 --> 00:15:18.499
Sometimes, the elections.

00:15:18.523 --> 00:15:23.450
We've had a string of elections
in Mexico, one coming up in India,

00:15:23.474 --> 00:15:27.921
obviously, the election last year,
the midterm election,

00:15:27.945 --> 00:15:30.417
so we just want to be flexible
with our resources.
