00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.160
So we will dissect some
of these sounds for you now.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.056
TT: It's in there really. Definitely.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.176
(Laughter)

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.440
OK.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.640
(High-pitched sounds)

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.720
(High-pitched sounds)

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.856
(Hooting)

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.216
MB: So what he's doing
is he's changing the shape

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.256
and the length of the vibrating air column

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.776
using rhythmic contractions
of all the muscles

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.160
to generate all those sounds
that you're hearing.
