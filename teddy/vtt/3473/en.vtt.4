00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.496
(Beatboxing) flexibility
of the unfiltered human voice.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.456
And for years, my contemporaries and I
have been fielding questions like,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.496
"Oh my God, that's so cool.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.536
When did you figure out
you could do that?"

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.056
After I practiced for thousands
and thousands of hours --

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.336
(Laughter)

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.376
"And what do you do for a real job?"

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.736
"I'm a full-time beatboxer, Your Honor."

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.616
But there is one question
that I get quite a lot

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.936
that's a little bit
more difficult to answer,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.656
and that is how are you doing it --

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.456
how are you making those noises?
