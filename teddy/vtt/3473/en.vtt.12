00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.336
TT: (Low pitch)

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.760
MB: Turn the light on here.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.216
TT: (High and low pitches)

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.136
MB: So I've got the frequency of sound
matched with the stroboscope.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.656
That's the light you're seeing
flickering in the cup.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.416
TT: (Low pitch)

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.936
MB: And that's at about 80 hertz or so.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.336
So what we can do then is we can take that

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.536
and put the phase of the strobe
and the sound just out of sync.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.336
That lets us capture real-time,
slow-motion activity of vibrating tissues.
