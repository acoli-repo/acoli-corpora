00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.856
MB: We set out a little while ago
to try to go deep into the world --

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.096
and the throat --

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.416
of this beatboxer extraordinaire

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.936
to try to understand how such a vast
array of sounds are humanly possible.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.576
And what we found --

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.656
these are going in the mouth by the way --

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.720
and what we found
was something absolutely amazing.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.576
Even after my two years
of laryngeal surgery

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.856
in Harvard Medical School

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.896
with world-renowned professor
Steven Zeitels,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.976
we never saw anything
as extraordinary or fascinating as this,
