It's very hard not to gag with this.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.696
Say, "e."

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.976
TT: (Singing) E --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.336
MB: So down the bottom
you see the vocal cords,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.936
the little cord-like structures.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.680
(Laughter)

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.216
And now just look at the skin on the neck

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.880
and you'll see how strong
the light is to penetrate the skin.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.640
Alright, so if you'll have
the lights back on?

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.976
(Laughter)

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.136
(Applause)
