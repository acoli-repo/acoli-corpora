00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.960
(Laughter)

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.416
MB: That wasn't in the script.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.656
(Laughter)

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.880
(Applause)

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.296
TT: Secondhand.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.880
(Laughter)

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.936
MB: Now, we've had to time
this bit perfectly

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.216
because of the requirement
for local anesthetic.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.896
You've got to numb the nose,
get the camera in.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.576
It doesn't help for producing
a lot of the sounds,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.416
but it gives us a really cool view
of what's happening.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.976
So hold onto the stomachs,
and let's see what we can do.
