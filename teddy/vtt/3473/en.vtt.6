00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.216
I know how to drive,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.216
I just don't know what's under the hood.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.336
So I decided to find out

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.576
and invite 5,000 captive strangers,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.136
a few uncomfortable cameras,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.016
everybody watching online
and their browser history

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.176
into a place where not even the most
intimate of encounters have been ...

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.576
my throat.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.456
And to help me do that,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.176
I'd like to introduce to the stage
a very specialist guest

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.016
from the Queensland Voice Center,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.216
a man that's been in my mouth
more times than I'd care to admit,
