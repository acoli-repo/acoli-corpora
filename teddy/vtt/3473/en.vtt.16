00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.456
So all his beatboxing,
all those sounds for years

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.176
with Tom's way of doing it --

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.416
absolutely no damage whatsoever.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.120
That's really remarkable.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.816
Well done.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.056
OK.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.296
TT: (High pitch)

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.536
We've got this.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.096
MB: So watch now as the vocal cords
go from high pitch to low pitch.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.440
You'll see them go from long
and skinny to short and fat.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.616
Really think "e."

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:32.240
TT: (High to low pitch) E.
