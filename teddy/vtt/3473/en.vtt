(Beatboxing) Yo, what up?

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.536
My name is Tom Thum,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.696
and I've got to say
it's a pleasure to be back at TEDx.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.056
When I first stepped
upon the Sydney stage in 2013

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.136
as a starry-eyed boy from Brisbane,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.056
I had no idea that I was about to deliver
the most watched TEDx presentation ever.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.176
(Laughter)

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.696
(Applause)

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.136
But you know, I was stoked
because it was completely unexpected.
