If you think of it like a trumpet,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.456
we've got the mouthpiece --
that's the vocal folds --

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.416
and then the horn section is the throat.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.776
If we took your head off,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.216
took a bit of your neck off

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.136
and left you as a torso
with just your vocal folds vibrating,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.896
this is what you'd sound like.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.296
(Flatulent sound)

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.536
TT: (High pitch)

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.736
MB: Pretty hard to communicate,
but fortunately we've got a throat.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.296
We've got all the soft tissues,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.616
and that actually gives you
all the incredible dynamics of sound

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.200
that you'll hear tonight.
