00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.136
(Applause)

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.176
Alright, so just give us
a comfortable "e."

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.176
TT: (Singing) E.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.416
(Laughter)

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.096
TT: (Singing) E.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.136
(Audience gasps)

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.376
MB: So that's the vibrating vocal folds;

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.616
about 120 hertz.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.536
Means they've collided 120 times a second

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.320
just to make that sound.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.416
And we can also see that they're
absolutely, perfectly normal.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.456
So all his beatboxing,
all those sounds for years
