00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.976
So hold onto the stomachs,
and let's see what we can do.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.440
(Audience gasps)

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.480
So we're going to the back of the nose.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.936
And there you can see the soft palate.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.096
A lot of the sounds
we make from day to day,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.536
even the simple ones,

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.016
are incredibly complex.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.616
The sound "kh" for example.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.736
It's the soft palate sealing up
precisely against the back of the nose.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.616
So if you say it loudly five times,

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.536
feel your own soft palate
snapping against the back of the throat.
