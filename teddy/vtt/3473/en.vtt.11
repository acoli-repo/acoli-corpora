00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.200
that you'll hear tonight.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.360
Now, this is a rigid laryngoscope.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.856
TT: Hmm, spicy boy.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.896
(Laughter)

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.136
MB: I know, I know.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.656
(Laughter)

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.016
10 millimeters in diameter,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.656
it gives us the highest resolution
image of the larynx we can get.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.856
And we teed up with a stroboscope here

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.960
and a trigger microphone.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.656
The mic will pick up the frequency

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.296
and that will allow us
to show you how this all works.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.040
So, if we can have the lights down?
