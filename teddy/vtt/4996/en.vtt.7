00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.677
We’ve discovered that coating implants 
with certain chemicals and drugs

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:33.997
can dampen the immune response.

00:03:33.997 --> 00:03:37.987
Those basically make the implants 
invisible to the immune system.

00:03:37.987 --> 00:03:41.307
We’re also making more implants 
out of natural materials

00:03:41.307 --> 00:03:44.077
and in forms that directly mimic tissues,

00:03:44.077 --> 00:03:46.547
so that the body launches a weaker attack

00:03:46.547 --> 00:03:50.997
than it would if it came across a 
completely artificial implant.

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:53.131
Some medical treatments involve implants

00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:56.791
designed to regenerate lost 
or damaged tissues.

00:03:56.791 --> 00:04:00.301
In those cases, we can design the implants
to contain ingredients
