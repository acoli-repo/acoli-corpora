00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:30.867
they fuse together, forming a mass of 
cells called a “giant cell.”

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:34.031
At the same time, cells called fibroblasts

00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:39.011
travel to the site and begin to deposit
layers of dense connective tissue.

00:02:39.011 --> 00:02:43.005
Those enclose the needle that the pump 
uses to deliver insulin

00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:45.275
and test for glucose levels.

00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:47.755
Over time this scaffolding builds up,

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:51.325
forming a scar around the implant.

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:54.765
The scar functions as an almost 
impenetrable wall

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:57.095
that might start to block vital 
interactions

00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:59.615
between the body and the implant.

00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:03.205
For example, scarring around pacemakers
can interrupt
