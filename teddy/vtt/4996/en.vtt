Insulin pumps improve the lives

00:00:08.488 --> 00:00:13.438
of many of the 415 million people 
with diabetes around the world

00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:16.245
by monitoring blood sugar, delivering 
insulin,

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:20.245
and preventing the need for constant 
finger-pricking and blood testing.

00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:25.305
These small machines include a pump and
a needle, which can sense glucose levels,

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:26.655
feed back to the pump,

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:30.275
and then calculate how much insulin 
to deliver through the needle.
