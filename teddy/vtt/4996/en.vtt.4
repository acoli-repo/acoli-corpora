00:01:58.154 --> 00:02:00.164
Early-responding inflammatory cells,

00:02:00.164 --> 00:02:02.514
like neutrophils and macrophages,

00:02:02.514 --> 00:02:05.094
respond to the emergency call.

00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:08.284
Neutrophils release little granules filled
with enzymes

00:02:08.284 --> 00:02:12.014
that try to break down the surface 
of the insulin pump’s needle.

00:02:12.014 --> 00:02:14.484
Macrophages secrete enzymes too,

00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:16.764
together with nitric oxide radicals,

00:02:16.764 --> 00:02:21.424
which create a chemical reaction that 
degrades the object over time.

00:02:21.424 --> 00:02:25.571
If the macrophages are unable to dispatch 
the foreign body rapidly,

00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:30.867
they fuse together, forming a mass of 
cells called a “giant cell.”
