For example, scarring around pacemakers
can interrupt

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:07.475
the electrical transmission that’s 
crucial for their functioning.

00:03:07.477 --> 00:03:11.387
Synthetic knee joints may give off 
particles as they’re worn down,

00:03:11.387 --> 00:03:15.047
causing immune cells to inflame 
around these fragments.

00:03:15.047 --> 00:03:19.887
Tragically, the immune system’s attack
can even be life-threatening.

00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:23.400
However, researchers are finding ways 
to trick the immune system

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.210
into accepting the new devices we 
introduce into our bodily tissues.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.677
We’ve discovered that coating implants 
with certain chemicals and drugs
