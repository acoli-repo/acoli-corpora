with the same suspicion as they would
a harmful virus or bacteria.

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:37.482
As soon as the insulin pump has been 
implanted in the skin,

00:01:37.482 --> 00:01:41.842
its presence triggers what’s known as a
“foreign body response.”

00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:44.054
This starts with free-floating proteins

00:01:44.054 --> 00:01:47.144
that stick themselves to the surface 
of the implant.

00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:49.534
Those proteins include antibodies,

00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:52.194
which attempt to neutralize the new object

00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:55.624
and send out a signal that calls other 
immune cells to the site

00:01:55.624 --> 00:01:58.154
to strengthen the attack.
