00:00:57.031 --> 00:01:01.561
That isn’t just a nuisance: it 
can be expensive and risky.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:05.296
This inconvenience happens because of 
our bodies’ immune systems.

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:08.706
Honed by several hundred million 
years of evolution,

00:01:08.706 --> 00:01:10.016
these defensive fronts

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:14.366
have become exceptionally good 
at identifying foreign objects.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.706
Our immune systems boast

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:20.036
an impressive arsenal of tools to tackle,
intercept, and destroy

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:22.926
anything they believe shouldn’t be there.

00:01:22.926 --> 00:01:25.766
But the consequence of this constant 
surveillance

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:29.766
is that our bodies treat helpful 
implants, like insulin pumps,

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:34.366
with the same suspicion as they would
a harmful virus or bacteria.
