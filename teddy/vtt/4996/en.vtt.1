00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:30.275
and then calculate how much insulin 
to deliver through the needle.

00:00:30.275 --> 00:00:33.595
But they have a catch: they’re temporary.

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:37.705
Within a few days, glucose sensors have to
be moved and replaced.

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:42.595
And it’s not just glucose monitors and 
insulin pumps that have this problem,

00:00:42.595 --> 00:00:46.284
but all bodily implants, 
at different time scales.

00:00:46.284 --> 00:00:50.994
Plastic prosthetic knees have to be 
replaced after about 20 years.

00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:54.311
Other implants, such as those used for 
cosmetic reasons,

00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:57.031
can meet the same fate in about 10.

00:00:57.031 --> 00:01:01.561
That isn’t just a nuisance: it 
can be expensive and risky.
