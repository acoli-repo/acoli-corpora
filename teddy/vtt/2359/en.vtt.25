WEBVTT

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.266
produced over 1,000 felony convictions

00:12:32.266 --> 00:12:34.940
just in cases designated as major,

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.078
and that understates the degree of prioritization,

00:12:38.078 --> 00:12:39.874
because we worked with the FBI

00:12:39.874 --> 00:12:44.138
to create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes,

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:47.402
the absolute worst of the worst, nationwide.

00:12:47.402 --> 00:12:50.186
Roughly 300 savings and loans involved,

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.500
roughly 600 senior officials.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.840
Virtually all of them were prosecuted.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.671
We had a 90 percent conviction rate.

00:12:58.671 --> 00:13:00.501
It's the greatest success against
