And that's a hint as to how

00:02:34.543 --> 00:02:36.279
we discovered this recipe,

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:40.355

00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:45.267

00:02:47.722 --> 00:02:50.139
and we looked for common characteristics,

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.398

00:02:56.712 --> 00:02:59.790
In other words, a coroner could find these things

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.650
because this is a fatal recipe
