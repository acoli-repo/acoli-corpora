00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:32.253
This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud

00:05:32.253 --> 00:05:33.850
led by the banks.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.523
What about liar's loans?

00:05:35.523 --> 00:05:39.372
Well, that warning actually comes earlier.

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.001
The savings and loan debacle is basically

00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:45.548
the early 1980s through 1993,

00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:48.303
and in the midst of fighting that wave

00:05:48.303 --> 00:05:50.970
of accounting control fraud,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.158
in 1990, we found that a second front

00:05:55.158 --> 00:05:57.203
of fraud was being started.

00:05:57.203 --> 00:05:59.358
And like all good financial frauds in America,

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:03.210
it began in Orange County, California.
