00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.415
typically a CEO,

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:02.988
a seemingly legitimate entity,

00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:05.244
use it as a weapon to defraud.

00:01:05.244 --> 00:01:08.839
And these are the weapons of mass destruction

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.939
in the financial world.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.669
They also follow in finance a particular strategy,

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:18.041
because the weapon of choice in finance

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:19.511
is accounting,

00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:23.405
and there is a recipe for accounting

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:25.735
control fraud, and how it occurs.

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:27.368
And we discovered this recipe

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:30.062
in quite an odd way that I'll
come back to in a moment.
