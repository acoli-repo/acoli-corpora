in quite an odd way that I'll
come back to in a moment.

00:01:30.062 --> 00:01:34.039
First ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy;

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.077
second, by making or buying really crappy loans,

00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:42.560
but loans that are made at a very high interest rate

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.038
or yield;

00:01:44.038 --> 00:01:46.270
three, while employing extreme leverage --

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.985
that just means a lot of debt --

00:01:47.985 --> 00:01:49.219
compared to your equity;

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.239
and four, while providing only trivial loss reserves

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.423
against the inevitable losses.

00:01:55.423 --> 00:01:59.089
If you follow those four simple steps,

00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:01.390
and any bank can follow them,
