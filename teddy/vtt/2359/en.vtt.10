00:04:56.221 --> 00:05:00.077
they, the banks, would blacklist

00:05:00.077 --> 00:05:02.299
honest appraisers

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:04.851
and refuse to use them.

00:05:04.851 --> 00:05:07.413
Now, we've seen this before

00:05:07.413 --> 00:05:08.941
in the savings and loan debacle,

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:10.765
and we know that this kind of fraud

00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:13.361
can only originate from the lenders,

00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:16.405
and that no honest lender would ever inflate

00:05:16.405 --> 00:05:17.714
the appraisal,

00:05:17.714 --> 00:05:20.810
because it's the great protection against loss.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.441
So this was an incredibly early warning, 2000.

00:05:24.441 --> 00:05:26.622
It was something we'd seen before,

00:05:26.622 --> 00:05:28.861
and it was completely unambiguous.

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:32.253
This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud
