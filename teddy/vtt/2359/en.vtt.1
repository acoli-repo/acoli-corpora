00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:31.561
That's what 11 trillion looks like.

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.108
That's how many zeros?

00:00:33.108 --> 00:00:36.544
And cost us over 10 million jobs as well.

00:00:36.544 --> 00:00:39.195
So our task is to educate ourselves

00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:40.403
so that we can understand

00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:42.853
why we have these recurrent,

00:00:42.853 --> 00:00:44.930
intensifying financial crises,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.125
and how we can prevent them in the future.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.515
And the answer to that is

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:54.921
that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.870
Control fraud is what happens

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.690
when the people who control,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.415
typically a CEO,
