00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:04.534
So today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank,

00:00:04.534 --> 00:00:08.819
and it's clear that the general public needs guidance,

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:11.692
because the average bank robbery nets

00:00:11.692 --> 00:00:14.230
only 7,500 dollars.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.200
Rank amateurs who know nothing

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.539
about how to cook the books.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.599
The folks who know, of course,

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.390
run our largest banks,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.908
and in the last go-around,

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:29.144
they cost us over 11 trillion dollars.

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:31.561
That's what 11 trillion looks like.
