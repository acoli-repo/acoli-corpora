00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.650
because this is a fatal recipe

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.074
that will destroy the banks

00:03:04.074 --> 00:03:06.165
as well as the economy.

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:09.678
And it also turns out to be precisely

00:03:09.678 --> 00:03:11.940
what could have stopped this crisis,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.462
the one that cost us 11 trillion dollars

00:03:14.462 --> 00:03:16.398
just in the household sector,

00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:18.502
that cost us 10 million jobs,

00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:21.956
was the easiest financial crisis by far

00:03:21.956 --> 00:03:24.427
to have avoided completely

00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:26.499
if we had simply learned the lessons

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:28.604
of epidemics of control fraud,

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:31.095
particularly using this recipe.
