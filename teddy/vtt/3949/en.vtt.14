00:06:59.474 --> 00:07:01.949
asked for these scholarships?

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.201
First, they just don't have enough doctors,

00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:06.967
and where they do, their distribution

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:09.409
is skewed against the poor,

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:11.871
because our global health crisis

00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:14.836
is fed by a crisis in human resources.

00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:18.688
We are short four to seven million health workers

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:21.152
just to meet basic needs,

00:07:21.152 --> 00:07:23.010
and the problem is everywhere.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.562
Doctors are concentrated in the cities,

00:07:25.562 --> 00:07:28.172
where only half the world's people live,

00:07:28.172 --> 00:07:29.960
and within cities,

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.139
not in the shantytowns or South L.A.
