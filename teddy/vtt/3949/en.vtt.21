Dozens of projects give us an inkling

00:10:30.822 --> 00:10:33.390
of what they're capable of doing.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.153
Take the Garífuna grads.

00:10:35.153 --> 00:10:37.343
They not only went to work back home,

00:10:37.343 --> 00:10:39.750
but they organized their communities to build

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.151
Honduras' first indigenous hospital.

00:10:43.151 --> 00:10:45.300

The first patients walked through the doors

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:54.299
in December 2007,

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:56.808
and since then, the hospital has received

00:10:56.808 --> 00:10:59.958
nearly one million patient visits.

00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.119
And government is paying attention,
