that they will practice where most doctors don't,

00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:34.623
in places not only poor

00:01:34.623 --> 00:01:37.176
but oftentimes dangerous,

00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:40.202
carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks

00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:42.821
or navigating neighborhoods

00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:46.142
riddled by drugs, gangs and bullets,

00:01:46.142 --> 00:01:48.842
their home ground.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.168
The hope is that they will help

00:01:50.168 --> 00:01:52.768
transform access to care,

00:01:52.768 --> 00:01:55.187
the health picture in impoverished areas,

00:01:55.187 --> 00:01:57.346
and even the way medicine itself

00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:59.889
is learned and practiced,

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:04.140
and that they will become pioneers in our global reach
