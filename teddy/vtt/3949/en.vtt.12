00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.479
by doing and correcting course as they went.

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.741
Even the brightest students

00:06:04.741 --> 00:06:06.654
from these poor communities

00:06:06.654 --> 00:06:08.330
weren't academically prepared

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.023
for six years of medical training,

00:06:11.023 --> 00:06:14.680
so a bridging course was set up in sciences.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.255
Then came language:

00:06:16.255 --> 00:06:19.416
these were Mapuche, Quechuas, Guaraní, Garífuna,

00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:21.193
indigenous peoples

00:06:21.193 --> 00:06:23.393
who learned Spanish as a second language,

00:06:23.393 --> 00:06:26.190
or Haitians who spoke Creole.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.127
So Spanish became part

00:06:28.127 --> 00:06:32.285
of the pre-pre-med curriculum.
