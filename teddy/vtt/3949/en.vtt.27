00:13:28.616 --> 00:13:31.600
The grads face pressure from their families too,

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.903
desperate to make ends meet,

00:13:33.903 --> 00:13:36.479
so when there are no public sector jobs,

00:13:36.479 --> 00:13:39.100
these new MDs decamp into private practice,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.115
or go abroad to send money home.

00:13:43.115 --> 00:13:46.300
Worst of all, in some countries,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.236
medical societies influence accreditation bodies

00:13:49.236 --> 00:13:52.251
not to honor the ELAM degree,

00:13:52.251 --> 00:13:54.568
fearful these grads will take their jobs

00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:58.123
or reduce their patient loads and income.

00:13:58.123 --> 00:14:01.104
It's not a question of competencies.
