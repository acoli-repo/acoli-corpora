00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.303
Hundreds of Cuban doctors
volunteered for disaster response,

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:35.148
but when they got there,

00:02:35.148 --> 00:02:37.231
they found a bigger disaster:

00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:40.427
whole communities with no healthcare,

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:42.751
doors bolted shut on rural hospitals

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.630
for lack of staff,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.301
and just too many babies dying

00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:50.236
before their first birthday.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:54.070
What would happen when these Cuban doctors left?

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.784
New doctors were needed to make care sustainable,

00:02:56.784 --> 00:02:58.096
but where would they come from?

00:02:58.096 --> 00:03:00.901
Where would they train?
