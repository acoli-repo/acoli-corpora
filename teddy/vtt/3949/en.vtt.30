and a voice to their communities.

00:15:00.844 --> 00:15:03.496
They've done the heavy lifting.

00:15:03.496 --> 00:15:05.510
Now we need to do our part

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.127
to support the 23,000 and counting,

00:15:09.127 --> 00:15:10.481
All of us —

00:15:10.481 --> 00:15:14.115
foundations, residency directors, press,

00:15:14.115 --> 00:15:17.299
entrepreneurs, policymakers, people —

00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:19.452
need to step up.

00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:21.443

00:15:21.443 --> 00:15:24.382
to give these new doctors the opportunity

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:26.775
to prove their mettle.

00:15:26.775 --> 00:15:27.778
They need to be able

00:15:27.778 --> 00:15:30.982
to take their countries' licensing exams.
