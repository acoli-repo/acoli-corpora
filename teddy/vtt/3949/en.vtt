00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:02.159
I want to tell you

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.850
how 20,000 remarkable young people

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.706
from over 100 countries

00:00:08.706 --> 00:00:10.518
ended up in Cuba

00:00:10.518 --> 00:00:14.321
and are transforming health in their communities.

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:16.401
Ninety percent of them would never

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:17.973
have left home at all

00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:21.317
if it weren't for a scholarship
to study medicine in Cuba

00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:23.128
and a commitment to go back

00:00:23.128 --> 00:00:26.756
to places like the ones they'd come from —

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:30.203
remote farmlands, mountains, ghettos —
