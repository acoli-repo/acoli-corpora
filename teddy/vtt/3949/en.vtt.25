00:12:29.004 --> 00:12:32.575
staffed, and in 35 cases, headed

00:12:32.575 --> 00:12:36.497
by ELAM graduates.

00:12:36.497 --> 00:12:38.365
Yet the Haitian story

00:12:38.365 --> 00:12:40.424
also illustrates some of the bigger problems

00:12:40.424 --> 00:12:42.640
faced in many countries.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.384
Take a look:

00:12:44.384 --> 00:12:50.166
748 Haitian graduates by 
2012, when cholera struck,

00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:53.912
nearly half working in the public health sector

00:12:53.912 --> 00:12:55.983
but one quarter unemployed,

00:12:55.983 --> 00:13:02.093
and 110 had left Haiti altogether.
