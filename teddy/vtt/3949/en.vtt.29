00:14:28.966 --> 00:14:32.420
in Cuba, "We are trained to provide quality care

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.422
with minimal resources,

00:14:34.422 --> 00:14:36.998
so when I see all the resources we have here,

00:14:36.998 --> 00:14:39.160
and you tell me that's not possible,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.330
I know it's not true.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:46.949
Not only have I seen it work, I've done the work."

00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:48.910
ELAM's graduates,

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.427
some from right here in D.C. and Baltimore,

00:14:52.427 --> 00:14:55.595
have come from the poorest of the poor

00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:57.928
to offer health, education

00:14:57.928 --> 00:15:00.844
and a voice to their communities.
