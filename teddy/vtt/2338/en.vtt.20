And she said she had stolen the shoes,

00:10:01.193 --> 00:10:04.768
but she did so because
she wanted to sell them

00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:09.139
and take the money to pay for a drug test

00:10:09.163 --> 00:10:12.370
so that her mother
could show she was clean

00:10:12.394 --> 00:10:15.887
and try to regain custody
of two younger children

00:10:15.911 --> 00:10:18.956
who were then in state protective care.

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:23.228
The other girls heard this,

00:10:23.252 --> 00:10:24.640
saw Mercedes crying

00:10:24.664 --> 00:10:25.852
and they hugged her.

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:29.622
They did not ask her
to return what she'd stolen,

00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:32.226
but they did say they wanted a restart.
