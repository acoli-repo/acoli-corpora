00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:01.335
But I also worry -- I worry a lot --

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:02.384
(Laughter)

00:02:02.408 --> 00:02:08.806
I worry that these tools, when used,
replicate the disparities,

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.666
the inequities along the lines
of race and class and other markers

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.612
of advantage and disadvantage.

00:02:15.025 --> 00:02:18.723
Biases or privileged access are at work

00:02:18.747 --> 00:02:24.602
when United States presidents
pardon people charged with crimes.

00:02:25.027 --> 00:02:29.220
Historically, white people
are pardoned four times as often

00:02:29.244 --> 00:02:34.461
as members of minority groups
for the same crime, same sentence.
