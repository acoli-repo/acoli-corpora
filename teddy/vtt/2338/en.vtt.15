and their own communities?

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.121
Legal frameworks inviting youth
to describe their conduct

00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:39.802
could also involve community members
to hear and forgive.

00:07:40.365 --> 00:07:42.009
Called "restorative justice,"

00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:46.401
such efforts emphasize
accountability and service

00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:48.005
rather than punishment.

00:07:49.275 --> 00:07:54.440
Many schools in the United States have
turned to use restorative justice methods

00:07:54.464 --> 00:07:57.628
to resolve conflicts and to prevent them,

00:07:57.652 --> 00:08:00.457
and to disrupt
the school-to-prison pipeline.
