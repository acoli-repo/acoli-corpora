00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.824
I also worried about the law itself.

00:01:01.764 --> 00:01:06.653
The law leans so severely
towards punishment these days

00:01:06.677 --> 00:01:09.205
that it's part of the problem.

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:11.984
And that's what I want to talk about here.

00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:17.527
The powerful example
of one individual's forgiveness

00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:23.385
makes me worry that lawyers and officials
too often overlook the tools

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.975
that law itself creates
to allow forgiveness,

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:32.965
when the principle should be
the cornerstone of a thriving society.
