in the United States

00:03:16.594 --> 00:03:18.570
and the District of Columbia,

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:22.152

medical professionals to apologize

00:03:22.176 --> 00:03:23.383
when something goes wrong

00:03:23.407 --> 00:03:28.037

could later be used against them

00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:30.737
in an action for damages.
