00:06:57.451 --> 00:07:03.625
The rhetoric of innocence is resonant
when we talk about child soldiers,

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:08.121
but not when we talk about
teen gang members in the United States.

00:07:08.883 --> 00:07:13.084
Yet in both settings, youth are caught
in worlds that are made by adults,

00:07:13.108 --> 00:07:16.839
and forgiveness can offer
both accountability and fresh starts.

00:07:17.914 --> 00:07:23.069
What if, instead, young people
caught in criminal activity and violence

00:07:23.093 --> 00:07:26.675
could have chances
to accept responsibility

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:31.863
while learning and rebuilding their lives
and their own communities?
