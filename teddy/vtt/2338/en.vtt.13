where we severely punish minors,

00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:41.256
often moving them to adult courts,
even adult prisons.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.068
And yet, like child soldiers,

00:06:44.092 --> 00:06:48.764

into violent activity in the United States

00:06:48.788 --> 00:06:50.954
when there are few options,

00:06:50.978 --> 00:06:52.232
when they are threatened

00:06:52.256 --> 00:06:56.389
or when adults induce them
with money or ideology.

00:06:57.451 --> 00:07:03.625
The rhetoric of innocence is resonant
when we talk about child soldiers,
