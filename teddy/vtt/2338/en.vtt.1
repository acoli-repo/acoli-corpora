00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:30.253
and I joined the rest of the country
watching on television in awe

00:00:30.277 --> 00:00:32.055
at that act of grace.

00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:34.379
But I also worried.

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:40.034
I worried that people
who are African American like Brandt Jean

00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:43.549
are expected to forgive
more often than other people.

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:48.535
And I worried that a white
police officer like Amber Guyger

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.864
receives a lesser sentence

00:00:50.888 --> 00:00:53.945
than other people
who commit wrongful killings.

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:56.772
But because I'm a law professor,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.824
I also worried about the law itself.
