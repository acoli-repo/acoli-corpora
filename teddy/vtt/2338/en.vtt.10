00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.818
looking down at a defendant
with the exact same nose

00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:03.306
and exact same mustache

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.750
and says, "Obviously not guilty."

00:05:05.774 --> 00:05:07.226
(Laughter)

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.531
Forgiveness could undermine
the commitment that law has

00:05:11.555 --> 00:05:15.778
to treat people the same
under the same circumstances,

00:05:15.802 --> 00:05:17.707
to apply rules evenly.

00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:22.181
In this age of resentment,
mass incarceration,

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:24.776
widespread consumer debt,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.182
we need more forgiveness,
but we need a philosophy of forgiveness.

00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:31.389
We need to forgive fairly.
