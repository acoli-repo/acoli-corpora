00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:10.538
In 2011, a group of researchers conducted
a scientific study

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:12.663
to find an impossible result:

00:00:12.663 --> 00:00:16.163
that listening to certain songs 
can make you younger.

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:20.288
Their study involved real people,
truthfully reported data,

00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:23.288
and commonplace statistical analyses.

00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:24.704
So how did they do it?

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:28.829
The answer lies in a statistical method 
scientists often use

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.704
to try to figure out whether their results
mean something or if theyâ€™re random noise.
