00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:30.929
That difference made the ball curve
towards the lower pressure zone.

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.302
This phenomenon is called
the Magnus effect.

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:37.673
This type of kick, 
often referred to as a banana kick,

00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:39.529
is attempted regularly,

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:43.581
and it is one of the elements
that makes the beautiful game beautiful.

00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:45.932
But curving the ball 
with the precision needed

00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:51.061
to both bend around the wall
and back into the goal is difficult.

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.314
Too high and it soars over the goal.

00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:56.587
Too low and it hits the ground 
before curving.

00:01:56.587 --> 00:01:59.093
Too wide and it never reaches the goal.

00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:02.591
Not wide enough 
and the defenders intercept it.
