00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:05.142
sending it high and to the right,
but also rotating around its axis.

00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:08.223
The ball started its flight
in an apparently direct route,

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:12.053
with air flowing on both sides
and slowing it down.

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:16.989
On one side, the air moved in the opposite
direction to the ball's spin,

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:18.890
causing increased pressure,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.036
while on the other side, the air moved
in the same direction as the spin,

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:26.114
creating an area of lower pressure.

00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:30.929
That difference made the ball curve
towards the lower pressure zone.
