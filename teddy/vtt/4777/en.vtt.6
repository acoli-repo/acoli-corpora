causing it to spiral into smaller 
and smaller circles

00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:05.287
until finally stopping.

00:03:05.287 --> 00:03:07.026
And just to get that spiral,

00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:11.103
you'd have to make the ball spin
over 15 times faster

00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:13.904
than Carlos's immortal kick.

00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:16.215
So good luck with that.
