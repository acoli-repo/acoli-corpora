00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:30.217
It also applies to golf balls,
frisbees and baseballs.

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:33.138
In every case, the same thing happens.

00:02:33.138 --> 00:02:37.634
The ball's spin creates a pressure 
differential in the surrounding air flow

00:02:37.634 --> 00:02:40.651
that curves it 
in the direction of the spin.

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:41.972
And here's a question.

00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:44.448
Could you theoretically 
kick a ball hard enough

00:02:44.448 --> 00:02:48.292
to make it boomerang 
all the way around back to you?

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:50.139
Sadly, no.

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.672
Even if the ball didn't 
disintegrate on impact,

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.311
or hit any obstacles,

00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:55.786
as the air slowed it,

00:02:55.786 --> 00:02:58.897
the angle of its deflection 
would increase,

00:02:58.897 --> 00:03:02.658
causing it to spiral into smaller 
and smaller circles
