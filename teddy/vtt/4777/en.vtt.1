00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.960
but just before going out of bounds,
it hooked to the left

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.082
and soared into the goal.

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:35.877
According to Newton's first law of motion,

00:00:35.877 --> 00:00:39.246
an object will move 
in the same direction and velocity

00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:42.077
until a force is applied on it.

00:00:42.077 --> 00:00:45.931
When Carlos kicked the ball,
he gave it direction and velocity,

00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:48.696
but what force made the ball swerve

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:53.577
and score one of the most magnificent 
goals in the history of the sport?

00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:55.828
The trick was in the spin.

00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:59.515
Carlos placed his kick
at the lower right corner of the ball,

00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:05.142
sending it high and to the right,
but also rotating around its axis.
