00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:02.591
Not wide enough 
and the defenders intercept it.

00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:06.068
Too slow and it hooks too early,
or not at all.

00:02:06.068 --> 00:02:09.088
Too fast and it hooks too late.

00:02:09.088 --> 00:02:10.978
The same physics make it possible

00:02:10.978 --> 00:02:14.386
to score another 
apparently impossible goal,

00:02:14.386 --> 00:02:17.504
an unassisted corner kick.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:21.032
The Magnus effect was first documented
by Sir Isaac Newton

00:02:21.032 --> 00:02:26.261
after he noticed it while playing a game
of tennis back in 1670.

00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:30.217
It also applies to golf balls,
frisbees and baseballs.
