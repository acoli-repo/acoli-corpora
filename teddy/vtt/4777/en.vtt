00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:11.328
In 1997, 
in a game between France and Brazil,

00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:14.387
a young Brazilian player
named Roberto Carlos

00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:17.502
set up for a 35 meter free kick.

00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:19.554
With no direct line to the goal,


00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:23.859
Carlos decided to attempt 
the seemingly impossible.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.068
His kick sent the ball flying
wide of the players,

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.960
but just before going out of bounds,
it hooked to the left
