00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.080
and I admit I'm fascinated by it
and we use it in my own lab,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.616
that I think someone
is going to go that extra step

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.216
and continue the GM human embryo work

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.640
and maybe make designer babies.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.736
This is so ubiquitous now.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.176
It just came on the scene three years ago.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.536
Thousands of labs
literally have this in hand today,

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.936
and they're doing important research.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.576
Most of them are not interested
in designer babies.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.096
They're studying human disease

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.536
and other important elements of science.
