00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.976
This was the first time in history.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.680
And they did it using
this new CRISPR technology.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.296
It didn't work perfectly,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.896
but I still think
they sort of cracked the door ajar

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.720
on a Pandora's box here.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.376
And I think some people
are going to run with this technology

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.280
and try to make designer babies.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.256
Now, before I go on, some of you
may hold up your hands and say,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.536
"Stop, Paul, wait a minute.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.376
Wouldn't that be illegal?

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.040
You can't just go off
and create a designer baby."
