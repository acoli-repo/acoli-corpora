00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.440
it would be very seductive.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.936
And yet coming with it
would be these risks.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.856
I talked about eugenics,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.696
but there would be risks
to individuals as well.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.176
So if we forget about enhancing people

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.656
and we just try to make them
healthier using genetic modification,

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.136
this technology is so new

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.736
and so powerful,

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.520
that by accident
we could make them sicker.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.656
That easily could happen.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.936
And there's another risk,

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.536
and that is that all of the legitimate,
important genetic modification research
