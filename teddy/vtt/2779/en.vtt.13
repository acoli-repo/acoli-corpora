00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.400
or a GPS for our DNA,

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.456
so it can home in on a certain spot.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.136
And the next tool is like scissors

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.416
that can cut the DNA right in that spot.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.016
And finally we have a pen

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.536
where we can literally rewrite
the genetic code in that location.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.800
It's really that simple.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.336
And this technology, which came
on the scene just three years ago,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.200
has taken science by storm.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.256
It's evolving so fast, and it's
so freaking exciting to scientists,

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.080
and I admit I'm fascinated by it
and we use it in my own lab,
