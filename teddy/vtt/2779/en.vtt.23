00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.536
and that is that all of the legitimate,
important genetic modification research

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.216
going on just in the lab --

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.256
again, no interest in designer babies --

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.136
a few people going
the designer baby route,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.536
things go badly,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.520
that entire field could be damaged.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.896
I also think it's not that unlikely

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.200
that governments might start taking
an interest in genetic modification.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.816
So for example our imagined GM Jenna child

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.056
who is healthier,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.096
if there's a generation that looks
like they have lower health care costs,
