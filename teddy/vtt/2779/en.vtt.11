00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.376
It was illegal there,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.976
but just a few months ago,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.456
they carved out an exception to that rule.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.016
They passed a new law

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.496
allowing the creation
of genetically modified humans

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.640
with the noble goal of trying
to prevent a rare kind of genetic disease.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.096
But still I think in combination
these events are pushing us

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.656
further towards an acceptance

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.600
of human genetic modification.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.736
So I've been talking
about this CRISPR technology.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.800
What actually is CRISPR?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.696
So if you think about the GMOs
that we're all more familiar with,
