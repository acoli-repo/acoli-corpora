She was born a genetically modified
designer baby with numerous upgrades.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.080
Yeah. Upgrades.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.776
And these enhancements were introduced

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.336
using a new genetic
modification technology

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.136
that goes by the funny name CRISPR,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.856
you know, like something's crisp,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.200
this is CRISPR.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.816
The scientist that Jenna's parents
hired to do this

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.720
for several million dollars

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.440
introduced CRISPR
into a whole panel of human embryos.
