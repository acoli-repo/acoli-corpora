00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.856
if designer baby number one is born,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.096
within a few decades,

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.776
there could well be millions
of genetically modified humans.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.256
And there's a difference there too,
because if we, you in the audience, or I,

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.176
if we decide to have a designer baby,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.216
then their children will also
be genetically modified, and so on,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.536
because it's heritable.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.040
So that's a big difference.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.496
So with all of this in mind,

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.080
what should we do?

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.936
There's actually going to be a meeting

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.856
a month from tomorrow in Washington, D.C.
