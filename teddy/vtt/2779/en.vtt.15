00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.536
and other important elements of science.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.160
So there's a lot of good research
going on with CRISPR.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.416
And the fact that we can
now do genetic modifications

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.216
that used to take years
and cost millions of dollars

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.256
in a few weeks
for a couple thousand bucks,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.416
to me as a scientist that's fantastic,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.576
but again, at the same time,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.720
it opens the door to people going too far.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.736
And I think for some people

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.776
the focus is not going to be
so much on science.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.816
That's not what's going
to be driving them.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.360
It's going to be ideology
or the chase for a profit.
