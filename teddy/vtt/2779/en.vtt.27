But when we are going about
hacking the human code,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.696
I think all bets are off
in terms of what might come of that.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.360
There would still be dangers.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.056
And we can look in the past

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.696
to other elements
of transformative science

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.536
and see how they can
basically go out of control

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.120
and permeate society.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.360
So I'll just give you one example,
and that is in vitro fertilization.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.096
Almost exactly 40 years ago,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.816
test tube baby number one
Louise Brown was born,

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.096
and that's a great thing,
