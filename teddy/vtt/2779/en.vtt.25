00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.616
in our digital age --

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.296
viral videos, social media --

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.896
what if designer babies
are thought to be fashionable,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.056
and they kind of become
the new glitterati,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.816
the new Kardashians or something?

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.856
(Laughter)

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.416
You know, are those trends
that we really could control?

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.520
I'm not convinced that we could.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.816
So again, today it's Halloween

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.296
and when we talk
about genetic modification,

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.456
there's one Halloween-associated character

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.136
that is talked about
or invoked more than anything else,
