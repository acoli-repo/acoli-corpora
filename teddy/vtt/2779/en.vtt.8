00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.376
and I can see this new CRISPR technology

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.120
and its potential impact.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.216
And we may find ourselves in that reality,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.320
and a lot will depend
on what we decide to do today.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.456
And if you're still
kind of thinking in sci-fi mode,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.976
consider that the world of science
had a huge shock earlier this year,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.935
and the public largely
doesn't even know about it.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.736
Researchers in China just a few months ago

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.416
reported the creation
of genetically modified human embryos.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.976
This was the first time in history.
