00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.096
and that's a great thing,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.656
and I think since then
five million IVF babies have been born,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.336
bringing immeasurable happiness.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.496
A lot of parents now can love those kids.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.576
But if you think about it,
in four decades,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.496
five million babies being born
from a new technology

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.336
is pretty remarkable,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.576
and the same kind of thing could happen

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.176
with human genetic modification
and designer babies.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.376
So depending on the decisions
we make in the next few months,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.696
the next year or so,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.856
if designer baby number one is born,
