00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.496
And when my grandparents
had little baby Peter,

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.256
the world was very different. Right?

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.576
It was a different Vienna.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.176
The United States was different.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.456
The world was different.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.776
There was a eugenics rising,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.136
and my grandparents realized,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.576
pretty quickly I think,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.120
that they were on the wrong side
of the eugenics equation.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.216
And so despite this being their home

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.296
and their whole extended family's home,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.656
and this area being their family's
home for generations,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.696
they decided because of eugenics

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.960
that they had to leave.
