00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.696
So if you think about the GMOs
that we're all more familiar with,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.936
like GMO tomatoes and wheat

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.896
and things like that,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.536
this technology
is similar to the technologies

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.416
that were used to make those,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.816
but it's dramatically better,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.800
cheaper and faster.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.656
So what is it?

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.136
It's actually like
a genetic Swiss army knife.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.416
We can pretend this is a Swiss army knife

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.776
with different tools in it,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.936
and one of the tools
is kind of like a magnifying glass

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.400
or a GPS for our DNA,
