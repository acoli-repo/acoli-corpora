00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.616
And so in the meeting in December

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.096
and other meetings that are likely
to follow in the next few months,

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.256
it's very possible
there may be no moratorium.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.336
And I think part

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.416
is that all of this trend,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.536
this revolution in genetic modification

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.176

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.016
Nobody has been saying,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.096

this is a revolution,

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.376
and this could affect you
in very personal ways.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.216
And so part of my goal
is actually to change that
