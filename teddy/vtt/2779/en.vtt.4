00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.520
that Jenna is extraordinary.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.216
She's incredibly intelligent.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.496
If you're honest with yourself,
she's smarter than you,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.080
and she's five years old.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.936
She's beautiful, tall, athletic,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.440
and the list goes on and on.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.856
And in fact, there's
a whole new generation

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.120
of these GM kids like Jenna.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.056
And so far it looks like

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.416
they're healthier
than their parents' generation,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.176
than your generation.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.200
And they have lower health care costs.
