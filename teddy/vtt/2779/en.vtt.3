introduced CRISPR
into a whole panel of human embryos.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.056
And then they used genetic testing,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.136
and they predicted that
that little tiny embryo, Jenna's embryo,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.080
would be the best of the bunch.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.616
And now, Jenna is an actual, real person.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.856
She's sitting on the carpet
in your living room

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.360
playing with your daughter Marianne.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.176
And your families have known
each other for years now,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.616
and it's become very clear to you

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.520
that Jenna is extraordinary.
