A new browser called Brave

00:08:30.458 --> 00:08:33.970
empowers users with "Brave Shields" --
they literally call it that --

00:08:33.994 --> 00:08:38.995
by aggressively blocking
data-grabbing ads and trackers,

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.503
and avoid leaking data
like other browsers.

00:08:41.527 --> 00:08:46.470
In return, users can take back
some bargaining and pricing power.

00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:49.704
When users opt in to accept ads,

00:08:49.728 --> 00:08:53.105
Brave rewards users
with "basic attention tokens"

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:57.350
that can redeem content
behind paywalls from publishers.

00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:00.739
And I've been using Brave
for a few months.
