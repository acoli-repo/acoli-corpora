00:01:58.546 --> 00:02:04.484
We have all experienced how data
is shifting this major paradigm shift

00:02:04.508 --> 00:02:08.393
for our personal, economic
and political lives.

00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:11.115
Whoever owns the data owns the future.

00:02:11.553 --> 00:02:13.278
But who's producing the data?

00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:16.968
I assume everyone in this room
has a smartphone,

00:02:16.992 --> 00:02:18.484
several social media accounts

00:02:18.508 --> 00:02:21.458
and has done a Google search
or two in the past week.

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:24.281
We are all producing data. Yes.

00:02:24.948 --> 00:02:28.356
It is estimated that by 2030,
10 years from now,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.579
there will be about 125 billion
connected devices in the world.
