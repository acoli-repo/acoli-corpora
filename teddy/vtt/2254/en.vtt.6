00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.531
Data has immense value
but is centrally controlled and owned.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:05.418
You are all walking raw materials
for those large data companies,

00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:06.877
but none of you are paid.

00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:08.876
Not only that,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.270
you're not even considered
as part of this equation for income.

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.344
So once again,

00:03:15.368 --> 00:03:17.105
we are undoubtedly equal:

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.592
we're equally poor.

00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:22.043
Somebody else owns everything,
and we own nothing.

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:23.620
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:26.134
So what should we do?

00:03:26.158 --> 00:03:28.571
There might be some clues
in how my life turned out

00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:29.933
after that difficult start.

00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:32.376
Things began to look up
for my family in the '80s.
