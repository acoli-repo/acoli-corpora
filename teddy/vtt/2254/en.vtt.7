00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:32.376
Things began to look up
for my family in the '80s.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.879
The system evolved,

00:03:33.903 --> 00:03:37.635
and people began to be allowed
to own a piece of what we created.

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:39.836
"People diving into the ocean,"

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.208
or "xia hai," the Chinese term,

00:03:42.232 --> 00:03:45.531
described those who left
state-owned enterprise jobs

00:03:45.555 --> 00:03:47.330
and started their own businesses.

00:03:47.814 --> 00:03:49.801
Private ownership of a business

00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:52.905
became personal ownership of cars,

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:56.366
properties, food, clothes and things.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.261
The economic machine started rolling,

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:01.485
and people's lives began to improve.
