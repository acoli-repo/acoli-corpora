00:00:58.068 --> 00:01:02.214
what I'm going to talk about today
is about a new form of collective poverty

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:04.167
that many of us don't recognize

00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:06.345
and that urgently needs to be understood.

00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:09.280
I'm sure you've noticed
that in the past 20 years,

00:01:09.304 --> 00:01:11.080
that asset has emerged.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.562
It's been generating wealth
at a breakneck pace.

00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:18.663
As a tool, it has brought businesses
deep customer insights,

00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:20.325
operational efficiency

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:22.541
and enormous top-line growth.

00:01:23.018 --> 00:01:24.646
But for some,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.467
it has also provided a device
to manipulate a democratic election

00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:34.660
or perform surveillance
for profit or political purposes.
