00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:30.267
And obviously I'm not here to argue
that China has it all figured out.

00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:31.497
We haven't.

00:05:31.521 --> 00:05:35.707
Nor that data is fully comparable
to physical assets.

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:36.996
It is not.

00:05:37.726 --> 00:05:42.709
But my life experience allowed me
to see what's hiding in plain sight.

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:44.328
Currently, the public discourse

00:05:44.352 --> 00:05:48.359
is so focused on the regulatory
and privacy issue

00:05:48.383 --> 00:05:50.114
when it comes to data ownership.

00:05:50.138 --> 00:05:51.813
But I want to ask:

00:05:51.837 --> 00:05:55.053
What if we look at data ownership
in completely different ways?

00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:58.216
What if data ownership is, in fact,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.568
a personal, individual and economic issue?
