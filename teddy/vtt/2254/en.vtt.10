00:04:54.219 --> 00:05:00.580
China's extreme poverty rate in 1981,
when I was a little kid, was 88 percent.

00:05:00.604 --> 00:05:04.031
By 2015, 0.7 percent.

00:05:04.832 --> 00:05:06.576
I am a product of that success,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.692
and I am very happy to share that today,
I have my own AI business,

00:05:10.716 --> 00:05:13.414
and I lead a very worldly
and dynamic life,

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:17.483
a path that was unimaginable
when I was a kid in west China.

00:05:18.252 --> 00:05:22.096
Of course, this prosperity
came with a trade-off,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.510
with equality,
the environment and freedom.

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:30.267
And obviously I'm not here to argue
that China has it all figured out.
