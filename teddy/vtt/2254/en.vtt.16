Or, if we had the tools
to set our behavior data

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.313
at a price of, say,
100,000 US dollars,

00:08:05.337 --> 00:08:07.767
I doubt any political group
would be able to target

00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:09.663
or manipulate your vote.

00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:12.490
You control. You decide.

00:08:13.403 --> 00:08:15.950
Now, I know this sounds
probably implausible,

00:08:15.974 --> 00:08:17.654
but trends are already pointing to

00:08:17.678 --> 00:08:22.459

individual data ownership movement.

00:08:22.483 --> 00:08:24.947
First, start-ups
are already creating tools

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:27.337
to allow us to take back some control.
