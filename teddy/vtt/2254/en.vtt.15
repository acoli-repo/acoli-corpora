00:07:26.428 --> 00:07:30.629
We are always,
although often subconsciously,

00:07:30.653 --> 00:07:31.997
making such trade-offs

00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:36.072
based on our diverse personal beliefs
and life priorities.

00:07:36.096 --> 00:07:40.017
That is why data ownership
would be incomplete

00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:41.800
without a pricing power.

00:07:42.665 --> 00:07:45.335
By assigning pricing power to individuals,

00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:49.590
we gain a tool to reflect
our personal and nuanced preferences.

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:53.053
So, for example, you could choose
to donate your data for free

00:07:53.077 --> 00:07:56.722
if a contribution
to a particular medical research

00:07:56.746 --> 00:07:58.532
is very meaningful for you.

00:07:59.068 --> 00:08:02.006
Or, if we had the tools
to set our behavior data
