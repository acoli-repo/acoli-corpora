00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:01.485
and people's lives began to improve.

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:02.753
For the first time,

00:04:02.777 --> 00:04:05.385
to get rich was glorious.

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.472
So in the '90s, when I went
to study in Chengdu in west China,

00:04:10.496 --> 00:04:12.124
many young individuals like myself

00:04:12.148 --> 00:04:14.927
were well-positioned
to take advantage of the new system.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.034
After I graduated from my university,

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:21.241
I cofounded my first business
and moved to Shenzhen,

00:04:21.265 --> 00:04:25.744
the brand-new special economic zone
that used to be a fishing village.

00:04:25.768 --> 00:04:26.937
Twenty years later,

00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:31.366
Shenzhen has become
a global innovation powerhouse.
