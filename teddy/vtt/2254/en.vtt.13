What if we give that same definition

00:06:37.051 --> 00:06:39.531
or we trade it at our chosen price?

00:06:40.013 --> 00:06:41.687
Now, I know some of you might say,

00:06:41.711 --> 00:06:45.139

00:06:45.163 --> 00:06:48.448
But that, let me remind you,
is exactly what you're doing now,

00:06:48.472 --> 00:06:50.910
except you're giving
your data away for free.

00:06:51.576 --> 00:06:55.618

and nuanced issue.

00:06:55.642 --> 00:07:00.033
You might have the privilege
to prioritize your privacy over money,
