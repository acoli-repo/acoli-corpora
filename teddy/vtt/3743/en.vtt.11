00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:31.483
haptic feedback on your arm,

00:05:31.507 --> 00:05:34.867
delivered by these haptic arm bands
which have motors inside,

00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:36.462
and guide you as you move.

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:37.752
So, if we put it together,

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:40.101
as you're trying to track this motion,

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:43.289
if you deviate -- say, maybe,
your arm is a little too high --

00:05:43.313 --> 00:05:45.422
we turn on the motors
right there on the skin

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:47.217
to let you know you should move down,

00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:49.103
almost like a coach gently guiding you

00:05:49.127 --> 00:05:52.018
and helping you master
these movements more quickly

00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:53.891
and make more precise corrections.

00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:56.677
We developed this system
for use in stroke rehabilitation,

00:05:56.701 --> 00:05:59.005
but I think there are a lot
of applications,

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:03.239
like maybe dance training
or all sorts of sports training as well.
