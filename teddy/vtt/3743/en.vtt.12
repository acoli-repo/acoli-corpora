about the field of haptics,

00:06:06.003 --> 00:06:08.705
which I think you'll hear more
about in the coming years.

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.159
I've shown you three examples.

00:06:10.183 --> 00:06:11.534
I just want to take a moment

00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:14.766
to acknowledge the great students
who work with me in my lab at Penn

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.941
and my collaborators.

00:06:15.965 --> 00:06:17.122
They're a great group.

00:06:17.146 --> 00:06:20.044
I also want to thank you
for your kind attention.

00:06:20.068 --> 00:06:23.070
