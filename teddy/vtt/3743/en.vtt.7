00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.052
how to tell where in a patient's mouth
there are cavities.

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:33.597
Of course they look at X-rays,

00:03:33.621 --> 00:03:36.871
but a large part of this clinical judgment
comes from what they feel

00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:39.261
when they touch your teeth
with a dental explorer.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:41.293
You've all had this happen,
they go across.

00:03:41.317 --> 00:03:44.860
What they're feeling for is if the tooth
is really hard, then it's healthy,

00:03:44.884 --> 00:03:46.630
but if it's kind of soft and sticky,

00:03:46.654 --> 00:03:49.158
that's a signal that the enamel
is starting to decay.

00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:52.403
These types of judgments are hard
for a new dental student to make,

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:54.685
because they haven't touched
a lot of teeth yet.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.547
And you want them to learn this
before they start practicing

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:58.731
on real human patients.

00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:03.041
So what we do is add an accelerometer
on to the dental explorer,
