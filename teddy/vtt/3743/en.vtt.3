00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.993
Could I improve the interfaces
to computers and machines

00:01:32.017 --> 00:01:34.590
by letting you take
advantage of your hands?

00:01:34.614 --> 00:01:36.179
And indeed, I think we can,

00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:38.795
and that's at the core
of a field called haptics,

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.549
and this is the area that I work in.

00:01:40.573 --> 00:01:42.918
It's all about interactive
touch technology.

00:01:42.942 --> 00:01:44.095
And the way it works is,

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.624
as you move your body through the world,

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:49.932
if, as an engineer, I can make a system
that can measure that motion,

00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:52.486
and then present to you
sensations over time

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.754
that kind of make sense,

00:01:53.778 --> 00:01:56.452
that match up with what you might feel
in the real world,

00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:59.020
I can fool you into thinking
you're touching something

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:00.729
even though there's nothing there.
