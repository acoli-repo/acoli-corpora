00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:00.729
even though there's nothing there.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.369
So here are three examples

00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:05.503
and these are all done
from research in my lab at Penn.

00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:08.784
The first one is all about that same
problem that I was showing you:

00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:10.775
how can we capture how objects feel

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.796
and recreate those experiences?

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.819
So the way we solve this problem

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.908
is by creating a hand-held tool

00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:18.804
that has many different sensors inside.

00:02:18.828 --> 00:02:22.180
It has a force sensor, so we can tell
how hard you're pushing;

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:25.512
it has motion tracking, so we can tell
exactly where you've moved it;

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:28.226
and it has a vibration sensor,
an accelerometer, inside,

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.692
that detects the shaking
back and forth of the tool
