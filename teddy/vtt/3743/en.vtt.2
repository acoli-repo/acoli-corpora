This has to do with the position
of your body and how it's moving,

00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:01.727
and the forces you encounter.

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:03.648
And you're really good at incorporating

00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:05.878
both of these types of sensations together

00:01:05.902 --> 00:01:08.882
to understand the physical interactions
you have with the world

00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:10.731
and understand as you touch a surface:

00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:13.794
is it a rock, is it a cat,
is it a bunny, what is it?

00:01:13.818 --> 00:01:16.058
And so, as an engineer,

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:17.474
I'm really fascinated

00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:20.807
and I have a lot of respect
for how good people are with their hands.

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:22.733
And I'm intrigued and curious

00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:25.168
about whether we could
make technology better

00:01:25.192 --> 00:01:26.890
by doing a better job at leveraging

00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:29.036
the human capability
with the sense of touch.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.993
Could I improve the interfaces
to computers and machines
