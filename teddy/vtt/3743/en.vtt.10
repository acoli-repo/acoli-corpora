The last example I want to tell you about
is again about human movement.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.320
So if any of you have ever learned sports,

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.607
how do you get good
at something like surfing?

00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:05.782
You practice.

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.668
You practice some more and more, right?

00:05:07.692 --> 00:05:10.761
Making small corrections,
maybe getting some input from a coach,

00:05:10.785 --> 00:05:12.561
learning how to improve your motions.

00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:14.047
I think we could use computers

00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:16.667
to help make that process
more efficient and more fun.

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.651
And so here, for example,
if I have six different arm movements

00:05:19.675 --> 00:05:20.871
that I want you to learn,

00:05:20.895 --> 00:05:24.271
you come into my lab at Penn
and try out our system.

00:05:24.295 --> 00:05:27.754
We use a Kinect to measure your motions,
we show graphics on the screen,

00:05:27.778 --> 00:05:29.871
and then we also give you touch cues,

00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:31.483
haptic feedback on your arm,
