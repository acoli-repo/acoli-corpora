00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:03.041
So what we do is add an accelerometer
on to the dental explorer,

00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:04.998
and then we record what Dr. Maggio feels

00:04:05.022 --> 00:04:07.192
as she touches different extracted teeth.

00:04:07.216 --> 00:04:09.979
And we can play it back for you as a video

00:04:10.003 --> 00:04:11.656
with a touch track --

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.899
not just a sound track,
but also a touch track,

00:04:13.923 --> 00:04:16.249
that you can feel by holding
that repeating tool.

00:04:16.273 --> 00:04:19.566
You feel the same things the dentist
felt when they did the recording,

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.031
and practice making judgments.

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:22.217
So here's a sample one.

00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.730
Here's a tooth that looks
kind of suspicious, right?

00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:27.278
It has all those brown stains.

00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:30.785
You might be thinking, "We should
definitely put a filling in this tooth."
