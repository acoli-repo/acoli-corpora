But what I can't do is record and share

00:00:33.294 --> 00:00:36.643
how these objects feel to touch.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.207
And that's kind of surprising,

00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:40.496
because your sense of touch
is really important.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.390
It's involved in every physical
interaction you do every day,

00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:45.964
every manipulation task,
anything you do in the world.

00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:48.495
So the sense of touch
is actually pretty interesting.

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.161
It has two main components.

00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:52.522
The first is tactile sensations,

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:54.636
things you feel in your skin.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.918
And the second is kinesthetic sensations.

00:00:56.942 --> 00:01:00.132
This has to do with the position
of your body and how it's moving,
