00:02:58.658 --> 00:03:01.927
just like if you touched, dragged
back and forth, on the real canvas.

00:03:01.951 --> 00:03:03.892
We can create very compelling illusions.

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:07.486
We can do this for all kinds of surfaces
and it's really a lot of fun.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.427
We call it haptography --
haptic photography.

00:03:11.451 --> 00:03:14.231
And I think it has potential
benefits in all sorts of areas

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:16.961
like online shopping,
maybe interactive museum exhibits,

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:19.739
where you're not supposed
to touch the precious artifacts,

00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:21.139
but you always want to.

00:03:21.163 --> 00:03:24.841
The second example I want to tell you
about comes from a collaboration I have

00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:27.207
with Dr. Margrit Maggio
at the Penn Dental School.

00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:29.246
Part of her job is to teach
dental students

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.052
how to tell where in a patient's mouth
there are cavities.
