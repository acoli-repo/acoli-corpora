WEBVTT

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.692
that detects the shaking
back and forth of the tool

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.748
that lets you know
that's a piece of canvas

00:02:32.772 --> 00:02:34.794
and not a piece of silk or something else.

00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:37.457
Then we take the data we record
from these interactions.

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:38.775
Here's ten seconds of data.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.684
You can see how the vibrations
get larger and smaller,

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:43.184
depending on how you move.

00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:45.951
And we make a mathematical
model of those relationships

00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:48.394
and program them into a tablet computer

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:49.982
so that when you take the stylus

00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:51.435
and go and touch the screen,

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.289
that voice-coil actuator
in the white bracket

00:02:54.313 --> 00:02:56.580
plays vibrations to give you the illusion

00:02:56.604 --> 00:02:58.634
that you're touching the real surface,

00:02:58.658 --> 00:03:01.927
just like if you touched, dragged
back and forth, on the real canvas.
