You might be thinking, "We should
definitely put a filling in this tooth."

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:32.769
But if you pay attention to how it feels,

00:04:32.793 --> 00:04:35.427
all the surfaces of this tooth
are hard and healthy,

00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:37.710
so this patient does not need a filling.

00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:40.857
And these are exactly the kind
of judgments doctors make every day

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:43.953
and I think this technology
we've invented has a lot of potential

00:04:43.977 --> 00:04:47.428
for many different things in medical
training, because it's really simple

00:04:47.452 --> 00:04:50.998
and it does a great job at recreating
what people feel through tools.

00:04:51.022 --> 00:04:54.042
I think it could also help make games
more interactive and fun

00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:56.643
and more realistic
in the sensations that you feel.

00:04:56.667 --> 00:05:00.296
The last example I want to tell you about
is again about human movement.
