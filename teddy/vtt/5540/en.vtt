00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.708
You hear the gentle lap of waves,

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.913
the distant cawing of a seagull.

00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:15.820
But then an annoying whine
interrupts the peace,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.459
getting closer, and closer, and closer.

00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:21.568
Until...whack!

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:26.617
You dispatch the offending mosquito, 
and calm is restored.

00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:31.730
How did you detect that noise from afar
and target its maker with such precision?
