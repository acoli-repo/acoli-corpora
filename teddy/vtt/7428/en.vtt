Around the world and especially
in low-resource countries

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:05.877
like my home country of Kenya,

00:00:05.918 --> 00:00:08.296
mental health problems
prevent young people

00:00:08.337 --> 00:00:11.382
from living independent
and successful lives.

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:15.386
I was born and raised
in a small sugarcane farm.

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:18.806

are those of my younger brother and I

00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:22.101
walking around and pretending

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:26.105

were actually from school.

00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:29.317

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:31.611
made sure that I knew
how much they'd sacrificed
