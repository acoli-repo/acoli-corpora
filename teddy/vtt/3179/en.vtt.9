00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:30.073
so then they had to do
another surgery a year later,

00:04:30.097 --> 00:04:31.468
and then that took a year --

00:04:31.492 --> 00:04:32.749
two years in a wheelchair,

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:38.723
and that's when I came
into contact with actual reality:

00:04:38.747 --> 00:04:40.112
limits.

00:04:40.598 --> 00:04:43.628
Those very limits I'd spent
my whole life denying

00:04:43.652 --> 00:04:45.965
and pushing past and ignoring

00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:49.033
were real,

00:04:49.057 --> 00:04:51.394
and I had to deal with them,

00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:57.109
and they took imagination,
creativity and my entire skill set.

00:04:57.461 --> 00:05:01.842
It turned out I was great
at actual reality.
