I don't know about that --

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.748
but my life has certainly
been enriched by other people.

00:14:03.772 --> 00:14:04.977
By TED,

00:14:05.001 --> 00:14:08.160
which introduced me
to a whole network of people

00:14:08.184 --> 00:14:10.863
who have enriched my life,

00:14:10.887 --> 00:14:14.080
including Tricia McGillis,
my website designer,

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:16.469
who's working with my wonderful daughter

00:14:16.493 --> 00:14:20.031
to take my website
and turn it into something

00:14:20.055 --> 00:14:21.946
where all I have to do is write a blog.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.466
I don't have to use
the executive brain function ...

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:28.069
Ha, ha, ha, I win!

00:14:28.093 --> 00:14:29.192
(Laughter)

00:14:29.216 --> 00:14:31.874
And I am so grateful to you.
