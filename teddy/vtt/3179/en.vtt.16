00:07:56.725 --> 00:08:01.383
but it's as if you had asked Santa
for a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow

00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:04.119
and you had gotten
a salad spinner instead.

00:08:04.672 --> 00:08:07.020
You know, it's the beef --

00:08:07.044 --> 00:08:10.865
the beef with it is that it comes
with an expiration date.

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:12.683
Death is the deal breaker.

00:08:13.954 --> 00:08:15.105
I don't get that.

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:16.280
I don't understand --

00:08:16.304 --> 00:08:17.948
to me, it's disrespectful.

00:08:17.972 --> 00:08:19.855
It's disrespectful to nature.

00:08:20.404 --> 00:08:22.877
The idea that we're going
to dominate nature,

00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:25.083
we're going to master nature,

00:08:25.107 --> 00:08:28.987
nature is too weak
to withstand our intellect --

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.680
no, I don't think so.
