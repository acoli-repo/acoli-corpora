But the most outlandish concepts
make sense to me.

00:06:32.968 --> 00:06:34.357
The string theory;

00:06:34.381 --> 00:06:38.549
the idea that all of reality emanates
from the vibrations of these teeny --

00:06:38.573 --> 00:06:40.485
I call it "The Big Twang."

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:41.768
(Laughter)

00:06:42.405 --> 00:06:44.402
Wave-particle duality:

00:06:44.426 --> 00:06:48.067
the idea that one thing
can manifest as two things ...

00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:49.242
you know?

00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:53.088

as a wave and a particle

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:55.473
coincided with my deepest intuitions

00:06:55.497 --> 00:06:57.180
that people are good and bad,

00:06:57.204 --> 00:06:59.294
ideas are right and wrong.

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.598
Freud was right about penis envy
