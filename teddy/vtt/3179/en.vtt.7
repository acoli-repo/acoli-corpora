00:03:25.641 --> 00:03:30.047
And I'm staring at the present
they sent me to celebrate my arrival --

00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:35.165
not the Lalique vase or the grand piano
I've heard of other people getting,

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.546
but a three-foot-tall,
stuffed Mickey Mouse

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.585
(Laughter)

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.467
with a catalog, in case I wanted
to order some more stuff

00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.495
that didn't jibe with my aesthetic.

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.556
(Laughter)

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.326
And when I looked up in the catalog

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.708
to see how much
this three-foot-high mouse cost,

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.556
here's how it was described ...

00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:57.931
"Life-sized."

00:03:57.955 --> 00:04:02.793
(Laughter)
