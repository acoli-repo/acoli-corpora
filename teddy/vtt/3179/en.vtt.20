I hope you're willing
to come with me on this,

00:10:02.463 --> 00:10:08.083
but my real problem with the mindset
that is so out to defeat death

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:11.867
is if you're anti-death,

00:10:11.891 --> 00:10:14.288
which to me translates as anti-life,

00:10:14.312 --> 00:10:18.173
which to me translates as anti-nature,

00:10:18.197 --> 00:10:21.328
it also translates to me as anti-woman,

00:10:21.352 --> 00:10:25.658
because women have long been
identified with nature.

00:10:25.682 --> 00:10:27.924
And my source on this is Hannah Arendt,

00:10:27.948 --> 00:10:31.575
the German philosopher who wrote
a book called "The Human Condition."
