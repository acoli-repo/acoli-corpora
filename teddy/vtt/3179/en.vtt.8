00:03:57.955 --> 00:04:02.793
(Laughter)

00:04:02.817 --> 00:04:04.476
And that's when I knew.

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:07.273
Reality wasn't "reality."

00:04:07.297 --> 00:04:09.255
Reality was an imposter.

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:14.438
So I dived into quantum physics
and chaos theory

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:16.608
to try to find actual reality,

00:04:16.632 --> 00:04:18.277
and I've just finished a movie --

00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:20.501
yes, finally finished --

00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:21.703
about all that,

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:23.032
so I won't go into it here,

00:04:23.056 --> 00:04:25.522
and anyway, it wasn't until
after we shot the movie,

00:04:25.546 --> 00:04:27.608
when I broke my leg
and then it didn't heal,

00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:30.073
so then they had to do
another surgery a year later,
