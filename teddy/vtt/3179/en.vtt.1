00:00:27.543 --> 00:00:30.200
not everybody can take
so cavalier an attitude.

00:00:30.224 --> 00:00:31.748
I don't have young children.

00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:36.043
I have a grown daughter who's
brilliant and happy and wonderful.

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:39.696
I don't have huge financial stress.

00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:42.721
My cancer isn't that aggressive.

00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:44.965
It's kind of like
the Democratic leadership --

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.672
(Laughter)

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:50.562
not convinced it can win.

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:52.236
It's basically just sitting there,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.596
waiting for Goldman Sachs
to give it some money.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.635
(Laughter)

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.548
(Applause)
