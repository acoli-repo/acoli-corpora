00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.680
no, I don't think so.

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:36.475
I think if you've actually read
quantum physics as I have --

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:39.371
well, I read an email
from someone who'd read it, but --

00:08:39.395 --> 00:08:43.268
(Laughter)

00:08:43.292 --> 00:08:44.539
You have to understand

00:08:44.563 --> 00:08:48.396
that we don't live in Newton's
clockwork universe anymore.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.625
We live in a banana peel universe,

00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:55.329
and we won't ever be able
to know everything

00:08:55.353 --> 00:08:56.999
or control everything

00:08:57.023 --> 00:08:58.506
or predict everything.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.737
Nature is like a self-driving car.
