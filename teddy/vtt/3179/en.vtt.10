00:04:57.461 --> 00:05:01.842

I fell in love.

00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:07.107

00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:11.113
given my equally shaky
relationship with the zeitgeist ...

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:16.363
I'll just say, if anyone
is in the market for a Betamax --

the rest of the country would decide
to go in the opposite direction.

00:05:25.963 --> 00:05:28.272
(Laughter)

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:32.841
But I'm not here to talk about Trump
or the alt-right or climate-change deniers
