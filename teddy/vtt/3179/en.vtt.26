00:12:57.075 --> 00:13:03.117
I look at death now from the point of view
of a German biologist,

00:13:03.141 --> 00:13:04.596
Andreas Weber,

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.222
who looks at it as part
of the gift economy.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:11.024
You're given this enormous gift, life,

00:13:11.048 --> 00:13:13.391
you enrich it as best you can,

00:13:13.415 --> 00:13:15.475
and then you give it back.

00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:19.352
And, you know, Auntie Mame
said, "Life is a banquet" --

00:13:19.376 --> 00:13:21.487
well, I've eaten my fill.

00:13:22.126 --> 00:13:24.397
I have had an enormous appetite for life,

00:13:24.421 --> 00:13:25.644
I've consumed life,

00:13:25.668 --> 00:13:28.303
but in death, I'm going to be consumed.

00:13:28.327 --> 00:13:31.778
I'm going into the ground
just the way I am,
