00:01:28.594 --> 00:01:32.832
(Laughter)

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:36.785
But what if you don't have my advantages?

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:40.483
The only advice I can give you
is to do what I did:

00:01:40.507 --> 00:01:43.203
make friends with reality.

00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:47.406
You couldn't have a worse relationship
with reality than I did.

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:50.491
From the get-go,

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:52.837
I wasn't even attracted to reality.

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:56.083
If they'd had Tinder when I met reality,

00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:57.297
I would have swiped left

00:01:57.321 --> 00:01:59.314
and the whole thing would have been over.

00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:01.004
