(Laughter)

00:02:01.028 --> 00:02:03.017
And reality and I --

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:06.436
we don't share the same values,
the same goals --

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.467
(Laughter)

00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:10.190
To be honest, I don't have goals;

00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:11.815
I have fantasies.

00:02:12.388 --> 00:02:16.078
They're exactly like goals
but without the hard work.

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:18.052
(Laughter)

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:19.505
(Applause)

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.775
I'm not a big fan of hard work,

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.697
but you know reality --

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:27.690
it's either push, push, push, push, push

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:32.027
through its agent,
the executive brain function --
