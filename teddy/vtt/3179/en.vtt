I'm going to first tell you something that
in my grandmother

00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:07.261
would've elicited a five-oy alarm:

00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:08.548
"Oy-oy-oy-oy-oy."

00:00:08.572 --> 00:00:09.722
(Laughter)

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:13.031
And here it is ...
are you ready?

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:14.672
OK.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.466
I have stage IV lung cancer.

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.571
Oh, I know, "poor me."

00:00:21.595 --> 00:00:22.837
I don't feel that way.

00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:24.912
I'm so OK with it.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.519
And granted, I have certain advantages --

00:00:27.543 --> 00:00:30.200
not everybody can take
so cavalier an attitude.
