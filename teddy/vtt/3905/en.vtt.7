00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:30.156
plants have the capacity,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.156
as photosynthetic organisms, to help out.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.301
So we're hoping that's what they'll do.

00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:38.511
But there's a catch here.

00:03:38.535 --> 00:03:40.773
We have to help the plants
a little ourselves,

00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:45.744
because what plants like to do
is put most of the CO2 into sugars.

00:03:45.768 --> 00:03:48.315
And when the end
of the growing season comes,

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:50.696
the plant dies and decomposes,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.593
and then all that work they did
to suck out the CO2 from the atmosphere

00:03:55.617 --> 00:03:58.847
and make carbon-based biomass

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:03.340
is now basically going right back up
in the atmosphere as CO2.
