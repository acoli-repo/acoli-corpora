00:06:29.287 --> 00:06:30.490
Here we go.

00:06:31.204 --> 00:06:32.354
OK.

00:06:33.634 --> 00:06:37.786
You have to remember
three simple things from my talk, OK?

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.125
We have to get plants to make more suberin
than they normally make,

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:45.106
because we need them to be
a little better than what they are.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.498
We have to get them to make more roots,

00:06:49.522 --> 00:06:52.260
because if we make more roots,
we can make more suberin --

00:06:52.284 --> 00:06:57.037
now we have more of the cells
that suberin likes to accumulate in.

00:06:57.061 --> 00:07:00.490
And then the third thing is,
we want the plants to have deeper roots.
