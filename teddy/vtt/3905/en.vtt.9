00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:30.843
There's hundreds of them in this molecule.

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:33.263
And where you see those few red dots,

00:04:33.287 --> 00:04:34.443
those are oxygens.

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:36.882
And oxygen is what microbes like to find

00:04:36.906 --> 00:04:39.236
so they can decompose a plant.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.910
So you can see why this is
a perfect carbon storage device.

00:04:42.934 --> 00:04:48.047
And actually it can stabilize
the carbon that gets fixed by the plant

00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:51.954
into something that's a little bit
better for the plant.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.586
And so, why now?

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.180
Why is now a good time to do
a biological solution to this problem?
