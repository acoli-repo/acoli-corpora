00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:02.857
I recently had an epiphany.

00:00:03.183 --> 00:00:07.000
I realized that I could
actually play a role

00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:12.696
in solving one of the biggest problems
that faces mankind today,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.029
and that is the problem of climate change.

00:00:16.497 --> 00:00:20.601
It also dawned on me that
I had been working for 30 years or more

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:22.546
just to get to this point in my life

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.461
where I could actually make
this contribution to a bigger problem.

00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:29.070
And every experiment
that I have done in my lab

00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:31.087
over the last 30 years
