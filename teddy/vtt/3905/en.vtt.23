00:11:28.324 --> 00:11:30.811
That's what scientists are mostly like.

00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:34.943
But we know now that, you know,
no one can really deny --

00:11:34.967 --> 00:11:38.156
the climate is changing,
everyone knows that.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.276
And it's here and it's bad
and it's serious,

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.149
and we need to do something about it.

00:11:42.173 --> 00:11:45.220
But I feel pretty optimistic
that we can do this.

00:11:45.244 --> 00:11:49.514
So I'm here today
as a character witness for plants.

00:11:49.538 --> 00:11:52.459
And I want to tell you
that plants are going to do it for us,

00:11:52.483 --> 00:11:54.666
all we have to do
is give them a little help,

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.211
and they will go and get
a gold medal for humanity.

00:11:57.235 --> 00:11:58.647
Thank you very much.

00:11:58.671 --> 00:12:02.658
