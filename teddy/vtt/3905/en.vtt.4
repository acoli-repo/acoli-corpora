CO2 is the star of my talk.

00:02:01.998 --> 00:02:06.299
Now, most of you probably think
of CO2 as a pollutant.

00:02:06.323 --> 00:02:11.102
Or perhaps you think of CO2
as the villain in the novel, you know?

00:02:11.126 --> 00:02:13.690
It's always the dark side of CO2.

00:02:14.174 --> 00:02:18.974
But as a plant biologist,
I see the other side of CO2, actually.

00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:22.180
And that CO2 that we see,

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:26.864
we see it differently because
I think we remember, as plant biologists,

00:02:26.888 --> 00:02:28.728
something you may have forgotten.

00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:33.608
And that is that plants actually
do this process called photosynthesis.
