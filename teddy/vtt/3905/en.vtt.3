00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.974
I've had Parkinson's
for the last 15 years,

00:01:31.998 --> 00:01:35.362
and this gives me a sense of urgency
that I want to do this now,

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:38.974
while I feel good enough
to really be part of this team.

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.213
And I have an incredible team.

00:01:41.237 --> 00:01:43.512
We all work together,

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:47.403
and this is something we want to do
because we have fun.

00:01:47.427 --> 00:01:50.829
And if you're only going to have
five people trying to save the planet,

00:01:50.853 --> 00:01:52.156
you better like each other,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.952
because you're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:56.026
(Laughter)

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.655
OK, alright. But enough about me.

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.362
Let's talk about CO2.

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:01.489
CO2 is the star of my talk.
