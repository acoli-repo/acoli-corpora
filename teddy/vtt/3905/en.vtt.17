00:08:29.735 --> 00:08:31.156
This shows one result,

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.046
where we have a plant here on the right

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.820
that's making more than double
the amount of root

00:08:35.844 --> 00:08:37.175
than the plant on the left,

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:39.892
and that's just because of the way
we expressed one gene

00:08:39.916 --> 00:08:41.370
that's normally in the plant

00:08:41.394 --> 00:08:45.887
in a slightly different way
than the plant usually does on its own.

00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:48.871
Alright, so that's just one example
I wanted to show you.

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:50.966
And now I want to tell you that, you know,

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.248
we still have a lot
of challenges, actually,

00:08:53.272 --> 00:08:54.998
when we get to this problem,

00:08:55.022 --> 00:08:57.307
because it takes ...

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.993
We have to get the farmers
to actually buy the seeds,
