00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.752
and we are doing it actually,
in the model plant, Arabidopsis,

00:07:33.776 --> 00:07:36.650
which allows us to do these
experiments much faster

00:07:36.674 --> 00:07:39.958
than we can do in another big plant.

00:07:39.982 --> 00:07:43.728
And when we find that we have plants
where traits all add up

00:07:43.752 --> 00:07:46.863
and we can get more of them,
more suberin in those plants,

00:07:46.887 --> 00:07:48.275
we're going to move it all --

00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:50.882
we can and we we will,
we're beginning to do this --

00:07:50.906 --> 00:07:52.505
move it to crop plants.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:57.244
And I'll tell you why we're picking
crop plants to do the work for us

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:59.653
when I get to that part of my talk.
