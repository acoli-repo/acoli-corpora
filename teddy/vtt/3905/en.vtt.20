00:09:57.483 --> 00:10:01.816
And the climate change is actually
causing loss of yield all over the earth.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.903
So why would farmers
want to buy seeds

00:10:04.927 --> 00:10:06.379
if it's going to impact yield?

00:10:06.403 --> 00:10:08.434
So we're not going to let it impact yield,

00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:10.657
we're going to always have
checks and balances

00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:13.871
that says go or no go on that experiment.

00:10:13.895 --> 00:10:17.964
And then the second thing is,
when a plant actually makes more carbon

00:10:17.988 --> 00:10:19.855
and buries it in the soil like that,

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:23.434
almost all the soils on earth
are actually depleted of carbon

00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:26.181
because of the load from agriculture,

00:10:26.205 --> 00:10:28.681
trying to feed eight billion people,

00:10:28.705 --> 00:10:31.001
which is what lives
on the earth right now.
