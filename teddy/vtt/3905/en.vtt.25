00:12:27.815 --> 00:12:30.082
you may be able to offer the world

00:12:31.895 --> 00:12:36.909
seed variants for the major crops,
like -- what? -- wheat, corn, maybe rice,

00:12:38.331 --> 00:12:41.768
that can offer farmers just as much yield,

00:12:41.792 --> 00:12:46.811
sequester three times, four times,
more carbon than they currently do?

00:12:47.315 --> 00:12:48.466
Even more than that?

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.765
Joanne Chory: We don't know
that number, really.

00:12:50.789 --> 00:12:52.363
But they will do more.

00:12:52.387 --> 00:12:53.769
CA: And at the same time,

00:12:53.793 --> 00:12:57.211
make the soil that those
farmers have more fertile?

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:58.385
JC: Yes, right.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:00.680
CA: So that is astonishing.
