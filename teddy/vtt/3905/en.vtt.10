00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.180
Why is now a good time to do
a biological solution to this problem?

00:05:00.204 --> 00:05:04.297
It's because over the last
30 or so years --

00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:07.339
and I know that's a long time,
you're saying, "Why now?" --

00:05:07.363 --> 00:05:09.653
but 30 years ago, we began to understand

00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:13.283
the functions of all the genes
that are in an organism in general.

00:05:13.307 --> 00:05:16.895
And that included humans as well as plants

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.743
and many other complicated eukaryotes.

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:23.196
And so, what did the 1980s begin?

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.403
What began then is that we now know

00:05:25.427 --> 00:05:27.954
the function of many of the genes
that are in a plant

00:05:27.978 --> 00:05:29.403
that tell a plant to grow.

00:05:29.427 --> 00:05:34.133
And that has now converged
with the fact that we can do genomics
