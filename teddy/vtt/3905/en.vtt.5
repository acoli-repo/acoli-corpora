00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:33.608
And that is that plants actually
do this process called photosynthesis.

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:35.672
And when they do photosynthesis --

00:02:35.696 --> 00:02:39.434
all carbon-based life on our earth

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:44.903
is all because of the CO2 that plants
and other photosynthetic microbes

00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:49.317
have dragged in from CO2
that was in the atmosphere.

00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:52.929
And almost all of the carbon in your body
came from air, basically.

00:02:52.953 --> 00:02:54.445
So you come from air,

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.175
and it's because of photosynthesis,

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.791
because what plants do
is they use the energy in sunlight,

00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:02.680
take that CO2 and fix it into sugars.
