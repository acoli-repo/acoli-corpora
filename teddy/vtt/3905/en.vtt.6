take that CO2 and fix it into sugars.

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:04.360
It's a great thing.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.463
And the other thing
that is really important

for what I'm going to tell you today

is that plants and other
photosynthetic microbes

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:14.458
have a great capacity for doing this --

00:03:14.482 --> 00:03:18.789

00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:26.347
at cutting our emissions and things,

00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:30.156
plants have the capacity,
