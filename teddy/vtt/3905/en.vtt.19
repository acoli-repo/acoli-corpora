00:09:26.454 --> 00:09:30.742
we have wasted ecosystems that aren't
really going to be able to handle

00:09:30.766 --> 00:09:34.192
all the load they have to take
from agriculture.

00:09:34.567 --> 00:09:38.853
And then we also have
this competition for land.

00:09:39.209 --> 00:09:44.450
And so we figure, to do this
carbon sequestration experiment

00:09:44.474 --> 00:09:48.791
actually requires a fair amount of land.

00:09:48.815 --> 00:09:51.355
We can't take it away from food,

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:54.895
because we have to feed the people
that are also going to be on the earth

00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:57.459
until we get past this big crisis.

00:09:57.483 --> 00:10:01.816
And the climate change is actually
causing loss of yield all over the earth.
