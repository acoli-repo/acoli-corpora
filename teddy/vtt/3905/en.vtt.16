00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:04.117
OK, so I think this is the science
behind the whole thing.

00:08:04.141 --> 00:08:08.085
And so I know we can do the science,
I feel pretty confident about that.

00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:10.410
And the reason is because,
just in the last year,

00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:14.777
we've been able to find single genes
that affect each of those three traits.

00:08:15.307 --> 00:08:19.315
And in several of those cases,
two out of the three,

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:21.720
we have more than one way to get there.

00:08:21.744 --> 00:08:25.156
So that tells us we might be able
to even combine within a trait

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.913
and get even more suberin.

00:08:29.735 --> 00:08:31.156
This shows one result,
