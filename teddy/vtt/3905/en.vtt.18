00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.993
We have to get the farmers
to actually buy the seeds,

00:09:01.017 --> 00:09:03.469
or at least the seed company to buy seeds

00:09:03.493 --> 00:09:05.730
that farmers are going to want to have.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.485
And so when we do the experiments,

00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:12.212
we can't actually take a loss in yield,

00:09:12.236 --> 00:09:15.228
because while we are doing
these experiments,

00:09:15.252 --> 00:09:17.974
say, beginning about 10 years from now,

00:09:17.998 --> 00:09:21.184
the earth's population will be
even more than it is right now.

00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:23.752
And it's rapidly growing still.

00:09:23.776 --> 00:09:26.430
So by the end of the century,
we have 11 billion people,

00:09:26.454 --> 00:09:30.742
we have wasted ecosystems that aren't
really going to be able to handle
