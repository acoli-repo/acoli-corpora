00:05:57.673 --> 00:06:01.106
Then finally, we have these little
genetic tricks that came along,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.903
like you heard about this morning --

00:06:03.927 --> 00:06:06.186
things like CRISPR,
that allows us to do editing

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.713
and make genes be a little different
from the normal state in the plant.

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:13.458
OK, so now we have biology on our side.

00:06:13.482 --> 00:06:17.236
I'm a biologist, so that's why
I'm proposing a solution

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.141
to the climate change problem

00:06:20.165 --> 00:06:25.522
that really involves the best evolved
organism on earth to do it -- plants.

00:06:25.546 --> 00:06:27.267
So how are we going to do it?

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.263
Biology comes to the rescue.

00:06:29.287 --> 00:06:30.490
Here we go.
