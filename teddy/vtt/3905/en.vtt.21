00:10:28.705 --> 00:10:31.001
which is what lives
on the earth right now.

00:10:31.372 --> 00:10:33.919
And so, that is also a problem as well.

00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:39.705
Plants that are making more carbon,
those soils become enriched in carbon.

00:10:39.729 --> 00:10:44.364
And carbon-enriched soils
actually hold nitrogen

00:10:44.388 --> 00:10:46.640
and they hold sulphur
and they hold phosphate --

00:10:46.664 --> 00:10:50.260
all the minerals that are required
for plants to grow and have a good yield.

00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:53.236
And they also retain water
in the soil as well.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.610
So the suberin will break up
into little particles

00:10:55.634 --> 00:10:58.156
and give the whole soil a new texture.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.887
And as we've shown that
we can get more carbon in that soil,
