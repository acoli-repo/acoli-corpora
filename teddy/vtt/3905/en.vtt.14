00:06:57.061 --> 00:07:00.490
And then the third thing is,
we want the plants to have deeper roots.

00:07:00.514 --> 00:07:02.236
And what that does is --

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.927
we're asking the plant, actually,
"OK, make stable carbon,

00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:07.395
more than you used to,

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:09.744
and then bury it for us in the ground."

00:07:09.768 --> 00:07:12.213
So they can do that
if they make roots that go deep

00:07:12.237 --> 00:07:15.847
rather than meander around
on the surface of the soil.

00:07:15.871 --> 00:07:18.559
Those are the three traits
we want to change:

00:07:18.583 --> 00:07:23.490
more suberin, more roots,
and the last one, deep roots.

00:07:23.514 --> 00:07:26.268
Then we want to combine
all those traits in one plant,

00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:29.276
and we can do that easily
and we will do it,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.752
and we are doing it actually,
in the model plant, Arabidopsis,
