00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:03.340
is now basically going right back up
in the atmosphere as CO2.

00:04:03.364 --> 00:04:09.737
So how can we get plants to redistribute
the CO2 they bring in

00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.172
into something that's
a little more stable?

00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:15.839
And so it turns out
that plants make this product,

00:04:15.863 --> 00:04:17.485
and it's called suberin.

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.822
This is a natural product
that is in all plant roots.

00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:22.491
And suberin is really cool,

00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:25.212
because as you can see there, I hope,

00:04:25.236 --> 00:04:28.755
everywhere you see a black dot,
that's a carbon.

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:30.843
There's hundreds of them in this molecule.
