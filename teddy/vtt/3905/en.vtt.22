00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.887
And as we've shown that
we can get more carbon in that soil,

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.847
the soil will get darker.

00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.926
And so we will be able
to measure all that,

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.990
and hopefully, this is going to help
us solve the problem.

00:11:10.363 --> 00:11:11.799
So, OK.

00:11:11.823 --> 00:11:15.728
So we have the challenges of
a lot of land that we need to use,

00:11:15.752 --> 00:11:17.375
we have to get farmers to buy it,

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:20.014
and that's going to be
the hard thing for us, I think,

00:11:20.038 --> 00:11:22.936
because we're not really salesmen,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.974
we're people who like to Google a person
rather than meet them,

00:11:25.998 --> 00:11:27.264
you know what I mean?

00:11:27.288 --> 00:11:28.300
(Laughter)

00:11:28.324 --> 00:11:30.811
That's what scientists are mostly like.
