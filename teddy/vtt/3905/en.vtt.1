00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:31.087
over the last 30 years

00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:35.299
and people who work for me
did in my lab over the last 30 years

00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:39.577
has been directed toward doing
the really big experiment,

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:41.534
this one last big experiment.

00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:43.022
So who am I?

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:45.149
I'm a plant geneticist.

00:00:45.173 --> 00:00:49.410
I live in a world where there's
too much CO2 in the atmosphere

00:00:49.434 --> 00:00:52.998
because of human activity.

00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:56.466
But I've come to appreciate the plants

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.622
as amazing machines that they are,

00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:02.600
whose job has been, really,
to just suck up CO2.
