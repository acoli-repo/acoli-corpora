00:05:29.427 --> 00:05:34.133
And that has now converged
with the fact that we can do genomics

00:05:34.157 --> 00:05:37.283
in a faster and cheaper way
than we ever did before.

00:05:37.307 --> 00:05:41.307
And what that tells us is that
all life on earth is really related,

00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:46.728
but plants are more related to each other
than other organisms.

00:05:46.752 --> 00:05:50.006
And that you can take a trait
that you know from one plant

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.237
and put it in another plant,

00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:55.756
and you can make a prediction
that it'll do the same thing.

00:05:56.093 --> 00:05:57.649
And so that's important as well.

00:05:57.673 --> 00:06:01.106
Then finally, we have these little
genetic tricks that came along,
