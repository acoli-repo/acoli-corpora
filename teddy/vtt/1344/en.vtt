This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What looks like moss covering rocks

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is actually a shrub

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
comprised of thousands of branches,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and so densely packed together

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that you could actually stand on top of it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and it happens to be 3,000 years old.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It also happens to be a relative of parsley.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For the past five years, I've been researching,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
working with biologists
