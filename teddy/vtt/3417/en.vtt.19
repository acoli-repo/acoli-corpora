00:09:29.927 --> 00:09:32.537
very efficiently in one place,

to take all the decisions in one place,

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:40.196
and then centralized data processing
will be more efficient

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.420
than distributed data processing.

00:09:43.053 --> 00:09:46.813
And then the main handicap
of authoritarian regimes

00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:48.474

00:09:48.498 --> 00:09:53.014
their attempt to concentrate

00:09:53.038 --> 00:09:56.404
it will become their greatest advantage.

00:09:58.768 --> 00:10:03.675
Another technological danger
that threatens the future of democracy
