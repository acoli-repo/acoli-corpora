When I see these movies,
I never understand --

00:05:33.315 --> 00:05:39.820
why would anybody be tempted to follow
a disgusting creep like Voldemort?

00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:44.411
The problem with evil
is that in real life,

00:05:44.435 --> 00:05:47.326
evil doesn't necessarily look ugly.

00:05:47.688 --> 00:05:49.580
It can look very beautiful.

00:05:50.354 --> 00:05:53.077
This is something that
Christianity knew very well,

00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:56.807
which is why in Christian art,
as [opposed to] Hollywood,

00:05:56.831 --> 00:06:00.699
Satan is usually depicted
as a gorgeous hunk.
