00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.204
Well, it's a bit difficult to say,

00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:33.695
because we've forgotten what fascism is.

00:00:34.498 --> 00:00:37.077
People now use the term "fascist"

00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:40.109
as a kind of general-purpose abuse.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:44.080
Or they confuse fascism with nationalism.

00:00:44.863 --> 00:00:50.251
So let's take a few minutes
to clarify what fascism actually is,

00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:53.395
and how it is different from nationalism.

00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:58.879
The milder forms of nationalism
have been among the most benevolent

00:00:58.903 --> 00:01:00.361
of human creations.
