00:13:57.973 --> 00:14:00.837
just break that mirror.

00:14:01.696 --> 00:14:02.847
Thank you.

00:14:02.871 --> 00:14:09.253
(Applause)

00:14:10.677 --> 00:14:12.309
Chris Anderson: Yuval, thank you.

00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:13.484
Goodness me.

00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.898
It's so nice to see you again.

00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:17.513
So, if I understand you right,

00:14:17.537 --> 00:14:20.204
you're alerting us
to two big dangers here.

00:14:20.228 --> 00:14:24.720
One is the possible resurgence
of a seductive form of fascism,

00:14:24.744 --> 00:14:28.998
but close to that, dictatorships
that may not exactly be fascistic,

00:14:29.022 --> 00:14:31.585
but control all the data.
