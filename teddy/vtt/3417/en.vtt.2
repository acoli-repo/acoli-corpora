00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:10.894
For example, I don't know
the eight million people

00:01:10.918 --> 00:01:13.474
who share my Israeli citizenship.

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.276
But thanks to nationalism,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.106
we can all care about one another
and cooperate effectively.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.650
This is very good.

00:01:22.093 --> 00:01:27.831

imagine that without nationalism,

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:31.645
the world will be a peaceful paradise.
