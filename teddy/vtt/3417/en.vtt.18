00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:03.744
it was simply inefficient to try
and concentrate too much data

00:09:03.768 --> 00:09:06.527
and too much power in one place.

00:09:07.244 --> 00:09:11.727
But it is not a law of nature

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:17.355
that centralized data processing
is always less efficient

00:09:17.379 --> 00:09:19.926
than distributed data processing.

00:09:20.605 --> 00:09:24.042
With the rise of artificial intelligence
and machine learning,

00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:29.903
it might become feasible to process
enormous amounts of information

00:09:29.927 --> 00:09:32.537
very efficiently in one place,
