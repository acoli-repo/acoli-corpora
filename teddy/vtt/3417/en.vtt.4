like Congo and Somalia and Afghanistan,

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.553
tend to be violent and poor.

00:02:04.855 --> 00:02:08.993
So what is fascism, and how
is it different from nationalism?

00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:15.344
Well, nationalism tells me
that my nation is unique,

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:19.169
and that I have special obligations
towards my nation.

00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:25.847
Fascism, in contrast, tells me
that my nation is supreme,

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:29.783
and that I have exclusive
obligations towards it.
