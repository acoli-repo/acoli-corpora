00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.835
if it's a corporation
and it really controls the data,

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.787
this is our real government.

00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:05.878
So the difference
is more apparent than real.

CA: But somehow,
at least with corporations,

00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:12.930
you can imagine market mechanisms

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:27.546
YNH: Well, we are not there yet,

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:32.728
but again, if a corporation really
knows you better than you know yourself --
