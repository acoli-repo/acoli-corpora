00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The big residual

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
is always value for money.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
All the time we are trying to get value for money.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What we don't look for

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is value for many,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
while we are generating value for money.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Do we care about those four billion people

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
whose income levels are less than two dollars a day,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the so-called bottom of the pyramid?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What are the challenges in getting value for money

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
as well as value for many?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We have described here

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in terms of the performance

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and the price.
