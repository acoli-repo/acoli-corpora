00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:03.714
According to the American
Academy of Ophthalmology,

00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:06.928
we create 15 to 30 gallons
of tears a year.

00:00:07.484 --> 00:00:10.417
I am what you would call
a high-volume producer.

00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:13.839
Now even though we do create
less tears as we age,

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:16.053
I figure by the time I'm 80,

00:00:16.077 --> 00:00:19.149
I will have filled up 40
average-sized bath tubs.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.442
Now crying in my early years?

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.395
Not something I would brag about.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:24.752
When I was five,

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:27.403
I thought it was a good idea
to practice writing my name

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.633
on the side of the house.

00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:29.839
Outside the house.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.494
Momma didn't agree with me much.
