00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that I gave to relieve my own suffering,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
not someone else's.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The truth be told, I was giving out of that place,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
not out of a genuine place of hope

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and excitement to help and of generosity.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It became a transaction for me,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
became sort of a trade.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I was purchasing something --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I was buying my right to go on with my day

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And I think the way that we go through that sometimes

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
can, first of all,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.
