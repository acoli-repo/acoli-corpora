00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that were never going away, that would always be with us.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which I was excited to do,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
but I didn't know how it was going to work.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
especially if the problem was never going away.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
In the years following,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the other stories I heard about the poor growing up

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
were no more positive.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
For example, I saw pictures and images

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
frequently of sadness and suffering.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.
