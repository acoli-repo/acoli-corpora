00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
to me, Kiva's really about stories.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
It's about retelling

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the story of the poor,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and it's about giving ourselves

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
an opportunity to engage

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
that validates their dignity,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
validates a partnership relationship,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
not a relationship that's based

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
weirdness that can happen.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But instead a relationship that can promote respect

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and hope

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and this optimism

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that together we can move forward.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So what I hope is that,
