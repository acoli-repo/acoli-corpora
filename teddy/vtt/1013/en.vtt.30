As investors choose to become involved

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
based on those terms,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
they can either take their rewards back as cash,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
or they can decide in advance

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
to give those returns away to a non-profit.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
a path to go do what they want to do in the world

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and to gather the people around them that they already have,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
the people that know them best

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and that love them and want to support them,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
to gather them to make this happen.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So that's what I'm working on now.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
