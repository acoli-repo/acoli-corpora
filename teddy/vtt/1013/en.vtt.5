because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000

I started to distance myself.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000

I gave when solutions were on sale.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I mean who can argue with that?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough
