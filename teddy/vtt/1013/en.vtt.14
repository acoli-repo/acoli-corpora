is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So I saw that and it was very humbling.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I never once was asked for a donation,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
which had kind of been my mode, right.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
There's poverty, you give money to help --

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
no one asked me for a donation.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and to build on their own capabilities.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So what I did hear, once in a while,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
was that people wanted a loan --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.
