00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to be able to continue their businesses as loans,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that's this little idea that turned into Kiva.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
A few months later, I went back to Uganda

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
with a digital camera and a basic website

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and took pictures of seven of my new friends,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
spammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
but do you say, do you want to help participate in this,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
provide the money that they need?"

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
The money came in basically overnight.
