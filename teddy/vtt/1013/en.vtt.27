00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
or they might need money during a hard month.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
But there's always a need for resources close by.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Another thing is, it turns out,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect --

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
banks, venture capitalists,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000

it's a lot.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
it's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
how to ask, what to promise in return,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
even though they have the best of intentions
