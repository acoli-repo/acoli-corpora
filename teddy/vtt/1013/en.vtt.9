00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
explaining what that was,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
He also talked about, in particular, microlending,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
which is a tiny loan

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that could help someone start or grow a business.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
that, for once, showed me, maybe,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
a way to interact with someone

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and didn't make me feel bad --

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
that was exciting.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But more importantly, he told stories about the poor

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that were different than any stories I had heard before.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.
