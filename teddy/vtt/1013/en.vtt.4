00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I heard about disease, I heard about war --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
they always seemed to be kind of related.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And in general,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I got this sort of idea

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that the poor in the world lived lives

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that were wrought with suffering and sadness,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
devastation, hopelessness.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
is this predictable response,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.
