00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and to participate in their story

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
by lending a little bit of money,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I think that can change the way we believe in each other

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and each other's potential.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And as I look forward to what is next,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
have taught me what entrepreneurship is.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
You see an opportunity

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today
