00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And over and over again,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
as I interviewed them and spent my days with them,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I did hear stories of life change

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and amazing little details of change.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So I would hear from goat herders

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Their business trajectory would change.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
They would make a little bit more money;

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
their standard of living

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
would shift and would get better.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
like they would start to send their children to school.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
They might be able to buy mosquito nets.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea
