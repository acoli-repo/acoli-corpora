Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and offer that to me when I came as their guest

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and that made them feel proud.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and some days that's what happened --

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
these beautiful details of life change

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
that were meaningful to them.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
That was another thing that really touched me.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It was really humbling to see for the first time,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
to really understand

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I probably would have gotten a lot wrong.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Because the best way for people to change their lives

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.
