I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I just got this impression that the money would work.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And my introduction to business

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
was in these $100 little infuses of capital.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So this idea

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that these new stories of business and hope

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
might be shared with my friends and family,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed
