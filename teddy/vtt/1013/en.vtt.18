00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
The second year, it was a total of 15 million.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
The third year, the total was up to around 40.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
The fourth year, we were just short of 100.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And today, less than five years in,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Kiva's facilitated

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
more than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
from lenders and entrepreneurs --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And while those numbers and those statistics

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
are really fun to talk about and they're interesting,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
to me, Kiva's really about stories.
