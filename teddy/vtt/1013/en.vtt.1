00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I remember learning that people who were poor

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
needed something material --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And I also was taught, coupled with that,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
it was our job, apparently, to help.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is what Jesus asked of us.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now I was pretty psyched.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I was very eager to be useful in the world --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I think we all have that feeling.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That was news to me,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But I also learned very soon thereafter
