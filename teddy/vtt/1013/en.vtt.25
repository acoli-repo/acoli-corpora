00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
when all else is equal,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
given the option to have just money to do what you need to do,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
or money plus the support and encouragement

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
of a global community,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
people choose the community plus the money.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So with that in mind, this particular incident

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
has led to the things that I'm working on now.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And one thing that I've seen

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
With social networks,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
it's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us
