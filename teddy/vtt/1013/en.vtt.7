00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
can, first of all,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And it can also turn into a commodity,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
which is a very scary thing.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000

to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and, in short to love.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,
