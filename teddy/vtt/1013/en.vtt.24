In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and going after that.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So they're not a donation.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
But in fact, when you give something to someone

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
that's one thing.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
This continued attention -- this ongoing attention --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
is a really big deal

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
to build different kinds of relationships among us.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,
