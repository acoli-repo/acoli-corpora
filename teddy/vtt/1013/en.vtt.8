00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
but to give the shorthand version

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
for any who have not heard him speak,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
for his work pioneering modern microfinance.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
When I heard him speak, it was three years before that.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
think of that as financial services for the poor.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Think of all the things you get at your bank

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and imagine those products and services

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Dr. Yunus shared his story,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
explaining what that was,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.
