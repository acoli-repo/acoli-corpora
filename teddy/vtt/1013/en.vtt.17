00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
provide the money that they need?"

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
The money came in basically overnight.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We sent it over to Uganda.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
the entrepreneurs received the money,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and they were able to support themselves

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and change the trajectory of their lives.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
In October of '05,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
after those first seven loans were paid,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
We said, "Our little experiment has been a success.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Let's start for real." That was our official launch.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And then that first year, October '05 through '06,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.
