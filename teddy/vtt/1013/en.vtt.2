00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But I also learned very soon thereafter

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the poor would always be with us.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This frustrated and confused me;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000

And for the first time,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I began to fear this group of people

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
