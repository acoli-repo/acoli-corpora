Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
just like they've cared enough to use Kiva

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
to make those connections.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care --

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I'm not even going to try.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I don't think, even though we often hear,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
the religious reasons,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier."

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know;

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
in fact, I think we know so much,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and it's such a reality
