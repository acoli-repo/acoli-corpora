00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
somebody who's built their own business from scratch,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
someone who is surrounded by abundance,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
not scarcity,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
who's in fact creating abundance,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
somebody with full hands with something to offer,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
not empty hands

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
asking for you to give them something.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
of somebody who wakes up every day

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and works very, very hard to make their life better.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
These stories can really change the way that we think about each other.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And if we can catalyze

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
a supportive community to come around these individuals

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and to participate in their story
