00:15:28.632 --> 00:15:30.783
It's a giant duck-bill dinosaur.

00:15:30.807 --> 00:15:32.535
Here's another one.

00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:35.032
So we look at the bone histology.

00:15:35.056 --> 00:15:39.939
The bone histology tells us
that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile,

00:15:39.963 --> 00:15:41.591
or at least a subadult,

00:15:41.615 --> 00:15:47.368
and the other one is an adult,
and we have an ontogeny.

00:15:48.273 --> 00:15:50.226
And we get rid of Anatotitan.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.221
So we can just keep doing this.

00:15:53.245 --> 00:15:56.581
And the last one is T. Rex.

00:15:57.332 --> 00:16:01.976
So there's these two dinosaurs,
T. Rex and Nanotyrannus.
