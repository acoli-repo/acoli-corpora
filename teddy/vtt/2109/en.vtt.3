Shape-shifting Dinosaurs:

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.976
The cause of a premature extinction.

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.794
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs.

00:01:36.818 --> 00:01:39.721
And there's lots of different shapes.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:42.198
Lots of different kinds.

00:01:42.222 --> 00:01:43.976
A long time ago,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.838
back in the early 1900s,
museums were out looking for dinosaurs.

00:01:49.862 --> 00:01:51.975
They went out and gathered them up.

00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:54.368
And this is an interesting story.

00:01:55.203 --> 00:01:59.234
Every museum wanted a little bigger
or better one than anybody else had.

00:01:59.258 --> 00:02:06.046
So if the museum in Toronto went out
and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one,
