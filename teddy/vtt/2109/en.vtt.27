00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:34.642
But what was interesting
was the adult Triceratops was also spongy.

00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:37.684
And this is a skull
that is two meters long.

00:13:38.113 --> 00:13:39.976
It's a big skull.

00:13:40.828 --> 00:13:45.475
But there's another dinosaur
that is found in this formation

00:13:45.619 --> 00:13:49.102
that looks like a Triceratops,
except it's bigger,

00:13:49.126 --> 00:13:51.094
and it's called Torosaurus.

00:13:51.955 --> 00:13:55.975
And Torosaurus, when we cut
into it, has mature bone.

00:13:56.437 --> 00:13:58.479
But it's got these big
holes in its shield.

00:13:58.503 --> 00:13:59.656
And everybody says,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.340
"A Triceratops and a Torosaurus
can't possibly be the same animal
