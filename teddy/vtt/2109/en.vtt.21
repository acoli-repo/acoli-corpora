00:10:28.668 --> 00:10:31.404
So if we cut open Dracorex --

00:10:31.428 --> 00:10:33.353
I cut open our Dracorex --

00:10:33.377 --> 00:10:37.601
and look, it was spongy inside,
really spongy inside.

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:41.324
I mean, it is a juvenile
and it's growing really fast.

00:10:41.904 --> 00:10:43.891
So it is going to get bigger.

00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:47.553
If you cut open Stygimoloch,
it is doing the same thing.

00:10:47.577 --> 00:10:51.207
The dome, that little dome,
is growing really fast.

00:10:51.231 --> 00:10:52.923
It's inflating very fast.

00:10:53.564 --> 00:10:56.940
What's interesting is the spike
on the back of the Dracorex

00:10:56.964 --> 00:10:59.043
was growing very fast as well.

00:10:59.067 --> 00:11:02.316
The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch
are actually resorbing,
