00:07:00.705 --> 00:07:03.362
So if you cut open a little dinosaur,

00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:06.076
it's very spongy inside, like A.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.976
And if you cut into an older dinosaur,
it's very massive.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.077
You can tell it's mature bone.

00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:14.137
So it's real easy to tell them apart.

00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:18.309
So what I want to do is show you these.

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:22.234
In North America in the northern plains
of the United States

00:07:22.258 --> 00:07:25.976
and the southern plains
of Alberta and Saskatchewan,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.726
there's this unit of rock
called the Hell Creek Formation

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.201
that produces the last
dinosaurs that lived on Earth.
