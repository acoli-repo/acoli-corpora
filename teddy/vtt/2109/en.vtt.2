00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:00.666
in fact, one of the most asked
questions I get

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.976
is, why do children
like dinosaurs so much?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.976
What's the fascination?

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.976
And I usually just say,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.976
"Well, dinosaurs were big,

00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:13.976
different and gone."

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:16.494
They're all gone.

00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:17.976
Well that's not true,

00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:20.723
but we'll get to the goose in a minute.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.244
So that's sort of the theme:

00:01:23.268 --> 00:01:25.898
big, different and gone.

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:28.809
The title of my talk:
