00:14:26.682 --> 00:14:32.798
and he actually discovered that the hole
starting to form in Triceratops

00:14:32.822 --> 00:14:35.957
and, of course it's open, in Torosaurus --

00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:41.119
so he found the transitional ones
between Triceratops and Torosaurus,

00:14:41.143 --> 00:14:42.375
which was pretty cool.

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:48.530
So now we know that Torosaurus
is actually a grown-up Triceratops.

00:14:49.964 --> 00:14:51.744
Now when we name dinosaurs,

00:14:51.768 --> 00:14:55.304
when we name anything,
the original name gets to stick

00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:59.173
and the second name is thrown out.

00:14:59.936 --> 00:15:02.128
So Torosaurus is extinct.
