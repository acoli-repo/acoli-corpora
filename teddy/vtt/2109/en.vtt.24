00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:00.510
And before the year 2000 --

00:12:00.534 --> 00:12:04.206
now remember, Triceratops was first
found in the 1800s --

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:09.395
before 2000, no one had ever seen
a juvenile Triceratops.

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:13.906
There's a Triceratops
in every museum in the world,

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.976
but no one had ever collected a juvenile.

00:12:18.418 --> 00:12:19.820
And we know why, right?

00:12:19.844 --> 00:12:21.976
Because everybody wants to have a big one.

00:12:22.844 --> 00:12:24.878
So everyone had a big one.

00:12:24.902 --> 00:12:27.310
So we went out and collected
a whole bunch of stuff

00:12:27.334 --> 00:12:29.341
and we found a whole bunch of little ones.

00:12:29.365 --> 00:12:31.976
They're everywhere,
they're all over the place.
