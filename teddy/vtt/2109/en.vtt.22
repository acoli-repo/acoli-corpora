00:10:59.067 --> 00:11:02.316
The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch
are actually resorbing,

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.474
which means they're getting smaller
as that dome is getting bigger.

00:11:06.498 --> 00:11:08.976
And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.251
Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome

00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:17.243
and its little bumps on the back
of its head were also resorbing.

00:11:17.267 --> 00:11:20.976
So just with these three dinosaurs,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.696
as a scientist, we can easily hypothesize

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.975
that it is just a growth series
of the same animal.

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:31.690
Which of course means
