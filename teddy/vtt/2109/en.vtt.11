00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:32.057
But the actual subadult at 65 percent
had no crest at all.

00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:33.976
So this was interesting.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.452
So this is where people went astray again.

00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:42.718
I mean, if they'd have just taken that,

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.760
taken Peter Dodson's work,
and gone on with that,

00:05:45.784 --> 00:05:48.975
then we would have a lot less
dinosaurs than we have.

00:05:49.658 --> 00:05:53.432
But scientists have egos;
they like to name things.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.143
And so they went on naming dinosaurs
because they were different.
