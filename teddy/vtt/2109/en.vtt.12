00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:02.798
Now we have a way of actually testing

00:06:02.822 --> 00:06:07.741
to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal,
is a young one or an older one.

00:06:08.141 --> 00:06:11.392
And that's by actually
cutting into their bones.

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:18.663
But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur
is hard to do, as you can imagine,

00:06:18.687 --> 00:06:23.731
because in museums, bones are precious.

00:06:25.842 --> 00:06:28.700
You go into a museum,
and they take really good care of them.

00:06:28.724 --> 00:06:31.792
They put them in foam, little containers.
