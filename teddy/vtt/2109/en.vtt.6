People assumed --
and this was actually a problem --

00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:06.777
people assumed
that if they had little dinosaurs,

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:10.503
if they had juvenile dinosaurs,
they'd be easy to identify.

00:03:10.527 --> 00:03:14.400
You'd have a big dinosaur
and a littler dinosaur.

00:03:14.424 --> 00:03:15.725
(Laughter)

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:17.976
But all they had were big dinosaurs.

00:03:18.983 --> 00:03:20.976
And it comes down to a couple of things.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.143
First off, scientists have egos,

00:03:25.778 --> 00:03:28.976
and scientists like to name dinosaurs.

00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:30.976
They like to name anything.
