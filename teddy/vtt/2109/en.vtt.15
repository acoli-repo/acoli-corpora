that produces the last
dinosaurs that lived on Earth.

00:07:33.225 --> 00:07:36.149
And there are 12 of them
that everyone recognizes --

00:07:36.173 --> 00:07:39.975
I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs
that went extinct.

00:07:40.613 --> 00:07:43.322
And so we will evaluate them.

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:46.095
And that's sort of what I've been doing.

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:51.250
So my students, my staff,
we've been cutting them open.

00:07:51.814 --> 00:07:55.657
Now as you can imagine,
cutting open a leg bone is one thing,

00:07:55.681 --> 00:07:58.740
but when you go to a museum

00:07:58.764 --> 00:08:02.975
and say, "You don't mind if I cut open
your dinosaur's skull, do you?"
