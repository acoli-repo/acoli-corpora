00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:32.098
And the assumption is that they're related
like cousins or whatever.

00:08:32.122 --> 00:08:37.958
But no one ever considered
that they might be more closely related.

00:08:37.982 --> 00:08:39.206
In other words,

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.976
people looked at them
and they saw the differences.

00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:45.976
And you all know
that if you are going to determine

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.906
whether you're related
to your brother or your sister,

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.976
you can't do it by looking at differences.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.191
You can only determine relatedness
by looking for similarities.

00:08:56.215 --> 00:08:58.214
So people were looking at these

00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:00.671
and they were talking
about how different they are.
