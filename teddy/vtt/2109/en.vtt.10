00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.976
So this was a problem,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.556
and Peter Dodson pointed this out
using some duck-billed dinosaurs

00:05:09.062 --> 00:05:10.563
then called Hypacrosaurus.

00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:15.453
And he showed that if you were to take
a baby and an adult

00:05:15.477 --> 00:05:18.778
and make an average
of what it should look like,

00:05:18.802 --> 00:05:21.538
if it grew in sort of a linear fashion,

00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:25.994
it would have a crest
about half the size of the adult.

00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:32.057
But the actual subadult at 65 percent
had no crest at all.
