Dr. Peter Dodson
at the University of Pennsylvania

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:07.835
actually realized that dinosaurs
grew kind of like birds do,

00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:12.222
which is different
than the way reptiles grow.

00:04:12.246 --> 00:04:13.826
And in fact,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.366
he used the cassowary as an example.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.441
And it's kind of cool --
if you look at the cassowary,

00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:23.692
or any of the birds
that have crests on their heads,

00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:30.351
they grow to about 80 percent adult size
before the crest starts to grow.
