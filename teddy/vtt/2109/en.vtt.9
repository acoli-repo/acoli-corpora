00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:30.351
they grow to about 80 percent adult size
before the crest starts to grow.

00:04:31.434 --> 00:04:32.976
Now think about that.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.976
They're basically retaining
their juvenile characteristics

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.520
very late in what we call ontogeny.

00:04:39.544 --> 00:04:45.474
So allometric cranial ontogeny
is relative skull growth.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.432
So you can see that if you actually found
one that was 80 percent grown

00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:56.886
and you didn't know that it was going
to grow up to a cassowary,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.428
you would think
they were two different animals.
