00:07:58.764 --> 00:08:02.975
and say, "You don't mind if I cut open
your dinosaur's skull, do you?"

00:08:03.454 --> 00:08:05.976
they say, "Go away."

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.976
(Laughter)

00:08:13.548 --> 00:08:14.976
So here are 12 dinosaurs.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.223
And we want to look at these three first.

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:22.119
So these are dinosaurs
that are called Pachycephalosaurus.

00:08:22.143 --> 00:08:25.773
And everybody knows
that these three animals are related.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:32.098
And the assumption is that they're related
like cousins or whatever.
