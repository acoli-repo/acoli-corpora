00:15:57.332 --> 00:16:01.976
So there's these two dinosaurs,
T. Rex and Nanotyrannus.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.890
(Laughter)

00:16:04.914 --> 00:16:07.630
Again, it makes you wonder.

00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:10.864
(Laughter)

00:16:10.888 --> 00:16:13.223
But they had a good question.

00:16:13.247 --> 00:16:16.132
They were looking at them and they said,
"One's got 17 teeth,

00:16:16.156 --> 00:16:18.020
and the biggest one's got 12 teeth.

00:16:18.044 --> 00:16:19.914
And that doesn't make any sense at all,

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:23.606
because we don't know of any dinosaurs
that gain teeth as they get older.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.878
So it must be true --

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.195
they must be different."

00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:29.976
So we cut into them.
