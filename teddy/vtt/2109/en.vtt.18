00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:00.671
and they were talking
about how different they are.

00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:04.119
Pachycephalosaurus has a big,
thick dome on its head,

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:06.840
and it's got some little bumps
on the back of its head,

00:09:06.864 --> 00:09:09.976
and it's got a bunch of gnarly things
on the end of its nose.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:16.546
And then Stygimoloch, another dinosaur
from the same age, lived at the same time,

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.736
has spikes sticking out
the back of its head.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.732
It's got a little, tiny dome,

00:09:20.756 --> 00:09:23.581
and it's got a bunch
of gnarly stuff on its nose.

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:27.976
And then there's this thing
called Dracorex hogwartsia.

00:09:29.227 --> 00:09:30.657
Guess where that came from?
