00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:13.381
In the spring of 1947, six Scandinavian
explorers noticed a strange phenomenon

00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:15.661
while crossing the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:20.140
Somehow, small squid 
known to live deep beneath the waves

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.140
kept appearing on the roof of their boat.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.250
The crew was mystifiedâ€”

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.421
until they saw the squids soaring
above the sea for roughly 50 meters.
