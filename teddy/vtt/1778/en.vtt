Science,

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:07.958
science has allowed us to know so much

00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:10.984

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:14.179
which is at the same time tremendously important

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.245
and extremely remote,

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.704
and yet much, much closer,

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:20.795
much more directly related to us,

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.263
there are many things we don't really understand.

00:00:23.263 --> 00:00:25.392

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:30.734
and today I want to tell you a few stories
