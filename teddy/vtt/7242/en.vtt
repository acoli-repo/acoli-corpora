00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:03.541
I've been in love
with music my whole life,

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:06.919
both as a musician and as a listener.

00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:08.379
But as a listener,

00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:12.633
sometimes songs feel
a little like houses to me,

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:14.886
houses that you can
only see from the street.

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:18.431
You can stop and admire them
from the outside.

00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:21.684
You can say, "Wow, look,
the architecture is amazing.

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:26.314
You might be able to get a little peek
inside through one of the windows,

00:00:26.314 --> 00:00:29.942
but itâ€™s this thing of beauty that you
have to appreciate from a distance

00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:31.986
because it's not yours.
