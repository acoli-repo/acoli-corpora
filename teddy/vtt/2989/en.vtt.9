00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.656
because the producers of a car airbag
produced and distributed a product

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.920
that they thought was,
you know, good enough.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.816
The reality is that medical errors

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.376
are now the third leading cause
of death in America.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.656
250,000 people die each year

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.216
because somebody who probably thought
they were doing their job good enough

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.440
messed up.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.576
And you don't believe me?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.416
Well, I can certainly understand why.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.096
You see, it's hard for us
to believe anything these days

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.496
when less than 50 percent
of what news pundits say

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.936
is actually grounded in fact.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.376
(Laughter)
