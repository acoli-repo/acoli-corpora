00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.016
Look, failure and imperfection
are basically the same thing.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.576
We all know that imperfection
exists all around us.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.440
Nothing and nobody is perfect.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.256
But at some point, because it was
too difficult or too painful,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.456
we decided to dismiss
our natural ability to deal with failure

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.976
and replace it with
a lower acceptance level.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.736
And now we're all forced to sit back

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.416
and just accept this new norm
or good-enough attitude

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.080
and the results that come with it.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.496
So even with all that said,
