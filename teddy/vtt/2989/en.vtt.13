So even with all that said,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.256
people will still tell me, you know,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.216
"Didn't the medical staff,
the maintenance crew, the engineer,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.886
didn't they try their best,
and isn't that good enough?"

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.150
Well, truthfully, not for me
and especially not in these examples.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.656
Yeah, but, you know, trying
to be perfect is so stressful, right?

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.536
And, you know, Oprah talked about it,
universities study it,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.296
I bet your high school counselor
even warned you about it.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.856
Stress is bad for us, isn't it?

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.096
Well, maybe,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.536
but to say that seeking
perfection is too stressful

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.736
is like saying that exercise
is too exhausting.
