Think about it.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.456
If the makers of our credit cards
were only 99.9 percent effective,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.216
there would be over a million cards
in circulation today

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.376
that had the wrong information
on the magnetic strip on the back.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.816
Or, if the Webster's Dictionary
was only 99.9 percent accurate,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.600
it would have 470 misspelled words in it.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.336
How about this?

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.816
If our doctors were
only 99.9 percent correct,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.136
then every year, 4,453,000 prescriptions
would be written incorrectly,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.496
and probably even scarier,
