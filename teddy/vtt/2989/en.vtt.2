When did we come to live in a world
where these types of typos,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.580
common errors, this do-your-best attitude
or just good enough was acceptable?

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.656
At some point, we've stopped
valuing perfection,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.240
and now, these are
the type of results that we get.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.616
You see, I think that we
should all seek perfection,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.096
all the time,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.080
and I think we need to get to it quick.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.496
You see, I run a training facility

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.976
where I'm responsible for the education
of professional delivery drivers,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.256
and in my line of work,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.376
we have a unique understanding
of the cost of failure,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280
the cost of just 99 percent,
