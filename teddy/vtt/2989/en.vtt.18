Instead of defining perfectionism
as a destructive intolerance for failure,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.816
why don't we try
giving it a new definition?

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.856
Why don't we try defining perfectionism
as a willingness to do what is difficult

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.480
to achieve what is right?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.696
You see, then we can agree

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.416
that failure is a good thing
in our quest for perfection,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.896
and when we seek perfection
without fear of failure,

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.856
just think about what we can accomplish.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.096
Like NBA superstar Steph Curry:

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.376
he hit 77 three-point shots in a row.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.616
Think about that.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.776
The guy was able to accurately deliver
a nine-and-a-half inch ball
