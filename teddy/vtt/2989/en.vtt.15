00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.096
because the self-help industry today
has a higher recidivism rate

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.456
because it's more focused on teaching you
how to accept being a failure

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.016
and lower your acceptance level

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.080
than it is about
pushing you to be perfect.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.056
See, these doctors,
therapists and self-help gurus

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.800
are all focused on a symptom
and not the illness.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.776
The true illness in our society today
is our unwillingness to confront failure.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.176
See, we're more comfortable
resting on our efforts

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.176
than we are with focusing on our results.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.056
Like at Dublin Jerome High School in Ohio,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.000
where they name 30 percent
of a graduating class valedictorian.
