00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.776
The guy was able to accurately deliver
a nine-and-a-half inch ball

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.536
through an 18-inch rim
that's suspended 10 feet in the air

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.136
from nearly 24 feet away

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.480
almost 80 times without failure.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.256
Or like the computer programmers

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.496
at the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.976
who have now written a program

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.656
that uses 420,000 lines
of near-flawless code

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.536
to control every aspect of igniting
four million pounds of rocket fuel

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.720
and putting a 120-ton
spaceship into orbit.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.696
Or maybe like the researchers
