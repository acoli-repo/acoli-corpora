00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.416
that when I'm training them
to drive a car and I say,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.136
"Clear every intersection,"

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.296
they understand that I mean
every traffic signal, every cross street,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.296
every side street, every parking lot,
every dirt road, every crosswalk,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.840
every intersection without fail.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.376
Now, new students will often ask me

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.056
why my class is so difficult,
strict, or uniform,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.656
and the answer is simple.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.256
You see, perfectionism is an attitude
developed in the small things

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.296
and then applied to the larger job.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.936
So basically, if you can't
get the little things right,
