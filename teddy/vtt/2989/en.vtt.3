00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280
the cost of just 99 percent,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.016
because in the world
of professional driving,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.880
just 99 percent of the job

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.256
Look, a hundred people die every day

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.520
due to vehicular crashes.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.816
Think about that for a second.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.456
That's like the equivalent
of four commercial airliners

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.736

yet we still can't convince ourselves
to pay perfect attention behind the wheel.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.696
So I teach my drivers to value perfection.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.336
It's why I have them memorize

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.456
our 131-word defensive driving program

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.696
perfectly,
