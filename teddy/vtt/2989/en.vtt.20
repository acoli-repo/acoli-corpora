00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.696
Or maybe like the researchers

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.816
at the Children's Mercy Hospital
in Kansas City, Missouri,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.416
who have now developed a device

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.520
that can complete human
genome coding in just 26 hours.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.536
So this device is able
to diagnose genetic diseases

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.560
in babies and newborns sooner,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.136
giving doctors an opportunity
to start treatments earlier

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.336
and potentially save the baby's life.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.216
See, that's what happens
when we seek perfection.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.216
So maybe we should be
more like the professional athlete,

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.656
or we should be more like
that tireless programmer,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.496
or like that passionate researcher.
