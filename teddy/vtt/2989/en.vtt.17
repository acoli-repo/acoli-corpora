And see, if we continue
to cultivate this culture,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.976
where nobody fails
or nobody is told that they will fail,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.616
then nobody's going to reach
their potential, either.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.056
Failure and loss
are necessary for success.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.120
It's the acceptance of failure that's not.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.056
Michelangelo is credited with saying
that the greatest danger for most of us

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.296
is not that our aim
is too high and we miss it,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.656
but it's too low and we reach it.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.496
Failure should be a motivating force,

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.600
not some type of pathetic
excuse to give up.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.960
So I have an idea.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.256
Instead of defining perfectionism
as a destructive intolerance for failure,
