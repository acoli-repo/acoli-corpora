00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.736
is like saying that exercise
is too exhausting.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.216
In both cases, if you want the results,
you've got to endure the pain.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.176
So truthfully, saying that
seeking perfection is too stressful

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.600
is just an excuse to be lazy.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.776
But here's the really scary part.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.256
Today, doctors, therapists

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.416
and the nearly 10-billion-
dollar-a-year self-help industry

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.496
are all advocating
against the idea of perfection

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.376
under this guise that somehow
not trying to be perfect

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.176
will save your self-esteem
and protect your ego.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.776
But, see, it's not working,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.096
because the self-help industry today
has a higher recidivism rate
