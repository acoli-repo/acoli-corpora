Have you ever heard of typosquatting?

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.976
Well, typosquatting
is where companies like Google

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.456
post advertisements on websites
that are commonly miskeyed,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.576
and then they sit back
and rake in millions

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.096

visiting something like gmale.com

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.696
or mikerowesoft.com.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.736

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.680
It just seems kind of silly, doesn't it?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.976
How about this?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.376
On February 28, an engineer at Amazon

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.056
made a similar, seemingly small key error.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.576
Only I say seemingly small

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.656
because this one little typo
on Amazon's supercode
