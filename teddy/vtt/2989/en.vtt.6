00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.936
So basically, if you can't
get the little things right,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.696
you're going to fail when it counts,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.696
and when you're driving a car, it counts.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.696
A car traveling at 55 miles an hour

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.936
covers the length
of an American football field

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.016
in just under four and a half seconds,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.376
but just so happens to be
the same amount of time

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.856
it takes the average person
to check a text message.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.056
So I don't allow my drivers to lose focus,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.976
and I don't accept anything less
than perfection out of them.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.256
And you know what?

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.616
I'm tired of everybody else
accepting 99 percent as good enough.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.800
I mean, being less than perfect
has real consequences, doesn't it?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.816
Think about it.
