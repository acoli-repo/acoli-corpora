00:14:57.079 --> 00:15:01.412
Now, massive disturbance at this scale
is known to affect hydrological cycles,

00:15:01.454 --> 00:15:03.412
degrade wildlife habitat,

00:15:03.454 --> 00:15:06.371
and emit greenhouse gases
back into the atmosphere,

00:15:06.371 --> 00:15:09.287
which creates more disturbance
and more tree diebacks.

00:15:11.287 --> 00:15:14.287
Not only that, we're continuing
to plant one or two species

00:15:14.287 --> 00:15:16.246
and weed out the aspens and birches.

00:15:17.246 --> 00:15:19.829
These simplified forests lack complexity,

00:15:19.871 --> 00:15:23.287
and they're really vulnerable
to infections and bugs.

00:15:23.287 --> 00:15:25.204
And as climate changes,

00:15:25.204 --> 00:15:27.496
this is creating a perfect storm

00:15:29.412 --> 00:15:32.996
for extreme events, like the massive
mountain pine beetle outbreak
