00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:30.329
a world of infinite biological pathways

00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:33.787
that connect trees
and allow them to communicate

00:00:33.787 --> 00:00:37.287
and allow the forest to behave
as though it's a single organism.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.746
It might remind you
of a sort of intelligence.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.246
How do I know this?

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:44.496
Here's my story.

00:00:45.537 --> 00:00:47.704
I grew up in the forests
of British Columbia.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.246
I used to lay on the forest floor
and stare up at the tree crowns.

00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:53.496
They were giants.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.912
My grandfather was a giant, too.

00:00:55.912 --> 00:00:57.371
He was a horse logger,

00:00:57.412 --> 00:01:00.954
and he used to selectively cut
cedar poles from the inland rainforest.
