00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:02.621
And third, when we do cut,

00:17:02.662 --> 00:17:04.454
we need to save the legacies,

00:17:05.163 --> 00:17:06.704
the mother trees and networks,

00:17:06.746 --> 00:17:08.871
and the wood, the genes,

00:17:08.913 --> 00:17:12.788
so they can pass their wisdom
onto the next generation of trees

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.954
so they can withstand
the future stresses coming down the road.

00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:18.704
We need to be conservationists.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.538
And finally, fourthly and finally,

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.788
we need to regenerate our forests
with a diversity of species

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.038
and genotypes and structures

00:17:29.038 --> 00:17:31.829
by planting and allowing
natural regeneration.
