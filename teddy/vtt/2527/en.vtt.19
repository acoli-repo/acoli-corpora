00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:32.912
that this belowground
mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza

00:09:32.954 --> 00:09:34.454
was involved.

00:09:34.496 --> 00:09:37.537
Mycorrhiza literally means "fungus root."

00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:42.246
You see their reproductive organs
when you walk through the forest.

00:09:42.287 --> 00:09:44.079
They're the mushrooms.

00:09:44.121 --> 00:09:47.121
The mushrooms, though,
are just the tip of the iceberg,

00:09:47.162 --> 00:09:51.412
because coming out of those stems
are fungal threads that form a mycelium,

00:09:51.454 --> 00:09:54.121
and that mycelium
infects and colonizes the roots

00:09:54.162 --> 00:09:56.287
of all the trees and plants.

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:58.954
And where the fungal cells
interact with the root cells,

00:09:58.996 --> 00:10:01.787
there's a trade of carbon for nutrients,
