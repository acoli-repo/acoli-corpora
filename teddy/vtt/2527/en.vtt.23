00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:30.537
to the understory seedlings,

00:11:30.537 --> 00:11:33.704
and we've associated this
with increased seedling survival

00:11:33.704 --> 00:11:34.954
by four times.

00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:39.079
Now, we know we all
favor our own children,

00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:42.371
and I wondered, could Douglas fir
recognize its own kin,

00:11:43.746 --> 00:11:45.746
like mama grizzly and her cub?

00:11:46.537 --> 00:11:48.371
So we set about an experiment,

00:11:48.412 --> 00:11:52.287
and we grew mother trees
with kin and stranger's seedlings.

00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:55.204
And it turns out
they do recognize their kin.

00:11:55.246 --> 00:12:00.204
Mother trees colonize their kin
with bigger mycorrhizal networks.
