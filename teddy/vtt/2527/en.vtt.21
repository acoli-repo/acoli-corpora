You see, like all networks,

00:10:31.662 --> 00:10:34.496
mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links.

00:10:34.496 --> 00:10:38.579
We made this map by examining
the short sequences of DNA

00:10:38.579 --> 00:10:44.079
of every tree and every fungal individual
in a patch of Douglas fir forest.

00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:47.912
In this picture, the circles represent
the Douglas fir, or the nodes,

00:10:47.954 --> 00:10:52.079
and the lines represent the interlinking
fungal highways, or the links.

00:10:53.121 --> 00:10:57.454
The biggest, darkest nodes
are the busiest nodes.

00:10:57.496 --> 00:10:59.412
We call those hub trees,

00:10:59.454 --> 00:11:01.871
or more fondly, mother trees,
