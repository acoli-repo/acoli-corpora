So I went back to school,

00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:34.329
and I studied my other world.

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:39.746
You see, scientists had just discovered
in the laboratory in vitro

that one pine seedling root

00:02:41.913 --> 00:02:45.329
could transmit carbon
to another pine seedling root.

00:02:46.163 --> 00:02:47.913
But this was in the laboratory,

00:02:47.954 --> 00:02:50.996
and I wondered,
could this happen in real forests?

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:52.246
I thought yes.

00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:57.079
Trees in real forests might also
share information below ground.

00:02:58.121 --> 00:02:59.913
But this was really controversial,

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:02.538
and some people thought I was crazy,
