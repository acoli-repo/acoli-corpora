00:09:58.996 --> 00:10:01.787
there's a trade of carbon for nutrients,

00:10:01.787 --> 00:10:04.871
and that fungus gets those nutrients
by growing through the soil

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:06.871
and coating every soil particle.

00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:12.121

00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:13.704
under a single footstep.

00:10:14.704 --> 00:10:19.496
And not only that, that mycelium connects
different individuals in the forest,

00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:25.912
individuals not only of the same species

00:10:25.954 --> 00:10:28.287

00:10:29.746 --> 00:10:31.662
