00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:31.621
that fir was sending more carbon to birch
than birch was sending to fir,

00:07:31.621 --> 00:07:35.288
and this was because the fir was still
growing while the birch was leafless.

00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:38.538
So it turns out the two species
were interdependent,

00:07:38.538 --> 00:07:39.829
like yin and yang.

00:07:40.954 --> 00:07:43.913
And at that moment,
everything came into focus for me.

00:07:43.954 --> 00:07:46.204
I knew I had found something big,

00:07:46.246 --> 00:07:50.954
something that would change the way
we look at how trees interact in forests,

00:07:50.996 --> 00:07:52.996
from not just competitors

00:07:53.038 --> 00:07:54.704
but to cooperators.

00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:58.246
And I had found solid evidence

00:07:58.288 --> 00:08:01.663
of this massive belowground
communications network,
