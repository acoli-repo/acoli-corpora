of this massive belowground
communications network,

00:08:01.663 --> 00:08:02.913
the other world.

00:08:03.954 --> 00:08:05.871
Now, I truly hoped and believed

00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:09.496
that my discovery would change
how we practice forestry,

00:08:09.496 --> 00:08:11.288
from clear-cutting and herbiciding

00:08:11.329 --> 00:08:14.246
to more holistic and sustainable methods,

00:08:14.288 --> 00:08:17.496
methods that were less expensive
and more practical.

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:18.746
What was I thinking?

00:08:19.913 --> 00:08:21.204
I'll come back to that.

00:08:23.746 --> 00:08:27.579
So how do we do science
in complex systems like forests?

00:08:28.704 --> 00:08:32.037
Well, as forest scientists,
we have to do our research in the forests,
