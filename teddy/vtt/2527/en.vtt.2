cedar poles from the inland rainforest.

00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:05.746
Grandpa taught me about the quiet
and cohesive ways of the woods,

00:01:05.746 --> 00:01:08.163
and how my family was knit into it.

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.204
So I followed in grandpa's footsteps.

00:01:11.246 --> 00:01:13.788
He and I had this curiosity about forests,

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:16.913
and my first big "aha" moment

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:18.829
was at the outhouse by our lake.

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:22.746
Our poor dog Jigs
had slipped and fallen into the pit.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.204
So grandpa ran up with his shovel
to rescue the poor dog.

00:01:27.246 --> 00:01:29.496
He was down there, swimming in the muck.
