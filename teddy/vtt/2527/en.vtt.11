00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:30.996
and I was swatting the mosquitos,
and I jumped into the truck,

00:05:31.038 --> 00:05:32.246
and I thought,

00:05:32.288 --> 00:05:34.038
"This is why people do lab studies."

00:05:34.038 --> 00:05:35.496
(Laughter)

00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:38.621
I waited an hour.

00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:40.246
I figured it would take this long

00:05:40.288 --> 00:05:43.038
for the trees to suck up
the CO2 through photosynthesis,

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:46.204
turn it into sugars,
send it down into their roots,

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:48.913
and maybe, I hypothesized,

00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:51.746
shuttle that carbon belowground
to their neighbors.

00:05:52.913 --> 00:05:54.788
After the hour was up,

00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:56.371
I rolled down my window,

00:05:56.413 --> 00:05:57.996
and I checked for mama grizzly.

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:00.996
Oh good, she's over there
eating her huckleberries.
