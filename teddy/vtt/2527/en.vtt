Imagine you're walking through a forest.

00:00:03.954 --> 00:00:07.079
I'm guessing you're thinking
of a collection of trees,

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:09.871
what we foresters call a stand,

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:12.496
with their rugged stems
and their beautiful crowns.

00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:15.913
Yes, trees are the foundation of forests,

00:00:16.496 --> 00:00:18.954
but a forest is much more
than what you see,

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:23.246
and today I want to change
the way you think about forests.

00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:27.246
You see, underground
there is this other world,

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:30.329
a world of infinite biological pathways
