Oh good, she's over there
eating her huckleberries.

00:06:01.704 --> 00:06:04.329
So I got out of the truck
and I got to work.

00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:08.246
I went to my first bag with the birch.
I pulled the bag off.

00:06:08.288 --> 00:06:10.579
I ran my Geiger counter over its leaves.

00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:12.496
Kkhh!

00:06:13.413 --> 00:06:14.621
Perfect.

00:06:14.621 --> 00:06:17.579
The birch had taken up
the radioactive gas.

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:19.163
Then the moment of truth.

00:06:19.204 --> 00:06:20.704
I went over to the fir tree.

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:23.079
I pulled off its bag.

00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:25.454
I ran the Geiger counter up its needles,

00:06:25.496 --> 00:06:27.663
and I heard the most beautiful sound.

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:29.621
Kkhh!
