00:03:59.288 --> 00:04:01.288
and some high pressure bottles

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.829
of the stable isotope
carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.

00:04:05.538 --> 00:04:07.121
But I was legally permitted.

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:08.871
(Laughter)

00:04:08.871 --> 00:04:10.496
Oh, and I forgot some stuff,

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.788
important stuff: the bug spray,

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.454
the bear spray,
the filters for my respirator.

00:04:17.163 --> 00:04:18.371
Oh well.

00:04:19.538 --> 00:04:22.329
The first day of the experiment,
we got out to our plot

00:04:22.371 --> 00:04:25.163
and a grizzly bear and her cub
chased us off.

00:04:25.913 --> 00:04:27.454
And I had no bear spray.

00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:32.288
But you know, this is how
forest research in Canada goes.
