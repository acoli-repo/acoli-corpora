In our recent experiments,

00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:04.579
we found with patch-cutting
and retention of hub trees

00:16:04.621 --> 00:16:08.746
and regeneration to a diversity
of species and genes and genotypes

00:16:08.787 --> 00:16:12.621
that these mycorrhizal networks,
they recover really rapidly.

00:16:13.954 --> 00:16:18.287
So with this in mind, I want to leave you
with four simple solutions.

00:16:18.287 --> 00:16:21.662
And we can't kid ourselves
that these are too complicated to act on.

00:16:23.162 --> 00:16:26.371
First, we all need
to get out in the forest.

00:16:27.496 --> 00:16:32.037
We need to reestablish
local involvement in our own forests.
