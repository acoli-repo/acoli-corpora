00:12:29.454 --> 00:12:31.246
And these two compounds

00:12:31.287 --> 00:12:35.371
have increased the resistance
of those seedlings to future stresses.

00:12:35.412 --> 00:12:36.662
So trees talk.

00:12:38.537 --> 00:12:40.579
(Applause)

00:12:40.579 --> 00:12:41.787
Thank you.

00:12:45.454 --> 00:12:47.746
Through back and forth conversations,

00:12:47.746 --> 00:12:50.454
they increase the resilience
of the whole community.

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:54.246
It probably reminds you
of our own social communities,

00:12:54.287 --> 00:12:55.871
and our families,

00:12:55.871 --> 00:12:57.287
well, at least some families.

00:12:57.287 --> 00:12:59.496
(Laughter)

00:12:59.496 --> 00:13:01.412
So let's come back to the initial point.
