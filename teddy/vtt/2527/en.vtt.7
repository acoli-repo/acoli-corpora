00:03:28.454 --> 00:03:30.288
And I gathered my apparatus,

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.496
and I had no money,
so I had to do it on the cheap.

00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:35.121
So I went to Canadian Tire --

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:36.579
(Laughter)

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.996
and I bought some plastic bags
and duct tape and shade cloth,

00:03:40.038 --> 00:03:43.288
a timer, a paper suit, a respirator.

00:03:44.163 --> 00:03:47.329
And then I borrowed some
high-tech stuff from my university:

00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:51.954
a Geiger counter, a scintillation counter,
a mass spectrometer, microscopes.

00:03:51.996 --> 00:03:54.454
And then I got some
really dangerous stuff:

00:03:54.496 --> 00:03:59.246
syringes full of radioactive
carbon-14 carbon dioxide gas

00:03:59.288 --> 00:04:01.288
and some high pressure bottles
