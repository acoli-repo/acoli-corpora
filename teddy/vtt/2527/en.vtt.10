00:04:59.538 --> 00:05:02.538
I injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas,

00:05:02.538 --> 00:05:04.121
into the bag of birch.

00:05:04.163 --> 00:05:05.413
And then for fir,

00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:09.246
I injected the stable isotope
carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.

00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:10.996
I used two isotopes,

00:05:11.038 --> 00:05:12.288
because I was wondering

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:16.163
whether there was two-way communication
going on between these species.

00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:20.204
I got to the final bag,

00:05:20.246 --> 00:05:21.746
the 80th replicate,

00:05:21.746 --> 00:05:24.163
and all of a sudden
mama grizzly showed up again.

00:05:24.204 --> 00:05:25.621
And she started to chase me,

00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:28.038
and I had my syringes above my head,

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:30.996
and I was swatting the mosquitos,
and I jumped into the truck,
