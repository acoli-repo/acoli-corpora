Some of my oldest experimental plantations
are now over 30 years old.

00:09:02.037 --> 00:09:03.454
You can check them out.

00:09:03.496 --> 00:09:05.287
That's how forest science works.

00:09:06.204 --> 00:09:08.537
So now I want to talk about the science.

00:09:08.537 --> 00:09:11.621
How were paper birch
and Douglas fir communicating?

00:09:11.621 --> 00:09:16.121
Well, it turns out they were conversing
not only in the language of carbon

00:09:16.162 --> 00:09:19.162
but also nitrogen and phosphorus

00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:23.912
and water and defense signals
and allelochemicals and hormones --

00:09:23.954 --> 00:09:25.162
information.

00:09:26.162 --> 00:09:29.329
And you know, I have to tell you,
before me, scientists had thought

00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:32.912
that this belowground
mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza
