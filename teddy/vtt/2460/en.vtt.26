00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:02.648
Listen to Suheir Hammad recite
"First Writing Since,"

00:13:02.672 --> 00:13:05.721
or Esperanza Spalding
perform "Black Gold."

00:13:05.745 --> 00:13:08.393
Set your gaze upon the art
of Kehinde Wiley

00:13:08.417 --> 00:13:10.271
or Favianna Rodriguez.

00:13:10.914 --> 00:13:16.499
Look at the hands of your grandmother

00:13:16.523 --> 00:13:19.195
or into the eyes of someone who loves you.

00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:22.254
We are magic.

00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:25.957
Individually, we don't have
a lot of wealth and power,

00:13:25.981 --> 00:13:29.488
but collectively, we are unstoppable.
