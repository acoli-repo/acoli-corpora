00:05:58.605 --> 00:06:00.491
I have learned from families

00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:04.197
who are unleashing
their ingenuity and tenacity

00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.411
to collectively create
their own solutions.

00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:08.539
And they're not just focused on money.

00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:12.607
They're addressing education,
housing, health, community --

00:06:12.631 --> 00:06:14.829
the things that we all care about.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.643
Everywhere I go,

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.801
I see people who are broke but not broken.

00:06:21.263 --> 00:06:25.082
I see people who are struggling
to realize their good ideas,

00:06:25.106 --> 00:06:27.674
so that they can create
a better life for themselves,

00:06:27.698 --> 00:06:30.236
their families, their communities.
