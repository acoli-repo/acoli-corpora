00:08:57.979 --> 00:09:00.317
And I'm not being modest
or self-deprecating --

00:09:00.341 --> 00:09:01.492
I am amazing.

00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:02.734
(Laughter)

00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:04.372
But most people work hard.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.999
Hard work is the common
denominator in this equation,

00:09:09.023 --> 00:09:11.392
and I'm tired of the story we tell

00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:14.024
that hard work leads to success,

00:09:14.048 --> 00:09:15.585
because that allows --

00:09:15.609 --> 00:09:16.799
Thank you.

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:20.314
(Applause)

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:26.122
... because that story allows those of us
who make it to believe we deserve it,

00:09:26.146 --> 00:09:27.379
and by implication,

00:09:27.403 --> 00:09:29.636
those who don't make it don't deserve it.
