00:00:58.576 --> 00:01:00.727
I'm here to tell you

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:06.178
that we have overlooked
the most powerful and practical resource.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.485
Here it is:

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.202
people who are poor.

00:01:11.382 --> 00:01:15.394
Up in the left-hand corner
is Jobana, Sintia and Bertha.

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:17.934
They met when they all had small children,

00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.795
through a parenting class
at a family resource center

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:22.003
in San Francisco.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.419
As they grew together
as parents and friends,

00:01:26.443 --> 00:01:28.459
they talked a lot about how hard it was

00:01:28.483 --> 00:01:30.705
to make money when your kids are little.
