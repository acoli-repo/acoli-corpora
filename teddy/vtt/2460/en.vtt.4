00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:00.966
(Laughter)

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.842
And they split the money three ways.

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:04.167
It was not a full-time gig,

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.422
no one could watch
the little ones all day.

00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:08.960
But it made a difference
for their families.

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.076
Extra money to pay for bills
when a husband's work hours were cut.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.378
Money to buy the kids clothes
as they were growing.

00:02:18.402 --> 00:02:20.321
A little extra money in their pockets

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:22.839
to make them feel some independence.

00:02:22.863 --> 00:02:26.992
Up in the top-right corner
is Theresa and her daughter, Brianna.

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:28.931
Brianna is one of those kids

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:33.765
with this sparkly, infectious,
outgoing personality.
