00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:02.899
were showing up for these
monthly meetings that she put together.

00:04:02.923 --> 00:04:05.140
She went from feeling helpless

00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:08.793
to realizing how capable she was
of supporting her daughter,

00:04:08.817 --> 00:04:12.498
with the support of other people
who were going through the same struggle.

00:04:12.522 --> 00:04:15.559
And Brianna is doing fantastic --
she's doing great academically

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:16.760
and socially.

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:21.220
That in the middle is my man Baakir,

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:24.089
standing in front of
BlackStar Books and Caffe,

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:26.698
which he runs out of part of his house.

00:04:26.722 --> 00:04:28.297
As you walk in the door,

00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:31.705
Baakir greets you
with a "Welcome black home."
