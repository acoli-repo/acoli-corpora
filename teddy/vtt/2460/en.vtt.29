If this country is going to live up to its
promise of liberty and justice for all,

00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:39.122
then we need to elevate
the voices of our unheard,

00:14:39.146 --> 00:14:42.627
of people like Jobana,
Sintia and Bertha,

00:14:42.651 --> 00:14:45.118
Theresa and Baakir.

00:14:45.809 --> 00:14:48.794
We must leverage their solutions
and their ideas.

00:14:49.437 --> 00:14:52.567
We must listen to their true stories,

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:55.241
their more beautifully complex stories.

00:14:55.956 --> 00:14:57.116
Thank you.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:02.984
