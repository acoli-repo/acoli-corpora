00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:30.820
My husband is a business owner.

00:07:31.605 --> 00:07:33.369
I have a retirement account.

00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:36.882
My daughter is not even allowed
to turn on the stove

00:07:36.906 --> 00:07:38.485
unless there's a grown-up at home

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:39.667
and she doesn't have to,

00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:42.954
because she does not have to have
the same kind of self-reliance

00:07:42.978 --> 00:07:44.771
that I had to at her age.

00:07:44.795 --> 00:07:46.999
My kids' raviolis are organic

00:07:47.023 --> 00:07:49.930
and full of things
like spinach and ricotta,

00:07:49.954 --> 00:07:52.277
because I have the luxury of choice

00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:54.219
when it comes to what my children eat.

00:07:54.243 --> 00:07:56.343
I am the exception,

00:07:56.367 --> 00:07:58.699
not because I'm more talented than Baakir

00:07:58.723 --> 00:08:02.605
or my mother worked any harder
than Jobana, Sintia or Bertha,
