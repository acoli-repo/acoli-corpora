For every story I hear demonizing
low-income single mothers

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.429
or absentee fathers,

00:10:07.453 --> 00:10:10.195
which is how people
might think of my parents,

00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:15.081
I've got 50 that tell a different story
about the same people,

00:10:15.105 --> 00:10:18.015
showing up every day and doing their best.

00:10:18.491 --> 00:10:22.207
I'm not saying that some
of the negative stories aren't true,

00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:28.595
but those stories allow us
to not really see who people really are,

00:10:28.619 --> 00:10:30.806
because they don't paint a full picture.
