00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:30.150
(Laughter)

00:11:30.174 --> 00:11:34.015
Right? But where is our strategy
for Theresa and Baakir?

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:37.423
There are no incubators for them,

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:40.156
no accelerators, no fellowships.

00:11:40.577 --> 00:11:44.252
How are Jobana, Sintia and Bertha
really all that different

00:11:44.276 --> 00:11:46.914
from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world?

00:11:46.938 --> 00:11:49.922
Baakir has experience and a track record.

00:11:49.946 --> 00:11:51.655
I'd put my money on him.

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:59.405
So, consider this an invitation
to rethink a flawed strategy.
