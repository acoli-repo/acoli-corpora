00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:30.852
and one of them said,

00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:32.812
"Theresa, how are you?"

00:03:33.344 --> 00:03:35.058
And she burst into tears.

00:03:35.804 --> 00:03:39.145
After she shared her story,
one of her friends said,

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.446
"I went through the exact same thing
with my son about a year ago."

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.621
And in that moment,

00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:45.902
Theresa realized
that so much of her struggle

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:48.428
was not having anybody
to talk with about it.

00:03:48.984 --> 00:03:52.331
So she created a support group
for parents like her.

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:56.435
The first meeting was her
and two other people.

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.500
But word spread, and soon
20 people, 30 people

00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:02.899
were showing up for these
monthly meetings that she put together.
