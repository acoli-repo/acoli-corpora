The quarter-truths and limited
plot lines have us convinced

00:10:35.122 --> 00:10:38.380
that poor people are a problem

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.839
What if we recognized
that what's working is the people

00:10:43.863 --> 00:10:46.417
and what's broken is our approach?

00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:49.966
What if we realized that the experts
we are looking for,

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.786

00:10:53.755 --> 00:10:56.758
What if, instead of imposing solutions,

00:10:56.782 --> 00:10:58.881
we just added fire

00:10:58.905 --> 00:11:01.849
to the already-burning flame
that they have?
