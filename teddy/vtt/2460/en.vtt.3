00:01:28.483 --> 00:01:30.705
to make money when your kids are little.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.411
Child care is expensive,

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:34.190
more than they'd earn in a job.

00:01:34.214 --> 00:01:35.374
Their husbands worked,

00:01:35.398 --> 00:01:37.874
but they wanted to contribute
financially, too.

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:39.637
So they hatched a plan.

00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:41.546
They started a cleaning business.

00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:44.435
They plastered neighborhoods with flyers

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.332
and handed business cards out
to their families and friends,

00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:49.240
and soon, they had clients calling.

00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:52.662
Two of them would clean
the office or house

00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:54.552
and one of them would watch the kids.

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:57.491
They'd rotate who'd cleaned
and who'd watch the kids.

00:01:57.515 --> 00:01:59.728
(Laughs) It's awesome, right?

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:00.966
(Laughter)
