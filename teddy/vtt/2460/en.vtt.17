00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.654
They are full of people applying
their savvy intelligence

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:34.065
to stretch a minimum wage paycheck,

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:37.276
or balance a job and a side hustle
to make ends meet.

00:08:37.627 --> 00:08:41.402
They are full of people
doing for themselves and for others,

00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:44.930
whether it's picking up medication
for an elderly neighbor,

00:08:44.954 --> 00:08:48.688
or letting a sibling borrow some money
to pay the phone bill,

00:08:48.712 --> 00:08:50.955
or just watching out
for the neighborhood kids

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:52.187
from the front stoop.

00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:56.646
I am the exception
because of luck and privilege,

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.955
not hard work.

00:08:57.979 --> 00:09:00.317
And I'm not being modest
or self-deprecating --
