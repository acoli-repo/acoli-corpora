00:06:56.933 --> 00:07:01.341
I'd get myself home after school every day
and do homework and chores,

00:07:01.365 --> 00:07:03.351
and wait for my mother to come home.

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:05.567
After school, I'd go to the corner store

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.093
and buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli,

00:07:08.117 --> 00:07:10.740
which I'd heat up on the stove
as my afternoon snack.

00:07:11.145 --> 00:07:13.952
If I had a little extra money,
I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie.

00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:14.977
(Laughter)

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:16.152
Cherry.

00:07:16.176 --> 00:07:17.830
Not as good as a buttermilk drop.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:18.855
(Laughter)

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:20.573
We were poor when I was a kid.

00:07:20.597 --> 00:07:24.390
But now, I own a home
in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood

00:07:24.414 --> 00:07:25.943
in Oakland, California.

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.010
I've built a career.

00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:30.820
My husband is a business owner.
