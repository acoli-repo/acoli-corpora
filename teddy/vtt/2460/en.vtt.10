00:04:59.464 --> 00:05:02.697
But BlackStar is much more than a café.

00:05:03.046 --> 00:05:04.651
For the kids in the neighborhood,

00:05:04.675 --> 00:05:07.680
it's a place to go after school
to get help with homework.

00:05:07.704 --> 00:05:09.497
For the grown-ups, it's where they go

00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:11.724
to find out what's going on
in the neighborhood

00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:13.105
and catch up with friends.

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:14.606
It's a performance venue.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.960
It's a home for poets,
musicians and artists.

00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:20.608
Baakir and his partner Nicole,

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:22.772
with their baby girl strapped to her back,

00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:24.350
are there in the mix of it all,

00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:26.445
serving up a cup of coffee,

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.609
teaching a child how to play Mancala,

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:31.688
or painting a sign
for an upcoming community event.
