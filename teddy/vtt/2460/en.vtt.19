00:09:30.175 --> 00:09:32.378
We tell ourselves,
in the back of our minds,

00:09:32.402 --> 00:09:34.677
and sometimes in the front of our mouths,

00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:37.738
"There must be something a little wrong
with those poor people."

00:09:37.762 --> 00:09:39.254
We have a wide range of beliefs

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:41.463
about what that something wrong is.

00:09:41.487 --> 00:09:44.771
Some people tell the story
that poor folks are lazy freeloaders

00:09:44.795 --> 00:09:47.977
who would cheat and lie
to get out of an honest day's work.

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:51.200
Others prefer the story
that poor people are helpless

00:09:51.224 --> 00:09:54.505
and probably had neglectful parents
that didn't read to them enough,

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:56.738
and if they were just told what to do

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.019
and shown the right path,

00:09:58.043 --> 00:09:59.284
they could make it.

00:09:59.917 --> 00:10:06.056
For every story I hear demonizing
low-income single mothers
