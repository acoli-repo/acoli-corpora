00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:31.404
but he got me safely there.

00:07:31.404 --> 00:07:33.754
What could I do?

00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:35.550
But believe me, there are more polite ways

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.723
to offer assistance.

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.245
We don't know you're there,

00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:41.225
so it's kind of nice to say "Hello" first.

00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:43.361
"Would you like some help?"

00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:46.412
But while in Oakland, I've really been struck by

00:07:46.412 --> 00:07:49.030
how much the city of Oakland changed

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.532
as I lost my sight.

00:07:51.532 --> 00:07:53.699
I liked it sighted. It was fine.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:56.275
It's a perfectly great city.

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:57.544
But once I lost my sight

00:07:57.544 --> 00:07:59.859
and was walking along Broadway,

00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:03.070
I was blessed every block of the way.
