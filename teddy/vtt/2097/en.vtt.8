00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.753
within such a short period of time.

00:04:02.753 --> 00:04:04.649
From that came a lot of insights,

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:06.146
or outsights, as I called them,

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:09.535
things that I learned since losing my sight.

00:04:09.535 --> 00:04:12.502
These outsights ranged from the trival

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.167
to the profound,

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.735
from the mundane to the humorous.

00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:19.752
As an architect, that stark juxtaposition

00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:22.266
of my sighted and unsighted experience

00:04:22.266 --> 00:04:24.551
of the same places and the same cities

00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:26.564
within such a short period of time

00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:28.770
has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.944
of the city itself.
