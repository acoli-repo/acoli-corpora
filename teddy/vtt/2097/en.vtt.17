I tend to think that it comes
out of our shared humanity,

00:08:31.049 --> 00:08:34.159
out of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.019
In fact, if I'm feeling down,

I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland,

00:08:37.927 --> 00:08:40.586
I go for a walk, and I feel better like that,

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:43.857
in no time at all.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.892

00:08:50.394 --> 00:08:53.120

00:08:56.955 --> 00:08:59.398
Everybody's welcome.

00:08:59.398 --> 00:09:01.959
In fact, I've heard it said in the disability community
