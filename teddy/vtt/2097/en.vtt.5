00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:30.922
like anybody would.

00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:33.414
But as I had time to stop and think,

00:02:33.414 --> 00:02:35.165
I actually started to realize

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:38.089
I had a lot to be grateful for.

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.085
In particular, I thought about my dad,

00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:43.282
who had passed away from complications

00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:45.385
from brain surgery.

00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:50.476
He was 36. I was seven at the time.

00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:53.169
So although I had every reason

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.401
to be fearful of what was ahead,

00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:58.035
and had no clue quite what was going to happen,

00:02:58.035 --> 00:02:59.793
I was alive.

00:02:59.793 --> 00:03:02.505
My son still had his dad.
