00:02:59.793 --> 00:03:02.505
My son still had his dad.

00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:04.392
And besides, it's not like I was the first person

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.005
ever to lose their sight.

00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:08.154
I knew there had to be all sorts of systems

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.471
and techniques and training to have

00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:13.033
to live a full and meaningful, active life

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:14.635
without sight.

00:03:14.635 --> 00:03:16.782
So by the time I was discharged from the hospital

00:03:16.782 --> 00:03:19.486
a few days later, I left with a mission,

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:21.616
a mission to get out and get the best training

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:26.780
as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.828
Within six months, I had returned to work.
