00:05:39.752 --> 00:05:42.186
and over time you build a pattern of where you are

and your progression through a block

00:05:53.342 --> 00:05:56.847
and your movement through time and space.

00:05:56.847 --> 00:05:59.280
But also, the sense of smell.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.981
Some districts and cities have their own smell,
