the ear of a dog, perhaps a golden retriever.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.915
Its leash had been tied to the chair

00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:36.652
as her master went in for coffee,

00:01:36.652 --> 00:01:38.444
and she was just persistent in her efforts

00:01:38.444 --> 00:01:41.782
to greet me, perhaps get a scratch behind the ear.

00:01:41.782 --> 00:01:44.394
Who knows, maybe she was volunteering for service.

00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:46.773
(Laughter)

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.182
But that little story is really about

00:01:49.182 --> 00:01:52.381
the fears and misconceptions that come along

00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:55.284
with the idea of moving through the city

00:01:55.284 --> 00:01:56.607
without sight,

00:01:56.607 --> 00:01:59.568
seemingly oblivious to the environment

00:01:59.568 --> 00:02:02.468
and the people around you.
