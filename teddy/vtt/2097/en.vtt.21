00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:32.625
If you design a city with the blind in mind,

00:10:32.625 --> 00:10:35.268
you design a city with a robust,

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:38.960
accessible, well-connected mass transit system

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.562
that connects all parts of the city

00:10:40.562 --> 00:10:43.581
and the region all around.

00:10:43.581 --> 00:10:45.647
If you design a city with the blind in mind,

00:10:45.647 --> 00:10:48.466
there'll be jobs, lots of jobs.

00:10:48.466 --> 00:10:49.796
Blind people want to work too.

00:10:49.796 --> 00:10:52.235
They want to earn a living.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:54.991
So, in designing a city for the blind,

00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:57.060
I hope you start to realize

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.938
that it actually would be a more inclusive,

00:10:59.938 --> 00:11:03.544
a more equitable, a more just city for all.
