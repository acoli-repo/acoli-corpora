00:01:59.568 --> 00:02:02.468
and the people around you.

00:02:02.468 --> 00:02:06.369
So let me step back and set the stage a little bit.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.928
On St. Patrick's Day of 2008,

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:11.515
I reported to the hospital for surgery

00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:13.709
to remove a brain tumor.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.796
The surgery was successful.

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:18.965
Two days later, my sight started to fail.

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:22.487
On the third day, it was gone.

00:02:22.487 --> 00:02:24.584
Immediately, I was struck by an incredible sense

00:02:24.584 --> 00:02:28.473
of fear, of confusion, of vulnerability,

00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:30.922
like anybody would.
