00:08:59.398 --> 00:09:01.959
In fact, I've heard it said in the disability community

00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:04.461
that there are really only two types of people:

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.220
There are those with disabilities,

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.882
and there are those that haven't
quite found theirs yet.

00:09:10.882 --> 00:09:13.003
It's a different way of thinking about it,

00:09:13.003 --> 00:09:15.252
but I think it's kind of beautiful,

00:09:15.252 --> 00:09:17.428
because it is certainly far more inclusive

00:09:17.428 --> 00:09:19.533
than the us-versus-them

00:09:19.533 --> 00:09:22.101
or the abled-versus-the-disabled,

00:09:22.101 --> 00:09:24.879
and it's a lot more honest and respectful

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:28.183
of the fragility of life.

00:09:28.183 --> 00:09:30.108
So my final takeaway for you is
