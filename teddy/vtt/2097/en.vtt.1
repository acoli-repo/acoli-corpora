00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:31.702
Stepping onto the sidewalk,

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:34.396
I then heard the sound of a steel chair

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:38.552
slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me.

00:00:38.552 --> 00:00:40.469
I know there's a cafe on the corner,

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.115
and they have chairs out in front,

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:43.511
so I just adjusted to the left

00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:45.355
to get closer to the street.

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:48.995
As I did, so slid the chair.

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:51.076
I just figured I'd made a mistake,

00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:52.914
and went back to the right,

00:00:52.914 --> 00:00:56.409
and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity.

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.774
Now I was getting a little anxious.

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:00.387
I went back to the left,
