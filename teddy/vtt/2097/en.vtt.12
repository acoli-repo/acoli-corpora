Some districts and cities have their own smell,

00:06:01.981 --> 00:06:05.022
as do places and things around you,

00:06:05.022 --> 00:06:06.814
and if you're lucky, you can even follow your nose

00:06:06.814 --> 00:06:10.243
to that new bakery that you've been looking for.

00:06:10.243 --> 00:06:11.952
All this really surprised me,

00:06:11.952 --> 00:06:14.957
because I started to realize that

00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:17.510
my unsighted experienced

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.945
was so far more multi-sensory

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:22.970
than my sighted experience ever was.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.710
What struck me also was how much the city

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.342
was changing around me.

00:06:27.342 --> 00:06:29.079
When you're sighted,

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:31.268
everybody kind of sticks to themselves,
