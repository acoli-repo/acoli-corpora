00:09:28.183 --> 00:09:30.108
So my final takeaway for you is

00:09:30.108 --> 00:09:34.176
that not only is the city good for the blind,

00:09:34.176 --> 00:09:37.355
but the city needs us.

00:09:37.355 --> 00:09:39.393
And I'm so sure of that that

00:09:39.393 --> 00:09:40.989
I want to propose to you today

00:09:40.989 --> 00:09:44.429
that the blind be taken as
the prototypical city dwellers

00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:47.714
when imagining new and wonderful cities,

00:09:47.714 --> 00:09:49.575
and not the people that are thought about

00:09:49.575 --> 00:09:51.808
after the mold has already been cast.

00:09:51.808 --> 00:09:54.861
It's too late then.

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:58.045
So if you design a city with the blind in mind,

00:09:58.045 --> 00:10:02.630
you'll have a rich, walkable network of sidewalks
