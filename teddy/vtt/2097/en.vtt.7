00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.828
Within six months, I had returned to work.

00:03:30.828 --> 00:03:32.430
My training had started.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.090
I even started riding a tandem bike

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.715
with my old cycling buddies,

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.412
and was commuting to work on my own,

00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:40.887
walking through town and taking the bus.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.650
It was a lot of hard work.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.917
But what I didn't anticipate

00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:48.889
through that rapid transition

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.637
was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition

00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:56.577
of my sighted experience
up against my unsighted experience

00:03:56.577 --> 00:03:59.250
of the same places and the same people

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.753
within such a short period of time.
