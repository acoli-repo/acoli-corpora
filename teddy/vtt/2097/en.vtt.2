00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:00.387
I went back to the left,

00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:01.676
and so slid the chair,

00:01:01.676 --> 00:01:04.284
blocking my path of travel.

00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:07.286
Now, I was officially freaking out.

00:01:07.286 --> 00:01:08.871
So I yelled,

00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:12.132
"Who the hell's out there? What's going on?"

00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:14.384
Just then, over my shout,

00:01:14.384 --> 00:01:17.069
I heard something else, a familiar rattle.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:18.915
It sounded familiar,

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:20.778
and I quickly considered another possibility,

00:01:20.778 --> 00:01:22.709
and I reached out with my left hand,

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:26.113
as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy,

00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:28.664
and I came across an ear,

00:01:28.664 --> 00:01:32.926
the ear of a dog, perhaps a golden retriever.
