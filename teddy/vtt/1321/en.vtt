what a breakthrough this was

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:07.136
for women who were victims of violence

00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:09.092
in the 1980s.

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:12.605
They would come into the emergency room

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:16.017
with what the police would call "a lovers' quarrel,"

00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:19.792

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:24.534
I would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist

00:00:24.534 --> 00:00:26.295
and swollen eyes.

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:30.333
