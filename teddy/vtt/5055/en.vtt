00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:12.658
Hephaestus, god of technology, was hard at
work on his most ingenious invention yet.

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:15.946
He was creating a new defense 
system for King Minos,

00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:19.947
who wanted fewer intruders on his 
island kingdom of Crete.

00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:23.279
But mortal guards and ordinary 
weapons wouldnâ€™t suffice,

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.339
so the visionary god devised an 
indomitable new defender.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.025
In the fires of his forge,

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:33.535
Hephaestus cast his invention in 
the shape of a giant man.
