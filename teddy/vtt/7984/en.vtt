00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:02.290
So plastics.

00:00:02.623 --> 00:00:06.544
Plastics come in all shapes,
forms and colors.

00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:08.171
They are everywhere.

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:09.464
They are in our makeup,

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:10.882
it packages our food

00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:12.467
and insulates our homes.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:16.471
They are in airplanes
and our favorite electronic devices.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.016
They are truly a remarkable material.

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:22.602
But so are its troubles.

00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:27.690
And we produce and consume plastics
in staggering quantities.

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:29.484
Since it's been mass-produced,

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:33.613
the world has created
over 10 billion metric tons of it.
