00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:03.174
I know that listening to one another
will not magically solve all problems.

00:02:03.198 --> 00:02:05.549
But it will give a chance
to create avenues

00:02:05.573 --> 00:02:10.282
to start to work together to solve
many of humanity's problems.

00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:13.245
With my first play, "Silent Voices,"

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.879
based on interviews with victims
of the Northern Uganda war

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:20.854
between the government
and Joseph Kony's LRA rebel group,

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:25.640
I brought together victims,
political leaders, religious leaders,

00:02:25.664 --> 00:02:30.506
cultural leaders, the Amnesty Commission
and transitional justice leadership
