00:03:59.898 --> 00:04:01.318
in the middle ground.

00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:04.045
When I lived in the USA,

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.863
many of my American friends
would be shocked at my ignorance

00:04:07.887 --> 00:04:11.720
at fancy Western dishes
like lasagna, for instance.

00:04:11.744 --> 00:04:12.942
(Laughter)

00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:15.022
And my question to them would be,

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.127
"Well, do you know malakwang?"

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:20.704
And then I would tell them
about malakwang,

00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:24.379
a fancy vegetable dish from my culture.

00:04:24.403 --> 00:04:26.752
And they would tell me about lasagna.

00:04:26.776 --> 00:04:30.625
And we would leave
richer and fuller individuals.
