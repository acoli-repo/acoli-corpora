00:00:00.793 --> 00:00:04.713
I'm a writer-director
who tells social-change stories,

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:07.983
because I believe stories
touch and move us.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.588
Stories humanize
and teach us to empathize.

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:13.670
Stories change us.

00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:16.166
When I write and direct plays,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.739
I'm amplifying voices
of disadvantaged groups,

00:00:19.763 --> 00:00:21.624
I'm fighting the self-censorship

00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:26.561
that has kept many Ugandan artists
away from social, political theater

00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:32.406
since the persecution of artists
by former Ugandan president, Idi Amin.
