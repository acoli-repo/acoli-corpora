inappropriate laughter.

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:37.426
He explained that his
was a laughter of embarrassment

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.569
and a recognition
of his own embarrassment.

00:03:41.593 --> 00:03:45.355
He saw himself in the actors onstage

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.472
and saw the meaninglessness
of his past actions.

00:03:50.307 --> 00:03:53.577
So I say: share your truths.

00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:56.197
Listen to one another's truths.

00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:59.874
You will discover
a more powerfully uniting truth

00:03:59.898 --> 00:04:01.318
in the middle ground.
