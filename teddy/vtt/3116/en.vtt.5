cultural leaders, the Amnesty Commission
and transitional justice leadership

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.303
for critical conversations on issues
of justice for war crime victims --

00:02:36.327 --> 00:02:39.780
the first of its kind
in the history of Uganda.

00:02:39.804 --> 00:02:42.868
And so many powerful things happened,

00:02:42.892 --> 00:02:45.413
that I can't even
cover them all right now.

00:02:45.872 --> 00:02:49.578
Victims were given the opportunity
to sit at the table

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.869
with Amnesty Commission leadership,

00:02:51.893 --> 00:02:55.490
and they expressed
the big injustice they suffered

00:02:55.514 --> 00:02:57.492
when the Commission ignored them

00:02:57.516 --> 00:03:02.428
and instead facilitated the resettlement
of the war perpetrators.
