00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:30.537
Because if you're staying in your truth,

00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:33.529
isn't it logical that the person
you believe is wrong

00:01:33.553 --> 00:01:35.474
is also staying in their truth?

00:01:36.117 --> 00:01:39.101
So, what you have is two extremes

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:43.673
that shut out all possible
avenues of conversations.

00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:49.688
I create provocative theater and film
to touch, humanize

00:01:49.712 --> 00:01:53.998
and move disagreeing parties
to the conversation table

00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:56.841
to bridge misunderstandings.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:03.174
I know that listening to one another
will not magically solve all problems.
