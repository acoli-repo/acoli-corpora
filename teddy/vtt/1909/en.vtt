Charles Van Doren, who was later
a senior editor of Britannica,

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.896
said the ideal encyclopedia
should be radical --

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.456
it should stop being safe.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.696
But if you know anything about the history
of Britannica since 1962,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.056
it was anything but radical:

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.976
still a very completely safe,
stodgy type of encyclopedia.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.176
Wikipedia, on the other hand,
begins with a very radical idea,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.216
and that's for all of us
to imagine a world

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.256
in which every single person on the planet

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.856
is given free access
to the sum of all human knowledge.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.214
And that's what we're doing.
