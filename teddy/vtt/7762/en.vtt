00:00:06.654 --> 00:00:07.967
Ah, spring.

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:11.738
Grass growing, flowers blooming,
trees growing new leaves,

00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:13.567
but if you get allergies,

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:19.136
this explosion of new life probably
inspires more dread than joy.

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:23.127
Step outside, and within minutes,
you're sneezing and congested.

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:24.421
Your nose is running,

00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.283
your eyes are swollen and watery,

00:00:26.283 --> 00:00:27.896
your throat is itchy.

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:32.559
For you and millions of others,
it's seasonal allergy time.
