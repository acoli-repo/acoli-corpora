00:00:00.527 --> 00:00:03.372
Anyone in the room thought about sex today?

00:00:03.372 --> 00:00:04.532
(Laughter)

00:00:04.532 --> 00:00:05.737
Yeah, you did.

00:00:05.737 --> 00:00:08.203
Thank you for putting your hand up over there.

00:00:08.203 --> 00:00:09.923
Well, I'm here to provide you with

00:00:09.923 --> 00:00:11.618
some biological validation

00:00:11.618 --> 00:00:13.048
for your sordid daydreams.

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:14.442
I'm here to tell you a few things

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:17.948
that you might not have known about wild sex.

00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:19.796
Now, when humans think about sex,

00:00:19.796 --> 00:00:21.526
male and female forms

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:23.197
are generally what come to mind,

00:00:23.197 --> 00:00:25.650
but for many millions of years,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.271
such specific categories didn't even exist.

00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:30.874
Sex was a mere fusion of bodies
