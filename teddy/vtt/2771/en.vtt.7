You have to ask questions in the right way
to get the answers you know you want,

00:03:32.993 --> 00:03:37.172
and you have to say no
in the right way to keep the peace.

00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:41.444
But the most important lesson
I learned growing up

00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:44.974
was the importance of being at the table.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:48.805
When my mom's favorite lamp broke,
I had to be there when she was trying

00:03:48.805 --> 00:03:53.334
to find out how and by who,
because I had to defend myself,

00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:57.117
because if you're not,
then the finger is pointed at you,

00:03:57.117 --> 00:03:59.741
and before you know it,
you will be grounded.

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.018
I am not speaking
from experience, of course.
