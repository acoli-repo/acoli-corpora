00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:33.736
In 2012 and 2013, my organization
led the single largest

00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:36.221
and most widespread
campaign in Libya.

00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:40.997
We entered homes and schools
and universities, even mosques.

00:08:40.997 --> 00:08:43.279
We spoke to 50,000 people directly,

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:47.343
and hundreds of thousands more through
billboards and television commercials,

00:08:47.343 --> 00:08:50.130
radio commercials and posters.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.194
And you're probably wondering how
a women's rights organization

00:08:53.194 --> 00:08:56.166
was able to do this in communities
which had previously opposed

00:08:56.166 --> 00:08:59.161
our sheer existence.

00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:02.170
I used scripture.
