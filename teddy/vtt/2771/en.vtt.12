Why weren't we learning about these women?

00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:03.986
Why were women being relegated
to positions which predated

00:06:03.986 --> 00:06:06.656
the teachings of our faith?

00:06:06.656 --> 00:06:08.931
And why, if we are equal
in the eyes of God,

00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.033
are we not equal in the eyes of men?

00:06:12.623 --> 00:06:17.690
To me, it all came back to the lessons
I had learned as a child.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.022
The decision maker, the person
who gets to control the message,

00:06:22.022 --> 00:06:24.604
is sitting at the table,

00:06:24.604 --> 00:06:29.504
and unfortunately,
in every single world faith,

00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:32.150
they are not women.
