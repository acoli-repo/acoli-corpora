00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:01.905
pray and praise God for their blessings,

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:06.664
namely me of course, but among others.
(Laughter)

00:02:06.664 --> 00:02:09.822
They were kind and funny and patient,

00:02:09.822 --> 00:02:16.161
limitlessly patient, the kind of patience
that having 11 kids forces you to have.

00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:18.181
And they were fair.

00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:22.895
I was never subjected to religion
through a cultural lens.

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:24.961
I was treated the same,

00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:27.410
the same was expected of me.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.177
I was never taught that God
judged differently based on gender.
