My mom actually says, you can't build
a straight house on a crooked foundation.

00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:09.130
In 2011, the Libyan revolution broke out,
and my family was on the front lines.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.644
And there's this amazing thing
that happens in war,

00:07:12.644 --> 00:07:15.773
a cultural shift almost, very temporary.

00:07:15.773 --> 00:07:18.844
And it was the first time that I felt
it was not only acceptable

00:07:18.844 --> 00:07:21.816
for me to be involved,
but it was encouraged.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.161
It was demanded.

00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:27.170
Myself and other women
had a seat at the table.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.569
We weren't holding hands or a medium.
