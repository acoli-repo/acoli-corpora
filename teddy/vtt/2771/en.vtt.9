It was ice cream and trips to the beach
and really excited relatives.

00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:38.470
Turns out it's not the same
as a 15-year-old young lady.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.438
I very quickly became introduced
to the cultural aspect of religion.

00:04:44.438 --> 00:04:48.896
The words "haram" --
meaning religiously prohibited --

00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:52.402
and "aib" -- meaning
culturally inappropriate --

00:04:52.402 --> 00:04:55.118
were exchanged carelessly,

00:04:55.118 --> 00:04:59.437
as if they meant the same thing
and had the same consequences.

00:04:59.437 --> 00:05:04.174
And I found myself in conversation
after conversation with classmates
