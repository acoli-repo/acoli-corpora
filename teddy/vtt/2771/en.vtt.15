00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.569
We weren't holding hands or a medium.

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:32.427
We were part of decision making.

00:07:32.427 --> 00:07:35.840
We were information sharing.
We were crucial.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.890
And I wanted and needed
for that change to be permanent.

00:07:42.342 --> 00:07:45.128
Turns out, that's not that easy.

00:07:45.128 --> 00:07:49.500
It only took a few weeks before the women
that I had previously worked with

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.470
were returning back
to their previous roles,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.275
and most of them were driven
by words of encouragement

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:58.177
from religious and political leaders,

00:07:58.177 --> 00:08:02.171
most of whom cited religious scripture
as their defense.
