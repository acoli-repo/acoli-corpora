00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.177
I was never taught that God
judged differently based on gender.

00:02:32.647 --> 00:02:38.289
And my parents' understanding of God
as a merciful and beneficial friend

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:42.143
and provider shaped the way
I looked at the world.

00:02:42.143 --> 00:02:46.970
Now, of course, my upbringing
had additional benefits.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.722
Being one of 11 children is Diplomacy 101.
(Laughter)

00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:55.169
To this day, I am asked
where I went to school,

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:57.652
like, "Did you go to
Kennedy School of Government?"

00:02:57.652 --> 00:02:59.558
and I look at them and I'm like, "No,

00:02:59.558 --> 00:03:02.367
I went to the Murabit School
of International Affairs."
