00:11:28.957 --> 00:11:31.604
the principles of our faith,

00:11:31.604 --> 00:11:34.367
not for us, not for
the women in your families,

00:11:34.367 --> 00:11:36.317
not for the women in this room,

00:11:36.317 --> 00:11:39.491
not even for the women out there,

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:42.997
but for societies
that would be transformed

00:11:42.997 --> 00:11:45.314
with the participation of women.

00:11:45.884 --> 00:11:48.391
And the only way we can do that,

00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:50.179
our only option,

00:11:50.179 --> 00:11:53.709
is to be, and remain, at the table.

00:11:53.709 --> 00:11:56.332
Thank you.

00:11:56.332 --> 00:11:59.911
