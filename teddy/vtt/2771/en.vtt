00:00:00.785 --> 00:00:03.840
So on my way here,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.542
the passenger next to me and I
had a very interesting conversation

00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:09.585
during my flight.

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:14.113
He told me, "It seems like
the United States has run out of jobs,

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:16.481
because they're just making some up:

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:22.743
cat psychologist, dog whisperer,
tornado chaser."

00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:25.560
A couple of seconds later, he asked me,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.812
"So what do you do?"

00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:30.505
And I was like, "Peacebuilder?"
