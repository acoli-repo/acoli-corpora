The tailings ponds are the largest toxic
impoundments on the planet.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.872
Oil sands -- or rather,
I should say tar sands --

00:07:04.896 --> 00:07:07.181
oil sands is a PR-created term

00:07:07.205 --> 00:07:10.264
so that the oil companies
wouldn't be trying to promote something

00:07:10.288 --> 00:07:14.291
that sounds like a sticky tar-like
substance that's the world's dirtiest oil.

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:16.582
So they decided to call it oil sands.

00:07:17.106 --> 00:07:20.928
The tar sands consume more water
than any other oil process,

00:07:20.952 --> 00:07:24.239
three to five barrels of water
are taken, polluted

00:07:24.263 --> 00:07:26.559
and then returned into tailings ponds,

00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:28.765
the largest toxic
impoundments on the planet.

00:07:29.084 --> 00:07:33.164
