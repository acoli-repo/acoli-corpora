in the context of its breeding ground
in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:33.408
Well, the wintering ground
is also critical

00:02:33.432 --> 00:02:36.033
and it also is not protected,

00:02:36.057 --> 00:02:41.188
and is potentially, could be potentially,
exploited for gas and mineral rights.

00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:45.309
The western border of the boreal
in British Columbia

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:46.950
is marked by the Coast Mountains,

00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:48.945
and on the other side of those mountains

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.797
is the greatest remaining
temperate rainforest in the world,

00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:53.163
the Great Bear Rainforest,

00:02:53.187 --> 00:02:56.047
and we'll discuss that in a few minutes
in a bit more detail.

00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:57.501
All across the boreal,

00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:02.519

of indigenous peoples,
