00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:01.534
That's like from Wall Street
at the southern edge of Manhattan

00:08:01.558 --> 00:08:03.398
up to maybe 120th Street.

00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:08.174
So this is one of the larger
tailings ponds.

00:08:08.198 --> 00:08:11.241
This might be, what? I don't know,
half the size of Manhattan.

00:08:11.265 --> 00:08:12.758
And you can see in the context,

00:08:12.782 --> 00:08:17.128
it's just a relatively small section
of one of 10 mining complexes

00:08:17.152 --> 00:08:20.605
and another 40 to 50
on stream to be approved soon.

00:08:22.398 --> 00:08:24.954
And of course, these tailings ponds --

00:08:24.978 --> 00:08:27.533
well, you can't see
many ponds from outer space

00:08:27.557 --> 00:08:31.388
and you can see these, so maybe
we should stop calling them ponds --
