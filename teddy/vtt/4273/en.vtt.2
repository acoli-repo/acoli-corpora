In Ontario, the boreal marches down south
to the north shore of Lake Superior.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:09.545
And these incredibly
beautiful boreal forests

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.514
were the inspiration for some of the most
famous art in Canadian history,

00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:17.868
the Group of Seven
were very inspired by this landscape,

00:01:17.892 --> 00:01:23.250
and so the boreal is not just a really key
part of our natural heritage,

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:26.033
but also an important part
of our cultural heritage.
