00:08:27.557 --> 00:08:31.388
and you can see these, so maybe
we should stop calling them ponds --

00:08:31.412 --> 00:08:35.216
these massive toxic wastelands are built

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.886
unlined and on the banks
of the Athabasca River.

00:08:38.562 --> 00:08:42.375
And the Athabasca River drains downstream
to a range of aboriginal communities.

00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:47.285
In Fort Chipewyan, the 800 people there,
are finding toxins in the food chain,

00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:49.172
this has been scientifically proven.

00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:51.738
The tar sands toxins
are in the food chain,

00:08:51.762 --> 00:08:54.673
and this is causing cancer
rates up to 10 times

00:08:54.697 --> 00:08:56.765
what they are in the rest of Canada.

00:08:57.767 --> 00:09:03.025
In spite of that, people have to live,
have to eat this food in order to survive.
