WEBVTT

00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:31.736
we can learn so much from these people

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.985
who have lived so sustainably
in this ecosystem

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:35.823
for over 10,000 years.

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:40.533
In the heart of this ecosystem
is the very antithesis

00:03:40.557 --> 00:03:43.036
of all of these values
that we've been talking about,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.198
and I think these
are some of the core values

00:03:45.222 --> 00:03:46.900
that make us proud to be Canadians.

00:03:46.924 --> 00:03:48.740
This is the Alberta tar sands,

00:03:48.764 --> 00:03:53.366
the largest oil reserves on the planet
outside of Saudi Arabia.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.286
Trapped underneath the boreal forest
and wetlands of northern Alberta

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.100
are these vast reserves
of this sticky, tar-like bitumen.
