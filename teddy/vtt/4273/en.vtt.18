In spite of that, people have to live,
have to eat this food in order to survive.

00:09:03.264 --> 00:09:06.279
The incredibly high price of flying food

00:09:06.303 --> 00:09:08.892
into these remote
Northern aboriginal communities

00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:10.591
and the high rate of unemployment

00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:13.151
makes this an absolute
necessity for survival.

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:17.326
And not that many years ago,
I was lent a boat by a First Nations man,

00:09:17.813 --> 00:09:20.040
and he said, "When you
go out on the river,

00:09:20.064 --> 00:09:23.170
do not under any
circumstances eat the fish.

00:09:23.733 --> 00:09:24.883
It's carcinogenic."

00:09:25.417 --> 00:09:29.938
And yet, on the front porch
of that man's cabin,

00:09:29.962 --> 00:09:31.369
I saw four fish.
