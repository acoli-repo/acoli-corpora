00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:01.207
And let's face it, we all live downstream

00:15:01.231 --> 00:15:03.834
in an era of global warming
and climate change.

00:15:05.043 --> 00:15:07.801
What we need, is we all need to act

00:15:07.825 --> 00:15:12.497
to ensure that Canada respects
the massive amounts of freshwater

00:15:12.521 --> 00:15:14.165
that we hold in this country.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.281
We need to ensure
that these wetlands and forests

00:15:17.305 --> 00:15:20.587
that are our best and greatest
and most critical defense

00:15:20.611 --> 00:15:23.073
against global warming are protected,

00:15:23.097 --> 00:15:26.630
and we are not releasing
that carbon bomb into the atmosphere.

00:15:27.557 --> 00:15:32.688
And we need to all gather together
and say no to the tar sands.
