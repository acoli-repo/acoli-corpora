00:12:55.363 --> 00:13:00.027
through the heart of the third largest
watershed basin in the world,

00:13:00.051 --> 00:13:02.589
and the only one
which is 95 percent intact.

00:13:03.231 --> 00:13:06.615
And building a pipeline
with an industrial highway

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:10.127
would change forever
this incredible wilderness,

00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:13.101
which is a true rarity
on the planet today.

00:13:15.306 --> 00:13:19.551
So the Great Bear Rainforest
is just over the hill there,

00:13:19.575 --> 00:13:22.702
within a few miles,
we go from these dry boreal forests

00:13:22.726 --> 00:13:26.115
of 100-year-old trees,
maybe 10 inches across,

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.576
and soon, we're in the coastal
temperate rainforest,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.176
rain-drenched, 1,000-year-old trees,
