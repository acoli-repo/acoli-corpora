00:04:29.254 --> 00:04:30.690
If I stand beside that truck,

00:04:30.714 --> 00:04:34.125
my head comes to around the bottom
of the yellow part of that hubcap.

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:36.685
Within the dimensions of that truck,

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:40.974
you could build a 3,000-square-foot
two-story home quite easily.

00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:42.203
I did the math.

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:47.407
So instead of thinking of that as a truck,
think of that as a 3,000-square-foot home.

00:04:47.802 --> 00:04:49.698
That's not a bad size home.

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:53.079
And line those trucks / homes
back and forth

00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:57.348
across there from the bottom
all the way to the top.

00:04:57.993 --> 00:05:03.070
And then think of how large
that very small section of one mine is.
