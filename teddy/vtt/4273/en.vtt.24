So as bad as all that is, things are going

00:12:09.652 --> 00:12:12.363
This is the infrastructure
as we see it about now.

00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:15.792
This is what's planned for 2015.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.470

00:12:20.168 --> 00:12:24.395

the agricultural heart of North America,

00:12:28.726 --> 00:12:31.082
of the United States,
