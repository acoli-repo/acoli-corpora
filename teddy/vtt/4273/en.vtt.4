00:01:57.122 --> 00:02:00.429
the first non-aboriginal
explorers of Northern Canada

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.212
that, taking from
the First Nations people,

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:05.616
used canoes and paddled to explore

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.350
for a trade route,
a Northwest Passage for the fur trade.

00:02:09.954 --> 00:02:13.585
In the North, the boreal
is bordered by the tundra,

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.632
and just below that, in Yukon,

00:02:16.656 --> 00:02:20.134
we have this incredible valley,
the Tombstone Valley.

00:02:20.158 --> 00:02:24.844
And the Tombstone Valley is home
to the Porcupine caribou herd.

00:02:24.868 --> 00:02:27.586
Now you've probably heard
about the Porcupine caribou herd

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.162
in the context of its breeding ground
in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
