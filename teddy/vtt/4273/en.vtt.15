SemCrude, just one of the licensees,
in just one of their tailings ponds,

00:07:33.188 --> 00:07:37.941
dumps 250,000 tons
of this toxic gunk every single day.

00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:42.732
That's creating the largest toxic
impoundments in the history of the planet.

00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:47.720
So far, this is enough toxin to cover
the face of Lake Erie a foot deep.

00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:53.926
And the tailings ponds
range in size up to 9,000 acres.

00:07:54.592 --> 00:07:58.073
That's two-thirds the size
of the entire island of Manhattan.

00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:01.534
That's like from Wall Street
at the southern edge of Manhattan
