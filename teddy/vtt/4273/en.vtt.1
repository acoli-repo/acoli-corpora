00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:32.745
we're blessed with this incredible
abundance of wetlands.

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.769
Wetlands, globally, are one
of the most endangered ecosystems.

00:00:37.126 --> 00:00:40.008
They're absolutely critical ecosystems,

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:42.613
they clean air, they clean water,

00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:45.706
they sequester large amounts
of greenhouse gases,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.131
and they're home
to a huge diversity of species.

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:51.512
In the boreal, they are also the home

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:55.887
where almost 50 percent of the 800 bird
species found in North America

00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:58.468
migrate north to breed
and raise their young.
