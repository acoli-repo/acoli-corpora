00:11:27.293 --> 00:11:31.210
This is a globally significant wetland,
perhaps the greatest on the planet.

00:11:31.234 --> 00:11:34.943
Incredible habitat
for half the bird species

00:11:34.967 --> 00:11:37.706
you find in North America, migrating here.

00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:42.845
And also the last refuge
for the largest herd of wild bison,

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:46.812
and also, of course, critical habitat
for another whole range of other species.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.949
But it too is being threatened

00:11:49.973 --> 00:11:53.613
by the massive amount of water
being drawn from the Athabasca,

00:11:53.637 --> 00:11:55.619
which feeds these wetlands,

00:11:55.643 --> 00:11:57.736
and also the incredible toxic burden

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.533
of the largest toxic unlined
impoundments on the planet,
