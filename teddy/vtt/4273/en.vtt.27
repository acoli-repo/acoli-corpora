00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.176
rain-drenched, 1,000-year-old trees,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.254
20 feet across, a completely
different ecosystem.

00:13:35.278 --> 00:13:38.047
And the Great Bear Rainforest
is generally considered to be

00:13:38.071 --> 00:13:41.425
the largest coastal temperate rainforest
ecosystem in the world.

00:13:42.014 --> 00:13:43.820
Some of the greatest densities

00:13:43.844 --> 00:13:47.028
of some of the most iconic
and threatened species on the planet.

00:13:47.881 --> 00:13:51.404
And yet there's a proposal,
of course, to build a pipeline

00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:56.335
to take huge tankers,
10 times the size of the Exxon Valdez,

00:13:56.359 --> 00:13:59.814
through some of the most
difficult-to-navigate waters in the world,

00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:03.154
where only just a few years ago,
a BC ferry ran aground.
