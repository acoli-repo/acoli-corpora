And even though this looks
maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines,

00:06:03.483 --> 00:06:05.660
it's even more damaging in some ways.

00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:11.059
It impacts and fragments
a larger part of the wilderness,

00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:13.545
where there is 90 percent
reduction of key species,

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.886
like woodland caribou and grizzly bears,

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.418
and it consumes
even more energy, more water,

00:06:19.442 --> 00:06:21.995
and produces at least
as much greenhouse gas.

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:28.011
So these in situ developments are at least
as ecologically damaging as the mines.
