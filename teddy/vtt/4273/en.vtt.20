00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:01.804
So what we're doing is,

00:10:01.828 --> 00:10:06.386
we're taking the most concentrated
greenhouse gas sink --

00:10:07.517 --> 00:10:10.050
twice as much greenhouse
gases are sequestered

00:10:10.074 --> 00:10:13.611
in the boreal per acre
than the tropical rainforests.

00:10:14.088 --> 00:10:16.565
And what we're doing is we're destroying

00:10:16.589 --> 00:10:19.287
this carbon sink,
turning it into a carbon bomb.

00:10:19.645 --> 00:10:22.757
And we're replacing that
with the largest industrial project

00:10:22.781 --> 00:10:24.152
in the history of the world,

00:10:24.176 --> 00:10:29.679
which is producing the most high-carbon
greenhouse-gas emitting oil in the world.
