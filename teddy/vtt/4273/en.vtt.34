00:16:57.358 --> 00:17:00.804
to get Canada to step up
to its responsibilities,

00:17:00.828 --> 00:17:05.214
to convince Canada to go back
to being a climate change champion

00:17:05.238 --> 00:17:06.971
instead of a climate change villain,

00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:08.652
and to say no to the tar sands,

00:17:08.676 --> 00:17:11.345
and yes to a clean energy future for all.

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:12.693
Thank you so much.
