our possibility to survive,

00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:03.630
and for our children to survive
and have a rich future.

00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:07.711
We have an incredible gift in the boreal,

00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:12.843
an incredible opportunity to preserve
our best defense against global warming,

00:16:12.987 --> 00:16:14.724
but we could let that slip away.

00:16:15.715 --> 00:16:19.400
The tar sands could threaten
not just a large section of the boreal.

00:16:19.717 --> 00:16:22.690
It compromises the life and the health

00:16:22.714 --> 00:16:27.238
of some of our most underprivileged
and vulnerable people,

00:16:27.262 --> 00:16:30.375
the aboriginal communities
that have so much to teach us.
