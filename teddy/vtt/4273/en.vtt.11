00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:30.352
And this is just one of a number of mines,

00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:32.560
10 mines so far right now.

00:05:32.584 --> 00:05:35.190
This is one section of one mining complex,

00:05:35.214 --> 00:05:39.053
and there are about another 40 or 50
in the approval process.

00:05:39.077 --> 00:05:41.837
No tar sands mine has actually
ever been denied approval,

00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:43.866
so it is essentially a rubber stamp.

00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:48.439
The other method of extraction
is what's called the in situ.

00:05:48.463 --> 00:05:50.435
And here, massive amounts of water

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:53.466
are superheated and pumped
through the ground,

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.578
through these vasts networks of pipelines,

00:05:55.602 --> 00:05:59.292
seismic lines, drill paths,
compressor stations.

00:05:59.316 --> 00:06:03.459
And even though this looks
maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines,
