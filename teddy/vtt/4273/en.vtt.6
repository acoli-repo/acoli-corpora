00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:02.519
it's home for a huge incredible range
of indigenous peoples,

00:03:02.543 --> 00:03:05.129
and a rich and varied culture.

00:03:05.616 --> 00:03:08.122
And I think that one of the reasons

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:11.620
why so many of these groups have
retained a link to the past,

00:03:11.644 --> 00:03:13.656
know their native languages,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.018
the songs, the dances, the traditions,

00:03:16.042 --> 00:03:19.553
I think part of that reason
is because of the remoteness,

00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:20.879
the span and the wilderness

00:03:20.903 --> 00:03:24.567
of this almost 95 percent
intact ecosystem.

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:26.643
And I think particularly now,

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.799
as we see ourselves in a time
of environmental crisis,

00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:31.736
we can learn so much from these people
