WEBVTT

00:15:27.557 --> 00:15:32.688
And we need to all gather together
and say no to the tar sands.

00:15:32.712 --> 00:15:33.863
And we can do that.

00:15:33.887 --> 00:15:36.770
there is a huge network
all over the world,

00:15:36.794 --> 00:15:38.517
fighting to stop this project.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.834
And I quite simply think

00:15:40.858 --> 00:15:44.724
that this is not something
that should be decided just in Canada.

00:15:44.748 --> 00:15:47.028
Everyone in this room,
everyone across Canada,

00:15:47.052 --> 00:15:49.013
everyone listening to this presentation

00:15:49.037 --> 00:15:51.839
has a role to play
and, I think, a responsibility.

00:15:51.863 --> 00:15:57.498
Because what we do here
is going to change our history,

00:15:57.522 --> 00:16:00.215
it's going to color
our possibility to survive,
