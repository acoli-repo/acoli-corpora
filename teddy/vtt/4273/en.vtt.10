00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.246
Now, you can apply that same kind

Now, here you see --
of course, as you go further on,

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:11.872
these trucks become like a pixel.

00:05:12.505 --> 00:05:15.607

all back and forth there.

00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:18.041
How large is that one portion of a mine?

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.126

And this is just one of a number of mines,
