00:00:00.428 --> 00:00:05.709
The world's largest and most devastating
environmental and industrial project

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.574
is situated in the heart of the largest
and most intact forest in the world,

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:11.402
Canada's boreal forest.

00:00:11.426 --> 00:00:15.849
It stretches right across
Northern Canada, in Labrador,

00:00:15.873 --> 00:00:19.046
it's home to the largest remaining
wild caribou herd in the world:

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.541
the George River caribou herd,

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:22.734
numbering approximately 400,000 animals.

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:25.616
Unfortunately, when I was there,
I couldn't find one of them,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.518
but you have the antlers as proof.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.327
All across the boreal,

00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:32.745
we're blessed with this incredible
abundance of wetlands.
