00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:30.370
because genitalia are also where
a sexual conflict is played out.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.031
A female's interests are best served if
she fertilizes her eggs

00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:36.860
with the sperm of the best fathers

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.901
and creates genetic variability amongst
her offspring.

00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.381
For a male, on the other hand,
this is bad news.

00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:47.524
For him, it would be best if a female
used his sperm

00:03:47.524 --> 00:03:51.334
to fertilize all of her eggs.

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:55.514
So we see cycles of adaptation
in an evolutionary arms race

00:03:55.514 --> 00:03:57.975
to retain control.

00:03:57.975 --> 00:04:00.977
