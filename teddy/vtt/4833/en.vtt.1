00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.084
We see similarly unbelievable genitalia
in insects,

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:32.005
mammals,

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:32.883
reptiles,

00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:33.785
fish,

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:34.583
spiders,

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:36.576
and even snails.

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:40.915
Apparently, no organs evolve
faster and into more variable shapes

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:44.055
than those involved in procreation.

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:49.550
Superficially, it makes sense
because evolution works via reproduction.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.536
When an animal leaves more offspring,
its genes will spread.

00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:57.284
And since genitalia are an animal's tools
for reproduction,

00:00:57.284 --> 00:01:01.579
any improvement there 
will have immediate effect.
