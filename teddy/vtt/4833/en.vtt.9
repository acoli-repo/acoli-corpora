00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:30.914
on their right hand flanks
where the males usually pierce them.

00:04:30.914 --> 00:04:35.244
That allows them to maintain
the power to filter out unwanted sperm

00:04:35.244 --> 00:04:37.404
with their genitalia.

00:04:37.404 --> 00:04:40.698
And duck vaginas are shaped
like a clockwise spiral

00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:46.604
so that when the male inflates his long,
counterclockwise coiled penis into her,

00:04:46.604 --> 00:04:48.202
and she disapproves,

00:04:48.202 --> 00:04:51.364
all she needs to do 
is flex her vaginal muscles

00:04:51.364 --> 00:04:55.061
and the penis just flubs out.

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:59.425
So, genitalia differs so much,
not just to fascinate us,

00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:01.334
but because in every species,
