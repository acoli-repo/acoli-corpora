The penis of a chicken flea, for example,
looks nothing like a pipette,

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:33.014
more like an exploded grandfather clock.

00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:35.647
And the vagina of a featherwing beetle

00:01:35.647 --> 00:01:39.387
resembles something you'd find
in a Dr. Seuss book.

00:01:39.387 --> 00:01:40.837
Throughout the animal kingdom,

00:01:40.837 --> 00:01:43.679
genitalia are very complex things,

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.049
much more complicated than seems
necessary for what they're meant to do.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.036
That's because genitalia do more than just
deposit and receive sperm.

00:01:53.036 --> 00:02:00.607
Many male animals also use the penis
as courtship device, like crane flies.
