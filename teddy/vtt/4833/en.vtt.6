00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:00.968
In fact, insemination is different
to conception,

00:03:00.968 --> 00:03:04.481
and the female genitalia exploit
this distinction.

00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.159
For instance, in some dung flies,

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.050
the vagina contains pockets
for separating sperm from different males

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.630
depending on how appealing they were.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.739
Males using their penises for courtship

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.610
and females controlling 
their own sperm management

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.855
are two reasons why genitalia evolve
into such complex shapes.

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:25.971
But there are others

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:30.370
because genitalia are also where
a sexual conflict is played out.
