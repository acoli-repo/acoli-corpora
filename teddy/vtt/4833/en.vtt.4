Many male animals also use the penis
as courtship device, like crane flies.

00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:02.587
In some South American species,

00:02:02.587 --> 00:02:05.668
males have a tiny washboard and scraper
on their penis,

00:02:05.668 --> 00:02:09.989
which produces a song that reverberates
throughout the female's body

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.828
when they mate.

00:02:11.828 --> 00:02:15.459
It's thought that if female crane flies
enjoy this unusual serenade,

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.876
they'll allow the male 
to father their offspring.

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:22.718
This way, the genes of the most
musical penises spread,

00:02:22.718 --> 00:02:27.509
leading to rapid evolution
of insects' phalluses.

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:31.820
Similarly, some beetles have two little
drumsticks on either side of the penis.
