00:07:55.872 --> 00:08:00.684
those two forms of violence account
for more death and disability

00:08:00.684 --> 00:08:07.688
than malaria, than car accidents,
than war combined.

00:08:11.298 --> 00:08:16.075
The truth is, the poor of our world
are trapped in whole systems of violence.

00:08:16.075 --> 00:08:20.108
In South Asia, for instance,
I could drive past this rice mill

00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:23.045
and see this man hoisting 
these 100-pound sacks

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.089
of rice upon his thin back.

00:08:25.089 --> 00:08:26.907
But I would have no idea, until later,

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:29.349
that he was actually a slave,

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:33.738
held by violence in that rice mill
since I was in high school.
