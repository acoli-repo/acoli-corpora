than in any other time in human history.

00:09:01.071 --> 00:09:07.050
Experts tell us that there's about
35 million people in slavery today.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.711
That's about the population 
of the entire nation of Canada,

00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:14.179
where we're sitting today.

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:17.483
This is why, over time, I have come
to call this epidemic of violence

00:09:17.483 --> 00:09:19.772
the Locust Effect.

00:09:19.772 --> 00:09:22.783
Because in the lives of the poor,
it just descends like a plague

00:09:22.783 --> 00:09:25.571
and it destroys everything.

00:09:25.571 --> 00:09:29.954
In fact, now when you survey
very, very poor communities,

00:09:29.954 --> 00:09:34.038
residents will tell you that their
greatest fear is violence.
