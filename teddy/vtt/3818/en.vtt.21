In fact, nothing expresses that assumption
more clearly than three simple numbers:

00:10:31.137 --> 00:10:33.598

to a police 911 emergency call

00:10:44.147 --> 00:10:45.810
is about 10 minutes.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.995

law enforcement to protect you?

00:10:54.582 --> 00:10:59.204

00:10:59.204 --> 00:11:03.545
She was home alone in her 
dark house on a Saturday night,
