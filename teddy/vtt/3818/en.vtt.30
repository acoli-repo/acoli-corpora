But the more fundamental reason

00:15:05.408 --> 00:15:08.188

in the developing world

00:15:08.188 --> 00:15:10.072
is so neglected,

00:15:10.072 --> 00:15:13.957
is because the people inside
the developing world, with money,

00:15:13.957 --> 00:15:16.075
don't need it.

00:15:17.165 --> 00:15:19.745
I was at the World Economic 
Forum not long ago

00:15:19.745 --> 00:15:23.689
talking to corporate executives who have
massive businesses in the developing world

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:25.771
and I was just asking them,

00:15:25.771 --> 00:15:31.325
"How do you guys protect all your people
and property from all the violence?"
