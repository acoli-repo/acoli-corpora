00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.619
To be honest, by personality,

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:06.236
I'm just not much of a crier.

00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:10.596
But I think in my career
that's been a good thing.

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:12.630
I'm a civil rights lawyer,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.634
and I've seen some 
horrible things in the world.

00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:20.844
I began my career working 
police abuse cases in the United States.

00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:24.318
And then in 1994, I was sent to Rwanda

00:00:24.318 --> 00:00:29.248
to be the director of the U.N.'s 
genocide investigation.

00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:33.647
It turns out that tears 
just aren't much help
