residents will tell you that their
greatest fear is violence.

00:09:34.038 --> 00:09:36.607
But notice the violence that they fear

00:09:36.607 --> 00:09:39.785
is not the violence of 
genocide or the wars,

00:09:39.785 --> 00:09:42.140
it's everyday violence.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.353
So for me, as a lawyer, of course,
my first reaction was to think,

00:09:45.353 --> 00:09:47.667
well, of course we've
got to change all the laws.

00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:51.167
We've got to make all this violence
against the poor illegal.

00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:54.902
But then I found out, it already is.

00:09:54.902 --> 00:09:57.742
The problem is not that 
the poor don't get laws,

00:09:57.742 --> 00:10:01.442
it's that they don't get law enforcement.
