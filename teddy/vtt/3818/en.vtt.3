with one of the world's greatest
successes of compassion.

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:38.071
And that's the fight against 
global poverty.

00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:40.854
It's a cause that probably
has involved all of us here.

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:42.852
I don't know if your first introduction

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:46.217
might have been choruses of
"We Are the World,"

00:01:46.217 --> 00:01:50.280
or maybe the picture of a sponsored child
on your refrigerator door,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.367
or maybe the birthday you
donated for fresh water.

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:57.581
I don't really remember what my first
introduction to poverty was

00:01:57.581 --> 00:02:01.145
but I do remember the most jarring.
