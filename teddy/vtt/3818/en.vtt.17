Decades of anti-poverty programs
right in his community

00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:42.321
were never able to rescue him
or any of the hundred other slaves

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:45.957
from the beatings and the rapes
and the torture

00:08:45.957 --> 00:08:49.652
of violence inside the rice mill.

00:08:49.652 --> 00:08:54.032

00:08:54.032 --> 00:08:57.706
have left more poor people in slavery

00:08:57.706 --> 00:09:01.071
than in any other time in human history.
