00:13:35.889 --> 00:13:39.660
So you would think that the disintegration
of basic law enforcement

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.675
in the developing world
would be a huge priority

00:13:42.675 --> 00:13:45.915
for the global fight against poverty.

00:13:45.915 --> 00:13:48.048
But it's not.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:52.825
Auditors of international assistance
recently couldn't find

00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:56.659
even one percent of aid going 
to protect the poor

00:13:56.659 --> 00:14:00.990
from the lawless chaos 
of everyday violence.
