That word, compassion, actually 
comes from two Latin words:

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.642
cum passio, which simply mean 
"to suffer with."

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:10.204
And the things that I saw and experienced

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:12.790
in Rwanda as I got up close
to human suffering,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.129
it did, in moments, move me to tears.

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:18.855
But I just wish that I, 
and the rest of the world,

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:21.370
had been moved earlier.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.034
And not just to tears,

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:26.834
but to actually stop the genocide.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.292
Now by contrast, I've also been involved

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:35.125
with one of the world's greatest
successes of compassion.
