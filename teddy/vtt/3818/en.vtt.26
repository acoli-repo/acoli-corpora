00:12:56.002 --> 00:13:00.687
In South Asia, if you 
enslave a poor person,

00:13:00.687 --> 00:13:03.610
you're at greater risk of being 
struck by lightning

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.660
than ever being sent 
to jail for that crime.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.639
And so the epidemic of everyday 
violence, it just rages on.

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:15.738
And it devastates our efforts to try
to help billions of people

00:13:15.738 --> 00:13:19.315
out of their two-dollar-a-day hell.

00:13:19.315 --> 00:13:21.817
Because the data just doesn't lie.

00:13:21.817 --> 00:13:24.876
It turns out that you can give 
all manner of goods and services

00:13:24.876 --> 00:13:26.029
to the poor,

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:29.155
but if you don't restrain the hands 
of the violent bullies

00:13:29.155 --> 00:13:30.990
from taking it all away,
