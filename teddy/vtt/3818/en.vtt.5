She described what it was like 
when the coals on the cooking fire

00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:34.967
finally just went completely cold.

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:39.729
When that last drop 
of cooking oil finally ran out.

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.585
When the last of the food, 
despite her best efforts,

00:02:43.585 --> 00:02:44.693
ran out.

00:02:46.113 --> 00:02:49.096
She had to watch her youngest son, Peter,

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.878
suffer from malnutrition,

00:02:51.878 --> 00:02:55.954
as his legs just slowly bowed 
into uselessness.

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:59.302
As his eyes grew cloudy and dim.

00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:03.480
And then as Peter finally grew cold.
