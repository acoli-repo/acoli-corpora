00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.552
none of the traditional 
anti-poverty programs

00:06:30.552 --> 00:06:34.518
were going to stop Brutus,

00:06:34.518 --> 00:06:37.872
because they weren't meant to.

00:06:37.872 --> 00:06:42.878
This became even more clear
to me when I met Griselda.

00:06:42.878 --> 00:06:47.097
She's a marvelous young girl
living in a very poor community

00:06:47.097 --> 00:06:48.913
in Guatemala.

00:06:48.913 --> 00:06:51.310
And one of the things
we've learned over the years

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.881
is that perhaps the most powerful thing

00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:56.725
that Griselda and her family can do

00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:59.390
to get Griselda and her family 
out of poverty

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.514
is to make sure that she goes to school.
