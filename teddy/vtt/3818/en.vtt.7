00:03:29.715 --> 00:03:32.845
but the truth is this:

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:36.396
The fight against global poverty
is probably the broadest,

00:03:36.396 --> 00:03:41.531
longest running manifestation of the 
human phenomenon of compassion

00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.673
in the history of our species.

00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:48.322
And so I'd like to share
a pretty shattering insight

00:03:48.322 --> 00:03:52.615
that might forever change the way
you think about that struggle.

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:55.438
But first, let me begin with what
you probably already know.

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:58.920
Thirty-five years ago, when I would have
been graduating from high school,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.297
they told us that 40,000 kids every day
died because of poverty.
