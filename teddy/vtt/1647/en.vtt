00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:03.115
I had brain surgery 18 years ago,

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:05.682
and since that time, brain science has become

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:07.681
a personal passion of mine.

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.916
I'm actually an engineer.

00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:12.432
And first let me say, I recently joined

00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:13.981
Google's Moonshot group,

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.193
where I had a division,

00:00:15.193 --> 00:00:17.374
the display division in Google X,

00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:19.996
and the brain science work I'm speaking about today

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:22.917
is work I did before I joined Google

00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:25.249
and on the side outside of Google.

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.432
So that said, there's a stigma

00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:30.717
when you have brain surgery.
