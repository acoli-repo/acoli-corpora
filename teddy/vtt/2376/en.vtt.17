and by "this," I mean the stealing

00:08:31.836 --> 00:08:34.299
conversations or photos,

00:08:34.323 --> 00:08:35.942
and then making them public --

00:08:36.776 --> 00:08:38.458
public without consent,

00:08:39.214 --> 00:08:41.021
public without context

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:44.129
and public without compassion.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.236
Fast-forward 12 years, to 2010,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.706

more populated with instances like mine,

00:08:57.921 --> 00:09:00.409
whether or not someone
actually made a mistake,
