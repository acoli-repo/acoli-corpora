00:03:59.286 --> 00:04:01.421
almost instantaneously.

00:04:03.381 --> 00:04:06.257
This rush to judgment,
enabled by technology,

00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:09.358
led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.803
Granted, it was before social media,

00:04:12.827 --> 00:04:16.207
but people could still comment online,

00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:17.906
e-mail stories,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.941
and, of course, e-mail cruel jokes.

00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:25.977
News sources plastered
photos of me all over

00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:29.581
to sell newspapers, banner ads online,

00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:31.906
and to keep people tuned to the TV.
