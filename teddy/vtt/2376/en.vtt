00:00:00.763 --> 00:00:05.737
You're looking at a woman
who was publicly silent for a decade.

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:08.290
Obviously, that's changed,

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:10.277
but only recently.

00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:15.408
It was several months ago that I gave
my very first major public talk,

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:18.193
at the Forbes "30 Under 30 Summit" --

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:22.431
1,500 brilliant people,
all under the age of 30.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:29.625
That meant that in 1998,
the oldest among the group were only 14,

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.969
and the youngest, just four.
