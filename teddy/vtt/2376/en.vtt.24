released a staggering statistic
late last year:

00:12:03.558 --> 00:12:10.000
from 2012 to 2013,
there was an 87 percent increase

00:12:10.024 --> 00:12:13.445
in calls and e-mails
related to cyberbullying.

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:17.126
A meta-analysis
done out of the Netherlands

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.007
showed that for the first time,

00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:24.179
cyberbullying was leading
to suicidal ideations

00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:27.181
more significantly than offline bullying.

00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:31.699
