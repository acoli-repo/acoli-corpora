I mean, who can remember
what they said a year ago?

00:07:05.587 --> 00:07:08.599
Scared and mortified, I listen,

00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:14.755
listen as I prattle on about the flotsam
and jetsam of the day;

00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:19.128
listen as I confess my love
for the president,

00:07:19.152 --> 00:07:21.337
and, of course, my heartbreak;

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:28.134
listen to my sometimes catty,
sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self

00:07:28.158 --> 00:07:32.031
being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth;
