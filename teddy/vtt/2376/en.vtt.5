00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:31.034
and I regret that mistake deeply.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.177
In 1998, after having been swept up
into an improbable romance,

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:45.961
I was then swept up into the eye
of a political, legal and media maelstrom

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:48.192
like we had never seen before.

00:02:49.082 --> 00:02:51.710
Remember, just a few years earlier,

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.047
news was consumed from just three places:

00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:57.313
reading a newspaper or magazine,

00:02:57.337 --> 00:02:59.051
listening to the radio

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:00.658
or watching television.
