00:00:01.122 --> 00:00:03.499
Meet Elizabeth Ann.

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:05.835
She's a black-footed ferret,

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:09.297
America's most endangered animal.

00:00:09.338 --> 00:00:14.802
She was cloned using cells
from a ferret that lived 33 years ago.

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:18.681
Elizabeth Ann is a new hope
for the future of her species,

00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:22.602
a chance to actually restore
lost genetic diversity.

00:00:22.643 --> 00:00:25.772
She was born for this
intended consequence.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:29.692
I've been working in conservation
for the last 10 years

00:00:29.692 --> 00:00:32.403
with innovative scientists
from around the world
