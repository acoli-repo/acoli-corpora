00:13:28.344 --> 00:13:31.685
You might be a failure
by standards you hold dear

00:13:31.709 --> 00:13:34.111
but that the world doesn't reward.

00:13:34.719 --> 00:13:36.119
Only you can know.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.526
I know that I am not a tribute

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.036
to my great-grandmother,

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.729
who lived such a short and brutish life,

00:13:44.753 --> 00:13:47.916
if I earn enough money to afford
every creature comfort.

00:13:48.614 --> 00:13:51.743
You can't buy your way
out of suffering or into meaning.

00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:53.501
There is no home big enough

00:13:53.525 --> 00:13:56.547
to erase the pain
that she must have endured.

00:13:57.435 --> 00:13:58.685
I am a tribute to her

00:13:58.709 --> 00:14:03.156
if I live a life as connected
and courageous as possible.
