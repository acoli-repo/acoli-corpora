and courageous as possible.

00:14:04.256 --> 00:14:07.257
In the midst of such
widespread uncertainty,

00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:09.494
we may, in fact, be insecure.

00:14:10.334 --> 00:14:12.860
But we can let that insecurity
make us brittle

00:14:13.216 --> 00:14:14.375
or supple.

00:14:14.859 --> 00:14:19.866
We can turn inward, lose faith
in the power of institutions to change --

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.804
even lose faith in ourselves.

00:14:22.332 --> 00:14:23.736
Or we can turn outward,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:29.385
cultivate faith in our ability
to reach out, to connect, to create.
