00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:37.587
In fact, for the first time

00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:41.731
the majority of parents do not think
that their kids will be better off

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:43.187
than they were.

00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:46.489
This is true of rich and poor,
men and women.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.565

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:55.484
in this idea of economic transcendence,

00:00:55.508 --> 00:00:59.068
that every generation kind of
leapfrogs the one before it,

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.790
earning more, buying more, being more.
