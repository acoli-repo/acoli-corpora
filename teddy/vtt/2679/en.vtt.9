00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:31.422
21 children,

00:04:31.446 --> 00:04:33.828
with one woman, my great-grandmother,

00:04:33.852 --> 00:04:37.252
who died at 47 years old
of ovarian cancer.

00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:39.880
Now, I'm pregnant with my second child,

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:44.478
and I cannot even fathom
what she must have gone through.

00:04:44.502 --> 00:04:48.088
And if you're trying to do the math --
there were six sets of twins.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.548
So my grandfather, their son,

00:04:51.572 --> 00:04:53.271
became a traveling salesman,

00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:54.790
and he lived boom and bust.

00:04:54.814 --> 00:04:58.500
So my dad grew up answering
the door for debt collectors

00:04:58.524 --> 00:05:00.519
and pretending his parents weren't home.
