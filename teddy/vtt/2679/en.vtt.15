00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:31.182
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:07:31.206 --> 00:07:34.510
and start asking them,
"How do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:07:35.247 --> 00:07:37.146
Their work will constantly change.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.145
The common denominator is them.

00:07:39.504 --> 00:07:41.445
So the more they understand their gifts

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:43.924
and create crews of ideal collaborators,

00:07:43.948 --> 00:07:45.788
the better off they will be.

00:07:46.717 --> 00:07:49.380
The challenge ahead is to reinvent
the social safety net

00:07:49.404 --> 00:07:52.341
to fit this increasingly
fragmented economy.

00:07:52.365 --> 00:07:54.224
We need portable health benefits.

00:07:54.248 --> 00:07:57.857
We need policies that reflect
that everyone deserves to be vulnerable

00:07:57.881 --> 00:07:59.379
or care for vulnerable others,

00:07:59.403 --> 00:08:01.011
without becoming destitute.
