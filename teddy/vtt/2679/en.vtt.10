00:04:58.524 --> 00:05:00.519
and pretending his parents weren't home.

He actually took his braces off himself
with pliers in the garage,

00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:07.342
when his father admitted
he didn't have money

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:09.040
to go back to the orthodontist.

00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:12.549
So my dad, unsurprisingly,

00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:14.641
became a bankruptcy lawyer.

00:05:14.665 --> 00:05:16.713

So I ask these questions
by way of a few generations of struggle.

00:05:26.895 --> 00:05:29.952
My parents made sure that I grew up
on a kind of steady ground

00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:33.293
that allows one to question
and risk and leap.
