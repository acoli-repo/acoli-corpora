00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.634
The "new better off,"
as I've come to call it,

00:12:30.658 --> 00:12:33.614
is less about investing
in the perfect family

00:12:33.638 --> 00:12:37.123
and more about investing
in the imperfect village,

00:12:37.147 --> 00:12:39.373
whether that's relatives
living under one roof,

00:12:39.397 --> 00:12:41.237
a cohousing community like mine,

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.191
or just a bunch of neighbors
who pledge to really know

00:12:44.215 --> 00:12:45.721
and look out for one another.

00:12:46.134 --> 00:12:48.003
It's good common sense, right?

00:12:48.466 --> 00:12:51.273
And yet, money has often made us dumb

00:12:51.297 --> 00:12:52.662
about reaching out.

00:12:53.575 --> 00:12:55.608
The most reliable wealth

00:12:55.632 --> 00:12:58.191
is found in relationship.

00:12:59.511 --> 00:13:02.731
The new better off is not
an individual prospect at all.
