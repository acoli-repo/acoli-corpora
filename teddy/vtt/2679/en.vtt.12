00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:03.947
trying to fit women into a work world
built for company men.

00:06:04.358 --> 00:06:06.248
And many have done backbends to fit in,

00:06:06.272 --> 00:06:08.897
but others have carved
a more unconventional path,

00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:11.851
creating a patchwork of meaning and money

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:14.596
with enough flexibility
to do what they need to do

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.286
for those that they love.

00:06:16.993 --> 00:06:19.159
My mom called it "just making it work."

00:06:19.574 --> 00:06:23.043
Today I hear life coaches
call it "a portfolio career."

00:06:23.956 --> 00:06:25.615
Whatever you call it,

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.708
more and more men are craving
these whole, if not harried, lives.
