00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.234
All right, so is better off getting
a big house with a white picket fence?

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.147
Less of us are doing that.

00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:08.374
Nearly five million people lost
their homes in the Great Recession,

00:02:08.398 --> 00:02:12.772
and even more of us sobered up
about the lengths we were willing to go --

00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:15.543
or be tricked into going,
in many predatory cases --

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:17.074
to hold that deed.

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:21.258
Home-ownership rates
are at their lowest since 1995.

00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:25.465
All right, so we're not
finding steady employment,

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.222
we're not earning as much money,

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.658
and we're not living in big fancy houses.
