00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.349
from the most profound kind
of knowing there is:

00:07:03.373 --> 00:07:05.518
knowing the human condition.

00:07:06.442 --> 00:07:08.594
By prioritizing care,

00:07:08.618 --> 00:07:11.194
men are, in a sense, staking their claim

00:07:11.218 --> 00:07:14.121
to the full range of human existence.

00:07:15.097 --> 00:07:18.233
Now, this means the nine-to-five
no longer works for anyone.

00:07:18.685 --> 00:07:21.511
Punch clocks are becoming obsolete,
as are career ladders.

00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:24.603
Whole industries are being born
and dying every day.

00:07:24.627 --> 00:07:26.558
It's all nonlinear from here.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.102
So we need to stop asking kids,

00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:31.182
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
