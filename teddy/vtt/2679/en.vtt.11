00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:33.293
that allows one to question
and risk and leap.

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.223
And ironically, and probably
sometimes to their frustration,

00:05:37.247 --> 00:05:40.531
it is their steadfast
commitment to security

00:05:40.555 --> 00:05:43.020
that allows me to question its value,

00:05:43.044 --> 00:05:46.022
or at least its value
as we've historically defined it

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:47.759
in the 21st century.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.854
So let's dig into this first question:

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.048
How should we work?

00:05:54.397 --> 00:05:57.008
We should work like our mothers.

00:05:57.754 --> 00:05:59.893
That's right -- we've spent decades

00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:03.947
trying to fit women into a work world
built for company men.
