00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:31.764
Those are nearly extinct.

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:35.785
People move jobs, on average,
every 4.7 years,

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:37.770
and it's estimated that by 2020,

00:01:37.794 --> 00:01:40.650
nearly half of Americans
will be freelancers.

00:01:41.523 --> 00:01:44.474
OK, so is better off just a number?

00:01:44.498 --> 00:01:47.465
Is it about earning
as much as you possibly can?

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.292
By that singular measurement,
we are failing.

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:55.513
Median per capita income
has been flat since about 2000,

00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:57.099
adjusted for inflation.

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.234
All right, so is better off getting
a big house with a white picket fence?
