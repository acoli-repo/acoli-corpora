00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.800
we share an industrial-sized
kitchen and eating area,

00:11:01.824 --> 00:11:03.889
where we have common meals twice a week.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.152
Now, people, when I tell them
I live like this,

00:11:06.176 --> 00:11:08.082
often have one of two extreme reactions.

00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:10.755
Either they say, "Why doesn't
everyone live like this?"

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:13.507
Or they say, "That sounds
totally horrifying.

00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:15.030
I would never want to do that."

00:11:15.054 --> 00:11:20.201
So let me reassure you: there is
a sacred respect for privacy among us,

00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:24.931
but also a commitment to what we call
"radical hospitality" --

00:11:25.535 --> 00:11:27.958
not the kind advertised
by the Four Seasons,

00:11:28.704 --> 00:11:34.331
but the kind that says that every
single person is worthy of kindness,
