earning more, buying more, being more.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.457
We've exported this dream
all over the world,

00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:08.390
so kids in Brazil and China and even Kenya

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:10.783
inherit our insatiable expectation

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.354
for more.

00:01:13.063 --> 00:01:16.120
But when I read this historic poll
for the first time,

00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:18.117
it didn't actually make me feel sad.

00:01:18.593 --> 00:01:20.339
It felt like a provocation.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.014
"Better off" -- based on whose standards?

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.113
Is "better off" finding a secure job

00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:29.628
that you can count on
for the rest of your life?
