00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.091
I'm a journalist,

00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:04.666
so I like to look for the untold stories,

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.396
the lives that quietly play out
under the scream of headlines.

00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:12.434
I've also been going about the business
of putting down roots,

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:14.762
choosing a partner, making babies.

00:00:15.206 --> 00:00:17.437
So for the last few years,

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:18.924
I've been trying to understand

00:00:18.948 --> 00:00:22.396
what constitutes
the 21st-century good life,

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:27.695
both because I'm fascinated by the moral
and philosophical implications,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.799
but also because I'm in desperate
need of answers myself.
