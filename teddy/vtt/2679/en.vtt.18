00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.713
Many Americans are rejecting
the white picket fence

00:09:00.737 --> 00:09:04.052
and the kind of highly privatized life
that happened within it,

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.866
and reclaiming village life,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.470
reclaiming interdependence instead.

00:09:09.311 --> 00:09:10.914
Fifty million of us, for example,

00:09:10.938 --> 00:09:13.613
live in intergenerational households.

00:09:14.018 --> 00:09:16.746
This number exploded
with the Great Recession,

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.408
but it turns out people
actually like living this way.

00:09:19.432 --> 00:09:23.280
Two-thirds of those who are living
with multiple generations under one roof

00:09:23.304 --> 00:09:25.673
say it's improved their relationships.

00:09:26.145 --> 00:09:28.969
Some people are choosing
to share homes not with family,

00:09:28.993 --> 00:09:32.353
but with other people who understand
the health and economic benefits
