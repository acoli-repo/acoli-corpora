00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:32.087
Toll the funeral bells

00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:34.680
for everything that made America great.

00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:37.299
But,

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:41.673
are those the best measurements
of a country's greatness,

00:02:41.697 --> 00:02:43.198
of a life well lived?

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.455
What I think makes America great
is its spirit of reinvention.

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.752
In the wake of the Great Recession,

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:53.933
more and more Americans are redefining
what "better off" really means.

00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:58.398
Turns out, it has more to do
with community and creativity

00:02:58.422 --> 00:03:00.107
than dollars and cents.
