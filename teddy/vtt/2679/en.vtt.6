than dollars and cents.

00:03:00.917 --> 00:03:02.956
Now, let me be very clear:

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.673
the 14.8 percent of Americans
living in poverty need money,

00:03:08.697 --> 00:03:10.077
plain and simple.

00:03:10.101 --> 00:03:13.762
And all of us need policies
that protect us from exploitation

00:03:13.786 --> 00:03:16.987
by employers and financial institutions.

00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:21.662
Nothing that follows is meant to suggest
that the gap between rich and poor

00:03:21.686 --> 00:03:25.057
is anything but profoundly immoral.

00:03:26.224 --> 00:03:27.529
But,

00:03:27.553 --> 00:03:30.192
too often we let
the conversation stop there.
