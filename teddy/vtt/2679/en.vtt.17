00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:30.611
When they came to America,

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:34.865
they often shared apartments,
survival tactics, child care --

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.895
always knew how to fill one more belly,

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.179
no matter how small the food available.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.336
But they were told that success meant
leaving the village behind

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.412
and pursuing that iconic symbol
of the American Dream,

00:08:46.436 --> 00:08:47.912
the white picket fence.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.484
And even today,
we see a white picket fence

00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:52.881
and we think success, self-possession.

00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:55.136
But when you strip away
the sentimentality,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.536
what it really does is divides us.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.713
Many Americans are rejecting
the white picket fence
