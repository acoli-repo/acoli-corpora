this prolific blackberry bush
that snakes around a community garden,

00:10:33.701 --> 00:10:36.914
all smack-dab, by the way,

and we live in homes that have everything
a typical home would have.

00:10:58.106 --> 00:10:59.260
But additionally,

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.800
we share an industrial-sized
kitchen and eating area,
