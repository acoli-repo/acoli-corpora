00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Sixty-five million years ago, a very important

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and catastrophic event

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
changed the course of life on land.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
are just the scum of the Earth on the land --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the little bits of land floating around -- but they are important to us

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And these animals disappeared,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and a separate life, mammals,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
radiated out to take their place. And so, we know this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in extraordinary detail. And so this is a core

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
from near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis, the earthquakes,
