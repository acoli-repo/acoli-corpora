00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I've been playing TED for nearly a decade,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and I've very rarely played

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
any new songs of my own.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that was largely because there weren't any.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
(Laughter)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So I've been busy with a couple of projects,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and one of them was this:

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The Nutmeg.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
A 1930s ship's lifeboat,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which I've been restoring in the garden

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of my beach house in England.
