00:00:01.388 --> 00:00:02.976
I bet you're worried.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.976
(Laughter)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.274
I was worried.

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:08.829
That's why I began this piece.

00:00:08.853 --> 00:00:11.841
I was worried about vaginas.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:14.976
I was worried what we think about vaginas

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.242
and even more worried
that we don't think about them.

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:20.829
I was worried about my own vagina.

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:25.285
It needed a context, a culture,
a community of other vaginas.

00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:29.720
There is so much darkness
and secrecy surrounding them.

00:00:29.744 --> 00:00:34.392
Like the Bermuda Triangle,
nobody ever reports back from there.
