We need to change the way we think
about the climate challenge.

00:00:06.196 --> 00:00:08.276
Because things are different this time.

00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:15.116
We need to stop thinking about it
just as a problem, which it obviously is,

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:18.236
and start thinking about it
as an opportunity

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:20.596
which will motivate us to solve it.

00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:23.276
I'm a venture investor.

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:27.476
I invest in early stage companies
and technologies,

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:32.716
and I see tremendous opportunities
in solving climate change.
