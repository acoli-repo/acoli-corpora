00:01:27.598 --> 00:01:31.298
so that any answer 
yields useful information.

00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:35.827
First of all, we can get around
to not knowing what 'ozo' and 'ulu' mean

00:01:35.827 --> 00:01:39.578
by including the words themselves
in the questions,

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:43.539
and secondly, if we load each question
with a hypothetical condition,

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.988
whether an alien is lying or not
won't actually matter.

00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:49.559
To see how that could work,

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:53.630
imagine our question
is whether two plus two is four.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.399
Instead of posing it directly,

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.348
we say, "If I asked you whether
two plus two is four,

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:01.539
would you answer 'ozo'?"
