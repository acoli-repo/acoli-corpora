00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:30.961
You could already be talking to Arr,
in which case the answer is meaningless.

00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:34.921
But otherwise, you're talking to either
Tee or Eff,

00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:36.191
and as we know,

00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:41.402
getting 'ozo' from either one means 
your hypothetical question was correct,

00:03:41.402 --> 00:03:44.713
and the left overlord is indeed Arr.

00:03:44.713 --> 00:03:49.463
Either way, you can be sure the alien
on the right is not Arr.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:52.072
Similarly, if the answer is 'ulu,'

00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:55.662
then you know the alien 
on the left can't be Arr.

00:03:55.662 --> 00:04:00.027
Now go to the overlord you've determined
isn't Arr and ask,
