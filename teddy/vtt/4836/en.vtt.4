00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:01.539
would you answer 'ozo'?"

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.619
If 'ozo' means yes 
and the overlord is Tee,

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.359
it truthfully replies, "ozo."

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.289
But what if we ask Eff?

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.459
Well, it would answer "ulu,"
or no to the embedded question,

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.116
so it lies and replies 'ozo' instead.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:20.049
And if 'ozo' actually means no,

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.589
then the answer to 
our embedded question is 'ulu,'

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:27.069
and both Tee and Eff still reply 'ozo,'

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.110
each for their own reasons.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.180
