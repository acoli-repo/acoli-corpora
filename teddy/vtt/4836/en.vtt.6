00:02:56.621 --> 00:03:01.231
But don't worry, we can use our first
question to identify one alien lord

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:03.771
that definitely isn't Arr.

00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:08.112
Then we can use the second to find out
whether its Tee or Eff.

00:03:08.112 --> 00:03:09.371
And once we know that,

00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.955
we can ask it to identify 
one of the others.

00:03:12.955 --> 00:03:14.732
So let's begin.

00:03:14.732 --> 00:03:16.452
Ask the alien in the middle,

00:03:16.452 --> 00:03:22.122
"If I asked you whether the overlord on
my left is Arr, would you answer 'ozo'?"

00:03:22.122 --> 00:03:26.342
If the reply is 'ozo,' 
there are two possibilities.

00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:30.961
You could already be talking to Arr,
in which case the answer is meaningless.
