00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:01.628
and which means no.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:05.188
How can you still figure out 
which alien is which?

00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:08.147
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:09.968
Answer in: 3

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:11.447
2

00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:12.716
1

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:17.228
At first, this puzzle seems not just hard,
but downright impossible.

00:01:17.228 --> 00:01:18.797
What good is asking a question

00:01:18.797 --> 00:01:23.227
if you can neither understand the answer
nor know if it's true?

00:01:23.227 --> 00:01:24.918
But it can be done.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.598
The key is to carefully formulate
our questions

00:01:27.598 --> 00:01:31.298
so that any answer 
yields useful information.
