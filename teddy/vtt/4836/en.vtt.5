00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.180
If you're confused about why this works,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.610
the reason involves logical structure.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.640
A double positive and a double negative
both result in a positive.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.320
Now, we can be sure that asking
either Tee or Eff a question put this way

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.461
will yield 'ozo'
if the hypothetical question is true

00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:49.630
and 'ulu' if it's false

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.020
regardless of what 
each word actually means.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.621
Unfortunately, 
this doesn't help us with Arr.

00:02:56.621 --> 00:03:01.231
But don't worry, we can use our first
question to identify one alien lord
