00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:39.187
From an inscription, you learn that you

each addressed to any one lord.

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.747
Tee's answers are always true,

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:46.776
Eff's are always false,

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:50.327

words 'ozo' and 'ulu' means yes

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:01.628
and which means no.
