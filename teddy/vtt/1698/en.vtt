00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:04.268
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies.

00:00:04.268 --> 00:00:06.101
They're exactly what they sound like.

00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:08.654
They are these huge collections of galaxies,

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:10.909
bound together by their mutual gravity.

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.571
So most of the points that you see on the screen

00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:16.100
are not individual stars,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.936
but collections of stars, or galaxies.

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:21.267
Now, by showing you some of these images,

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:23.014
I hope that you will quickly see that

00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:25.694
galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects,

00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:27.187
but more than that,

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:29.850
I think galaxy clusters are mysterious,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.403
they are surprising,
