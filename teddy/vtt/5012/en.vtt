00:00:06.998 --> 00:00:11.978
The cry of the crowd. The roar of a lion. 
The clash of metal.

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:17.013
Starting in 80 CE these sounds rang 
through the stands of the Colosseum.

00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:18.406
On hundreds of days a year,

00:00:18.406 --> 00:00:23.076
over 50,000 residents of Rome and 
visitors from across the Roman Empire

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:28.414
would fill the stadiumsâ€™ four stories to 
see gladiators duel, animals fight,

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:31.203
and chariots race around the arena.
