As soon as Pharaoh Khufu ascended
the throne circa 2575 BCE,

00:00:13.718 --> 00:00:16.929
work on his eternal resting place began.

00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:20.016
The structure’s architect, Hemiunu,

00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:24.103
determined he would need 20 years
to finish the royal tomb.

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:28.524
But what he could not predict was
that this monument would remain

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:34.447
the world’s tallest manmade structure
for over 3,800 years.
