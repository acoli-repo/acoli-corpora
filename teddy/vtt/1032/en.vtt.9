I'm sorry, you may have a better

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
imagination than I do --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I can't imagine losing my arm,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and typically at 22 years old.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But compared to that, losing two?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Seems like that would be an inconvenience.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Anyway, I went home that night. I thought about it.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I literally could not sleep

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
thinking about, "I wonder how you'd roll over

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
with no shoulders."

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, I decided we've got to do this.
