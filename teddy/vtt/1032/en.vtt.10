00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, I decided we've got to do this.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And trust me, I've got a day job, I've got a lot of day jobs.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Most of my day job keeps me busy

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power ....

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And I've got a lot of day jobs.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
But I figured I gotta do this.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Did a little investigation,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
went down to Washington, told them

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I still think they're nuts but we're going to do it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And I told them I'd build them an arm.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional.
