When I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
but I told them, "It really doesn't matter what their opinion is.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
There is only one opinion that matters,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
the kids that are either going to use it or not."

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I told a bunch of my engineers, "Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and you're going to see people, lots of them,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
missing major body parts.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
They're probably going to be angry, depressed, frustrated.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
We're probably going to have to give them support, encouragement.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
But we've got to extract from them

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
enough information to make sure we're doing the right thing."
