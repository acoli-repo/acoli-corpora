00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And we took some pretty cruddy home movies.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
At the end of the one I'm going to show, it's only about a minute

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and a couple of seconds long,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Chuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I can't do it.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
He picks up a spoon, picks it up,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
holds the spoon level

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
as he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
to his mouth, and he doesn't drop any milk.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
(Laughter)

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I cannot do that.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
(Laughter)
