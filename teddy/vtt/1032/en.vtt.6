00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and then the punchline: "So, Dean,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we're here because you make medical stuff.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
You're going to give us an arm."

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
paperwork and DODs.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
No, the guy says,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
"We're going to bring a guy into this conference room,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and wearing the arm you're going to give us,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
off this table.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
If it's the grape, they won't break it."

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Great he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.
