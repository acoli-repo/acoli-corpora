00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
you know, before the dust clears,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
if some soldier has been hurt

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
they will be getting world-class triage emergency care

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
in a car accident in a major city in the United States.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
That's the good news.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The bad news is if they've collected this person

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and he or she is missing an arm or leg,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
part of the face, it's probably not coming back.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So, they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm.
