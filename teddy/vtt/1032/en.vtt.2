show you an early, crude video

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because I think it's

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
a better way to tell a story.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
A few years ago I was visited by

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the guy that runs DARPA,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the people that fund all the advanced technologies

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I get this sort of unrequested -- by me anyway -- visit,
