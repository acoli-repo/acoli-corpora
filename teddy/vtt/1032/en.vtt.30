00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I was asked to stop at Texas.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
There were 3,500 people,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
the Veteran's Administration,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
U.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge event

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
to help the families

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
of all the kids --

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
some that have died, some that are

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
like Brandon --

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and they wanted me to speak.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I said, "What am I going to say?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
This is not a happy thing. Look, if this happens to you,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I can give you ... This stuff is

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
still not as good at the original equipment."
