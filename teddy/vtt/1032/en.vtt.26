00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And it was astounding

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
how positive they are.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So, we went back,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and we've been working harder yet.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
We're in clinical trials,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
we've got five of them on people.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We're screaming along.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And I get a call and we go back

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to Washington.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
We go back to Walter Reed,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and a kid, literally,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
20 some-odd days before that

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
was blown up.
