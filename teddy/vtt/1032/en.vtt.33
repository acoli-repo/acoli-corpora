00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Who is entitled to how much?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Who is going to pay for it?"

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Those are tough questions.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I don't have an answer to that. Not everybody

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
It's not possible. It would be nice

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
but let's be realistic.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
They were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I don't know the answers.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
There are other questions that are tough.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
"Should we be there?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
How do we get out?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
What do we need to do?" There's very polarized

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
answers to that question too,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and I don't have any answers to that.
