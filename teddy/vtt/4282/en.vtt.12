00:05:58.628 --> 00:06:03.008
They actually built three prototypes for us by hand.

00:06:03.008 --> 00:06:06.155
So now we have prototypes that can show that four people

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:08.571
can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably

00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:13.068
than a tent could ever provide.

00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:14.818
And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us.

00:06:14.818 --> 00:06:16.271
Now, a funny thing started happening.

00:06:16.271 --> 00:06:18.739
Other people started to believe in what we were doing,

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:20.656
and actually offered us hangar space, donated hangar

00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:22.940
space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.046
was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed.

00:06:27.046 --> 00:06:28.707
So now we had a hangar space to work in,

00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:31.789
and prototypes to demo with.
