00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:05.500
So, I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.631
Forty-two million people

00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:10.741
were displaced by natural disasters in 2010.

00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:13.812
Now, there was nothing particularly special about 2010,

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:17.108
because, on average, 31 and a half million people

00:00:17.108 --> 00:00:20.211
are displaced by natural disasters every single year.

00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:22.759
Now, usually when people hear statistics or stats like that,

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.553
you start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:28.973
exotic or maybe even impoverished areas, but it happens

00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:32.096
right here in the United States every single year.
