00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:00.582
and form these circular pods out of them,

00:03:00.582 --> 00:03:03.038
which give you this semi-private communal area

00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:05.807
for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:07.906
trapped inside these units.

00:03:07.906 --> 00:03:10.331
Now this fundamentally changes

00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:12.489
the way we respond to disasters,

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.467
because gone are the horrid conditions

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:17.192
inside a sports arena or a gymnasium, where people

00:03:17.192 --> 00:03:19.204
are crammed on these cots inside.

00:03:19.204 --> 00:03:24.791
Now we have instant neighborhoods outside.

00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.766
So the Exo is designed to be simply, basically

00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:30.008
like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together
