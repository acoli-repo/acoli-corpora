00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:32.374
from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields,

00:02:32.374 --> 00:02:34.377
because it doesn't require any special setup

00:02:34.377 --> 00:02:36.559
or specialty tools.

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.279
Now, at the foundation and kind of the core

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.213
of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit,

00:02:41.213 --> 00:02:43.646
which is just the individual shelter module.

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:45.378
And though it's light, light enough that you can actually

00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:47.534
lift it by hand and move it around,

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:51.233
and it actually sleeps four people.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.901
And you can arrange these things as kind of more

00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:56.676
for encampments and more of a city grid type layout,

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.571
or you can circle the wagons, essentially,

00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:00.582
and form these circular pods out of them,
