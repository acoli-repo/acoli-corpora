00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:31.789
and prototypes to demo with.

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.356
So in one year, we've negotiated manufacturing agreements,

00:06:35.356 --> 00:06:38.017
been awarded one patent, filed our second patent,

00:06:38.017 --> 00:06:40.700
talked to multiple people, demoed this to FEMA

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.948
and its consultants to rave reviews,

00:06:42.948 --> 00:06:45.131
and then started talking to some other people who requested

00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:47.622
information, this little group called the United Nations.

00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:49.727
And on top of that, now we have

00:06:49.727 --> 00:06:52.371
a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up

00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:55.862
and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps,

00:06:55.862 --> 00:06:58.294
mobile youth hostels, right down to the World Cup

00:06:58.294 --> 00:07:00.879
and the Olympics.
