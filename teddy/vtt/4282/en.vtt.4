talking to experts in the field, taking their feedback,

00:02:00.838 --> 00:02:03.749
and refining, and I kept on refining and refining

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.805

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.575
full-size prototypes in my own backyard — (Laughter) —

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:14.941
and actually spending my own personal savings on

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:28.431
It can be put up in any environment,

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:32.374
from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields,
