00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:30.008
like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:32.933
so we get extremely efficient transportation

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:35.184
and storage out of them.

00:03:35.184 --> 00:03:39.820
In fact, 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.994
This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up

00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:47.978
faster than any other housing option available today.

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:49.967
But I'm obsessive, so I couldn't just stop there,

00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:51.856
so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:54.164
actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving,

00:03:54.164 --> 00:03:55.676
so the same unit can now be used

00:03:55.676 --> 00:03:58.901
for an office or storage location.

00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:02.619
The doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on
