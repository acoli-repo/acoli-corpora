00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:33.059
our Milan office for a few months, so I was like,

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.796
what will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar,

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:38.996
and spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:43.016
with material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers.

00:05:43.016 --> 00:05:44.470
And we found through this whole process, we found

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.844
this great little manufacturer in Virginia,

00:05:46.844 --> 00:05:48.997
and if his body language is any indication,

00:05:48.997 --> 00:05:51.076
that's the owner — (Laughter) — of what it's like

00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:53.169
for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer,

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.372
you've got to see what happens here. (Laughter)

00:05:56.372 --> 00:05:58.628
But G.S. Industries was fantastic.

00:05:58.628 --> 00:06:03.008
They actually built three prototypes for us by hand.
