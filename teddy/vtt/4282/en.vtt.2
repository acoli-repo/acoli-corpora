00:00:56.715 --> 00:01:00.226
or a gymnasium.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.288
So obviously there's a massive housing gap,

00:01:03.288 --> 00:01:06.196
and this really upset me, because academia tells you

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:08.485
after a major disaster, there's typically about

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.824
an 18-month time frame to -- we kinda recover,

00:01:11.824 --> 00:01:13.401
start the recovery process,

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:15.766
but what most people don't realize is that on average

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.830
it takes 45 to 60 days or more

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.692
for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up.

00:01:21.692 --> 00:01:25.310
Before that time, people are left to their own devices.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.686
So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way

00:01:28.686 --> 00:01:30.836
to actually fill this gap.
