The doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:05.488
a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control,

00:04:05.488 --> 00:04:07.954
or a connector module that would allow you to actually

00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:10.339
connect multiple units together, which gives you

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:14.005
larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces,

00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:16.317
so now this same kit of parts, this same unit

00:04:16.317 --> 00:04:20.960
can actually serve as a living room, bedroom or bathroom,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.067
or an office, a living space and secure storage.

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:30.134
Sounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real?
