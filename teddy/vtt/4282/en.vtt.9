Sounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real?

00:04:30.134 --> 00:04:32.138
So the first idea I had, initially, was just

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:33.994
to go the federal and state governments and go,

00:04:33.994 --> 00:04:36.657
"Here, take it, for free."

00:04:36.657 --> 00:04:38.640
But I was quickly told that, "Boy, our government

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.898
doesn't really work like that." (Laughter)

00:04:40.898 --> 00:04:44.883
Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:47.726
to kind of help consult and get this idea going

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:49.829
along with the government, but then I was told,

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:52.304
"Son, our government looks to private sector

00:04:52.304 --> 00:04:53.901
for things like this."

00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:56.891
Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go

00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:59.311
to private corporations that would have this mutually shared

00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:02.214
benefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations
