00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:32.096
right here in the United States every single year.

00:00:32.096 --> 00:00:35.111
Last year alone, 99 federally declared disasters

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:37.357
were on file with FEMA,

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:40.548
from Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama,

00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:44.939
to the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:47.004
Now, how does the most powerful country in the world

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.103
handle these displaced people?

00:00:49.103 --> 00:00:51.532
They cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings

00:00:51.532 --> 00:00:53.700
in a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.715
and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena,

00:00:56.715 --> 00:01:00.226
or a gymnasium.
