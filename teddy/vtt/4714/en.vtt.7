00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:30.148
And there were so many of them,

00:03:30.172 --> 00:03:32.363
and they married so
many of the English women,

00:03:32.387 --> 00:03:34.544
that pretty soon, if you
grew up in England,

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:38.184
you heard streamlined English
as much as the real kind.

00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:41.003
After a while nobody remembered
the real kind any more.

00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:43.679
Nobody remembered that once you said doora

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:44.847
instead of doors

00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:47.009
and handa instead of hands.

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.840
Plurals made a lot more sense now,

00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:50.993
except for a few hold-outs like children

00:03:51.017 --> 00:03:51.925
and teeth

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.015
that get used so much

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.370
that it was hard to break the habit.

00:03:55.394 --> 00:03:56.276
The lesson is

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.062
that English makes a lot
more sense than you think.

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:00.612
Thank the ancestors of people
