00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:30.906
but what gender they were, too.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.991
And while today there
are only about a dozen plurals

00:01:33.015 --> 00:01:34.059
that don't make sense,

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:34.745
like men

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:35.546
and geese,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.554
in Old English, it was perfectly normal

00:01:37.578 --> 00:01:40.126
for countless plurals to be like that.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.997
You think it's odd that more
than one goose is geese?

00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:44.844
Well, imagine if more than one goat

00:01:44.868 --> 00:01:46.465
was a bunch of gat,

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:48.175
or if more than one oak tree

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:50.259
was a field of ack.

00:01:50.283 --> 00:01:52.093
To be able to talk about any of these,

00:01:52.117 --> 00:01:54.826
you just had to know the exact
word for their plural

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.799
rather than just adding
the handy S on the end.

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.237
And it wasn't always
an S at the end either.
