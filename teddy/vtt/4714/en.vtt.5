00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:32.175
Old English people had
toungen instead of tongues,

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.110
namen instead of names,

00:02:34.134 --> 00:02:36.111
and if things stayed the way they were,

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:40.075
today we would have eyen instead of eyes.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.374
So, why didn't things
stay the way they were?

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:44.043
In a word, Vikings.

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:46.630
In the 8th century, Scandinavian marauders

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:48.514
started taking over much of England.

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:49.542
They didn't speak English,

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:50.961
they spoke Norse.

00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:52.224
Plus, they were grown-ups,

00:02:52.248 --> 00:02:53.596
and grown-ups aren't as good

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.733
at learning languages as children.

00:02:55.757 --> 00:02:58.081
After the age of roughly 15,

00:02:58.105 --> 00:03:00.296
it's almost impossible
to learn a new language
