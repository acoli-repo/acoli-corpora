00:02:58.105 --> 00:03:00.296
it's almost impossible
to learn a new language

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.151
without an accent

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:03.203
and without slipping up here and there

00:03:03.227 --> 00:03:06.685
as we all know from what language
classes are like.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.403
The Vikings were no different,

00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:10.259
so they had a way of smoothing away

00:03:10.283 --> 00:03:12.605
the harder parts of how English worked.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.012
Part of that was those crazy plurals.

00:03:15.036 --> 00:03:16.798
Imagine running up against a language

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:17.532
with eggru

00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:18.147
and gat

00:03:18.171 --> 00:03:19.228
on the one hand,

00:03:19.252 --> 00:03:20.396
and then with other words,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.801
all you have to do is add 's'

00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:22.398
and get days

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:23.736
and stones.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.864
Wouldn't it make things easier

00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:27.257
to just use the 's' for everything?

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.034
That's how the Vikings felt too.

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:30.148
And there were so many of them,
