00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.233
Although if there were only one of them,

00:00:30.257 --> 00:00:31.921
it would be a woman.

00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:33.824
Or if there's more than one goose,

00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:35.066
they're geese,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.531
but why not lots of mooses, meese?

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:39.235
Or if you have two feet,

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:41.405
then why don't you read two beek

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:43.488
instead of books.

00:00:43.512 --> 00:00:45.655
The fact is that if you
were speaking English

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.632
before about a thousand years ago,

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:49.638
beek is exactly what you would have said

00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:51.507
for more than one book.

00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:53.427
If Modern English is strange,

00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:55.262
Old English needed therapy.

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:56.330
Believe it or not,

00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:58.522
English used to be an even harder language

00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:01.024
to learn than it is today.
