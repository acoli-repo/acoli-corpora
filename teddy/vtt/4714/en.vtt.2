00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:01.024
to learn than it is today.

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:02.796
Twenty-five hundred years ago,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.328
English and German were the same language.

00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:06.758
They drifted apart slowly,

00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:10.091
little by little becoming
more and more different.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:11.687
That meant that in early English,

00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:12.721
just like in German,

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:14.796
inanimate objects had gender.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.182
A fork, gafol, was a woman;

00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:19.166
a spoon, laefel, was a man;

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.019
and the table they were on, bord,

00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:23.762
was neither, also called neuter.

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:24.814
Go figure!

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:26.305
Being able to use words

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.054
meant not just knowing their meaning

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:30.906
but what gender they were, too.
