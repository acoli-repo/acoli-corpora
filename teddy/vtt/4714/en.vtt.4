00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.237
And it wasn't always
an S at the end either.

00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:02.353
In merry Old English,

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:04.235
they could add other sounds to the end.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.702
Just like more than one child is children,

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:09.427
more than one lamb was lambru,

00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:11.594

00:02:11.618 --> 00:02:13.285

One sheep,

00:02:20.617 --> 00:02:21.718

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.588
two house.

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:28.680
And just like today, we have
oxen instead of oxes.

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:32.175
Old English people had
toungen instead of tongues,
