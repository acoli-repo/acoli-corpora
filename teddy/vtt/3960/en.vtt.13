00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.376
Of those who do have access
to just that unpaid leave,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.576
most women can't afford
to take much of it at all.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.096
A nurse told me, "I didn't qualify
for short-term disability

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.176
because my pregnancy
was considered a preexisting condition.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.867
We used up all of our tax returns
and half of our savings

00:06:43.891 --> 00:06:45.736
during my six unpaid weeks.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.496
We just couldn't manage any longer.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.056
Physically it was hard,
but emotionally it was worse.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.056
I struggled for months
being away from my son."

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.976
So this decision
to go back to work so early,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.176
it's a rational economic decision
driven by family finances,
