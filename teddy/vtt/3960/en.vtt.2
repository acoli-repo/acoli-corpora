As a country, we are sending
millions of women back to work

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.016
every year, incredibly
and kind of horrifically soon

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.696
after they give birth.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.416
That's a moral problem

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.336
but today I'm also going to tell you
why it's an economic problem.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.976
I got so annoyed and obsessed
with the unreality of these images,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.016
which look nothing like my life,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.216
that I recently decided to shoot and star
in a parody series of stock photos

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.376
that I hoped the world would start to use

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.656
just showing the really awkward reality
of going back to work

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.240
when your baby's food source
is attached to your body.
