00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.440
started to turn into individual choices
not to have babies.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.016
One woman told me,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.296
"New motherhood is hard.
It shouldn't be traumatic.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.576
When we talk about expanding
our family now,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.896
we focus on how much time I would have
to care for myself and a new baby.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.216
If we were to have to do it again
the same way as with our first,

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.880
we might stick with one kid."

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.696
The birthrate needed in America
to keep the population stable

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.856
is 2.1 live births per woman.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.856
In America today, we are at 1.86.
