OK, this is pop quiz time:

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.616
what percentage of working
women in America do you think

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.160
have no access to paid maternity leave?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.640
88 percent.

00:05:41.873 --> 00:05:45.016
88 percent of working mothers
will not get one minute of paid leave

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.656
after they have a baby.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.296
So now you're thinking about unpaid leave.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.896
It exists in America.
It's called FMLA. It does not work.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.896
Because of the way it's structured,
all kinds of exceptions,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.936
half of new mothers are ineligible for it.
