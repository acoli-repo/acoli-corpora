Most of the stories that these women,
total strangers, send to me now,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.456
are not actually even about breastfeeding.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.376
A woman wrote to me to say,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.176
"I gave birth to twins and went back
to work after seven unpaid weeks.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.856
Emotionally, I was a wreck.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.216
Physically, I had a severe hemorrhage
during labor, and major tearing,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.976
so I could barely get up, sit or walk.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.856
My employer told me I wasn't allowed
to use my available vacation days

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.640
because it was budget season."

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.416
I've come to believe that we can't look
situations like these in the eye
