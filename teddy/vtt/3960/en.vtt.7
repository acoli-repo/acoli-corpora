I've come to believe that we can't look
situations like these in the eye

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.256
because then we'd be horrified,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.336
and if we get horrified
then we have to do something about it.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.216
So we choose to look at,
and believe, this image.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.696
I don't really know
what's going on in this picture,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.376
because I find it weird
and slightly creepy.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.816
(Laughter)

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.056
Like, what is she doing?

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.096
But I know what it tells us.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.656
It tells us that everything's fine.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.416
This working mother, all working mothers
and all of their babies, are fine.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.416
There's nothing to see here.
