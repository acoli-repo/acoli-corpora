00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.976
And yet, for many new working mothers,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.256
this is the only place during the day
that they can find to make food

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.600
for their newborn babies.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.336
I put these things,
a whole dozen of them, into the world.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.976
I wanted to make a point.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.416
I didn't know what I was also doing
was opening a door,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.976
because now, total strangers
from all walks of life

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.936
write to me all the time

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.816
just to tell me what it's like
for them to go back to work

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.856
within days or weeks of having a baby.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.456
I'm going to share
10 of their stories with you today.
