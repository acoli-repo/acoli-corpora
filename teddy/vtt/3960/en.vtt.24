00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.936
We have decided --
decided, not an accident,

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.896
to pass these costs directly
on to working mothers and their babies.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.576
We know the price tag is higher
for low-income women,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.376
therefore disproportionately
for women of color.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.856
We pass them on anyway.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.496
All of this is to America's shame.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.416
But it's also to America's risk.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.336
Because what would happen

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.416
if all of these individual
so-called choices to have babies

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.440
started to turn into individual choices
not to have babies.
