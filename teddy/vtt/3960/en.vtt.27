00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.136
to offer national paid leave

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.875
to the people doing the work
of the future of this country

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:36.776
and to the babies
who represent that future.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.936
Childbirth is a public good.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.496
This leave should be state-subsidized.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.016
It should have no exceptions
for small businesses,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.496
length of employment or entrepreneurs.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.896
It should be able
to be shared between partners.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.896
I've talked today a lot about mothers,

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.600
but co-parents matter on so many levels.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.616
Not one more woman
should have to go back to work

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.816
while she is hobbling and bleeding.
