for the people doing the work
of the future of those countries,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.896
but we say,
"We couldn't possibly do that."

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.416
We say that the market
will solve this problem,

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.776
and then we cheer when corporations
offer even more paid leave to the women

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.056
who are already the highest-educated
and highest-paid among us.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.896
Remember that 88 percent?

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.760
Those middle- and low-income women
are not going to participate in that.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.336
We know that there are staggering
economic, financial, physical

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.896
and emotional costs to this approach.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.936
We have decided --
decided, not an accident,
