00:00:07.025 --> 00:00:09.125
You’re a biologist on a mission

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:14.132
to keep the rare honeybee 
Apis Trifecta from going extinct.

00:00:14.132 --> 00:00:18.789
The last 60 bees of the species 
are in your terrarium.

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.163
You’ve already constructed wire frames
of the appropriate size and shape.

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:28.033
Now you need to turn 
them into working beehives

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:32.164
by helping the bees fill 
every hex with wax.
