00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:03.833
How do you start a new city?

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:07.628
Turns out it's not easy.

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.714
You need to survey terrain,

00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:12.258
get permission from a state, buy land,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.010
convince people to move there.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.847
And until Elon Musk gets us to Mars,

00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:19.891
land is a finite resource.

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.019
And the good spots are probably all taken.

00:00:24.937 --> 00:00:28.983
But what if we could start smaller,
like really small?

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:31.235
And just post on Twitter.
