00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:30.147
Though salmonella can live for weeks
outside a living body

00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:31.764
and even survive freezing,

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:35.385
136 degrees is too hot for them.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.093
When your dough reaches
that temperature, they die off.

00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:41.179
You'll live to test your fate
with a bite of raw dough

00:01:41.203 --> 00:01:42.888
you sneak from your next batch.

00:01:43.594 --> 00:01:47.069
At 144 degrees,
changes begin in the proteins,

00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:49.489
which come mostly
from the eggs in your dough.

00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:52.460
Eggs are composed of dozens
of different kinds of proteins,

00:01:52.484 --> 00:01:55.016
each sensitive to a different temperature.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.780
In an egg fresh from the hen,

00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:59.731
these proteins look
like coiled up balls of string.

00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:01.571
When they're exposed to heat energy,
