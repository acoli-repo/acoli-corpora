00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:10.683
In a time-lapse video,
it looks like a monster coming alive.

00:00:10.707 --> 00:00:13.595
For a moment, it sits there innocuously.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.172
Then, ripples move across its surface.

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:19.563
It bulges outwards,
bursting with weird boils.

00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:21.195
It triples in volume.

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:24.772
Its color darkens ominously,
and its surface hardens

00:00:24.796 --> 00:00:28.777
into an alien topography
of peaks and craters.

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.741
Then, the kitchen timer dings.
