00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:32.013
and slightly bitter flavor compounds
that define, well, caramel.

00:03:32.037 --> 00:03:35.515
And, in fact, if your recipe
calls for a 350 degree oven,

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:36.994
it'll never happen,

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:40.931
since caramelization
starts at 356 degrees.

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:43.347
If your ideal cookie is barely browned,

00:03:43.371 --> 00:03:45.599
like a Northeasterner on a beach vacation,

00:03:45.623 --> 00:03:48.478
you could have set
your oven to 310 degrees.

00:03:48.502 --> 00:03:50.761
If you like your cookies
to have a nice tan,

00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:51.876
crank up the heat.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.698
Caramelization continues
up to 390 degrees.

00:03:55.722 --> 00:03:56.913
And here's another trick:

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:58.931
you don't need that kitchen timer;

00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:01.890
your nose is a sensitive
scientific instrument.
