00:02:29.872 --> 00:02:31.356
sodium bicarbonate,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.576
or baking soda.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.575
The sodium bicarbonate reacts
with acids in the dough

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.116
to create carbon dioxide gas,
which makes airy pockets in your cookie.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.628
Now, it's nearly ready
for a refreshing dunk

00:02:42.652 --> 00:02:44.667
in a cool glass of milk.

00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:47.496
One of science's tastiest reactions

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.882
occurs at 310 degrees.

00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:52.497
This is the temperature
for Maillard reactions.

00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:53.989
Maillard reactions result

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:57.611
when proteins and sugars break down
and rearrange themselves,

00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:59.134
forming ring-like structures,

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:00.525
which reflect light in a way
