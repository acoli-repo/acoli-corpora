When they're exposed to heat energy,

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:05.813
the protein strings unfold
and get tangled up with their neighbors.

00:02:05.837 --> 00:02:07.290
This linked structure

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:09.197
makes the runny egg nearly solid,

00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:11.824
giving substance to squishy dough.

00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:14.725
Water boils away at 212 degrees,

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.474
so like mud baking in the sun,

00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:19.368
your cookie gets dried out
and it stiffens.

00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:21.351
Cracks spread across its surface.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:24.112
The steam that was bubbling
inside evaporates,

00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:27.776
leaving behind airy pockets
that make the cookie light and flaky.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.848
Helping this along
is your leavening agent,

00:02:29.872 --> 00:02:31.356
sodium bicarbonate,
