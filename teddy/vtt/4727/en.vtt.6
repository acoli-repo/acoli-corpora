00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:00.525
which reflect light in a way

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.680
that gives foods like Thanksgiving turkey

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:03.764
and hamburgers

00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:06.262
their distinctive, rich brown color.

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:08.099
As this reaction occurs,

00:03:08.123 --> 00:03:11.009
it produces a range of flavor
and aroma compounds,

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.677
which also react with each other,

00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:15.698
forming even more complex
tastes and smells.

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:18.393
Caramelization is the last reaction

00:03:18.417 --> 00:03:20.370
to take place inside your cookie.

00:03:20.394 --> 00:03:22.185
Caramelization is what happens

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.953
when sugar molecules
break down under high heat,

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:27.670
forming the sweet, nutty,

00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:32.013
and slightly bitter flavor compounds
that define, well, caramel.
