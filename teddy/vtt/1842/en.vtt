00:00:00.864 --> 00:00:03.187
We live in a very complex environment:

00:00:03.187 --> 00:00:05.091
complexity and dynamism

00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:07.154
and patterns of evidence

00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:10.039
from satellite photographs, from videos.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.050
You can even see it outside your window.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.910
It's endlessly complex, but somehow familiar,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.870
but the patterns kind of repeat,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.360
but they never repeat exactly.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.487
It's a huge challenge to understand.

00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:27.619
The patterns that you see

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.339
are there at all of the different scales,
