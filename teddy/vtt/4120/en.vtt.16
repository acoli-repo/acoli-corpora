00:07:57.474 --> 00:08:00.678
I've collected a bunch of best practices.

00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:03.441
and so you can learn
how to run a workshop here,

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.584
you can learn more about
the visual language

00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:10.500
and the structure of links and nodes that
you can apply to general problem-solving,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.705
and download examples of various templates

00:08:13.705 --> 00:08:18.998
for unpacking the thorny problems
that we all face in our organizations.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:22.620
So the seemingly trivial
design exercise of drawing toast

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.661
helps us get clear, engaged and aligned.

00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:29.609
So next time you're confronted
with an interesting challenge,

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:31.943
remember what design has to teach us.
