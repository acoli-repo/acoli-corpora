It begins with a clean sheet of paper,
a felt marker,

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.940
and without using any words,
you begin to draw how to make toast.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.118
And most people draw something like this.

00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:40.498
They draw a loaf of bread, 
which is sliced, then put into a toaster.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:42.744
The toast is then deposited for some time.

00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:48.295
It pops up, and then voila!
After two minutes, toast and happiness.

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:53.643
Now, over the years, I've collected
many hundreds of drawings of these toasts,

00:00:53.643 --> 00:00:55.403
and some of them are very good,

00:00:55.403 --> 00:00:58.869
because they really illustrate
the toast-making process quite clearly.

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:02.166
And then there are some that are,
well, not so good.
