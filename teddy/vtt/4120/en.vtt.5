00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:32.623
So for example, Americans
make toast with a toaster.

00:02:32.623 --> 00:02:34.144
That seems obvious.

00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:38.114
Whereas many Europeans
make toast with a frying pan, of course,

00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:42.391
and many students make toast with a fire.

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.610
I don't really understand this.
A lot of MBA students do this.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.375
So you can measure the complexity
by counting the number of nodes,

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:53.297
and the average illustration
has between four and eight nodes.

00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:56.292
Less than that, the drawing seems trivial,

00:02:56.292 --> 00:02:58.545
but it's quick to understand,

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:03.618
and more than 13, the drawing
produces a feeling of map shock.
