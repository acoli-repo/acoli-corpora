00:07:26.964 --> 00:07:32.886
And what's interesting is that
after visualizing the entire business,

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:34.650
systems upon systems,

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.716
they reclaimed 
50 million dollars of revenue,

00:07:37.716 --> 00:07:42.734
and they also moved from a D rating 
to an A rating from their customers.

00:07:42.734 --> 00:07:46.329
Why? Because there's
alignment from the executive team.

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:49.742
So I'm now on a mission
to help organizations

00:07:49.742 --> 00:07:54.456
solve their wicked problems
by using collaborative visualization,

00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:57.474
and on a site that I've produced
called drawtoast.com,

00:07:57.474 --> 00:08:00.678
I've collected a bunch of best practices.
