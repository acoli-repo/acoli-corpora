00:03:57.912 --> 00:04:01.263
is really the only way
in which we get clarity.

00:04:01.263 --> 00:04:03.911
It's the essence of the design process.

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.620
And systems theorists do tell us

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.182
that the ease with which
we can change a representation

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.767
correlates to our willingness
to improve the model.

00:04:13.447 --> 00:04:17.239
So sticky note systems
are not only more fluid,

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.279
they generally produce
way more nodes than static drawings.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.010
The drawings are much richer.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.575
And this brings us
to our third part of the exercise,

00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:29.509
which is to draw how to make toast,
but this time in a group.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.271
So what happens then?
