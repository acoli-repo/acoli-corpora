00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:31.713
but now with sticky notes
or with cards.

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:33.141
So what happens then?

00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:37.462
Well, with cards, most people
tend to draw clear, more detailed,

00:03:37.462 --> 00:03:39.740
and more logical nodes.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.317
You can see the step by step
analysis that takes place,

00:03:43.317 --> 00:03:46.549
and as they build up their model,
they move their nodes around,

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.129
rearranging them like Lego blocks.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.184
Now, though this might seem trivial,
it's actually really important.

00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:57.912
This rapid iteration of expressing
and then reflecting and analyzing

00:03:57.912 --> 00:04:01.263
is really the only way
in which we get clarity.
