Really interesting --
talking gets in the way.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.897
So here's some key lessons
that can emerge from this.

00:05:33.897 --> 00:05:36.476
First, drawing helps us
understand the situations

00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:39.748
as systems with nodes
and their relationships.

00:05:39.748 --> 00:05:43.388
Movable cards produce
better systems models,

00:05:43.388 --> 00:05:46.118
because we iterate much more fluidly.

00:05:46.118 --> 00:05:49.332
And then the group notes produce 
the most comprehensive models

00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:52.689
because we synthesize
several points of view.

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.275
So that's interesting.

00:05:54.275 --> 00:05:57.581
When people work together
under the right circumstances,

00:05:57.581 --> 00:06:00.692
group models are much better
than individual models.
