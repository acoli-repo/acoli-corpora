00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:02.166
And then there are some that are,
well, not so good.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:07.344
They really suck, actually, because
you don't know what they're trying to say.

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:09.271
Under close inspection,

00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:12.754
some reveal some aspects of toast-making
while hiding others.

00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:15.424
So there's some
that are all about the toast,

00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:18.164
and all about the transformation of toast.

00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:20.764
And there's others
that are all about the toaster,

00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:24.094
and the engineers love to draw
the mechanics of this.

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:25.504
(Laughter)

00:01:25.504 --> 00:01:27.875
And then there are others
that are about people.

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:31.723
It's about visualizing
the experience that people have.
