00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:03.618
and more than 13, the drawing
produces a feeling of map shock.

00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:05.121
It's too complex.

00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:07.664
So the sweet spot is between 5 and 13.

00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:10.294
So if you want to communicate
something visually,

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:14.021
have between five and 13 nodes
in your diagram.

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:16.725
So though we may not
be skilled at drawing,

00:03:16.725 --> 00:03:20.856
the point is that we intuitively know
how to break down complex things

00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:24.116
into simple things and then 
bring them back together again.

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:27.337
So this brings us to our second part of 
the exercise,

00:03:27.337 --> 00:03:28.913
which is how to make toast,

00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:31.713
but now with sticky notes
or with cards.
