00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.271
So what happens then?

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.883
Well, here's what happens.

00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:36.500
It starts out messy,
and then it gets really messy,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.125
and then it gets messier,

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:40.052
but as people refine the models,

00:04:40.052 --> 00:04:42.583
the best nodes become more prominent,

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:45.160
and with each iteration,
the model becomes clearer

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.434
because people build
on top of each other's ideas.

00:04:48.434 --> 00:04:51.917
What emerges is a unified systems model

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:56.057
that integrates the diversity
of everyone's individual points of view,

00:04:56.057 --> 00:04:57.977
so that's a really different outcome

00:04:57.977 --> 00:05:00.648
from what usually happens 
in meetings, isn't it?
