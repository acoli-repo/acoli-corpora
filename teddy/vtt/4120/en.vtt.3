It's about visualizing
the experience that people have.

00:01:31.723 --> 00:01:35.236
And then there are others that are about
the supply chain of making toast

00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:37.226
that goes all the way back to the store.

00:01:37.226 --> 00:01:40.663
It goes through the supply chain
networks of teleportation

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:43.890
and all the way back
to the field and wheat,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.700
and one all actually goes
all the way back to the Big Bang.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.904
So it's crazy stuff.

00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:50.757
But I think it's obvious

00:01:50.757 --> 00:01:54.263
that even though these drawings
are really wildly different,

00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:57.366
they share a common quality,
and I'm wondering if you can see it.

00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.743
Do you see it? What's common about these?

00:01:59.743 --> 00:02:03.118
Most drawings have nodes and links.
