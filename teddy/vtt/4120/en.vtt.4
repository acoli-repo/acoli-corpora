Most drawings have nodes and links.

00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:08.468
So nodes represent the tangible objects
like the toaster and people,

00:02:08.468 --> 00:02:11.974
and links represent
the connections between the nodes.

00:02:11.974 --> 00:02:14.807
And it's the combination
of links and nodes

00:02:14.807 --> 00:02:16.920
that produces a full systems model,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.845
and it makes our private
mental models visible

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:22.878
about how we think something works.

00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:24.709
So that's the value of these things.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.817
What's interesting about
these systems models

00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:29.002
is how they reveal
our various points of view.

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:32.623
So for example, Americans
make toast with a toaster.
