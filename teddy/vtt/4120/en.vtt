00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.731
Some years ago,

00:00:01.731 --> 00:00:05.175
I stumbled across a simple design exercise

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:08.780
that helps people understand
and solve complex problems,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.867
and like many of these design exercises,
it kind of seems trivial at first,

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:14.611
but under deep inspection,

00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.331
it turns out that it reveals
unexpected truths

00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:20.662
about the way that we collaborate
and make sense of things.

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:22.264
The exercise has three parts

00:00:22.264 --> 00:00:24.749
and begins with something
that we all know how to do,

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.149
which is how to make toast.

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.809
It begins with a clean sheet of paper,
a felt marker,
