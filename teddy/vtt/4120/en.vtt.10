00:04:57.977 --> 00:05:00.648
from what usually happens 
in meetings, isn't it?

00:05:00.648 --> 00:05:03.620
So these drawings can contain
20 or more nodes,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.849
but participants don't feel map shock

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.074
because they participate in the building
of their models themselves.

00:05:10.074 --> 00:05:13.395
Now, what's also really interesting,
that the groups spontaneously mix

00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:16.854
and add additional layers
of organization to it.

00:05:16.854 --> 00:05:18.864
To deal with contradictions, for example,

00:05:18.864 --> 00:05:21.684
they add branching patterns
and parallel patterns.

00:05:21.684 --> 00:05:24.907
Oh, and by the way,
if they do it in complete silence,

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:27.663
they do it much better
and much more quickly.

00:05:27.663 --> 00:05:30.205
Really interesting --
talking gets in the way.
