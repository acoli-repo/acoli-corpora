Try stopping the inevitable.

00:10:33.353 --> 00:10:37.083
Shortly after we published,
I got a three-word text from Johannes:

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.022
"Wintris has arrived."

00:10:40.046 --> 00:10:41.444
(Laughter)

00:10:41.468 --> 00:10:45.200
It had arrived and so, too, perhaps
has a new era for journalism.

00:10:45.673 --> 00:10:46.829
Thank you.

00:10:46.853 --> 00:10:53.807
(Applause)

00:10:57.612 --> 00:10:59.272
Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you.

00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:02.371
I guess you're going to send
that applause to the 350 journalists
