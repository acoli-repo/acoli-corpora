00:03:28.936 --> 00:03:31.563
There were nearly five million emails,

00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:34.900
two million PDFs that needed
to be scanned and indexed,

00:03:34.924 --> 00:03:37.736
and millions more files
and other kinds of documents.

00:03:38.162 --> 00:03:40.999
They all needed to be housed
in a safe and secure location

00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:42.180
in the cloud.

00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:46.432
We next invited reporters
to have a look at the documents.

00:03:46.456 --> 00:03:50.316
In all, reporters from more
than 100 media organizations

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.983
in 76 countries --

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:54.478
from the BBC in Britain

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:56.718
to Le Monde newspaper in France

00:03:56.742 --> 00:03:59.130
to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan.
