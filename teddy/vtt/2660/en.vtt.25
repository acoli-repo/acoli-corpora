that the basic information
about the offshore world

00:12:30.644 --> 00:12:31.797
should be made public.

00:12:31.821 --> 00:12:34.698
Now, we didn't publish
the underlying documents

00:12:34.722 --> 00:12:36.587
of the journalists we're working with.

00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:39.193
But the basic information
such as the name of a person,

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:42.141
what their offshore company was
and the name of that company,

00:12:42.165 --> 00:12:43.521
is now all available online.

00:12:43.545 --> 00:12:47.505
In fact, the biggest resource
of its kind basically is out there now

00:12:48.374 --> 00:12:50.247
BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do.

00:12:50.271 --> 00:12:51.429
GR: Thank you.

00:12:51.453 --> 00:12:54.966
