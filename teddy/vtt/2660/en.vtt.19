00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:33.652
There's a kind of irony
in what we've been able to do.

00:09:33.676 --> 00:09:37.382
The technology -- the Internet --
that has broken the business model

00:09:37.406 --> 00:09:39.960
is allowing us to reinvent
journalism itself.

00:09:40.516 --> 00:09:42.204
And this dynamic is producing

00:09:42.228 --> 00:09:45.068
unprecedented levels
of transparency and impact.

00:09:45.772 --> 00:09:49.258
We showed how a group of journalists
can effect change across the world

00:09:49.282 --> 00:09:53.262
by applying new methods
and old-fashioned journalism techniques

00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:55.690
to vast amounts of leaked information.

00:09:56.319 --> 00:10:00.571
We put all-important context
around what was given to us by John Doe.
