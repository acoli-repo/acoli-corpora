Now, when you're an investigative reporter
and you make an amazing discovery,

00:07:01.813 --> 00:07:05.694
such as your prime minster can be linked
to a secret offshore company,

00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:09.844
that that company has a financial
interest in Icelandic banks --

00:07:09.868 --> 00:07:12.218
the very issue he's been elected on --

00:07:12.242 --> 00:07:14.892
well, your instinct
is to scream out very loud.

00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:18.938
Instead, as one of the few people
that he could speak to,

00:07:18.962 --> 00:07:21.913
Johannes and I shared
a kind of gallows humor.

00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:24.112
"Wintris is coming," he used to say.

00:07:24.136 --> 00:07:25.665
(Laughter)

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:27.686
(Applause)

00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:31.564
We were big fans of "Game of Thrones."
