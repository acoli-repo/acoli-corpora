that in order to make
the biggest kind of noise,

00:05:04.106 --> 00:05:07.291

To manage the project
over the many months it would take,

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:13.061
we built a secure virtual newsroom.

00:05:13.085 --> 00:05:15.560
We used encrypted communication systems,

00:05:16.157 --> 00:05:18.847

00:05:20.522 --> 00:05:22.609

that were emerging from the documents.

00:05:24.638 --> 00:05:29.944
Those interested in blood diamonds
or exotic art, for instance,

00:05:29.968 --> 00:05:33.158
could share information about how
the offshore world was being used
