I guess you're going to send
that applause to the 350 journalists

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:03.973
who worked with you, right?

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.208
Now, a couple of questions
I would like to ask.

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:07.399
The first one is,

00:11:07.423 --> 00:11:10.091

in secrecy for over a year

00:11:10.115 --> 00:11:13.741
with 350-something colleagues
from all over the world --

00:11:13.765 --> 00:11:17.096
was there ever a moment when you thought

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.248
that the leak may be leaked,

00:11:19.272 --> 00:11:21.975
that the collaboration may just be broken

00:11:21.999 --> 00:11:23.578
by somebody publishing a story?

00:11:23.602 --> 00:11:26.420
Or somebody not in the group
releasing some information

00:11:26.444 --> 00:11:27.765
that they got to know?

00:11:28.228 --> 00:11:30.880
Gerard Ryle: We had a series
of crises along the way,
