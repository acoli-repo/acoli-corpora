00:09:56.319 --> 00:10:00.571
We put all-important context
around what was given to us by John Doe.

00:10:01.205 --> 00:10:02.790
And by sharing resources,

00:10:02.814 --> 00:10:04.503
we were able to dig deep --

00:10:04.527 --> 00:10:08.902
much deeper and longer than most
media organizations allow these days,

00:10:08.926 --> 00:10:10.669
because of financial concerns.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.083
Now, it was a big risk,

00:10:13.107 --> 00:10:15.095
and it wouldn't work for every story,

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:17.123
but we showed with the Panama Papers

00:10:17.147 --> 00:10:20.085
that you can write about any country
from just about anywhere,

00:10:20.109 --> 00:10:23.623
and then choose your preferred
battleground to defend your work.

00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:25.770
Try obtaining a court injunction

00:10:25.794 --> 00:10:29.714
that would prevent the telling
of a story in 76 different countries.
