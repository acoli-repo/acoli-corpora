"Native eyes on native names,"
we called it, the idea being,

00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:07.606
who best to tell you
who was important to Nigeria

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.200
than a Nigerian journalist?

00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:11.748
Who best in Canada than a Canadian?

00:04:12.247 --> 00:04:15.303
There were only two rules
for everyone who was invited:

00:04:15.327 --> 00:04:19.509
we all agreed to share everything
that we found with everybody else,

00:04:20.335 --> 00:04:22.969
and we all agreed to publish
together on the same day.

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:25.804
We chose our media partners based on trust

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:29.046
that had been built up through
previous smaller collaborations

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.077
and also from leads
that jumped out from the documents.
