By nature, investigative
reporters are lone wolves.

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:03.831
We fiercely guard our secrets,

00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:05.389
at times even from our editors,

00:02:05.413 --> 00:02:08.273
because we know that the moment
we tell them what we have,

00:02:08.297 --> 00:02:10.177
they'll want that story right away.

00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:11.989
And to be frank,

00:02:12.607 --> 00:02:14.029
when you get a good story,

00:02:14.053 --> 00:02:16.457
you like to keep the glory to yourself.

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:20.342
But there's no doubt
that we live in a shrinking world,

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:23.535
and that the media has largely
been slow to wake up to this.

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.595
The issues we report on
are more and more transnational.

00:02:27.135 --> 00:02:29.863
Giant corporations operate
on a global level.
