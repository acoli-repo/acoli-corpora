Gerard Ryle: We had a series
of crises along the way,

00:11:30.904 --> 00:11:33.635
including when something major
was happening in the world,

00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:36.682
the journalists from that country
wanted to publish right away.

00:11:36.706 --> 00:11:37.915
We had to calm them down.

00:11:37.939 --> 00:11:41.083
Probably the biggest crisis we had
was a week before publication.

00:11:41.107 --> 00:11:45.118
We'd sent a series of questions
to the associates of Vladimir Putin,

00:11:45.142 --> 00:11:46.635
but instead of responding,

00:11:46.659 --> 00:11:49.622
the Kremlin actually held
a press conference and denounced us,

00:11:49.646 --> 00:11:53.063
and denounced the whole thing
as being, I guess, a plot from the West.

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:56.103
At that point, Putin thought
it was just about him.

00:11:56.127 --> 00:11:58.631
And, of course, a lot of editors
around the world

00:11:58.655 --> 00:12:00.356
were very nervous about this.
