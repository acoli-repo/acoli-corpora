(Applause)

00:03:00.962 --> 00:03:02.278
That's amazing.

00:03:03.437 --> 00:03:06.915
When I began this process,
and we began this process,

00:03:07.471 --> 00:03:12.112
I realized that I had a limited
understanding of homelessness

00:03:12.136 --> 00:03:14.376
and the factors that impacted it,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.813
and that I needed a fairly major change
in my belief, in my thinking,

00:03:18.837 --> 00:03:22.653
because I had been raised
with the theory of rugged individualism

00:03:22.677 --> 00:03:24.767
and "pull yourself up by the bootstraps."

00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.977
That philosophy came from being raised
on our family's cattle ranch

00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.456
in a small town
in the western desert of Utah.
