As I read through those plans,
and I thought,

00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:02.696
"Pfft! This is unrealistic.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.247
You can't end homelessness.

00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:07.744
There's too many personal choices
and factors beyond our control."

00:05:09.724 --> 00:05:12.218
My perspective changed, however,

00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:15.189
when I attended a conference in 2003,

00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:19.602
where I learned the reason
behind the 10-year plan.

00:05:19.626 --> 00:05:23.775
First was this small population
of the homeless group

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:26.565
that was 15 percent
and were very expensive.

00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:28.517
That made sense

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:30.498
for a conservative state like Utah.
