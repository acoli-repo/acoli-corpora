00:07:29.214 --> 00:07:31.664
Now, those of us that attended
the conference said,

00:07:31.688 --> 00:07:33.589
"Yeah, these models will work in Utah."

00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:36.076
But when we got back home,
there were many who said,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.232
"Nah, those aren't going to work.
They won't succeed here."

00:07:39.256 --> 00:07:42.306
But there was, however,
an affordable housing organization

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.177
who was willing to build
our first 100 units.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.763
But they had concerns about having
100 chronically homeless people

00:07:49.787 --> 00:07:51.570
in one location.

00:07:51.594 --> 00:07:54.716
To address that concern,
we decided to create a pilot

00:07:56.097 --> 00:07:59.565
to test that idea while we built
the first 100 units.

00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:03.311
We would use existing units
scattered throughout Salt Lake City.
