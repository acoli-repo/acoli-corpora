who today, 11 years later,

00:09:01.615 --> 00:09:03.824
is sleeping in her own bed

00:09:03.848 --> 00:09:05.262
and is sober.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.492
At the end of this pilot,
one of the young case managers said,

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:11.812
"We used to debate
up at our university classes

00:09:11.836 --> 00:09:14.691
which theory of case management
was the most effective.

00:09:15.275 --> 00:09:17.649
Now our theory of case management is:

00:09:17.673 --> 00:09:20.673

00:09:21.868 --> 00:09:23.689
We became believers,

00:09:23.713 --> 00:09:27.197
and built hundreds of units
over those next 10 years,

00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:31.295
leading to the reduction of our statewide
chronic homeless population
