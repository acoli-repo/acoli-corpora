"You lazy bums, get a job.
Pull yourself up by the bootstraps."

00:04:01.926 --> 00:04:03.976
After high school, I left the ranch,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.092
graduated from college,

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:09.667
went to work for Ford Motor Company
for several years,

00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:12.991
then got a job at the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints

00:04:13.015 --> 00:04:14.798
and moved back to Salt Lake City.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.609
During that employment,
I had the opportunity to be loaned out

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.552
to the state's largest homeless shelter

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:22.642
to assist them in developing and improving

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:24.901
their financial
and management capabilities.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.855
While there, I became aware
of a new approach

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.066
to dealing with homeless individuals
