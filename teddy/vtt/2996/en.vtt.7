00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.456
in a small town
in the western desert of Utah.

00:03:31.113 --> 00:03:34.660
On the ranch, you learned
that nothing takes priority

00:03:34.684 --> 00:03:36.179
over caring for the cattle,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.880
something always needs fixing

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:40.728
and most importantly,

00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:43.167
hard work makes the world right.

00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:46.618
It was through that lens
that I would see homeless people.

00:03:46.642 --> 00:03:49.661
When I was a teenager, our family
would go into Salt Lake City,

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:53.145
and I would see these homeless people --
"hobos" we called them then --

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:54.575
sitting around on the street,

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:55.764
and I would think,

00:03:55.788 --> 00:04:00.037
"You lazy bums, get a job.
Pull yourself up by the bootstraps."
