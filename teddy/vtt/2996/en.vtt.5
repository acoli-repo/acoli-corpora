00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.775
inviting states and cities and counties

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.822
to develop a plan to end
chronic homelessness

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:36.225
in a 10-year period.

00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:38.964
The state of Utah accepted
this invitation,

00:02:38.988 --> 00:02:41.144
and I was asked to lead this effort.

00:02:42.485 --> 00:02:45.634
In 2005, we approved a 10-year plan,

00:02:45.658 --> 00:02:48.795
and 10 years later, in 2015,

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.885
we reported a reduction
in our chronic homeless population

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.399
of 91 percent statewide.

00:02:55.587 --> 00:03:00.938
