requires lots of things to learn.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.842
And Donald

00:12:06.417 --> 00:12:09.044
taught us some
of these transition lessons.

00:12:09.068 --> 00:12:12.003
His case manager asked him
why he had not turned up the heat

00:12:12.027 --> 00:12:13.265
in his cold apartment.

00:12:13.986 --> 00:12:15.608
Donald said, "How do you do that?"

00:12:16.412 --> 00:12:18.485
He was shown how to use a thermostat.

00:12:19.694 --> 00:12:21.612
The case manager also observed

00:12:21.636 --> 00:12:25.051
that he was heating the beans
in the can on the stove,

00:12:25.075 --> 00:12:27.576
like he had done over
the campfires for many years.

00:12:28.902 --> 00:12:30.917
He was shown how to use pots and pans.
