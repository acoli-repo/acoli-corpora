00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.976
I started doing murals,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.056
anything I could find
my hand on I painted,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.896
and everything became my canvas.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.216
So one day, I was just going
on my Instagram feed,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.696
and I saw this picture.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.816
It was Reign. She took a picture
standing in front my art,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.576
and the moment I saw that photo,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.256
something happened in that moment.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.696
I could actually see my artwork
go into her and come out of her literally,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.080
and that's how I started painting
on human bodies.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.776
As a child I saw art on the marble floors,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.416
I saw art on walls,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.160
but now I see art on people's faces
and people's bodies.
