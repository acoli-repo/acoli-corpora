00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.576
People featured me in magazines,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.816
interviews.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.416
People stopped me in the street.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.896
People knew my name, like --

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.496
And sometimes I had to step back

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.576
and just chill,
and, like, take everything in.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.016
You know, as artists,
we work so hard all our lives

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.456
for our art to be recognized,

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.840
and for this I feel blessed.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.296
However, the attorney
in me is still there,

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.000
so I use my art
to fight for what I believe in.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.280
My Yoruba heritage is always there.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.736
I'd like to share with you tonight
some of my art in motion.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.096
Please, welcome with me on stage.
