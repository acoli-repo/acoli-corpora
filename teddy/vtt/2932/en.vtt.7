00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.176
So in this one, you see the map of Africa,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.056
you see the questions, you see crying,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.256
and there you see syringes
plugged into Africa

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.376
and the natural resources
being drained out.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.936
So I asked myself, where does it go?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.440
Who benefits from all of this?

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.896
You see, with my art,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.776
the way I weave my art around
the patterns, the masks, the stories,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.136
and the way I use my lines,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.896
it's all from the Yoruba culture.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.456
So in 2013, I made a big gamble.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.816
I quit my job and I moved to New York City
to practice art full time.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.390
Of course, my parents were like,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.140
"Oh, [it's just a phase.]
He'll come back."
