00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.936
Of course I would miss classes,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.240
and I would make up excuses
why I wasn't going to class.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.856
But when I started working
at the Human Rights Commission

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.216
as a human rights attorney,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.440
my mind was elsewhere.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.800
I saw a very tough reality.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.376
I worked with children

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.216
who had to choose
between getting an education

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.160
and actually being forced into marriage.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.536
I was so frustrated
seeing all the injustice around me,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.136
and my only outlet was art,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.760
so I started painting.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.016
This piece is called "Dreamscape."
