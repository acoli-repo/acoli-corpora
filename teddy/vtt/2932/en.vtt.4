00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.016
So I remember my mom said,
"Laolu, we are Christians.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.856
Why don't you draw like other people?

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.176
Why don't you draw landscapes
or maybe you draw chairs or furniture,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.440
or maybe even draw Jesus?"

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.136
You know, I could paint
the whole house if I had a chance,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.096
but when I grew up,
I knew being an artist was not an option,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.096
so I wanted to be the person
my parents wanted me to be,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.696
so I went to law school.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.400
Of course, that's my dad there.
He was so proud that day.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.816
And this was what my notebooks
looked like in law school.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.416
(Laughter)

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.936
Of course I would miss classes,
