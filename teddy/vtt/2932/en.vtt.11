And I realized that only
when you tap into your Ori,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.456
then you can actually move mountains.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.240
So there's something so immediate
about painting on human bodies.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.456
It's like art in motion.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.536
It's like a 3D experience.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.336
So one day, I was just doing
my regular work in Brooklyn,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.056
and I got an email that said,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.376
"Hi, I'm a big fan of your work.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.416
Would you like to paint
for my music video?

00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:56.697
Signed, Beyoncé."

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.176
Like, Beyoncé emailed me.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.536
I was like, what?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.216
(Laughter)
