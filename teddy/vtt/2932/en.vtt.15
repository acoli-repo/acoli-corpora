Tonight, they represent
my hopes and my fears.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.160
Now, I put my fears on the back.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.600
I put my hopes in front.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.120
What are my hopes?

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.696
I hope that people know

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.936
that Africa is not just
one huge, nameless continent

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.536
that is all the same.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.936
I also hope that people know

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.936
that in Nigeria, we have
over 350 ethnic groups and languages,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.080
and I am just one artist from one of them.
