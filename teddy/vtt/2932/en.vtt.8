"Oh, [it's just a phase.]
He'll come back."

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.096
But life as an artist
in New York was not easy,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.136
because I was broke,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.096
no money, no gallery agents,
no representation,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.736
so no gallery would show my work.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.896
So I thought to myself, I need to survive.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.640
So I started painting on clothes
to make a living.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.880
I started painting on shoes.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.815
I started customizing things for people.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.536
And then soon I realized the power,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.216
because people were so proud
to wear their stories.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.176
So I started painting on everything.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.736
I painted on guitars,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.976
I started doing murals,
