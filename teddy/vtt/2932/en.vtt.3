00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.896
and you know, I would look
at the marble floors,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.576
and I would see all sorts
of patterns and designs in it,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.496
and I thought everybody could see them.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.776
So I would call my brother,
and I would be like,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.336
"Ikeolu, come and see this marble design,
see this pattern, see this mask."

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.816
And he would tell me,
"Laolu, I don't see anything."

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.936

what I saw on the floor.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.536
And then when my mom noticed,
she got really upset.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.136
(Laughter)

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.416
But that didn't stop me.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.096
I switched from ink to chalk,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.096
because I got in trouble a lot
with my teachers and my parents.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.016
So I remember my mom said,
"Laolu, we are Christians.
