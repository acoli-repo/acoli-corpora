00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.760
[Yoruba: Freeborn Ijebu-Ode son,]

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.120
[of true Ogbogbo Clan,]

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.570
[whose wealth and resources
surpass all that Europe ever had,]

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.960
[whose altar is filled with gold.]

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.960
This chant is called the oríkì.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.000
My grandmother used to sing it
to me when I was a child in Nigeria.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.216
See, an oríkì is the song of praise
of the Yoruba people,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.000
and this particularly speaks
of treasures that the West does not have.
