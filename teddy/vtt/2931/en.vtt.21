As each day goes by,
we're constantly creating our lives,

00:10:30.786 --> 00:10:32.355
adding to our story.

00:10:32.831 --> 00:10:35.580
And sometimes we can get off track.

00:10:36.362 --> 00:10:38.273
Whenever that happens to me,

00:10:38.297 --> 00:10:41.686
I remember a powerful experience
I had with my father.

00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:46.468
Several months after
I graduated from college,

00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:50.350
my dad had a massive heart attack
that should have killed him.

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:54.247
He survived, and when I asked him
what was going through his mind

00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:55.893
as he faced death,

00:10:55.917 --> 00:10:58.600
he said all he could think about
was needing to live

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:00.762
so he could be there
for my brother and me,
