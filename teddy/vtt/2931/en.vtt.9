For others, the key to meaning
is the second pillar: purpose.

00:04:35.844 --> 00:04:38.759
Now, finding your purpose
is not the same thing

00:04:38.783 --> 00:04:41.031
as finding that job that makes you happy.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.979
Purpose is less about what you want
than about what you give.

00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:49.491
A hospital custodian told me
her purpose is healing sick people.

00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:51.226
Many parents tell me,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.186
"My purpose is raising my children."

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:57.571
The key to purpose
is using your strengths to serve others.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.889
Of course, for many of us,
that happens through work.
