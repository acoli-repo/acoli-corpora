00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:33.355
But that raised some questions for me.

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:36.454
Is there more to life than being happy?

00:01:37.216 --> 00:01:39.639
And what's the difference
between being happy

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:41.554
and having meaning in life?

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:47.479
Many psychologists define happiness
as a state of comfort and ease,

00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:49.392
feeling good in the moment.

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:51.756
Meaning, though, is deeper.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.842
The renowned psychologist
Martin Seligman says

00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:59.513
meaning comes from belonging to
and serving something beyond yourself

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:02.220
and from developing the best within you.
