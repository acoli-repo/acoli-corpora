00:00:00.904 --> 00:00:02.183
I used to think

00:00:02.207 --> 00:00:05.941
the whole purpose of life
was pursuing happiness.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.064
Everyone said the path
to happiness was success,

00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:12.586
so I searched for that ideal job,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.641
that perfect boyfriend,
that beautiful apartment.

00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:19.996
But instead of ever feeling fulfilled,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.624
I felt anxious and adrift.

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:27.204
And I wasn't alone; my friends --
they struggled with this, too.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.989
Eventually, I decided to go
to graduate school for positive psychology
