00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:32.583
and reading through thousands
of pages of psychology,

00:02:32.607 --> 00:02:34.708
neuroscience and philosophy.

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:37.155
Bringing it all together,

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:42.520
I found that there are what I call
four pillars of a meaningful life.

00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:44.978
And we can each create lives of meaning

00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:48.351
by building some or all
of these pillars in our lives.

00:02:49.428 --> 00:02:51.616
The first pillar is belonging.

00:02:52.378 --> 00:02:54.685
Belonging comes
from being in relationships

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.414
where you're valued
for who you are intrinsically

00:02:57.438 --> 00:02:59.551
and where you value others as well.
