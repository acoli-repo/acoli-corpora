00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.230
by nearly every conceivable standard,

00:01:01.254 --> 00:01:03.453
more people feel hopeless,

00:01:03.477 --> 00:01:05.602
depressed and alone.

00:01:06.214 --> 00:01:09.027
There's an emptiness
gnawing away at people,

00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:12.321
and you don't have to be
clinically depressed to feel it.

00:01:12.345 --> 00:01:15.245
Sooner or later, I think we all wonder:

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.016
Is this all there is?

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:22.373
And according to the research,
what predicts this despair

00:01:22.397 --> 00:01:24.224
is not a lack of happiness.

00:01:24.248 --> 00:01:26.090
It's a lack of something else,

00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:29.755
a lack of having meaning in life.
