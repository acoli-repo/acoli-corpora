The third pillar of meaning
is also about stepping beyond yourself,

00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:36.313
but in a completely different way:

00:05:36.337 --> 00:05:37.924
transcendence.

00:05:37.948 --> 00:05:40.325
Transcendent states are those rare moments

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.761
when you're lifted above
the hustle and bustle of daily life,

00:05:43.785 --> 00:05:45.490
your sense of self fades away,

00:05:45.514 --> 00:05:48.288
and you feel connected
to a higher reality.

00:05:49.214 --> 00:05:52.904
For one person I talked to,
transcendence came from seeing art.

00:05:52.928 --> 00:05:55.458
For another person, it was at church.

00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:59.036
For me, I'm a writer,
and it happens through writing.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.130
Sometimes I get so in the zone
that I lose all sense of time and place.
