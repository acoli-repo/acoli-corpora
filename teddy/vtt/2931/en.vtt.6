00:03:00.218 --> 00:03:04.908
But some groups and relationships
deliver a cheap form of belonging;

00:03:04.932 --> 00:03:06.825
you're valued for what you believe,

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.095
for who you hate,

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:09.664
not for who you are.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.203
True belonging springs from love.

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:16.212
It lives in moments among individuals,

00:03:16.236 --> 00:03:20.081
and it's a choice -- you can choose
to cultivate belonging with others.

00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:22.268
Here's an example.

00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:25.847
Each morning, my friend Jonathan
buys a newspaper

00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.089
from the same street vendor in New York.

00:03:28.502 --> 00:03:30.782
They don't just conduct
a transaction, though.
