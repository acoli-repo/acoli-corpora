People leading meaningful
lives, he's found,

00:08:02.834 --> 00:08:04.765
tend to tell stories about their lives

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:07.811
defined by redemption, growth and love.

00:08:08.723 --> 00:08:11.185
But what makes people
change their stories?

00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:13.653
Some people get help from a therapist,

00:08:13.677 --> 00:08:15.487
but you can do it on your own, too,

00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:18.271
just by reflecting
on your life thoughtfully,

00:08:18.295 --> 00:08:20.382
how your defining experiences shaped you,

00:08:20.406 --> 00:08:22.143
what you lost, what you gained.

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:24.123
That's what Emeka did.

00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:27.058
You won't change your story overnight;

00:08:27.082 --> 00:08:29.427
it could take years and be painful.

00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:32.385
After all, we've all suffered,
and we all struggle.
