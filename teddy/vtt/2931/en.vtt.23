00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:32.476
Lying there facing death,
he had a reason to live:

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.908
love.

00:11:33.932 --> 00:11:36.383
His sense of belonging within his family,

00:11:36.407 --> 00:11:38.136
his purpose as a dad,

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.174
his transcendent meditation,
repeating our names --

00:11:41.198 --> 00:11:43.979
these, he says, are the reasons
why he survived.

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:46.442
That's the story he tells himself.

00:11:47.747 --> 00:11:49.897
That's the power of meaning.

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:53.435
Happiness comes and goes.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:55.308
But when life is really good

00:11:55.332 --> 00:11:57.221
and when things are really bad,

00:11:57.241 --> 00:12:00.294
having meaning gives you
something to hold on to.
