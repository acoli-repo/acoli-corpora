Sometimes I get so in the zone
that I lose all sense of time and place.

00:06:04.757 --> 00:06:07.903
These transcendent
experiences can change you.

00:06:07.927 --> 00:06:12.451
One study had students look up
at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees

00:06:12.475 --> 00:06:13.676
for one minute.

00:06:14.263 --> 00:06:16.417
But afterwards
they felt less self-centered,

00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:18.385
and they even behaved more generously

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.479
when given the chance to help someone.

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:25.302
Belonging, purpose, transcendence.

00:06:26.374 --> 00:06:29.097
Now, the fourth pillar
of meaning, I've found,

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.876
tends to surprise people.
