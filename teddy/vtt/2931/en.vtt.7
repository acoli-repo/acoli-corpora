00:03:28.502 --> 00:03:30.782
They don't just conduct
a transaction, though.

00:03:30.806 --> 00:03:33.489
They take a moment to slow down, talk,

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.419
and treat each other like humans.

00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:39.432
But one time, Jonathan
didn't have the right change,

00:03:39.456 --> 00:03:40.676
and the vendor said,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.220
"Don't worry about it."

00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:44.731
But Jonathan insisted on paying,

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:47.767
so he went to the store
and bought something he didn't need

00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:49.252
to make change.

00:03:49.992 --> 00:03:52.615
But when he gave the money to the vendor,

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.161
the vendor drew back.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.098
He was hurt.

00:03:56.715 --> 00:03:58.564
He was trying to do something kind,

00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:00.835
but Jonathan had rejected him.
