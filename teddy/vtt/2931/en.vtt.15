His new story was,

00:07:30.172 --> 00:07:33.439
"Before my injury,
my life was purposeless.

00:07:33.463 --> 00:07:36.716
I partied a lot and was
a pretty selfish guy.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.448
But my injury made me realize
I could be a better man."

00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:45.029
That edit to his story
changed Emeka's life.

00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:47.484
After telling the new story to himself,

00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:49.430
Emeka started mentoring kids,

00:07:49.454 --> 00:07:51.820
and he discovered what his purpose was:

00:07:51.844 --> 00:07:53.234
serving others.

00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:57.479
The psychologist Dan McAdams
calls this a "redemptive story,"

00:07:57.503 --> 00:07:59.786
where the bad is redeemed by the good.
