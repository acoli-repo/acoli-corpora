but Jonathan had rejected him.

00:04:02.113 --> 00:04:06.264
I think we all reject people in small ways
like this without realizing it.

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:07.486
I do.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.573
I'll walk by someone I know
and barely acknowledge them.

00:04:10.597 --> 00:04:13.244
I'll check my phone
when someone's talking to me.

00:04:13.678 --> 00:04:15.607
These acts devalue others.

00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:18.384
They make them feel
invisible and unworthy.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.882
But when you lead with love,
you create a bond

00:04:21.906 --> 00:04:23.578
that lifts each of you up.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.658
For many people, belonging
is the most essential source of meaning,

00:04:28.682 --> 00:04:30.680
those bonds to family and friends.
