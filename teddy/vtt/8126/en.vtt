I've never known life without disability.

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.837
Disability is where a physical
or mental condition or impairment

00:00:07.837 --> 00:00:10.673
is combined with physical
or social barriers

00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:13.092
that make it hard for a person
to do certain things

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:15.303
or interact with the world around them.

00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:17.388
Disability is very diverse,

00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:19.515
with a wide range of experiences

00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:24.353
that can affect a person's ability
to see, move, hear, learn,

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:27.231
communicate or interact with others.

00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:31.778
In my case, my sister Erin is autistic
and has intellectual disabilities.
