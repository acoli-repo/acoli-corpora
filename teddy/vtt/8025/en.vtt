00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:14.427
On February 7th, 1967, Homer Loutzenheuser
flipped a switch in Nebraska

00:00:14.427 --> 00:00:18.097
and realized a dream more than 
five decades in the making.

00:00:18.514 --> 00:00:22.101
The power grids 
of the United States joined together,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.481
forming one interconnected machine
stretching coast to coast.

00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:31.235
Today, the US power grid is the
world's largest machine.
