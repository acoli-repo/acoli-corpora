For the last few years,

00:00:02.792 --> 00:00:06.393
I've been a writer in residence
at the Stanford Medical School.

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:08.934
I was hired by an incredible woman,

00:00:08.958 --> 00:00:11.226
she's a poet and an anesthesiologist,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.893
named Audrey Shafer,

00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:15.226
and she started the Medicine
and the Muse Program

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.125
to reintroduce humanities back
into medical education and training.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:23.101
My job was to teach writing, storytelling

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:25.309
and general communication skills

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.809
to physicians, nurses, medical students

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:29.476
and other health care workers.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.434
And I thought I'd get
a ton of great student essays
