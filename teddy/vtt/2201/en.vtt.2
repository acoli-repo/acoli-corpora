(Audio) Uriel Sanchez:

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:09.351
you have to choose,

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:13.226
like, being a really good person
or a really good doctor.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.518

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.684
like sharing certain mental health
diagnoses, for example,

00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:29.833
can be absolutely career-ending.
