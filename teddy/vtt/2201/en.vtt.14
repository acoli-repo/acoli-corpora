For me, the only thing,
really, that matters with my time here

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.643
is feeling like I can connect
with other people

00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:09.351
and maybe make them feel
slightly less alone.

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:10.893
And in my experience,

00:07:10.917 --> 00:07:13.833
that's what stories do
absolutely the best.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.684
So, my student and a collaborator
in a lot of these endeavors

00:07:18.708 --> 00:07:20.684
is Candice Kim.

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:24.101
She's an MD-PhD student
in medical education.

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:26.434
She's written about #MeToo in medicine,

00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:29.976
navigating her queer identity
in a conservative field

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.809
and her mom's metastatic cancer diagnosis.
