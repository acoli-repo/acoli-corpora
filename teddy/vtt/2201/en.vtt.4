00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:00.476
ours are, too.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.684
Now, I am absolutely not
a mental health professional,

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:05.976
I'm a writer,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.809
which most days is absolutely
the complete and total opposite.

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.976
But I can tell you
that the more opportunities

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.643
that I give health care workers

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:17.059
to share their daily frustrations,
their fears, their joys,

00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:19.518
what surprises them, what they resent,

00:02:19.542 --> 00:02:21.351
the better they seem to feel.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:24.559
So at Medicine and the Muse,
we offer evening, weekend

00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:26.643
and day-long storytelling workshops

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:30.143
at farms and other places
with really good food.
