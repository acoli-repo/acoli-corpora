00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:30.143
at farms and other places
with really good food.

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:34.768
I invite other journalists,
writers, producers,

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:36.934
podcasters and poets,

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.726
and they teach writing,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.684
communication and storytelling skills
to our participants.

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:43.947
And those participants
practice being vulnerable

00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:46.559
by sharing their stories
out loud with one another.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:47.851
And in doing so,

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:51.226
they reconnect with what drew them
to medicine in the first place.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.226
These are the skills they'll draw on

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.059
when they realize and are confronted
with the stressful, messy reality

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:58.768
of the work they've chosen.

00:02:58.792 --> 00:03:01.809
This is how they realize it's a calling.
