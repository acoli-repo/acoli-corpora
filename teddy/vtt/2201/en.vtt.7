To me, sharing a true vulnerable story

00:03:31.542 --> 00:03:35.226
is a lot like raising
a flag up a flagpole.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.809
Other people see it,

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:39.119
if they agree with it
and it resonates with them,

00:03:39.143 --> 00:03:40.976
they come and stand under it with you.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.226
That's what my student
Maite Van Hentenryck did.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.851
(Audio) Maite Van Hentenryck:
I mean, it was super anxiety-inducing,

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:50.268
and I shared parts of myself

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:54.417
that I really have probably told
five classmates.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.101
LB: When Maite was a baby,
she had to have her leg amputated.
