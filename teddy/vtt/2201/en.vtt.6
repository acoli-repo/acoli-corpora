This is how they realize it's a calling.

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:05.184
So I have a prescription
here for you today.

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:08.518
It's not from physicians, it's for them,

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:10.893
and I asked my students for help.

00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:14.268
And before I start,
let me just say I work with doctors,

00:03:14.292 --> 00:03:16.143
but I'm absolutely convinced

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:18.559
that this applies
to almost any profession,

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.809
especially those of us
who are so committed to our work,

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:24.018
and it can be so intense and overwhelming,

00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:28.018
that sometimes we forget
why we chose to do it in the first place.

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:31.518
To me, sharing a true vulnerable story
