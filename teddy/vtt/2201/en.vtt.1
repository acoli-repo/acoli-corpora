00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.434
And I thought I'd get
a ton of great student essays

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:36.601
about dissecting cadavers
and poems about the spleen.

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:38.101
And I did.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:39.393
But almost immediately,

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:42.726
I started getting more essays
that made me really anxious

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.018
and really worried.

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:46.976
My students were writing
about their crushing anxiety,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.893
the unbearable pressure
on them to succeed,

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:51.559
their mental health diagnoses,

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:53.268
their suicide attempts,

00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:55.143
how alone and isolated they felt

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:57.809
and wondered if they'd gone
into the right profession,

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:00.184
and they weren't even doctors yet.
