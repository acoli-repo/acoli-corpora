and her mom's metastatic cancer diagnosis.

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:36.143
And recently, she started also

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:37.559
about our work.

00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:39.726

We've seen that students

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.101
who participate in our
storytelling opportunity

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:47.559
show between a 36 and 51 percent
decrease in distress.

00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:49.809
LB: If this was a mental health drug,

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:52.893

00:07:52.917 --> 00:07:55.434
Results seem to last up to a month.

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:56.726
It might be longer,

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.518
a month is just when Candice
stopped measuring.

00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:00.809
So we don't even know.
