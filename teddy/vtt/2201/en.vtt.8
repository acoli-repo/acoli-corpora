LB: When Maite was a baby,
she had to have her leg amputated.

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:01.602
When she got to medical school,

00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:03.893
she was taking just a standard class quiz,

00:04:03.917 --> 00:04:05.434
and she got asked the question,

00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:07.393
"Please tell us about the first time

00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:09.500
you encountered someone
with a disability."

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.976
She wondered if her supervisors
had ever considered

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.184
that the person with the disability
was her, the doctor.

00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:20.268
So she talked about it in front
of about 100 of her friends, peers,

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:23.143
which is a big deal, because,
you know, she's really shy.

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:24.601
And afterwards, what happened,

00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:26.643
is a number of students with disabilities,

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:27.934
that she didn't know,

00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.601
came up to her and asked her
to colead a group on campus
