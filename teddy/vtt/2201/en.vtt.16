00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:00.809
So we don't even know.

00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:03.976
Not only that, but 100 percent
of our participants

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.059
recommend these opportunities to a friend.

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:10.393
For me, though, the most important thing
that our work has done

00:08:10.417 --> 00:08:12.518
is create a culture of vulnerability

00:08:12.542 --> 00:08:17.018
in a place [where] there was
absolutely none before.

00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:18.393
I think what this does

00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:20.976
is that it allows doctors and other folks

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.434
an opportunity to envision
a different kind of future for themselves

00:08:24.458 --> 00:08:25.726
and their patients.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.018
This is Maite again.

00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:30.471
