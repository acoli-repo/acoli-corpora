00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:00.101
with each other,

00:09:00.125 --> 00:09:02.030
with their patients and with themselves

00:09:02.054 --> 00:09:04.851
is certainly not going to magically change

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:08.059
everything that is wrong
with the contemporary health care system,

00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:11.703
and it's not going to live to the immense
burdens we place on our physicians,

00:09:11.727 --> 00:09:13.393
but it is absolutely key

00:09:13.417 --> 00:09:16.184
in making sure that our healers
are healthy enough

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:18.434
to heal the rest of us.

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:21.143
Communicating with each other
with vulnerability,

00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:22.809
listening with compassion,

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:26.393
is, I believe, the absolute best
medicine that we have.

00:09:26.417 --> 00:09:27.684
Thank you.

00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:31.083
