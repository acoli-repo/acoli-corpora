00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:34.768
But nearly 30 percent of American
medical students are depressed,

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:37.351
and one in 10 have thought about suicide.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:40.351
And it's actually even worse
for practicing physicians.

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:42.518
There's really widespread
job dissatisfaction,

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:44.101
high rates of depression,

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:46.601
and doctors have one
of the highest suicide rates

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:48.708
of any profession in the United Sates.

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:52.018
This is scary.

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:54.101
Not just for them but for us, too.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:57.143
I really think doctors
have the most important job.

00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:58.691
And if their lives are at stake,

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:00.476
ours are, too.
