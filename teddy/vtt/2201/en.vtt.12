her parents are still together,

00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:03.976
she never went hungry,
and she graduated from Harvard.

(Audio) Arifeen Rahman:
I didn't feel like the stories I had

00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:09.601
were worth telling or that they mattered.

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:11.643
LB: Arifeen did have stories, though.

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:14.393
Recently, she gave a talk
about being maybe

00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:16.643
the only Bangladeshi American girl

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.226
to win an essay contest

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.518
from the Daughters
of the American Revolution --

00:06:20.542 --> 00:06:21.893
(Laughter)

00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:26.143
and then dress up for Halloween
as the Declaration of Independence.

00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:28.184
And I love Arifeen's story so much,

00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:30.893
because to me it represents
all that is good and bad
