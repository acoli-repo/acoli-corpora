I was here four years ago,

00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:04.976
and I remember, at the time,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.519

00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:11.976

to TEDsters in a box,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.851
a box set of DVDs,

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.367
which they put on their shelves,
where they are now.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.367

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.977
And actually, Chris called me
a week after I'd given my talk, and said,

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.205

Can we put yours online?"

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:28.109
And I said, "Sure."

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.712
And four years later,
