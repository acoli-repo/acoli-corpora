If you die leaving a spouse
or a domestic partner,

00:06:00.963 --> 00:06:03.782
then chances are
they will receive your estate,

00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:06.726
but if you are single,
it's far more complicated,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.306
as parents, siblings, half-siblings
and dependents all come into play.

00:06:12.101 --> 00:06:16.455
And did you know that if you make
a regular donation to charity,

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.394
that charity may have grounds
to make a claim on your estate?

00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:23.784
The most important thing to know
is the bigger your estate,

00:06:23.808 --> 00:06:25.698
the more complicated that will will be,

00:06:25.722 --> 00:06:27.704
and the more expensive that bill.

00:06:28.882 --> 00:06:32.067
So if you don't have a will, I ask you ...
