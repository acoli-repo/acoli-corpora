00:11:59.211 --> 00:12:01.055
Be patient,

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:03.261
be understanding,

00:12:03.285 --> 00:12:04.512
and be a listener.

00:12:05.672 --> 00:12:08.906
And if you can't be any of those things,

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.141
then please, be the person who makes
the lasagna, the curry or the casserole,

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:15.625
because your offerings
will be greatly appreciated.

00:12:15.649 --> 00:12:17.212
(Laughter)

00:12:17.686 --> 00:12:20.028
I've been to 10 funerals in the last year,

00:12:20.052 --> 00:12:22.022
one of which I helped arrange.

00:12:22.046 --> 00:12:24.264
They ran the full gamut:

00:12:24.288 --> 00:12:26.749
a very solemn Greek Orthodox service,

00:12:26.773 --> 00:12:29.384
four Catholic requiem masses

00:12:29.408 --> 00:12:31.067
and a garden party
