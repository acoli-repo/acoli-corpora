life would be a lot easier to live
if we talked about death now,

00:03:33.074 --> 00:03:34.335
while we're healthy.

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:38.673
For most of us, we wait
until we are too emotional,

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:40.197
too ill

00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:41.967
or too physically exhausted --

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.544
and then it's too late.

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:50.067
Isn't it time we started taking ownership
of our finale on this earth?

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.266
So let's get going.

00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:55.517
Do you know what you want when you die?

00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:58.522
Do you know how you want to be remembered?

00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:00.604
Is location important?
