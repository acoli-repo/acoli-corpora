00:10:58.905 --> 00:11:01.626
and it's really important
that we acknowledge that.

00:11:02.698 --> 00:11:05.849
So if we don't talk about our death
and the death of loved ones,

00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:10.004
how can we possibly support
a friend, a colleague, a neighbor

00:11:10.028 --> 00:11:11.645
who is grieving?

00:11:11.669 --> 00:11:14.678
How do we support someone
who has lost someone suddenly,

00:11:14.702 --> 00:11:16.605
like an accident or suicide?

00:11:17.685 --> 00:11:19.145
We tend to avoid them ...

00:11:20.359 --> 00:11:22.820
not because we don't care,

00:11:22.844 --> 00:11:24.716
because we don't know what to say.

00:11:25.912 --> 00:11:28.564
We know as a friend we can't fix it,

00:11:28.588 --> 00:11:31.183
we can't take away that pain,
