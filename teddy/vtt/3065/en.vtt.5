00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:31.062
making decisions about coffins,

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:32.344
headstones,

00:02:32.368 --> 00:02:33.850
headstone wording,

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:35.820
headstone font size,

00:02:35.844 --> 00:02:37.436
all while sleep-deprived.

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:40.708
We also discussed some of the issues

00:02:40.732 --> 00:02:43.294

00:02:43.318 --> 00:02:46.024

in how we honor
the passing of a loved one.

00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:52.211
A great example of this
is "Sorry Business,"

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:55.138
practiced by Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander people.

00:02:55.895 --> 00:02:57.980
During Sorry Business,

00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:01.765
family members will take on
specific roles and responsibilities,
