00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:00.604
Is location important?

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:03.202
Do you want to be near the ocean

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:04.752
or in the ocean?

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:06.769
(Laughter)

00:04:06.793 --> 00:04:10.126
Do you want a religious service
or an informal party,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.619
or do you want to go out with a bang,

00:04:12.643 --> 00:04:14.993
literally, in a firework?

00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:16.731
(Laughter)

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:19.151
When it comes to death,
there's so much to discuss,

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.412
but I want to focus on two aspects:

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:27.031
why talking about and planning your death
can help you experience a good death,

00:04:27.055 --> 00:04:29.524
and then reduce the stress
on your loved ones;

00:04:29.548 --> 00:04:32.905
and how talking about death can help us
support those who are grieving.
