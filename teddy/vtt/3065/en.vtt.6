00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:01.765
family members will take on
specific roles and responsibilities,

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.630
protocols such as limiting
the use of photographs,

00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:06.987
saying the name of the deceased,

00:03:07.011 --> 00:03:09.226
and holding a smoking ceremony

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.281
are all a sign of respect and allow
for a peaceful transition of the spirit.

00:03:14.642 --> 00:03:16.602
These customs can be a complete contrast

00:03:16.626 --> 00:03:19.094
to those we might practice
in Western cultures,

00:03:19.118 --> 00:03:21.285
where we would honor
the memory of a loved one

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:23.895
by talking about them
and sharing photographs.

00:03:25.312 --> 00:03:27.882
So my lesson from this last year is,

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:33.050
life would be a lot easier to live
if we talked about death now,
