00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.846
So I started asking
my friends and neighbors

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.077
and was really surprised to learn
many of them don't have a will,

00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:07.028
and some couples don't realize
they need individual wills.

00:05:07.627 --> 00:05:11.420
The usual explanation was, well,
it's all going to go to my partner anyway.

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.494
So keep in mind that laws vary

00:05:14.518 --> 00:05:17.335
from state to state
and country to country,

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.517
but this is what happens
in New South Wales

00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:22.017
if you die without leaving a legal will.

00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:26.819
Firstly, a suitable administrator
must be appointed

00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:29.065
by the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

00:05:29.854 --> 00:05:33.028
Chances are this is someone
who would never have met the deceased.
