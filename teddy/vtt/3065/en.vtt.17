00:08:28.499 --> 00:08:31.538
but you can also donate
your body to science.

00:08:31.562 --> 00:08:34.491
And I am pleased to report
that innovation has touched

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.109
the world of corpse disposal.

00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:37.234
(Laughter)

00:08:37.258 --> 00:08:39.314
You can now opt for an eco-funeral.

00:08:39.338 --> 00:08:41.406
You can be buried at the base of a tree

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.234
in recycled cardboard or a wicker basket,

00:08:44.258 --> 00:08:45.900
and for those who love the ocean,

00:08:45.924 --> 00:08:48.480
there are eco-friendly urns
that will dissolve at sea.

00:08:49.448 --> 00:08:52.179
Personally, I plan to be cremated,

00:08:52.203 --> 00:08:54.717
but given that I get seasick,

00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:56.552
I can think of nothing worse

00:08:56.576 --> 00:08:59.822
than having my ashes
flung into a huge ocean swell.
