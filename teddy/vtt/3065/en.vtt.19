read books and talked
to palliative care nurses.

00:09:31.627 --> 00:09:32.958
And I've come to understand

00:09:32.982 --> 00:09:36.301
as a consequence
of not talking about death,

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:38.452
we don't know how to be around grief.

00:09:39.591 --> 00:09:42.810
And on the flip side,
if we talk about death more,

00:09:42.834 --> 00:09:47.151
we will become more comfortable with
the emotions we experience around grief.

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:51.327
I discovered, this year,

00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:55.224
it's actually a privilege
to help someone exit this life,

00:09:55.248 --> 00:09:59.111
and although my heart
is heavy with loss and sadness,

00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:00.659
it is not heavy with regret.
