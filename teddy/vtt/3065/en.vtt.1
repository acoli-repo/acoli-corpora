00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:31.343
and we don't want to discuss it with
the most important people in our lives.

00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:35.682
I grew up in an Australian community
where people got old or sick

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:36.857
and passed away,

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:38.848
and only the adults attended the funeral.

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:42.051
My parents would come home
looking sad and drained,

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.860
but they didn't discuss it with us.

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:47.653
So I was ignorant to death
and of the grieving process.

00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:51.168
At 15, I got my invitation.

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:54.230
A dear neighbor who was like an aunt to me

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.103
died suddenly of a heart attack,

00:00:56.127 --> 00:00:58.879
and I attended my first funeral
and did my first reading.
