00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:02.554
To kick the bucket,

00:00:02.578 --> 00:00:04.265
bite the dust,

00:00:04.289 --> 00:00:06.412
cash in your chips,

00:00:06.436 --> 00:00:09.402
check out, depart, expire,

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:10.946
launch into eternity ...

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.542
These are all euphemisms we use in humor

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:19.153
to describe the one life event
we are all going to experience:

00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:21.747
death.

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.746
But most of us don't want
to acknowledge death,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.644
we don't want to plan for it,

00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:31.343
and we don't want to discuss it with
the most important people in our lives.
