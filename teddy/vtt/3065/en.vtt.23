00:11:28.588 --> 00:11:31.183
we can't take away that pain,

00:11:31.207 --> 00:11:34.398
so we say things
to fill that awkward silence,

00:11:34.422 --> 00:11:36.119
sometimes things we regret saying.

00:11:37.532 --> 00:11:38.817
Examples would be:

00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:43.174
"At least he isn't suffering anymore."

00:11:44.673 --> 00:11:46.418
"At least you've got your memories."

00:11:48.215 --> 00:11:51.135
"At least you don't have to pay
for hospital parking anymore."

00:11:51.159 --> 00:11:53.255
(Laughter)

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:56.040
Really, we don't need to say anything.

00:11:56.588 --> 00:11:58.048
We just need to be.

00:11:59.211 --> 00:12:01.055
Be patient,
