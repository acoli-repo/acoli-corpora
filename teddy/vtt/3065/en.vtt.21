00:10:27.238 --> 00:10:30.984
I went into the kitchen,
and I ate a big bowl of porridge.

00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:36.136
When I told some of my friends this,
they were really shocked.

00:10:36.947 --> 00:10:39.985
"How could you eat at a time like that?"

00:10:41.164 --> 00:10:44.073
Well, I was hungry.

00:10:44.097 --> 00:10:48.787
(Laughter)

00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:52.764
You see, grief impacted my sleep
and my ability to concentrate,

00:10:52.788 --> 00:10:56.039
but it never impacted my stomach.
I was always hungry.

00:10:56.063 --> 00:10:57.247
(Laughter)

00:10:57.271 --> 00:10:58.881
It's different for all of us,

00:10:58.905 --> 00:11:01.626
and it's really important
that we acknowledge that.
