I've actually bought a plot
in the rose garden next to my dad.

00:09:04.314 --> 00:09:06.267
I call it my investment property.

00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:08.751
(Laughter)

00:09:08.775 --> 00:09:11.900
But sadly, there's no tax deduction.

00:09:11.924 --> 00:09:14.161
(Laughter)

00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:17.534
So if you plan for your death,

00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:21.654
then your survivors will know
how to experience a healthy bereavement

00:09:21.678 --> 00:09:24.781
without fear or guilt of having failed
to honor your legacy.

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:28.533
As part of my research,
I've been to seminars,

00:09:28.557 --> 00:09:31.603
read books and talked
to palliative care nurses.
