00:12:29.408 --> 00:12:31.067
and a garden party

00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:35.528
where I made a toast while scattering
my friend's ashes around her garden

00:12:35.552 --> 00:12:36.877
with a soup ladle.

00:12:36.901 --> 00:12:38.427
(Laughter)

00:12:38.451 --> 00:12:43.085
I have carried, kissed, written on
and toasted coffins with a shot of ouzo.

00:12:43.783 --> 00:12:45.359
I have worn all black,

00:12:45.383 --> 00:12:48.160
all color and a party dress.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.469
Despite the vast differences in sendoff,

00:12:50.493 --> 00:12:53.015
despite me being at times
out of my comfort zone

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:55.881
doing something I've never done before,

00:12:55.905 --> 00:12:57.865
I drew comfort from one thing --

00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:01.873
knowing that this is what each person
would have wanted.
