00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.061
We are learning from each
others' strength and endurance,

00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:04.702
not against our bodies and our diagnoses,

00:07:04.702 --> 00:07:07.506
but against a world that exceptionalizes

00:07:07.506 --> 00:07:09.963
and objectifies us.

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:12.598
I really think that this lie that we've been sold

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:16.821
about disability is the greatest injustice.

00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:20.956
It makes life hard for us.

00:07:20.956 --> 00:07:24.829
And that quote, "The only disability in life

00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:26.827
is a bad attitude,"

00:07:26.827 --> 00:07:29.954
the reason that that's bullshit

00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:31.575
is because it's just not true,
