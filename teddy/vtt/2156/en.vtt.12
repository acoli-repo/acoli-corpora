00:05:59.293 --> 00:06:01.016
in the way that we do,

00:06:01.016 --> 00:06:03.118
to share those images?

00:06:03.118 --> 00:06:07.641
People, when they say, "You're an inspiration,"

00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.926
they mean it as a compliment.

00:06:10.926 --> 00:06:12.292
And I know why it happens.

00:06:12.292 --> 00:06:14.564
It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold

00:06:14.564 --> 00:06:18.778
this lie that disability makes you exceptional.

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:20.612
And it honestly doesn't.

00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:21.971
And I know what you're thinking.

00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:24.720
You know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.639
and you're thinking, "Jeez, Stella,

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.756
aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"
