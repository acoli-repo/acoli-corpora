00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:31.575
is because it's just not true,

00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:34.237
because of the social model of disability.

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:38.402
No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs

00:07:38.402 --> 00:07:43.348
has ever made it turn into a ramp.

00:07:43.348 --> 00:07:49.930
Never. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.810
Smiling at a television screen

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.641
isn't going to make closed captions appear

00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:55.374
for people who are deaf.

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:57.836
No amount of standing
in the middle of a bookshop

00:07:57.836 --> 00:07:59.606
and radiating a positive attitude

00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:02.305
is going to turn all those books into braille.
