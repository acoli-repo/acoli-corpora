00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:30.880
or inspirational,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.539
and this was long before my work

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.593
had any kind of public profile.

00:04:34.593 --> 00:04:36.295
They were just kind of congratulating me

00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:38.001
for managing to get up in the morning

00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:42.009
and remember my own name. (Laughter)

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.547
And it is objectifying.

00:04:44.547 --> 00:04:46.640
These images, those images

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.571
objectify disabled people

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:51.496
for the benefit of nondisabled people.

00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:54.110
They are there so that you can look at them

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.813
and think that things aren't so bad for you,

00:04:56.813 --> 00:05:00.960
to put your worries into perspective.
