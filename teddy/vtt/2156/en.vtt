00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.463
I grew up in a very small country town

00:00:02.463 --> 00:00:03.763
in Victoria.

00:00:03.763 --> 00:00:08.180
I had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.580
I went to school, I hung out with my friends,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.966
I fought with my younger sisters.

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.755
It was all very normal.

00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:19.927
And when I was 15, a member of my local community

00:00:19.927 --> 00:00:21.347
approached my parents

00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:22.740
and wanted to nominate me

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.860
for a community achievement award.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.103
And my parents said, "Hm, that's really nice,

00:00:29.103 --> 00:00:32.320
but there's kind of one glaring problem with that.
