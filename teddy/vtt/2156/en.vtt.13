aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:32.850
And the thing is, I am.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.888

I'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.

00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:43.982
I am learning that it's a genius idea

00:06:43.982 --> 00:06:45.403

00:06:45.403 --> 00:06:51.160
to pick up things that you dropped. (Laughter)

00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:58.266
your mobile phone battery from your chair battery.

00:06:58.266 --> 00:06:59.480
Genius.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.061
We are learning from each
others' strength and endurance,
