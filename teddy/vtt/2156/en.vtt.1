00:00:41.835 --> 00:00:44.283
I had a very low-key after school job

00:00:44.283 --> 00:00:46.065
in my mum's hairdressing salon,

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:47.863
and I spent a lot of time watching

00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:50.994

00:00:56.377 --> 00:00:58.930
I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.611
at all.
