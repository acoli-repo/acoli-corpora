00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:03.071
That ended the discussion.

00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:05.225
On the way back to the ministry in the car,

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.306
she turned around to me and said,

00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:09.376
"Rose, you've always been interested in finance.

00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:12.515
Go find us some insurance."

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:14.552
It's been six years since,

00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:16.542
and last year I was fortunate enough

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:18.048
to be part of a team that insured

00:02:18.048 --> 00:02:21.953
over 185,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda

00:02:21.953 --> 00:02:23.890
against drought.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.970
They owned an average of half an acre

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.423
and paid on average two Euros in premium.

00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:31.800
It's microinsurance.
