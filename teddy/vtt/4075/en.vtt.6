00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.871
So instead, we rely on technology and data.

00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:03.077
This satellite measures

00:03:03.077 --> 00:03:05.239
whether there were clouds or not,

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.407
because think about it:

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:11.109
If there are clouds, then you might have some rain,

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.808
but if there are no clouds,

00:03:12.808 --> 00:03:15.659
then it's actually impossible for it to rain.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.939
These images show the onset of the rains

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.794
this season in Kenya.

00:03:19.794 --> 00:03:21.830
You see that around March 6,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.935
the clouds move in and then disappear,

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:26.963
and then around the March 11,

00:03:26.963 --> 00:03:30.213
the clouds really move in.
