00:01:29.824 --> 00:01:31.444
and before we knew it, we were importing

00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:33.737
tons of fertilizer and seed

00:01:33.737 --> 00:01:36.462
and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:37.997
and plant.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.890
A couple of weeks later,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.603
the International Monetary Fund visited us,

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:44.133
and asked my minister,

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.945
"Minister, it's great that you want to help farmers

00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:51.118
reach food security, but what if it doesn't rain?"

00:01:51.118 --> 00:01:53.267
My minister answered proudly

00:01:53.267 --> 00:01:55.281
and somewhat defiantly,

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:59.871
"I am going to pray for rain."

00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:03.071
That ended the discussion.
