00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:31.800
It's microinsurance.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.855
Now, traditional insurance doesn't work

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:35.768
with two to three Euros of premium,

00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:38.675
because traditional insurance relies on farm visits.

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:40.617
A farmer here in Germany would be visited

00:02:40.617 --> 00:02:43.102
for the start of the season, halfway through,

00:02:43.102 --> 00:02:45.589
and at the end, and again if there was a loss,

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.995
to estimate the damages.

00:02:48.995 --> 00:02:52.130
For a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.959
the maths of doing those visits

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.030
simply don't add up.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.871
So instead, we rely on technology and data.
