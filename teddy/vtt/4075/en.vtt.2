00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.090
I come from a family of missionaries

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.241
who built hospitals in Indonesia,

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:05.518
and my father built a psychiatric hospital

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:06.774

and my boss had just been promoted

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.607
to become the minister.

00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:27.495
She launched an ambitious plan

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:29.824
to start a green revolution in her country,

00:01:29.824 --> 00:01:31.444
