00:05:59.103 --> 00:06:02.470
It's a very different value proposition.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.159
And so the uptick of insurance has been slow,

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.735
with so far only 4.4 percent of Africans

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:10.288
taking up insurance in 2012,

00:06:10.288 --> 00:06:12.280
and half of that number is in one country,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.323
South Africa.

00:06:14.323 --> 00:06:15.970
We tried for some years

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.421
selling insurance directly to farmers,

00:06:18.421 --> 00:06:20.420
with very high marketing cost

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.506
and very limited success.

00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:25.460
Then we realized that there were many organizations

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.169
working with farmers:

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.606
seed companies, microfinance institutions,
