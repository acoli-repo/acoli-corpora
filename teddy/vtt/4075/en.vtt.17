00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:30.477
they'd text in that number,

00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:31.850
and that number would actually help us

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.225
to locate the farmer

00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:36.349
and allocate them to a satellite pixel.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.891
A satellite would then measure the rainfall

00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:40.424
for the next three weeks,

00:08:40.424 --> 00:08:42.154
and if it didn't rain,

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:45.560
we'd replace their seed.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.800
One of the first —

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.023
(Applause) — Hold on, I'm not there!

00:08:52.023 --> 00:08:55.180
One of the first beneficiaries
of this replanting guarantee

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.396
was Bosco Mwinyi.

00:08:57.396 --> 00:09:00.087
We visited his farm later that August,
