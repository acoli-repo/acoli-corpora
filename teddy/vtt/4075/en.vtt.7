00:03:26.963 --> 00:03:30.213
the clouds really move in.

00:03:30.213 --> 00:03:33.140
That, and those clouds,

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.028
were the onset of the rains this year.

00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:38.715
This satellite covers the whole of Africa

00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:41.632
and goes back as far as 1984,

00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:43.980
and that's important, because if you know

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.421
how many times a place has had a drought

00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:48.370
in the last 30 years,

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.200
you can make a pretty good estimate

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.957
what the chances are of drought in the future,

00:03:52.957 --> 00:03:55.070
and that means that you can put a price tag

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.760
on the risk of drought.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.156
The data alone isn't enough.
