00:00:00.465 --> 00:00:03.722
In Kenya, 1984 is known

00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:06.333
as the year of the cup,

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.753
or the goro goro.

00:00:08.753 --> 00:00:11.671
The goro goro is a cup used to measure

00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:14.981
two kilograms of maize flower on the market,

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:18.121
and the maize flower is used to make ugali,

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:22.078
a polenta-like cake that is eaten
together with vegetables.

00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:24.393
Both the maize and the vegetables are grown

00:00:24.393 --> 00:00:26.518
on most Kenyan farms,

00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:28.791
which means that most families can feed themselves

00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:30.972
from their own farm.
