00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.606
seed companies, microfinance institutions,

00:06:31.606 --> 00:06:33.552
mobile phone companies,

00:06:33.552 --> 00:06:34.874
government agencies.

00:06:34.874 --> 00:06:37.624
They were all providing loans to farmers,

00:06:37.624 --> 00:06:40.246
and often, just before they'd finalize the loan,

00:06:40.246 --> 00:06:42.346
the farmer would say,

00:06:42.346 --> 00:06:44.498
"But what if it doesn't rain?

00:06:44.498 --> 00:06:47.965
How do you expect me to repay my loan?"

00:06:47.965 --> 00:06:50.042
Many of these organizations

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.660
were taking on the risk themselves,

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.628
simply hoping that that year,

00:06:53.628 --> 00:06:55.990
the worst wouldn't happen.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.996
Most of the organizations, however,

00:06:57.996 --> 00:07:00.319
were limiting their growth in agriculture.
