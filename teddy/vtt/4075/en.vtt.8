00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.156
The data alone isn't enough.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.641
We devise agronomic algorithms

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:06.335
which tell us how much rainfall
a crop needs and when.

00:04:06.335 --> 00:04:08.749
For example, for maize at planting,

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.144
you need to have two days of rain

00:04:11.144 --> 00:04:13.000
for farmers to plant,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.194
and then it needs to rain once every two weeks

00:04:15.194 --> 00:04:17.673
for the crop to properly germinate.

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:20.998
After that, you need rain every three weeks

00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:23.901
for the crop to form its leaves,

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:26.667
whereas at flowering, you
need it to rain more frequently,

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:30.527
about once every 10 days
for the crop to form its cob.
