were limiting their growth in agriculture.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.991
They couldn't take on this kind of risk.

00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:06.714
These organizations became our customers,

00:07:06.714 --> 00:07:09.913
and when combining credit and insurance,

00:07:09.913 --> 00:07:12.632
interesting things can happen.

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:16.020
Let me tell you one more story.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.870

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:25.940
and when rains start early, farmers are encouraged,

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.506
because it usually means that
the season is going to be good.

00:07:29.506 --> 00:07:32.262
So they took out loans and planted.
