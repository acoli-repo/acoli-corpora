00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:30.527
about once every 10 days
for the crop to form its cob.

00:04:30.527 --> 00:04:32.032
At the end of the season,

00:04:32.032 --> 00:04:34.244
you actually don't want it to rain,

00:04:34.244 --> 00:04:37.795
because rains then can damage the crop.

00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:41.150
Devising such a cover is difficult,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.046
but it turned out the real challenge

00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:47.574
was selling insurance.

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:50.061
We set ourselves a modest target

00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:54.061
of 500 farmers insured after our first season.

00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:56.631
After a couple of months' intense marketing,

00:04:56.631 --> 00:04:58.450
we had signed up the grand total

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.108
of 185 farmers.
