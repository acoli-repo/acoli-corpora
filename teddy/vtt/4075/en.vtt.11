00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.598
pioneered by Muhammad Yunus,

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:33.119
who won the Nobel Peace Prize

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:35.268
for his work with the Grameen Bank.

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:37.752
Turns out, selling microcredit

00:05:37.752 --> 00:05:41.153
isn't the same as selling insurance.

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:45.038
For credit, a farmer needs
to earn the trust of a bank,

00:05:45.038 --> 00:05:48.982
and if it succeeds, the bank will advance him money.

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.091
That's an attractive proposition.

00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:54.337
For insurance, the farmer needs to trust

00:05:54.337 --> 00:05:55.879
the insurance company, and needs

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.103
to advance the insurance company money.

00:05:59.103 --> 00:06:02.470
It's a very different value proposition.
