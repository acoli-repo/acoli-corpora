We visited his farm later that August,

00:09:00.087 --> 00:09:03.643
and I wish I could show you the smile on his face

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:06.107
when he showed us his harvest,

00:09:06.107 --> 00:09:07.740
because it warmed my heart

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.678
and it made me realize why selling insurance

00:09:09.678 --> 00:09:12.388
can be a good thing.

00:09:12.388 --> 00:09:13.936
But you know, he insisted

00:09:13.936 --> 00:09:16.890
that we get his whole harvest in the picture,

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.753
so we had to zoom out a lot.

00:09:20.753 --> 00:09:23.982
Insurance secured his harvest that season,

00:09:23.982 --> 00:09:26.502
and I believe that today,

00:09:26.502 --> 00:09:29.685
we have all the tools to enable African farmers

00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:32.452
to take control of their own destiny.
