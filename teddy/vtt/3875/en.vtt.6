00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:02.861
So there is no acoustic barrier at all.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.415
When you put many children in a quiet box,

00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:12.733
some of them get really nervous.

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:14.985
But in this kindergarten,

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:18.415
there is no reason they get nervous.

00:03:18.415 --> 00:03:21.225
Because there is no boundary.

00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:23.422
And the principal says

00:03:23.422 --> 00:03:27.425
if the boy in the corner
doesn't want to stay in the room,

00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:29.120
we let him go.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.279
He will come back eventually,
because it's a circle, it comes back.
