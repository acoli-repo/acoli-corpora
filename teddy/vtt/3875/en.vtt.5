00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:31.087
But if you look at this,

00:02:31.087 --> 00:02:32.917
the boy is not washing his boots,

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:34.591
he's putting water into his boots.

00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:36.531
(Laughter)

00:02:41.423 --> 00:02:46.499
This kindergarten is completely
open, most of the year.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:51.339
And there is no boundary
between inside and outside.

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:55.978
So it means basically
this architecture is a roof.

00:02:55.978 --> 00:02:59.267
And also there is no boundary
between classrooms.

00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:02.861
So there is no acoustic barrier at all.
