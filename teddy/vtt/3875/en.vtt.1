The principal of this kindergarten said,

00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:35.254
"No, I don't want a handrail."

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:37.483
I said, "It's impossible."

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:43.777
But he insisted: "How about having a net
sticking out from the edge of the roof?

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.986
So that it can catch
the children falling off?"

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:47.433
(Laughter)

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.509
I said, "It's impossible."

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.889
And of course,
the government official said,

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:56.154
"Of course you have to have a handrail."

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.843
But we could keep 
that idea around the trees.
