00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:42.976
Now, this drawing is showing
the movement of a boy

00:07:42.976 --> 00:07:49.300
between 9:10 and 9:30.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:55.501
And the circumference
of this building is 183 meters.

00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:59.353
So it's not exactly small at all.

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:03.959
And this boy did 6,000 meters
in the morning.
