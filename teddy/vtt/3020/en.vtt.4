00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.076
And this is not the shortage of <i>3 BHKs</i>
(bedroom hall kitchen).

00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:04.486
95 percent of the shortage

00:02:04.652 --> 00:02:07.803
is for people earning
10 to 15,000 rupees per month.

00:02:08.113 --> 00:02:12.450
Will you be able to find
an affordable home in this budget?

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.913
If this happened with you,
what would you do?

00:02:15.053 --> 00:02:17.177
Home is not a car
or some sort of jewellery.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.190
Home is food and clothes.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.408
Nobody can live without it.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.906
If you couldn't find a home
in a city to either buy or rent,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.343
you too would be driven to do
what most people end up doing.
