00:06:27.798 --> 00:06:30.992
Not the right to sell,
but the right to live there,

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.096
use it, settle on it.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.546
The whole world knows now
that to move forward,

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.710
we cannot remove settlements.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.810
We can only advance when we think of ways
to make settlements secure and sturdy.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.626
But just one thing.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.145
If we know it, then why doesn't it happen?

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.741
To apply this new thinking to settlements,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.866
we, that is you and me,
need to look deep within

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:05.570
and get rid of the disgust, disrespect
and apprehensions that we have.
