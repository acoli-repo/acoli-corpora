Shah Rukh Khan: Be it Mumbai or Delhi,
Chennai or Kolkata,

00:00:02.598 --> 00:00:05.467
all our big cities have
one great thing in common,

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:11.946
they happily welcome people from 
smaller places arriving in search of work.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.184
What is also true is that
this warm welcome leads to consequences.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.827
Problems like housing
in these cities are born.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.352
Today we have with us a human settlement
expert and researcher: Dr. Gautam Bhan,

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.530
who is re-imagining a solution
to this increasing problem.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.026
He will share with us the new picture
of urban India that he can see.
