00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.887
Make a home wherever possible.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.538
You too would make a <i>settlement.</i>

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.730
The government may keep calling it a <i>slum,</i>

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.586
but like the people living there,

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.524
I too will call it a settlement.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.549
One hundred million are not homeless.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.723
They have homes.

00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:51.273
Homes they built on their own.

00:02:51.874 --> 00:02:54.383
But most of these homes
are in settlements.

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:59.079
This is the truth
of an affordable home in India.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.774
The homes in settlements are cheap,
but not sturdy.
