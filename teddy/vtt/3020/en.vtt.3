Your parents worked as laborers all day.

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:33.819
Then you too would have come
to a city for progress.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.331
Or maybe, like it happens today,
you were born in the city itself.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.890
One day you go out looking
for an accommodation in the city,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.530
to buy or maybe just to rent.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.786
Will you be able find an affordable home?

00:01:50.312 --> 00:01:53.898
The government says we are falling
short of at least 20 million homes.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.046
20 million homes,
that's 100 million people.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.076
And this is not the shortage of <i>3 BHKs</i>
(bedroom hall kitchen).
