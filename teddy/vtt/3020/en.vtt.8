00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.560
If we do not make new homes,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.832
then what is the next solution?

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.636
How to make a settlement secure?

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.599
Firstly, eviction needs to be stopped.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.603
Bulldozing needs to be stopped.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.339
Never has that resulted
in progress in the past,

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:14.608
nor will it in the future.

00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:19.265
(Applause)

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.466
We have to start believing that
the laborers who build and run the city

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.950
have a right over the land of that city.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.105
(Applause)
