00:07:30.131 --> 00:07:30.916
Thank you.

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:38.216
(Applause)

00:07:39.414 --> 00:07:41.662
SRK: Thank you very much.
Thank you, Dr. Gautam Bhan.

00:07:41.662 --> 00:07:42.529
Thanks a lot.

00:07:43.572 --> 00:07:46.406
Please tell me, you just gave
an example of Thailand

00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:48.580
and the big thing there is

00:07:48.807 --> 00:07:52.556
the homes are for people
to settle in, not to sell.

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:55.079
They cannot be used for sale.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.979
Is there a similar thought process
or program in our country too,

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.521
inspired by your talks
and those of people around you?
