In ten years that slum changed into
a locality, a place, a world of its own.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.823
The government didn't have to build
even a single new home.

00:06:07.838 --> 00:06:12.373
(Applause)

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.230
Thailand launched this program
at national scale,

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.356
benefiting 100,000 people in 137 cities.

00:06:21.674 --> 00:06:25.494
And every person was given the right
to live over that land.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.253
But pay attention here.

00:06:27.798 --> 00:06:30.992
Not the right to sell,
but the right to live there,
