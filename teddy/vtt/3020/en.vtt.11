00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.074
all it's asking for is basic necessities:

00:05:33.122 --> 00:05:37.328
electricity, roads, water,
toilets and drainage.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.906
We call this <i>upgradation.</i>

00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:44.981
Here's an example of upgradation.

00:05:45.305 --> 00:05:47.017
In Ahmedabad, they started a program

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.204
where for ten years, 44 settlements were
promised there wouldn't be any eviction.

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:52.785
Only a promise.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.180
Nothing written, no documents.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.988
And basic necessities
were provided to them.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:04.551
In ten years that slum changed into
a locality, a place, a world of its own.
