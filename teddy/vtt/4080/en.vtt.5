(Laughter)

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.480
Came back to Earth
at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.840
It was a four-minute
and 27-second descent.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.680
And when I got to 10,000 feet,
I opened a parachute and I landed.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.680
(Applause)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.056
But this is really a science talk,
and it's really an engineering talk,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.376
and what was amazing to me
about that experience
