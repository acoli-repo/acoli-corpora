00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.336
until the point where you can
almost survive without any protection,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.176
about zero degrees,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.495
and then you end up
getting colder and colder,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.736
and that's the top of the stratosphere.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.696
It is one of the least accessible
places on our planet.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.456
Most often, when it's visited,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.376
it's by astronauts
who are blazing up at it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.256
at probably several times
the speed of sound,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.256
and they get a few seconds on the way up,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.056
and then they get this blazing
ball of fire coming back in,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.016
on the way back in.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.336
But the question I asked is, is it
possible to linger in the stratosphere?
