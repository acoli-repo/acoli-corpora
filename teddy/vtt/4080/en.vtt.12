00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.520
especially when you're going to land
70 miles away from the place you started.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.680
That's a helium truck in the background.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.616
It's darkness.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.856
I've already spent about an hour
and a half pre-breathing.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.280
And then here you see the suit going on.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.240
It takes about an hour to get the suit on.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.216
Astronauts get this really nice
air-conditioned van

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.816
to go to the launch pad,
but I got a front loader.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.016
(Laughter)

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.576
You can see the top.
You can see the balloon up there.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.120
That's where the helium is.
