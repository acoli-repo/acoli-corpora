00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.096
is right when you release,
you're in zero gravity.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.736
So it's very easy for this
to just turn right around you.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.040
And before you know it,
you can be tangled up or spinning,

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.976
or you can release this drogue late,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.056
in which case what happens
is you're going down at 800 miles an hour,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.576
and this thing is going to destroy itself

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.800
and not be very useful.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.696
But the guys at United Parachute
Technologies came up with this idea,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.656
and it was a roll that looks like that,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.360
but watch what happens when I pull it out.
