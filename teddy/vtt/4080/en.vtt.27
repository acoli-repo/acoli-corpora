00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.176
My daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old,
she and I were in the car,

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.656
and we were driving down the road,
and she was sitting there,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.056
and she had this idea, and she goes,
"Dad, I've got this idea."

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.600
And so I listened to her idea
and I said, "Katelyn, that's impossible."

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.936
And she looks at me

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.296
and she goes, "Dad,
after what you just did,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.720
how can you call anything impossible?"

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.016
And I laughed, and I said,
"OK, it's not impossible,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.440
it's just very, very hard."
