00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.536
People asked me what the best part
of this whole thing was,

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.016
and it was a chance
to work with the best experts

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.656
in meteorology and ballooning
and parachute technology

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.136
and environmental systems
and high altitude medicine.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.296
It was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream
to work with that group of people.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.576
And I also at the same time
wanted to thank my friends at Google,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.456
both for supporting me during this effort

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.776
and also covering for me
in the times that I was away.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.096
But there's one other group
I wanted to thank, and that's my family.
