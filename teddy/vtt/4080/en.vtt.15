00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.736
I'm right over the airport,
and I'm probably at 50,000 feet,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.456
but immediately I'm about to go
into a stratospheric wind

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.200
of over 120 miles an hour.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.176
This is my flight director telling me
that I had just gone higher

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.416
than anybody else
had ever gone in a balloon,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.120
and I was about 4,000 feet from release.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.040
This is what it looks like.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.145
You can see the darkness of space,
the curvature of the Earth,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.400
the fragile planet below.
