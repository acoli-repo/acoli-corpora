00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.536
and it shows a portion of our planet

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.976
that's rarely seen and rarely studied

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.296
and almost never explored.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.856
That place is called the stratosphere.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.016
If you start on the planet
and you go up and up and up,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.616
it gets colder and colder and colder,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.016
until you reach the beginning
of the stratosphere,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.656
and then an amazing thing happens.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.696
It gets colder at a much slower rate,
and then it starts warming up,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.376
and then it gets warmer and warmer

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.336
until the point where you can
almost survive without any protection,
