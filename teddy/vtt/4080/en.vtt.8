00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.296
but they sold one to me,
which I am very grateful for.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.480
Up here we have a parachute.
This was all about safety.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.056
Everyone on the team knew

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.816
that I have a wife
and two small children --

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.416
10 and 15 --

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.495
and I wanted to come back safely.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.949
So there's a main parachute
and a reserve parachute,

00:04:19.973 --> 00:04:21.173
and if I do nothing,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.427
the reserve parachute is going to open
because of an automatic opening device.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.296
The suit itself
can protect me from the cold.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.256
This area in the front here
has thermal protection.
