00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.936
The really nice thing about this
is the moment I opened --

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.336
I had a close of friend of mine,
Blikkies, my parachute guy.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.296
He flew in another airplane,
and he actually jumped out

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.296
and landed right next to me.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.576
He was my wingman on the descent.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.816
This is my landing, but it's probably more
properly called a crash.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.056
(Laughter)

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.536
I hate to admit it, but this wasn't
even close to my worst landing.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.416
(Laughter)

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.760
(Applause)
