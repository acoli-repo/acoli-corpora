00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.336
So I want to tell you one thing

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.656
that you might not have seen
in that video,

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.536
but one of the most critical parts
of the entire thing was the release

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.416
and what happens right after you release.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.736
And what we tried to do was use
something called a drogue parachute,

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.456
and a drogue parachute
was there to stabilize me.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.536
And I'll show you one of those right now.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.200
If any of you have ever
gone tandem skydiving,

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.640
you probably used one of these.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.136
But the problem with one of these things

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.096
is right when you release,
you're in zero gravity.
