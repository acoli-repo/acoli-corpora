00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.976
So I grew up in Orlando, Florida.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.296
I was the son of an aerospace engineer.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.056
I lived and breathed the Apollo program.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.136
We either saw the launches
from our backyard

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.816
or we saw it by driving
in the hour over to the Cape.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.698
I was impressed by, obviously,
space and everything about it,

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:21.627
but I was most impressed
by the engineering that went into it.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.416
Behind me you see an amazing view,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.336
a picture that was taken
from the International Space Station,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.536
and it shows a portion of our planet
