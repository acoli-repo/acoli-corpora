00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.616
So the trip up is beautiful.
It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.456
(Laughter)

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.576
It took two hours
and seven minutes to go up,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.336
and it was the most peaceful
two hours and seven minutes.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.240
I was mostly trying to relax.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.936
My heart rate was very low

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.080
and I was trying not to use
very much oxygen.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.576
You can see how the fields
in the background

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.216
are relatively big at this point,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.296
and you can see me going up and up.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.336
It's interesting here,
because if you look,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.736
I'm right over the airport,
and I'm probably at 50,000 feet,
