WEBVTT

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.376
and what was amazing to me
about that experience

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.056
is that Taber said, yes, I think
we can build a stratospheric suit,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.696
and more than that, come down tomorrow

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.856
and let's talk to the team
that formed the core of the group

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.080
that actually built it.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.736
And they did something
which I think is important,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.096
which is they took
the analogy of scuba diving.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.816
So in scuba diving,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.656
you have a self-contained system.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.016
You have everything
that you could ever need.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.080
You have a scuba tank.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.136
You have a wetsuit.
