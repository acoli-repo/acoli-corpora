00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.096
And to do a capsule, there's an amazing
amount of complexity that goes into it,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.056
and it weighed about 3,000 pounds,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.776
and to raise 3,000 pounds
to an altitude of 135,000 feet,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.936
which was my target altitude,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.120
it would have taken a balloon
that was 45 to 50 million cubic feet.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.176
Because I only weighed
500 pounds in this system,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.416
we could do it with a balloon
that was five times smaller than that,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.856
and that allowed us to use a launch system
that was dramatically simpler

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.520
than what needs to be done
for a much larger balloon.
