00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.256
This area in the front here
has thermal protection.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.456
It will actually heat water
that will wrap around my body.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.936
It has two redundant oxygen tanks.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.016
Even if I was to get
a quarter-inch hole in this suit,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.616
which is extremely unlikely,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.440
this system would still protect me
from the low pressure of space.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.976
The main advantage of this system
is weight and complexity.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.976
So the system weighs about 500 pounds,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.816
and if you compare it to the other attempt
recently to go up in the stratosphere,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.096
they used a capsule.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.096
And to do a capsule, there's an amazing
amount of complexity that goes into it,
