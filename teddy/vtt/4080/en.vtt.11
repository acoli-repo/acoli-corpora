00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.520
than what needs to be done
for a much larger balloon.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.136
So with that, I want to take you
to Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.856
We had an amazing team
that got up in the middle of the night.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.456
And here's the suit.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.616
Again, this is using the front loader
that you'll see in a second,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.856
and I want to play you a video
of the actual launch.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.896
Roswell's a great place
to launch balloons,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.096
but it's a fantastic place
to land under a parachute,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.520
especially when you're going to land
70 miles away from the place you started.
