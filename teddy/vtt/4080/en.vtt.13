00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.120
That's where the helium is.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.280
This is Dave clearing the airspace
with the FAA for 15 miles.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.560
And there we go.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.216
(Laughter)

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.936
That's me waving with my left hand.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.016
The reason I'm waving with my left hand

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.696
is because on the right hand
is the emergency cutaway.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.296
(Laughter)

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.160
My team forbade me
from using my right hand.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.616
So the trip up is beautiful.
It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse.
