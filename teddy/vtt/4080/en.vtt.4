00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:03.245
is it possible to build

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.136
a system to go into the stratosphere?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.736
And he said it was.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.456
And after a period of about three years,
we proceeded to do just that.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.960
And on October 24 of last year,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.880
in this suit,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.840
I started on the ground,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.760
I went up in a balloon to 135,890 feet --

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.576
but who's counting?

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.056
(Laughter)
