00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.136
You have a wetsuit.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.896
You have visibility.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.656
And that scuba is exactly this system,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.120
and we're going to launch it
into the stratosphere.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.080
Three years later, this is what we have.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.856
We've got an amazing suit
that was made by ILC Dover.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.336
ILC Dover was the company
that made all of the Apollo suits

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.776
and all of the extravehicular
activity suits.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.056
They had never sold a suit commercially,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.656
only to the government,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.296
but they sold one to me,
which I am very grateful for.
