00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a filmmaker.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For the last 8 years,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I have dedicated my life

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to documenting the work

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of Israelis and Palestinians

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
who are trying to end the conflict

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
using peaceful means.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When I travel with my work

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
across Europe and the United States,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
one question always comes up:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Why aren't Palestinians

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
using nonviolent resistance?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The challenge I face when I hear this question
