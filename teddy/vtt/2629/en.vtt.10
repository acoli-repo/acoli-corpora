00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:01.565
only to get the run-around

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:06.160
and to be evaluated by
a stoic figure in a white coat

00:05:06.184 --> 00:05:08.811
who only has 10 minutes to give you

00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:11.700
and who doesn't value the talk.

00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:16.683
So it's no wonder that some men
don't want to be bothered

00:05:16.707 --> 00:05:20.003
and skip going to the doctor altogether,

00:05:20.027 --> 00:05:22.159
especially if they feel fine.

00:05:23.402 --> 00:05:25.341
But herein lies the problem.

00:05:26.328 --> 00:05:28.449
You can feel just fine

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:32.296
while high blood pressure ravages
your most vital organs.
