WEBVTT

00:08:58.878 --> 00:09:01.378
was to help design
healthcare interventions

00:09:01.402 --> 00:09:03.675
that would appeal to black men.

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:07.727
We conducted about a dozen focus groups

00:09:07.751 --> 00:09:11.026
with a broad cross-section of black men,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.164
and we learned that for them,

00:09:13.188 --> 00:09:17.571
being healthy was as much about
being perceived as healthy

00:09:17.595 --> 00:09:19.843
as it was about feeling healthy,

00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:24.120
and that feeling good
went hand in hand with looking good.

00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:29.858
This work led to the development
of Project Brotherhood,

00:09:29.882 --> 00:09:32.787
a community clinic founded
by Dr. Eric Whitaker
