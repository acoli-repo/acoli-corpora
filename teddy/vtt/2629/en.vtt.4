"Hey young fella, how you doing?"

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.718
they would say to me,

00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:03.837
making me feel just as special.

00:02:05.118 --> 00:02:09.380
I remember the range
of the conversations was immense.

00:02:10.173 --> 00:02:14.396
The men would talk about politics
and sports and music

00:02:15.205 --> 00:02:18.752
and world news, national news,

00:02:18.776 --> 00:02:20.117
neighborhood news.

00:02:21.064 --> 00:02:22.736
There was some talk about women

00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:27.014
and what it was like to be
a black man in America.

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:31.013
But many times they also
talked about health.
