are less likely to have
a primary care doctor

00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:31.641
than other groups.

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:33.410
But why?

00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:37.481
Some of our earliest research
on black men's health

00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:42.119
revealed that for many, the doctor's
office is associated with fear,

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.015
mistrust,

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.060
disrespect,

00:04:47.084 --> 00:04:49.266
and unnecessary unpleasantness.

00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:55.327

00:04:55.902 --> 00:04:59.192
And when you do go,
you might wait for hours

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:01.565
only to get the run-around
