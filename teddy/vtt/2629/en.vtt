What do you see?

00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:08.768
Most of you see a barbershop,

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:11.680
but I see an opportunity:

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:14.429
an opportunity for health,

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:16.778
an opportunity for health equity.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:21.802
For black men, the barbershop
is not just a place

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:24.548
where you get your hair cut
or your beard trimmed.

00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:27.342
No, it's much more than that.

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:32.196
Historically, the barbershop
has been a safe haven for black men.
