00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:30.562
We went to Mr. Mike's barbershop
every other Saturday.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.197
And like clockwork,
the same group of men would be there

00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.942
every time we went,

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:39.323
either waiting on their favorite barber

00:01:39.347 --> 00:01:41.990
or just soaking up the atmosphere.

00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:47.169
I can remember the jovial greeting
that warmly welcomed us

00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:48.614
every time we went.

00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:52.860
"Hey Rev," they would say to my dad.

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:56.670
He's a local pastor,
and they treated him like a celebrity.

00:01:57.923 --> 00:02:00.242
"Hey young fella, how you doing?"
