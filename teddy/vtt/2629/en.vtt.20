But while there's only one
Project Brotherhood,

00:10:01.572 --> 00:10:04.893
there are thousands of black barbershops

00:10:04.917 --> 00:10:09.393
where the intersection of health
and haircuts can be cultivated.

00:10:10.782 --> 00:10:14.154
The next stop on my journey
was Dallas, Texas,

00:10:14.178 --> 00:10:17.195
where we learned that barbers
were not only willing

00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:21.258
but fully able to roll up
their sleeves and participate

00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:26.806
in delivering needed health services
to improve the health of their customers

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.084
and their community.

00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:32.389
We teamed up with an amazing
cadre of black barbers
