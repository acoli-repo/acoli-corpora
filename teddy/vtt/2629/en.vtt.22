00:10:59.232 --> 00:11:02.144
These barber-doctor partnerships

00:11:02.168 --> 00:11:06.652
resulted in a 20 percent increase
in the number of men

00:11:06.676 --> 00:11:09.469
who were able to achieve
target blood pressure levels

00:11:09.493 --> 00:11:11.953
and a three-point drop, on average,

00:11:11.977 --> 00:11:13.977
in the blood pressure of each participant.

00:11:14.421 --> 00:11:17.389
If we were to extrapolate
that three point drop

00:11:17.413 --> 00:11:20.818
to every single black man
with high blood pressure in America,

00:11:20.842 --> 00:11:27.089
we would prevent 800 heart attacks,
500 strokes and 900 deaths

00:11:27.113 --> 00:11:28.971
from high blood pressure

00:11:28.995 --> 00:11:30.897
in just one year.
