WEBVTT

00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:32.389
We teamed up with an amazing
cadre of black barbers

00:10:32.413 --> 00:10:34.557
and taught them how
to measure blood pressure

00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:36.362
and how to counsel their customers

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:38.213
and refer them to doctors

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:40.081
to help manage high blood pressure.

00:10:40.977 --> 00:10:43.239
The barbers were not only willing to do it

00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:44.731
but they were damn good at it.

00:10:45.794 --> 00:10:47.748
Over a three-year period,

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:50.716
the barbers measured
thousands of blood pressures

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.541
resulting in hundreds of black men
being referred to doctors

00:10:55.565 --> 00:10:58.645
for medical care
of their high blood pressure.
