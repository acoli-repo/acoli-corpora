Dr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.865
and Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans

00:08:37.889 --> 00:08:41.964
were at the forefront of bringing
health promotion to community hubs

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:43.476
in urban black neighborhoods.

00:08:58.878 --> 00:09:01.378
was to help design
healthcare interventions
