Historically, the barbershop
has been a safe haven for black men.

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:36.570
It's a place where we go for friendship,

00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:38.935
solidarity and solace.

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:43.687
It's a place where we go
to get away from the stress

00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:46.958
of the grind of work

00:00:46.982 --> 00:00:48.672
and sometimes home life.

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:52.202
It's a place where we don't have to worry

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:54.709
about how we're being perceived
by the outside world.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:59.542
It's a place where we don't
feel threatened,

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.907
or threatening.
