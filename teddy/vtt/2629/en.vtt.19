a community clinic founded
by Dr. Eric Whitaker

00:09:32.811 --> 00:09:35.604
that provided tailored
healthcare to black men.

00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:38.723
Part of this tailored care

00:09:38.747 --> 00:09:41.548
involved having a barber on the premises

00:09:41.572 --> 00:09:45.175
to reward the men who came
for needed healthcare

00:09:45.199 --> 00:09:47.164
with a free haircut,

00:09:47.188 --> 00:09:51.134
to let the men know that we, too,
valued how they looked

00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:53.028
as well as how they felt,

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:57.234
and that what was important to them
was also important to us.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.548
