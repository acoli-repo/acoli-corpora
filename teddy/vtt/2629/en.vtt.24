00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.937
to each and every one of them.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.495
Thanks to Denny Moe

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:07.122
and the myriad other barbers
and community leaders

00:12:07.146 --> 00:12:12.090
who shared the vision of opportunity
and empowerment

00:12:12.114 --> 00:12:14.820
to make a difference in their communities,

00:12:14.844 --> 00:12:17.599
we've been able to not only
lower blood pressure

00:12:17.623 --> 00:12:19.083
in our participants,

00:12:19.107 --> 00:12:22.819
but we've also been able to impact
other health indicators.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.622
So what do you see?

00:12:29.532 --> 00:12:31.202
What is your barbershop?
