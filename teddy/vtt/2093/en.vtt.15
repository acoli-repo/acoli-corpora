This is the USDA portion size, that little, tiny thing.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And the one over there, that's bigger than my head,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
is what McDonald's and Burger King

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and those big companies think we should eat.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And why can they serve that much?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and 99-cent double burgers?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
It's because of the way the government commodifies food,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and the cheap corn and cheap soy

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that are pushed into our food supply

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that makes these non-nutrient foods

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
really, really cheap.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Which is why I say it's a social justice issue.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Now, I said I'm doing this in Berkeley, and you might think,
