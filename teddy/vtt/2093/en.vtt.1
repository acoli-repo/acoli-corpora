00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
big kids would spit in it -- neither happened.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When I took over this, I tried to really figure out,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
like, what my vision would be.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
How do we really change children's relationship to food?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I'll tell you why we need to change it,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but we absolutely have to change it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And what I came to understand is,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we needed to teach children

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the symbiotic relationship

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And that if we don't do that, the antithesis,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
although we've heard otherwise,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is we're really going to become extinct,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
because we're feeding our children to death.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That's my premise.
