00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
for babysitters when you have them.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So we're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And if we're going to change it,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and change how we feed kids,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
we really have to rethink that.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So, public and private partnerships,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
advocacy groups, working with foundations.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
In our school district, the way we afford this

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
is our school district allocates .03 percent

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
of the general fund

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
allocated a half to one percent,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
we could start to really fix this program.
