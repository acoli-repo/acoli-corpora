00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That's my premise.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And the reason this is happening, by and large,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is because of our food system

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and the way the government commodifies food,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the way the government oversees our food,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And by -- tacitly, all of us send our kids,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and tell them to learn, you know,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
learn what's in those schools.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And when you feed these kids bad food,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about.
