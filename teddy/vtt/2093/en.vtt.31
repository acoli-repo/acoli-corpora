00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
about ways to teach people how to cook again,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
because, of course, they don't --

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
because we've had this processed food in schools

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and institutions for so long.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
We need 40-minute lunches --

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
most schools have 20-minute lunches --

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and lunches that are time-appropriate.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
There was just a big study done, and so many schools

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
That is not lunchtime.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
You know, it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And just remember,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
at very least tacitly,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
this is what we're teaching children

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
as what they should be doing.
