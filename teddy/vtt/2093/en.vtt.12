00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
we're going to have kids

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that have a life less long than our own.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The CDC, the Center for Disease Control,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
has said, of the children born in the year 2000 --

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
those seven- and eight-year-olds today --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
one out of every three Caucasians,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
are going to have diabetes in their lifetime.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And if that's not enough, they've gone on to say,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
most before they graduate high school.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
This means that 40 or 45 percent

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of all school-aged children

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
could be insulin-dependent
