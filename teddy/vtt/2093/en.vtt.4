00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So when I started thinking about these issues

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and how I was going to change what kids ate,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I really started focusing on what we would teach them.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And the very first thing

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
was about regional food -- trying to eat food

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
from within our region.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
as oil hits its peak oil,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
we should, or could, be moving food

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
1,500 miles before we eat it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So we talked to kids about that,
