00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My thing with school lunch is, it's a social justice issue.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm the Director of Nutrition Services

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and 17 locations, 9,600 kids.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm doing 7,100 meals a day

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and I've been doing it for two years,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
trying to change how we feed kids in America.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
These are some of my kids with a salad bar.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Everyone says it couldn't be done.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
big kids would spit in it -- neither happened.
