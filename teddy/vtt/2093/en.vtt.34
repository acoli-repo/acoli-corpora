00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
which is why we need all the diet aids.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
We spend 200 billion dollars a year

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
on diet-related illness today,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
200 billion.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So you know what, when we talk

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents --

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
that's what the government allocates for lunch.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
That means we spend less than a dollar a day
