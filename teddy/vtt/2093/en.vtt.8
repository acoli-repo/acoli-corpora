00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
produce in America.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The USDA allows these antibiotics,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and the USDA paid for this ad

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
in Time magazine.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
but we know it wasn't good for you and me.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And that has to change, you know.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The USDA cannot be seen as

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
the be-all and end-all of what we feed

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
our kids and what's allowed.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.
