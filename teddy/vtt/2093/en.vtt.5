00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So we talked to kids about that,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and we really start to feed kids regional food.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And then we talk about organic food.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now, most school districts can't really afford organic food,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but we, as a nation,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
have to start thinking about

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
consuming, growing and feeding our children

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
food that's not chock-full of chemicals.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We can't keep doing that.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
You know, it doesn't work.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And the results of that are kids getting sick.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.
