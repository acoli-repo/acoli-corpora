00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
every day and go cook the food for the kids,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
because this is what we need to do.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
We can't keep serving kids

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
processed crap,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
full of chemicals,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and expect these are going to be healthy citizens.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
You're not going to get the next generation,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
or the generation after, to be able to think like this

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
if they're not nourished.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
If they're eating

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
chemicals all the time,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
they're not going to be able to think.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
They're not going to be smart.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
You know what? They're just going to be sick.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people,
