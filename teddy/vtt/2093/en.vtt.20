There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
doing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
actually getting fresh food into schools.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Now, in Berkeley, we've gone totally fresh.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
We have no high-fructose corn syrup,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
no trans fats, no processed foods.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
We're cooking from scratch every day.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
thank you -- 25 percent of our stuff

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
is organic and local. We cook.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Those are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
every day and go cook the food for the kids,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
because this is what we need to do.
