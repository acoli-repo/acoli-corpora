00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
we've gone from being 200 --

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
being 100 percent, 95 percent farmers

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to less than 2 percent of farmers.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And we spend 35,000 dollars

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and school districts spend 500 dollars a year

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
feeding a child.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
It's no wonder, you know, we have criminals.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
(Laughter)

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And what's happening is, we're getting sick.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick.
