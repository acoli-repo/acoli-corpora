00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
of refined sugar,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
they go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
We have recycling in all of our schools.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You know, the things that we maybe do at home

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and think are so important,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
we have to teach kids about in school.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
It has to be so much a part of them

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
that they really get it.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Because, you know what, many of us

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
are sort of at the end of our careers,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and we need to be giving these kids --

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
these young kids, the next generation --
