This is available on my website in English and Spanish,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
We have to start changing this.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
We have to make kids understand

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
that their food choices make a big difference.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
We have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And why this is so important is

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
that we now have grown a generation,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
maybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
is eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer.
