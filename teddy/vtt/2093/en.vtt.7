And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
but it's an issue in the food supply.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
One of my favorite facts is that

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
That means every one of us, and our children,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
consumes what would equal a five-pound bag --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
those bags you have at home. If I had one here

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and ripped it open,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and that pile I would have on the floor

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
is what we consume and feed our children every year

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
because of what goes into our food supply,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
because of the way we consume

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
produce in America.
