Now, I said I'm doing this in Berkeley, and you might think,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
"Oh, Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley."

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Well, this is the food I found 24 months ago.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
This is not even food.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
This is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
corn dogs,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
pizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Everything came in plastic, in cardboard.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
it came frozen in a box.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
The USDA allows this.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
The USDA allows all of this stuff.
