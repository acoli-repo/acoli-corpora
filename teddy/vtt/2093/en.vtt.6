One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
is consumed in animal husbandry.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
We are feeding our kids antibiotics

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
in beef and other animal protein every day.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Seventy percent -- it's unbelievable.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And the result of it is, we have diseases.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We have things like E. coli that we can't fix,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that we can't make kids better when they get sick.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,
