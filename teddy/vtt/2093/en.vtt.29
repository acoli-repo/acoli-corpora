00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
we could start to really fix this program.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
We really need to change it.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
It's going to take more money.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Of course, it's not all about food; it's also about

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
kids getting exercise.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And one of the simple things we can do

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
is put recess before lunch.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
It's sort of this "duh" thing.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
You know, if you have kids coming into lunch

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And then, at one in the afternoon, they're totally crashing.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch.
