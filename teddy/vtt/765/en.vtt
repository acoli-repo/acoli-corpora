00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a garbage man.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because I absolutely hate waste.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I hope, within the next 10 minutes,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to change the way you think

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
about a lot of the stuff in your life.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I'd like to start at the very beginning.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Think back when you were just a kid.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
How did look at the stuff in your life?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's my stuff if I saw it first.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.
