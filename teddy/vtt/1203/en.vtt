00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in the

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
very, very north end of it there,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
where it's absolutely freezing cold.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This was me running around in the back garden mid-summer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
(Laughter)

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I couldn't pick a career.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In Ireland the obvious choice is the military,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but to be honest it actually kind of sucks.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
(Laughter)

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
My mother wanted me to be a dentist.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So I actually went to school in Belfast,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which was where all the action happened.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And this was a pretty common sight.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The school I went to was pretty boring.
