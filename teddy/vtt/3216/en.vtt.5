00:02:29.847 --> 00:02:33.110
then they can be reconstructed
in a distant location.

00:02:34.043 --> 00:02:37.377
This is what we mean
by biological teleportation.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.552
To prove out this vision,

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.569
Craig and Ham set a goal
of creating, for the first time,

00:02:42.593 --> 00:02:45.746
a synthetic cell, starting
from DNA code in the computer.

00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:51.141
I mean, come on,
as a scientist looking for a job,

00:02:51.165 --> 00:02:54.228
doing cutting-edge research,
it doesn't get any better than this.

00:02:54.252 --> 00:02:56.011
(Laughter)

00:02:56.035 --> 00:03:00.562
OK, a genome is a complete set
of DNA within an organism.
