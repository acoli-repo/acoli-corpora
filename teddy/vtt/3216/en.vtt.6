OK, a genome is a complete set
of DNA within an organism.

00:03:01.138 --> 00:03:03.847
Following the Human
Genome Project in 2003,

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:06.070
which was an international
effort to identify

00:03:06.094 --> 00:03:09.252
the complete genetic blueprint
of a human being,

00:03:09.276 --> 00:03:11.529
a genomics revolution happened.

00:03:11.553 --> 00:03:15.245
Scientists started mastering
the techniques for reading DNA.

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.563
In order to determine the order
of the As, Cs, Ts and Gs

00:03:18.587 --> 00:03:19.853
within an organism.

00:03:20.475 --> 00:03:22.031
But my job was far different.

00:03:22.412 --> 00:03:25.418
I needed to master
the techniques for writing DNA.

00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:26.712
Like an author of a book,

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:28.918
this started out
as writing short sentences,

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:31.045
or sequences of DNA code,
