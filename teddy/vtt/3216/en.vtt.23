00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:30.188
We like to compare
the DBC to fax machines.

00:11:31.016 --> 00:11:34.381
But whereas fax machines
received images and documents,

00:11:34.405 --> 00:11:37.143
the DBC receives biological materials.

00:11:38.024 --> 00:11:40.706
Now, consider how
fax machines have evolved.

00:11:41.553 --> 00:11:44.736
The prototype of the 1840s
is unrecognizable,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.278
compared with the fax machines of today.

00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.768
In the 1980s, most people
still didn't know what a fax machine was,

00:11:51.792 --> 00:11:53.188
and if they did,

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:55.571
it was difficult for them
to grasp the concept

00:11:55.595 --> 00:11:59.216
of instantly reproducing an image
on the other side of the world.

00:11:59.672 --> 00:12:01.966
But nowadays, everything
that a fax machine does
