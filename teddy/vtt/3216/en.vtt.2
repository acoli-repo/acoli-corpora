00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.291
in order to prepare the virus
for the start of a multistep,

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:06.597
multimonth flu vaccine
manufacturing process.

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:09.357
My team and I received this email

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:13.267
because we had just invented
a biological printer,

00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:15.712
which would allow
for the flu vaccine instructions

00:01:15.736 --> 00:01:19.057
to be instantly downloaded
from the internet and printed.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:22.919
Drastically speeding up the way
in which flu vaccines are made,

00:01:22.943 --> 00:01:25.743
and potentially saving thousands of lives.

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:31.750
The biological printer leverages
our ability to read and write DNA
