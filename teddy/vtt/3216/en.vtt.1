Although methods existed
to produce a flu vaccine

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.782
and stop the disease from spreading,

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:36.650
at best, it would not be available
for at least six months.

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:42.204
This is because a slow, antiquated
flu vaccine manufacturing process

00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:46.186
developed over 70 years ago
was the only option.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.592
The virus would need to be isolated
from infected patients,

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:52.910
packaged up and then sent to a facility

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:56.950
where scientists would inject
the virus into chicken eggs,

00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:59.545
and incubate those chicken eggs
for several weeks

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.291
in order to prepare the virus
for the start of a multistep,
