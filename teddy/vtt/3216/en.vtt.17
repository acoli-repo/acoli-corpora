00:08:28.895 --> 00:08:31.095
more accurately and more reliably.

00:08:31.688 --> 00:08:33.982
Because of the robustness
of these technologies,

00:08:34.006 --> 00:08:37.006
we found that we could
readily automate the processes

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.696
and move the laboratory workflows
out of the scientist's hands

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.986
and onto a machine.

00:08:43.004 --> 00:08:46.004
In 2013, we built the first DNA printer.

00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:48.940
We call it the BioXp.

00:08:48.964 --> 00:08:52.160
And it has been absolutely
essential in writing DNA

00:08:52.184 --> 00:08:53.799
across a number of applications

00:08:53.823 --> 00:08:57.623
my team and researchers
around the world are working on.

00:08:58.077 --> 00:09:00.094
It was shortly after we built the BioXp
