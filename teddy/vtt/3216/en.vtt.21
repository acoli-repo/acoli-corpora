00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:31.133
requiring a physical DVD to be inserted,

00:10:31.157 --> 00:10:33.490
whereas the DBC is Netflix.

00:10:35.974 --> 00:10:37.206
To build the DBC,

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:42.079
my team of scientists worked with
software and instrumentation engineers

00:10:42.103 --> 00:10:44.871
to collapse multiple laboratory workflows,

00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:46.363
all in a single box.

00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:50.577
This included software algorithms
to predict what DNA to build,

00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:55.053
chemistry to link the G, A, T and C
building blocks of DNA into short pieces,

00:10:55.077 --> 00:10:59.355
Gibson Assembly to stitch together
those short pieces into much longer ones,

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:02.938
and biology to convert the DNA
into other biological entities,
