00:01:58.892 --> 00:02:03.164
Self-replicating living cells
and things like vaccines and therapeutics

00:02:03.188 --> 00:02:06.295
that work in ways
that were previously impossible.

00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:10.442
Here's National Medal of Science
recipient Craig Venter

00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:12.601
and Nobel laureate Ham Smith.

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:15.347
These two guys shared a similar vision.

00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:19.768
That vision was, because all
of the functions and characteristics

00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:23.949
of all biological entities,
including viruses and living cells,

00:02:23.973 --> 00:02:26.403
are written into the code of DNA,

00:02:26.427 --> 00:02:29.823
if one can read and write
that code of DNA,

00:02:29.847 --> 00:02:33.110
then they can be reconstructed
in a distant location.
