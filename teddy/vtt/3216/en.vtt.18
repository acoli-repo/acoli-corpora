It was shortly after we built the BioXp

00:09:00.118 --> 00:09:05.004
that we received that email
about the H7N9 bird flu scare in China.

00:09:05.498 --> 00:09:08.919
A team of Chinese scientists
had already isolated the virus,

00:09:08.943 --> 00:09:12.459
sequenced its DNA and uploaded
the DNA sequence to the internet.

00:09:13.616 --> 00:09:17.131
At the request of the US government,
we downloaded the DNA sequence

00:09:17.155 --> 00:09:20.720
and in less than 12 hours,
we printed it on the BioXp.

00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:23.107
Our collaborators at Novartis

00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:27.146
then quickly started turning
that synthetic DNA into a flu vaccine.

00:09:27.497 --> 00:09:32.027
Meanwhile, the CDC, using technology
dating back to the 1940s,
