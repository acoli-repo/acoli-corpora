The biological printer leverages
our ability to read and write DNA

00:01:31.774 --> 00:01:33.744
and starts to bring into focus

00:01:33.768 --> 00:01:36.901
what we like to call
biological teleportation.

00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:41.904
I am a biologist and an engineer
who builds stuff out of DNA.

00:01:42.577 --> 00:01:44.926
Believe it or not,
one of my favorite things to do

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.327
is to take DNA apart
and put it back together

00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:50.109
so that I can understand
better how it works.

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:55.101
I can edit and program DNA to do things,
just like coders programing a computer.

00:01:55.797 --> 00:01:57.598
But my apps are different.

00:01:57.622 --> 00:01:58.868
They create life.

00:01:58.892 --> 00:02:03.164
Self-replicating living cells
and things like vaccines and therapeutics
