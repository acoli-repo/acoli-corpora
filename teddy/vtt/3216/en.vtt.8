We also knew that writing DNA
would enable biological teleportation ...

00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:08.094
the printing of defined,
biological material,

00:04:08.118 --> 00:04:09.813
starting from DNA code.

00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:13.537
As a step toward bringing
these promises to fruition,

00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:16.283
our team set out to create,
for the first time,

00:04:16.307 --> 00:04:18.545
a synthetic bacterial cell,

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.168
starting from DNA code in the computer.

00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:24.045
Synthetic DNA is a commodity.

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:27.680
You can order very short pieces of DNA
from a number of companies,

00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:31.371
and they will start from these four
bottles of chemicals that make up DNA,
