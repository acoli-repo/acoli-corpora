and biology to convert the DNA
into other biological entities,

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.144
such as proteins.

00:11:05.089 --> 00:11:06.716
This is the prototype.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.930
Although it wasn't pretty,
it was effective.

00:11:08.954 --> 00:11:11.247
It made therapeutic drugs and vaccines.

00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:15.045
And laboratory workflows
that once took weeks or months

00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:18.617
could now be carried out
in just one to two days.

00:11:18.641 --> 00:11:21.228
And that's all without
any human intervention

00:11:21.252 --> 00:11:23.843
and simply activated
by the receipt of an email

00:11:23.867 --> 00:11:26.410
which could be sent
from anywhere in the world.

00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:30.188
We like to compare
the DBC to fax machines.
