00:05:33.593 --> 00:05:36.918
Once we chemically synthesized
the complete bacterial genome,

00:05:36.942 --> 00:05:39.252
our next challenge was to find a way

00:05:39.276 --> 00:05:42.744
to convert it into a free-living,
self-replicating cell.

00:05:43.427 --> 00:05:47.252
Our approach was to think of the genome
as the operating system of the cell,

00:05:47.276 --> 00:05:51.771
with the cell containing the hardware
necessary to boot up the genome.

00:05:52.553 --> 00:05:54.172
Through a lot of trial and error,

00:05:54.196 --> 00:05:57.331
we developed a procedure
where we could reprogram cells

00:05:57.355 --> 00:06:00.704
and even convert one
bacterial species into another,
