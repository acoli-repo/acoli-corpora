00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:31.045
or sequences of DNA code,

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.347
but this soon turned into
writing paragraphs

00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:35.736
and then full-on novels of DNA code,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.989
to make important biological instructions
for proteins and living cells.

00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:43.966
Living cells are nature's most efficient
machines at making new products,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.649
accounting for the production

00:03:45.673 --> 00:03:49.244
of 25 percent of the total
pharmaceutical market,

00:03:49.268 --> 00:03:51.201
which is billions of dollars.

00:03:51.823 --> 00:03:55.704
We knew that writing DNA
would drive this bioeconomy even more,

00:03:55.728 --> 00:03:58.894
once cells could be programmed
just like computers.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:03.990
We also knew that writing DNA
would enable biological teleportation ...
