Ever since the first bacterial genome
was sequenced, back in 1995,

00:06:34.214 --> 00:06:37.673
thousands more whole bacterial genomes
have been sequenced and stored

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:39.103
in computer databases.

00:06:39.601 --> 00:06:41.988
Our synthetic cell work
was the proof of concept

00:06:42.012 --> 00:06:44.022
that we could reverse this process:

00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:47.641
pull a complete bacterial genome
sequence out of the computer

00:06:47.665 --> 00:06:52.426
and convert that information
into a free-living, self-replicating cell,

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.788
with all of the expected characteristics
of the species that we constructed.

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:00.958
Now I can understand
why there may be concerns
