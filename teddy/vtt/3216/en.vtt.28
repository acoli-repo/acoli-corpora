00:13:56.443 --> 00:14:00.450
to make new medicines
or to make synthetic organisms

00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:04.141
that produce oxygen, food,
fuel or building materials,

00:14:04.165 --> 00:14:07.339
as a means for making the planet
more habitable for humans.

00:14:08.002 --> 00:14:12.442
(Applause)

00:14:12.466 --> 00:14:15.807
With digital information
traveling at the speed of light,

00:14:15.831 --> 00:14:18.728
it would only take minutes
to send those digital instructions

00:14:18.752 --> 00:14:19.942
from Earth to Mars,

00:14:19.966 --> 00:14:23.815
but it would take months
to physically deliver those same samples

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:24.989
on a spacecraft.

00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:30.424
But for now, I would be satisfied
beaming new medicines across the globe,
