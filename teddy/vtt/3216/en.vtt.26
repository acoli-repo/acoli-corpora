00:12:59.173 --> 00:13:01.188
as a means to download
their prescriptions,

00:13:01.212 --> 00:13:03.331
such as insulin or antibody therapies.

00:13:03.355 --> 00:13:07.808
The DBC will also be valuable when placed
in strategic areas around the world,

00:13:07.832 --> 00:13:10.499
for rapid response to disease outbreaks.

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:13.982
For example, the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia

00:13:14.006 --> 00:13:18.799
could send flu vaccine instructions
to a DBC on the other side of the world,

00:13:18.823 --> 00:13:22.767
where the flu vaccine is manufactured
right on the front lines.

00:13:23.085 --> 00:13:28.315
That flu vaccine could even be
specifically tailored to the flu strain

00:13:28.339 --> 00:13:31.561
that's circulating in that local area.
