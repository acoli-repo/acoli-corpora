Naturally, with this in mind,

00:10:01.173 --> 00:10:03.379
we started to build
a biological teleporter.

00:10:04.402 --> 00:10:06.591
We call it the DBC.

00:10:06.615 --> 00:10:09.747
That's short for
digital-to-biological converter.

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:11.601
Unlike the BioXp,

00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:14.704
which starts from pre-manufactured
short pieces of DNA,

00:10:14.728 --> 00:10:17.831
the DBC starts from digitized DNA code

00:10:17.855 --> 00:10:20.910
and converts that DNA code
into biological entities,

00:10:20.934 --> 00:10:24.467
such as DNA, RNA,
proteins or even viruses.

00:10:25.188 --> 00:10:28.061
You can think of the BioXp
as a DVD player,

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:31.133
requiring a physical DVD to be inserted,
