00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:31.371
and they will start from these four
bottles of chemicals that make up DNA,

00:04:31.395 --> 00:04:32.840
G, A, T and C,

00:04:32.864 --> 00:04:36.120
and they will build
those very short pieces of DNA for you.

00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:38.819
Over the past 15 years or so,

00:04:38.843 --> 00:04:41.166
my teams have been
developing the technology

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.946
for stitching together
those short pieces of DNA

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.160
into complete bacterial genomes.

00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:51.204
The largest genome that we constructed
contained over one million letters.

00:04:51.942 --> 00:04:54.602
Which is more than twice the size
of your average novel,

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:58.069
and we had to put every single one
of those letters in the correct order,

00:04:58.093 --> 00:04:59.362
without a single typo.

00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:03.679
We were able to accomplish this
by developing a procedure
