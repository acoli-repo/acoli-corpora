00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:03.679
We were able to accomplish this
by developing a procedure

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:08.750
that I tried to call the "one-step
isothermal in vitro recombination method."

00:05:08.774 --> 00:05:10.863
(Laughter)

00:05:10.887 --> 00:05:15.879
But, surprisingly, the science community
didn't like this technically accurate name

00:05:15.903 --> 00:05:18.503
and decided to call it Gibson Assembly.

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:22.482
Gibson Assembly
is now the gold standard tool,

00:05:22.506 --> 00:05:24.974
used in laboratories around the world

00:05:24.998 --> 00:05:27.798
for building short and long pieces of DNA.

00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:33.569
