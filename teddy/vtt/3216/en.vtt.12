00:05:57.355 --> 00:06:00.704
and even convert one
bacterial species into another,

00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:04.252
by replacing the genome of one cell
with that of another.

00:06:05.363 --> 00:06:09.427
This genome transplantation
technology then paved the way

00:06:09.451 --> 00:06:12.680
for the booting-up of genomes
written by scientists

00:06:12.704 --> 00:06:14.371
and not by Mother Nature.

00:06:14.768 --> 00:06:17.387
In 2010, all of the technologies

00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:20.196
that we had been developing
for reading and writing DNA

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.141
all came together
when we announced the creation

00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:25.379
of the first synthetic cell,

00:06:25.403 --> 00:06:27.561
which of course, we called Synthia.

00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:29.586
(Laughter)

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.190
Ever since the first bacterial genome
was sequenced, back in 1995,
