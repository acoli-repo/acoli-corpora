00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:11.924
Your heart beats more 
than 100,000 times a day.

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:16.846
In just a minute, it pumps over five

00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:22.852

has a limited ability to repair itself.

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:25.605
So if this organ is severely damaged,

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:29.692
thereâ€™s often only one medical solution:
replacing it.
