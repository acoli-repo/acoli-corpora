00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.216
And that was the beginning
of partnerships.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.216
Working with rattan basket makers
to come up with products.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.016
So with this in hand, I felt confident

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.040
that I would be able
to take this knowledge

00:05:40.064 --> 00:05:42.616
back into the riverine communities

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.896
and help them to transform
their adversity into prosperity.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.096
So taking these weeds
and actually weaving them

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.696
into products that can be sold.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.456
So we have pens, we have tableware,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.256
we have purses, we have tissue boxes.
