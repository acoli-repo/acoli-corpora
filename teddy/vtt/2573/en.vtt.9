00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.016
And so I began my quest

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.976
to find out how I can learn how to weave.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.136
And this quest took me
to a community in Ibadan, where I lived,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.576
called Sabo.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.456
Sabo translates to "strangers' quarters."

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.496
And the community is
predominantly made up of people

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.496
from the northern part of the country.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.456
So I literally took
my dried weeds in hand,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.056
there were several more of them,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.416
and went knocking from door to door
to find out who could teach me

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.856
how to weave these
water hyacinth stems into ropes.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.000
And I was directed
to the shed of Malam Yahaya.
