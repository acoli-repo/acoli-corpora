Welcome to Bayeku,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.496
a riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos --

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.896
a vivid representation of several
riverine communities across Nigeria,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.896
communities whose waterways
have been infested

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.776
by an invasive aquatic weed;

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.056
communities where economic livelihoods
have been hampered:

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.296
fishing, marine transportation

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.576
and trading;

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.776
communities where fish yields
have diminished;
