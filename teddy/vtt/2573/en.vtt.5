00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.816
in the area of sustainable development.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.816
And so here I was in the year 2009,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.976
actually, at the end of 2009,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.016
in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.696
And I looked to my left
and saw this very arresting image.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.496
It was an image of fishing boats

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.256
that had been hemmed in
by dense mats of water hyacinth.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.656
And I was really pained by what I saw

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.176
because I thought to myself,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.056
"These poor fisherfolk,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.936
how are they going
to go about their daily activities
