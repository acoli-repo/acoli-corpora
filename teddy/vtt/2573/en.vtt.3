When you hear Abiola,
you remember annulled elections

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.776
and you think: dashed hopes.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.336
In the southwestern part of Nigeria,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.576
the plant is known as Gbe'borun.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.376
Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.376
which translates to "gossip,"
or "talebearer."

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.216
When you think of gossip, you think:
rapid reproduction, destruction.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.776
And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.656
the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.376
And when you hear that,
you think of death.
