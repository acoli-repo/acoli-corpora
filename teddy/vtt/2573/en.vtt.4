And when you hear that,
you think of death.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.256
It literally translates
to "death to mother and child."

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.136
I personally had my encounter
with this plant in the year 2009.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.896
It was shortly after I had relocated
from the US to Nigeria.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.456
I'd quit my job in corporate America

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.656
and decided to take
this big leap of faith,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.176
a leap of faith that came
out of a deep sense of conviction

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.336
that there was a lot of work
to do in Nigeria

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.816
in the area of sustainable development.
