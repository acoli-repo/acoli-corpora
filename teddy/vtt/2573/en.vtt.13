00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.496
to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.896
"provider of food for mother and child."

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.776
And I'd like to end
with a quote by Michael Margolis.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.816
He said, "If you want to learn
about a culture, listen to the stories.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.896
And if you want to change a culture,
change the stories."

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.016
And so, from Makoko community,
to Abobiri, to Ewoi,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.696
to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.296
we have changed the story.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.856
Thank you for listening.
