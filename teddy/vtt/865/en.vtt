If you think about the phone --

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and Intel has tested

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a lot of the things I'm going to show you,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
over the last 10 years,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in about 600 elderly households --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
trying to understand: How do we measure

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and monitor behavior

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in a medically meaningful way?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And if you think about the phone, right,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
it's something that we can use for some incredible ways

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to help people actually take the right medication at the right time.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We're testing these kinds of simple

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
sensor-network technologies in the home

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with
