00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:01.926
And I'm angry, too,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.401
at the climate deniers
who are stealing the future

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:08.118
from our children and grandchildren.

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:12.835
Friends, we are living in dangerous times.

00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:18.685
And such times call for all of us
to be more dangerous.

00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:21.408
Now, what do I mean by this?

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:23.209
I don't mean being feared.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:25.654
It's not that kind of dangerous.

00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:29.802
But I do mean being more fearless.
