00:06:55.055 --> 00:07:00.574
But I got to produce and host
breakthrough programming for women,

00:07:00.598 --> 00:07:02.541
while at the same time,

00:07:02.565 --> 00:07:04.509
remaining silent

00:07:04.533 --> 00:07:07.379
about sexual harassment

00:07:07.403 --> 00:07:11.290
and listening to consultants
who were hired to advise me

00:07:11.314 --> 00:07:13.046
about my appearance.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.883
"Become a blonde."

00:07:14.907 --> 00:07:16.068
I did.

00:07:16.092 --> 00:07:17.694
"Lower your voice."

00:07:17.718 --> 00:07:18.946
I tried.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.934
"Lower your necklines."

00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.163
I didn't.

00:07:22.187 --> 00:07:23.368
(Laughter)

00:07:23.392 --> 00:07:26.564
But I did wear those ugly anchor suits

00:07:26.588 --> 00:07:31.036
with those scarves that look
something like men's ties.
