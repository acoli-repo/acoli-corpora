and I really love that part.

00:03:34.662 --> 00:03:36.066

Women on the dangerous side of 60

00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:45.394
are not retiring.

00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:48.082
We are rewiring --

00:03:48.106 --> 00:03:51.063

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:57.274
taking all that we know and have done --
and that is a lot --

00:03:57.298 --> 00:04:00.151
to redefine what age looks like,
