00:05:27.942 --> 00:05:30.401
and landed at a big state university,

00:05:30.425 --> 00:05:35.274
right in the middle of two
great social justice movements:

00:05:35.298 --> 00:05:37.949
civil rights for African Americans

00:05:37.973 --> 00:05:40.304
and equal rights for women.

00:05:40.858 --> 00:05:44.481
I joined both with enthusiasm,

00:05:44.505 --> 00:05:48.358
only to discover that my newfound activism

00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:51.370
and my fermenting feminism

00:05:51.394 --> 00:05:57.541
would often be in direct conflict
with my deeply embedded need to please

00:05:58.467 --> 00:05:59.850
and be popular.
