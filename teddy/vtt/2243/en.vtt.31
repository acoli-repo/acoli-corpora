00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:33.040
We will move forward together,

00:15:33.064 --> 00:15:36.092
willing now to take more risk,

00:15:36.116 --> 00:15:38.665
to be more fearless,

00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:41.655
to speak up, speak out

00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:43.449
and show up

00:15:43.473 --> 00:15:44.841
for one another.

00:15:45.782 --> 00:15:48.225
George Bernard Shaw once wrote

00:15:48.249 --> 00:15:53.734
that he believed in his opinion
that his life belonged to the community,

00:15:53.758 --> 00:15:56.856
that the harder he worked,
the more he lived

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.803
and that he wanted to be
thoroughly used up when he died.
