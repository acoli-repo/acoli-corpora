I've observed women climate leaders
working behinds the scenes,

00:11:02.175 --> 00:11:04.307
out of the public spotlight,

00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:09.228
making sure that the negotiations
toward global climate agreement

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.450
continue to move forward.

00:11:11.474 --> 00:11:14.407
So as we move forward
in our lives and work

00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:16.854
and we have more power and influence,

00:11:16.878 --> 00:11:19.375
let's change the nature of power

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:24.911
by dismantling some of the barriers
that remain for those who follow

00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:27.275
by advocating and agitating

00:11:27.299 --> 00:11:31.754
for fairer and truer
and more equal representation
