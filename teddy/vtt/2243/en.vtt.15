00:07:36.945 --> 00:07:40.733
aware of being judged
through that gender lens,

00:07:40.757 --> 00:07:43.297
I struggled from time to time

00:07:43.321 --> 00:07:48.508
to find the right balance between

00:07:54.523 --> 00:07:59.031
But today, I'm proud to be known
as a woman leader.

00:07:59.055 --> 00:08:02.431
