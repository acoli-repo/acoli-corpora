00:04:29.592 --> 00:04:32.048
with no money, no connections,

00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:34.199
no influence.

00:04:34.748 --> 00:04:36.897
But what wasn't limited

00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:40.931
was my curiosity about the world
beyond my small town,

00:04:40.955 --> 00:04:45.205
beyond the small minds
of a still-segregated South,

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.843
a world that I glimpsed in the newsreels

00:04:47.867 --> 00:04:50.821
at the one movie theater in town,

00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:53.299
and a world that got a lot closer to me

00:04:53.323 --> 00:04:59.187
when I met Miss Shirley Rountree,
my eighth-grade English teacher.
