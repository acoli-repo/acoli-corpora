WEBVTT

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:01.270
to compete, compare,

00:02:02.214 --> 00:02:03.560
criticize.

00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:06.582
We have to end this.

00:02:07.547 --> 00:02:08.977
And speaking out

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.144
against the policies and the politics

00:02:11.168 --> 00:02:15.358
that divide us and diminish
our collective power

00:02:15.382 --> 00:02:19.174
as a global community of women,

00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:21.264
and the men and the allies

00:02:21.288 --> 00:02:22.828
who stand with us.

00:02:23.637 --> 00:02:28.679
Becoming dangerous also means
embracing whatever risks are necessary

00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:32.647
to create a world
where women and girls are safe
