00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:30.446
"That's when things
really started to change."

00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:32.289
And I'm here to say

00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:35.234
that for the movement
to end gun violence in America,

00:07:35.258 --> 00:07:37.840
that moment is here.

00:07:38.308 --> 00:07:43.969
(Applause)

00:07:43.993 --> 00:07:46.874
We are so clearly at a tipping point,

00:07:46.898 --> 00:07:50.009
because the American public
has come together by the millions

00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:52.247
like never before,
based on that common ground,

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.666
to say, "Enough."

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.897
Enough of the mass shootings
in malls and movie theaters

00:07:56.921 --> 00:07:58.827
and churches and schools.

00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:03.744
Enough of the daily terror
of gun violence in homes and streets
