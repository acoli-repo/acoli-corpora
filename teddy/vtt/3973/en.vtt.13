00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:32.691
They're just living with the unimaginable
consequences of a very bad decision,

00:06:32.715 --> 00:06:35.586
made based on very bad information

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.498
that was put into their minds
by very bad people,

00:06:38.522 --> 00:06:41.727
who know good and well
the misery that they're causing,

00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:44.108
but just don't care.

00:06:44.577 --> 00:06:47.039
And the result is a nightmare --

00:06:47.063 --> 00:06:49.633
not only for families like mine,

00:06:49.657 --> 00:06:53.026
but for, really, at the end
of the day, all of us.

00:06:53.472 --> 00:06:56.386
But I'm not here to talk
about the nightmare of gun violence.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.446
I'm here to talk about our dream,
and it's a dream we all share,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.946
which is the dream
of a better, safer, future.
