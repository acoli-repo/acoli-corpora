00:11:56.048 --> 00:12:00.976
one of my all-time favorite
TV shows, "Mad Men,"

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.214
a period TV show about advertising

00:12:03.238 --> 00:12:05.056
in the 1960s.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.677
And as I was trying to think
about how to end my remarks,

00:12:08.701 --> 00:12:10.976
I'd glance up at her screen
every now and then,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.293
and it seemed that every time I did,

00:12:13.317 --> 00:12:17.642
I'd see somebody smoking
in an office or around children

00:12:17.666 --> 00:12:20.079
or while pregnant or drinking and driving

00:12:20.103 --> 00:12:24.074
or driving without seat belts
or sexually harassing a coworker.

00:12:24.098 --> 00:12:26.472
And ultimately it dawned on me:

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.858
what tremendous inspiration

00:12:27.882 --> 00:12:31.841
to those of us who have this dream
to end gun violence.
