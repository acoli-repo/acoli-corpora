00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.946
which is the dream
of a better, safer, future.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.672
For my organization,
for the Brady Campaign,

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:07.284
that dream is reflected in the bold goal

00:07:07.308 --> 00:07:12.078
to cut the number of gun deaths
in the US in half by 2025.

00:07:12.102 --> 00:07:14.604
And I hope to leave
all of you here tonight

00:07:14.628 --> 00:07:20.501
with a strong sense of exactly why
that dream is so absolutely within reach.

00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:21.891
Because folks,

00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:24.727
for every great movement around the world,

00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:27.538
there's a moment
where you can look back and say,

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:30.446
"That's when things
really started to change."
