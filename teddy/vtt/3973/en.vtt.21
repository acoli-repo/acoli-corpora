00:10:30.006 --> 00:10:31.530
Until recently,

00:10:31.554 --> 00:10:34.806
the narrative in Congress
was that calls from the other side,

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.990
from that six percent,

00:10:36.014 --> 00:10:39.194
outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one.

00:10:39.218 --> 00:10:41.257
We're flipping that narrative on its head.

00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:43.891
After that recent terrible tragedy
in San Bernardino,

00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:45.720
we jammed Congressional switchboards.

00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:51.117
We put 15,000 calls
into Congress in 24 hours.

00:10:51.141 --> 00:10:52.292
And you know what?

00:10:52.316 --> 00:10:53.467
We got a vote on a bill

00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:56.705
that nobody thought was going to see
the light of day anytime soon.

00:10:56.729 --> 00:10:59.570
We're seeing real movement
to repeal some of the most evil,

00:10:59.594 --> 00:11:04.233
ugly gun lobby legislation
passed over the last dark decade.
