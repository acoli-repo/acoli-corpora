00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:03.039
Ten years ago, 42 percent
of the American public

00:05:03.063 --> 00:05:07.340
believed -- incorrectly -- that a gun
makes your home safer.

00:05:07.364 --> 00:05:11.007
Today, that number is 63 percent.

00:05:11.784 --> 00:05:12.936
Why?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.158
I kind of hate to say it,

00:05:14.182 --> 00:05:16.772
because it gets to the dark
underbelly of advertising,

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:19.224
which is if you tell
a big enough lie enough times,

00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:21.089
eventually that lie becomes the truth.

00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:23.060
And that's exactly what's happened here.

00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:25.626
The corporate gun lobby
has spent billions of dollars

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.975
blocking the CDC from doing research
into the public health epidemic

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:30.660
of gun violence;
