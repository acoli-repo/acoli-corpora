00:03:58.957 --> 00:04:02.720
And the numbers show the overwhelming
agreement among the American public:

00:04:02.744 --> 00:04:07.027
90 percent of Americans support
expanding Brady background checks

00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:09.685
to all gun sales -- including
90 percent of Republicans,

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.629
more than 80 percent of gun owners,

00:04:11.653 --> 00:04:13.905
more than 70 percent of NRA members.

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:15.843
This is not a controversial idea.

00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:19.443
In fact, only six percent
of the American public disagrees.

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:21.832
That's about the percentage
of the American public

00:04:21.856 --> 00:04:24.045
that believes the moon landing was a fake.

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:25.434
(Laughter)

00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:28.430
And it's also about the percentage
that believes the government

00:04:28.454 --> 00:04:32.413
is putting mind-controlling technology
in our TV broadcast signals.
