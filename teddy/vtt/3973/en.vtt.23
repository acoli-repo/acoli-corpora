00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.513
And you know what? We're winning.

00:11:31.537 --> 00:11:35.204
Congress is almost always
the last to wake up and realize

00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:37.417
that it's on the wrong side of history.

00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:41.062
And when they do, it's always
because the American public shakes them.

00:11:41.086 --> 00:11:43.268
And that's exactly
what we're doing right now,

00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:44.830
as we're in this tipping point.

00:11:44.854 --> 00:11:48.803
You know, recently I was flying
cross-country to give a speech

00:11:48.827 --> 00:11:52.259
to a large group like this,
although far less intimidating,

00:11:52.283 --> 00:11:56.024
and the woman sitting next to me
happened to be binge-watching

00:11:56.048 --> 00:12:00.976
one of my all-time favorite
TV shows, "Mad Men,"
