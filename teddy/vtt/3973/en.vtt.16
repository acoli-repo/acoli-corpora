00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:03.744
Enough of the daily terror
of gun violence in homes and streets

00:08:03.768 --> 00:08:06.975
that's claimed the lives of women
and young black men

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:08.421
in staggering proportions.

00:08:08.445 --> 00:08:10.228
Enough of easy access to guns

00:08:10.252 --> 00:08:12.728
by the people that we all agree
shouldn't have them.

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:15.787
And enough of a small group
of craven politicians

00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:18.100
putting the interests
of the corporate gun lobby

00:08:18.124 --> 00:08:21.123
ahead of the people
they have been elected to represent.

00:08:21.147 --> 00:08:22.298
Enough.

00:08:22.322 --> 00:08:28.476
(Applause)

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.404
And the really exciting thing is,
it's not just the usual suspects like me
