00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.404
And the really exciting thing is,
it's not just the usual suspects like me

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:33.960
that are saying it anymore.

00:08:33.984 --> 00:08:35.888
It's so much bigger than that.

00:08:35.912 --> 00:08:37.063
And if you want proof,

00:08:37.087 --> 00:08:40.639
let's start where most conversations

It's when they go from being
political and advocacy issues

00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:51.544
to being part of pop culture,

00:08:51.568 --> 00:08:55.137
voices coming from everywhere,
celebrities using their platforms,

00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:56.762
musicians, athletes.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.042
The NBA has come forward.

00:08:58.066 --> 00:09:00.720
Conservative pundits that you never
