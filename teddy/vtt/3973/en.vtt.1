00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.898
when my little brother Matt
was shot in the head

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:35.747
in a shooting that happened
on the observation deck

00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:37.887
of the Empire State Building.

00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:43.073
Suddenly, my family was thrown
into the middle of a nightmare,

00:00:43.097 --> 00:00:47.227
being told that my brother
was going to die,

00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.927
actually being given the opportunity
to say goodbye to him,

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:53.301
then several emergency brain surgeries

00:00:53.325 --> 00:00:55.976
and now what's amounted, for Matt,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.246
to a lifetime spent courageously
recovering from a traumatic brain injury.
