00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:30.992
Let's look, for example,
at people who love to hunt,

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:34.198
a sport enjoyed by millions across the US.

00:02:34.222 --> 00:02:36.862
It's a proud tradition. Families.

00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:38.040
In some places,

00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:41.316
the first day of hunting season
is actually a school holiday.

00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:43.261
What do hunters want?

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:45.633
Well, they want to hunt.
They love their guns.

00:02:45.657 --> 00:02:46.857
They believe deeply

00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.373
in the Second Amendment right
to own those guns.

00:02:49.397 --> 00:02:51.676
But that doesn't mean
there isn't common ground.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.128
In fact, there's a lot of it,

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:58.556
starting with the basic idea
of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.394
This isn't about taking
certain guns away from all people.
