00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.394
This isn't about taking
certain guns away from all people.

00:03:03.418 --> 00:03:06.294
It's about keeping all guns
away from certain people,

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:09.783
and it's the people that, it turns out,
we all agree shouldn't have guns:

00:03:09.807 --> 00:03:12.287
convicted violent criminals,
domestic abusers,

00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.181
the dangerously mentally ill.

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:16.356
We can all appreciate

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.287
how Brady background checks
have been incredibly effective

00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:21.579
in keeping guns
out of those dangerous hands.

00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:26.010
In 20 years, Brady background checks
at federally licensed firearm dealers

00:03:26.034 --> 00:03:29.799
have blocked 2.4 million gun sales

00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:32.988
to those people that we all agree
shouldn't have guns.
