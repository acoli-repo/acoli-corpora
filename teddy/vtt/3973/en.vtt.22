00:10:59.594 --> 00:11:04.233
ugly gun lobby legislation
passed over the last dark decade.

00:11:04.257 --> 00:11:07.164
The stranglehold of the gun lobby
is clearly being broken.

00:11:07.188 --> 00:11:10.490
We've seen President Obama's
historic executive actions.

00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:11.904
They don't go all the way,

00:11:11.928 --> 00:11:13.515
but they are going to save lives,

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:15.586
because they expand
Brady background checks

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.182
to thousands of gun sales
that didn't have them previously.

00:11:19.206 --> 00:11:22.214
And we're marching across the country --
we're not just waiting

00:11:22.238 --> 00:11:25.623
for Congress to act; that would almost
be the definition of insanity.

00:11:25.647 --> 00:11:27.292
We're marching across the country,

00:11:27.316 --> 00:11:29.915
state by state, marriage-equality style.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.513
And you know what? We're winning.
