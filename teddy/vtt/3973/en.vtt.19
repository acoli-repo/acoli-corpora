Some are being forced
to reverse very bad positions

00:09:32.162 --> 00:09:36.384
they defended very comfortably,
until very recently.

00:09:36.408 --> 00:09:38.038
For somebody like me,

00:09:38.062 --> 00:09:43.124
watching people wave around
their negative NRA ratings --

00:09:43.148 --> 00:09:46.367
it's almost surreal to watch.

00:09:46.391 --> 00:09:50.114
We're still outfunded, yes,
by the corporate gun lobby,

00:09:50.138 --> 00:09:52.507
and ultimately that needs to change.

00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:53.692
But you know what?

00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:58.075
We're smarter and we're scrappier,
and we have the truth on our side.

00:09:58.099 --> 00:09:59.819
And we're on offense.

00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:03.253
You know, they say that the Internet
democratizes information.
