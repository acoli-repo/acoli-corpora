00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:33.708
my fear and my anger
turned into something else.

00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:36.542
Shame.

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:39.851
My whole life I had spent blaming him,

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.143
hating him,

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:42.542
I even wished him ill.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.518
I had never once

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:50.125
thought about his struggle, his choices.

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.434
Could he be a potential ally?

00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:55.434
I never had thought

00:03:55.458 --> 00:03:57.958
he feels as trapped as the chickens.
