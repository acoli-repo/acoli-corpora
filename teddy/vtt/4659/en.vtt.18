00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.000
"I have two adopted kids."

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.684
And for the next 20 minutes,

00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:08.226
we just talked about that.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.684
We talked about adoption
and being a parent

00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:13.643
and in those moments,

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:16.101
we forgot who we were supposed to be

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:17.458
at that table.

00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:20.101
And the walls came down,

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:23.768
and a bridge was built
and we crossed this divide.

00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:27.018
And more progress
was made with that company

00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:30.625
because of that human
connection that we made.
