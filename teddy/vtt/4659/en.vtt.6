00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:02.059
there's very unlikely to be polar bears,

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:05.226
Sumatran elephants, orangutans.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.518
In my lifetime,

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:12.333
the number of birds, amphibians,
reptiles and mammals has halved.

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:15.768
And the main culprit

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:20.184
is our global appetite
for meat, dairy and eggs.

00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:22.934
And for me, up until this point,

00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.292
the villain was Craig Watts.

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:29.518
And as I sat there in his living room,

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:33.708
my fear and my anger
turned into something else.
