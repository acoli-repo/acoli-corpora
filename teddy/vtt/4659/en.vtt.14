00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:00.143
I sat down with an even bigger
so-called enemy:

00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:02.643
Jim Perdue himself.

00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:05.917
The man I had made the villain
of my viral video.

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:10.059
And again, through difficult conversations

00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:13.184
and being uncomfortable,

00:07:13.208 --> 00:07:15.934
Perdue came out with the first
animal care policy

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.333
of any poultry company.

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:21.351
In it, they agreed to do

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:24.934
some of the things we had criticized them
for not doing in the viral video,

00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.643
like put windows into houses.

00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:29.042
And pay for them.
