What other unlikely allies are out there?

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:10.601
What other progress,

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:15.000
what other lessons can I learn
if I cross those enemy lines?

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:19.143
The first lesson I learned

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:23.250
is that we have to become comfortable
with being uncomfortable.

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:26.768

00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:29.458
