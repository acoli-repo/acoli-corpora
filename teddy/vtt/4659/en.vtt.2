He took a quarter
of a million dollar loan out,

00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:05.101
and he built these chicken houses.

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:07.809
Perdue would give him a flock,
he'd raise them,

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.268
and each flock he'd get paid,

00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:11.726
and then he'd pay off
in small increments that loan,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.042
like a mortgage.

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:16.958
But pretty soon, the chickens got sick.

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.351
It's a factory farm, after all,

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:21.518
there are 25,000 chickens

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:23.768
that are stuffed wall-to-wall,

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:27.893
living on their own feces,
breathing ammonia-laden air.

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:30.934
And when chickens get sick,
some of them die.
