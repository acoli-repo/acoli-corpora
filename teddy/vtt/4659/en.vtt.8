00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:02.726
So we had been sitting there for hours

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.976
and the midday turned into afternoon,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.893
turned into dusk, turned into darkness,

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:09.184
and he suddenly said,

00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:12.059
"OK, are you ready to see the chickens?"

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:14.434
So under the cover of darkness,

00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:17.768
we walked towards one
of these long, gray houses.

00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:20.393
And he swung open the door

00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:21.684
and we stepped inside,

00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:25.059
and we were hit
with this overpowering smell

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:27.684
and every muscle in my body tensed up

00:04:27.708 --> 00:04:30.059
and I coughed and my eyes teared.
