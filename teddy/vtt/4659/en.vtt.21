Here is an environmentally friendly way
to stay on the land,

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:37.143
to pay the bills,

00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:39.643
that a vegan animal rights activist

00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:41.809
and a chicken farmer can get behind.

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:45.143
(Laughter)

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:47.226
And instead of thinking,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.143
how can I get these big
meat companies out of business,

00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:55.226
I started thinking, how can I help them
evolve into a different kind of business.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.226
One where the protein doesn't come
from slaughtered animals,

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.518
but rather, plants.
