Now, if we humans tried to think
of some super unjust,

00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:05.101
unfair, filthy and cruel food system,

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:09.893
we could not have thought
of anything worse than factory farming.

00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:14.476
Eighty billion farmed animals
around the world annually

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.851
are raised and slaughtered.

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:20.143
They're stuffed in cages and warehouses
never to see the light of day.

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:24.101
And that's not just a problem
for those farmed animals.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:25.434
Animal agriculture,

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:28.726
it accounts for more
greenhouse gas emissions

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.434
than all of the planes, trains
and automobiles put together.
