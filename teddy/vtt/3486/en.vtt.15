00:07:28.016 --> 00:07:31.521
I don't think so. So,

00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:34.847
how do you solve this problem,

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:38.066
this such big difference between the 
literacy [rate] of the Portuguese,

00:07:38.097 --> 00:07:41.116
that is down here, and the complexity 
of the public documents,

00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:44.583
those ones we need to understand
in our daily lives, sorry,

00:07:44.583 --> 00:07:46.157
that are up here?

00:07:46.157 --> 00:07:48.728
So, the first think that comes to mind is,

00:07:48.728 --> 00:07:52.004
"If literacy is down here, let's make it rise" -- isn't it?

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.926
Let's educate people.

00:07:53.942 --> 00:07:57.077
Let's, let's... of course we will, 
of course we will educate people.

00:07:57.077 --> 00:08:01.196
The thing is, it's hard and it's slow. 
And I don't even want to imagine
