00:13:59.859 --> 00:14:04.515
And lastly, the third, use plain words, those ones 
that grandma knows.

00:14:04.515 --> 00:14:06.833
Alright? It's easy!

00:14:06.833 --> 00:14:08.398
Before I leave,

00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:11.416
I would like to talk to you about "Clara" (Clear). 
"Clara" is a project of social responsibility.

00:14:11.416 --> 00:14:15.308
It has this mission: to change the way how public communication is made.

00:14:15.308 --> 00:14:16.239
What do we do?

00:14:16.239 --> 00:14:20.026
We are going to launch this year 
a collection of "Claro" guides,

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:24.123
that is, we are going to pick very, very, 
very complex subjects and put them simple.

00:14:24.123 --> 00:14:26.303
We are going to start with the 
"Claro" Guide of Justice.

00:14:26.303 --> 00:14:30.170
I think it is an area... that comes in handy.
