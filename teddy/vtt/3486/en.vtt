00:00:00.057 --> 00:00:03.673
The story I want to tell you about, started to me,

00:00:03.673 --> 00:00:07.825
in 1996 when I was studying in England.

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:11.989
One day, I was glancing through my bank statement
(I didn't have much to look at)

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:17.231
and I've noticed that in the upper corner there was
a symbol, that I'm going to show you,

00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:21.790
saying that document had been made in
plain language, for me to understand it.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.130
The idea interested me; I tried to find out
what that was

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.298
and I found out that there was a campaign for the
simplification of language,

00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:30.039
which was the "Plain English Campaign".
