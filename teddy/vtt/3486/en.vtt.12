00:05:59.847 --> 00:06:00.796
But it's not! (Applause)

00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:02.001
(Applause)

00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:04.922
(Applause)

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:08.983
So, it's this: when we leave our area of expertise --

00:06:08.983 --> 00:06:12.612
and it only takes a little; there is no need to go 
to the string theory or something like that,

00:06:12.612 --> 00:06:14.202
it only takes a little... (Laughter)

00:06:14.202 --> 00:06:15.943
What happens?

00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:19.639
We get as lost as Mr. Domingos.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.612
And these documents are not written 
by experts to experts,

00:06:23.612 --> 00:06:25.461
as the ones from the string theory.

00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:28.909
No! These are documents written for me, 
these are the public documents,

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.613
the public documents I need to understand 
in my daily life,
