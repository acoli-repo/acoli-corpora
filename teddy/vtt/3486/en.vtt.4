For example, if a person, from that red group, 
has to pick up

00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:07.496
the package leaflet of a medicinal product, 
to give a dose of medicine to his/her child,

00:02:07.496 --> 00:02:09.965
he/she can't, can't understand the information.

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:15.093
50% of the Portuguese. Then we have 30% more, 
those yellow ones,

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:19.644
over there, people who get by
on the daily basis.

00:02:19.644 --> 00:02:23.018
That is, if they don't have to read anything too new 
or too different, they will manage.

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:26.718
But, for example, if they work in a factory and 
a new machine arrives

00:02:26.718 --> 00:02:31.616
and they have to read the machine's manual 
to be able to work with it, they can't do it anymore.
