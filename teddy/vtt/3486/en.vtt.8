00:03:56.597 --> 00:04:00.288
they get a bank check and with that bank check 
they can have that surgery in the private sector.

00:04:00.288 --> 00:04:03.324
It was almost thrown away into the garbage, 
Mr. Domingos' letter.

00:04:03.324 --> 00:04:05.475
In that same year, I've found out,

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:09.069
only 20% of people had used these 
surgery-bank checks.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.156
The other 80%, I don't believe they had been cured
while they were waiting.

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:18.192
They most likely did the same as Mr. Domingos:

00:04:18.192 --> 00:04:20.487
"Ah! What's this? I'm not understanding, 
it's going to the garbage".

00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:23.436
They lost the opportunity to have the surgery 
they needed.

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:27.739
What happens here? When people don't understand

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:31.307
this has severe consequences -- to the individual, 
but also for the country.
