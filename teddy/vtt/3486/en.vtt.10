So, come on, this is an automobile insurance 
contract. It says this:

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:09.825
"Unless contrary stipulation, the decease of the ensured person, the ensured capital is provided,

00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:15.660
in case of predeceasing of the beneficiary relatively to the ensured person, to the heirs of the last,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.089
in case of the simultaneous decease of the ensured person and of the beneficiary,

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.491
to the heirs of the last". Hum? (Laughter)

00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:26.535
Next, there's another one, from the medicines' 
package leaflet, that says the following:

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:33.938
"Warning! It may also occur erythema, edema, 
vesiculation, keratolysis and urticaria."
