this is all based on a consumers' movement.

00:10:39.976 --> 00:10:44.503
So, what does it take for that civic movement 
to happen?

00:10:44.503 --> 00:10:47.350
We need to understand two very important things:

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:52.381

00:10:56.897 --> 00:11:00.045
And above all, it is a right, it is everyone's right.
