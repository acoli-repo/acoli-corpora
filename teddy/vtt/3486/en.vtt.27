00:13:29.123 --> 00:13:33.034
It's very easy. You write to your grandmother. 
Hum?

00:13:33.034 --> 00:13:34.882
You write to your grandmother. I'm going 
to show grandma to you.

00:13:34.882 --> 00:13:37.192
(Laughter)

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:38.951
You write with respect and without paternalism.

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:42.450
And you use three techniques that I'm going 
to teach you. First of all:

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.686
Start by the most important.

00:13:44.686 --> 00:13:48.565
Grandma has a lot to do. She is not going to read
three pages to get to the main idea.

00:13:48.565 --> 00:13:50.766
Start by the most important.

00:13:50.766 --> 00:13:54.438
Next, use short sentences, because grandma,

00:13:54.438 --> 00:13:55.648
like anyone of us,

00:13:55.648 --> 00:13:57.325
if you make very long sentences,

00:13:57.325 --> 00:13:59.859
she gets to the end and she can't remember what 
you said in the beginning, anymore.

00:13:59.859 --> 00:14:04.515
And lastly, the third, use plain words, those ones 
that grandma knows.
