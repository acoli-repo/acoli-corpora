00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.278
so, he falls in that yellow group that 
we have seen a little while ago.

00:03:30.278 --> 00:03:32.231
From time to time, I'm arriving home and he says:

00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:34.362
"Miss Sandra!"; "Yes, Mr. Domingos."

00:03:34.362 --> 00:03:38.881
"Here is a little letter." So, the deal is: when Mr. Domingos or someone in the family or in the neighbourhood

00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:42.576
receives something that they don't understand, 
they come to me and I help them to translate it.

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.186
And so, that time he said to me like this:

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:47.911
"Oh, Miss Sandra, I'm about to throw this away, 
but check it if this is important."

00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:52.737
It was very important. He had been waiting, 
for quite a while, to have a knee surgery

00:03:52.737 --> 00:03:56.597
and that was the letter of the famous surgery-bank
checks. When a person is waiting for a long time,

00:03:56.597 --> 00:04:00.288
they get a bank check and with that bank check 
they can have that surgery in the private sector.
