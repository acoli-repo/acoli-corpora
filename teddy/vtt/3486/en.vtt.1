which was the "Plain English Campaign".

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:33.010
I thought it was a fabulous idea, for about 
one day or two,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.749
and I've never thought about it since.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.285
When I came back to Portugal, for good,

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:42.430
I came across with several documents - for example, 
my work contract,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.127
the papers I had to sign to buy a house, 
the electricity bill --

00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:50.528
a series of documents that reminded me of 
that bank statement.

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:54.105
Not because they were equally clear and simple,

00:00:54.105 --> 00:00:56.711
but because they were the exact opposite.

00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:01.505
Because I had to read everything twice or thrice, 
to begin to understand what was written there.
