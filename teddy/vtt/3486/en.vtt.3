literacy is the hability to understand written documents --

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.692
is extremely low. I'm going to show you a chart about Portuguese people's literacy [rate].

00:01:36.692 --> 00:01:40.273
You know that about 10, 11% of people, in Portugal,

00:01:40.273 --> 00:01:43.082
don't know how to read nor write at all, yet.

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:47.297
Over there are those who know, or say they know, 
how to read and write. So, what do we have?

00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:52.657
We have that group of red people in level 1, 
which is the lowest in literacy [rate].

00:01:52.657 --> 00:01:55.981
They are persons who are able to join letters,

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:58.529
but they can't, actually, understand.

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:02.216
For example, if a person, from that red group, 
has to pick up
