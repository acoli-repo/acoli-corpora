00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:01.561
And looking at that, what did I realize?

00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:04.896
I realized we live in an apartheid of information.

00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:10.647
I realized that there's a small minority of people 
who has indeed access to information

00:03:10.647 --> 00:03:16.041
and can use it to their advantage and 
a huge majority that can't.

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:19.847
And because they can't, they are excluded 
and they are impaired.

00:03:19.847 --> 00:03:21.863
Let me give you an example.

00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:27.230
That one is Mr. Domingos, my building's doorkeeper. Mr. Domingos started to read at the age of 27,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.278
so, he falls in that yellow group that 
we have seen a little while ago.
