And you think, "Well, that's normal. 
They are countries that are a bit ahead.

00:09:30.654 --> 00:09:33.115
"Sweden, maybe, much more than the United States.

00:09:33.115 --> 00:09:34.765
"But they are countries that are a bit ahead.

00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:38.314
"It would be nice if in our country there was also 
legislation towards that, wouldn't it be?"

00:09:38.314 --> 00:09:42.862
So it would. And there is! Since 1999.

00:09:42.862 --> 00:09:45.584
The Law of the Administrative Modernization 
says that

00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:48.260
the communication between the State and the people

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.613
should be simple, clear, concise, meaningful, 
without acronyms, bla bla bla...

00:09:53.613 --> 00:09:55.660
But the thing is: it is not applied. So, the question,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.928
the path of going through legislation, 
enforcing through legislation,

00:09:58.928 --> 00:10:02.922
works in those countries where laws 
are made to be applied.
