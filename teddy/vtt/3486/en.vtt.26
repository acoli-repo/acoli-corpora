Einstein said this: "If you can't write about a subject,

00:13:03.353 --> 00:13:06.093
in a simple way, it's because, in fact, 
you don't understand it."

00:13:06.093 --> 00:13:09.637
So, if you... (Applause)

00:13:09.637 --> 00:13:11.547
To Einstein... (Applause)

00:13:11.547 --> 00:13:13.208
To Einstein...(Applause)

00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:15.907
So -- ah, ah, I don't have time! --

00:13:15.907 --> 00:13:20.479
so, if you do know what you want to say -- 
don't you? --

00:13:20.479 --> 00:13:22.645
you are aware of what you want to say,

00:13:22.645 --> 00:13:27.385
you just have to do one thing: believe that it is 
possible to write in a simple way.

00:13:27.385 --> 00:13:29.123
And how do you do that?

00:13:29.123 --> 00:13:33.034
It's very easy. You write to your grandmother. 
Hum?
