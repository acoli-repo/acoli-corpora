it's much more important to reduce 
the complexity of documents

00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:33.719
and simplify the language.

00:08:35.304 --> 00:08:37.305
I'm going to show you an example.

00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:39.306
When I talk about simplifying the language. 
Notice!

00:08:39.306 --> 00:08:43.381
On the left side of a contract:

00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:46.815
"It is agreed that the insurance company, bla bla bla, 
bla bla bla, bla bla..."

00:08:46.815 --> 00:08:51.314
This is a before and after example. What do we mean with simplifying language?

00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:59.119
It's communicating in a simple and clear way, 
enabling our reader to understand it at first glance.

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:03.043
What do you prefer? Before or after?
