00:14:26.303 --> 00:14:30.170
I think it is an area... that comes in handy. 
(Applause)

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.752
And now I'm going to follow Manuel [Forjaz]'s advise. 
If it's time to ask,

00:14:32.752 --> 00:14:35.766
whoever wants to sponsor the 
"Claro" Guide of Justice -- I don't know...

00:14:35.766 --> 00:14:38.834
for example, the EDP Foundation, or...ha? --

00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:41.712
come talk to me later.

00:14:41.712 --> 00:14:46.046
Another thing we will do is to grant prizes 
to the worse and best documents,

00:14:46.046 --> 00:14:49.565
because, indeed, there are people who are working
to communicate in a clearer way,

00:14:49.565 --> 00:14:50.814
and that have to be rewarded,

00:14:50.814 --> 00:14:54.407
and there are lazy people that do nothing 
about it and need to be humiliated.

00:14:54.407 --> 00:14:56.812
So, we'll give prizes to the worst and to the best.

00:14:56.812 --> 00:14:58.553
I'm counting on your help. (Applause)

00:14:58.553 --> 00:15:03.076
