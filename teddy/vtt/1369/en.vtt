Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.073
because, you see, my father's name was Ted,

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:11.087
and much of my life, especially my musical life,

00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:14.208
is really a talk that I'm still having with him,

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:17.956
or the part of me that he continues to be.

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:21.560
Now Ted was a New Yorker, an all-around theater guy,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.875
and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.410
He didn't read a note,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.375
and he was profoundly hearing impaired.
