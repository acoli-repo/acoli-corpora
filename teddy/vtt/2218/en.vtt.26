00:12:59.132 --> 00:13:01.169
but this system
is completely out of whack.

00:13:01.193 --> 00:13:03.062
These numbers that I'm showing you here

00:13:03.086 --> 00:13:07.283
show that in the last 10 years,
466 of the S and P 500 companies

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:11.032
have spent over four trillion
on just buying back their shares.

00:13:11.056 --> 00:13:14.871
And what you see then if you aggregate
this up at the macroeconomic level,

00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:17.441
so if we look at aggregate
business investment,

00:13:17.465 --> 00:13:19.452
which is a percentage of GDP,

00:13:19.476 --> 00:13:23.130
you also see this falling level
of business investment.

00:13:23.154 --> 00:13:24.333
And this is a problem.

00:13:24.357 --> 00:13:28.667
This, by the way, is a huge problem
for skills and job creation.

00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:31.397
You might have heard there's lots
of attention these days
