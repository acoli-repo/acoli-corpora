00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:03.441
But the second point here is that
that equilibrium price, or prices,

00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:05.281
reveal value.

00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:08.390
So the revolution here is a change
from objective to subjective,

00:08:08.414 --> 00:08:12.157
but also the logic is no longer
one of what is value,

00:08:12.181 --> 00:08:13.664
how is it being determined,

00:08:13.688 --> 00:08:16.297
what is the reproductive
potential of the economy,

00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:18.360
which then leads to a theory of price

00:08:18.384 --> 00:08:19.583
but rather the reverse:

00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:21.745
a theory of price and exchange

00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:23.099
which reveals value.

00:08:23.123 --> 00:08:25.146
Now, this is a huge change.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.077
And it's not just an academic exercise,
as fascinating as that might be.

00:08:29.101 --> 00:08:31.014
It affects how we measure growth.
