It affects how we measure growth.

00:08:31.038 --> 00:08:34.849
It affects how we steer economies
to produce more of some activities,

00:08:34.873 --> 00:08:36.041
less of others,

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:38.768
how we also remunerate
some activities more than others.

00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:41.022
And it also just kind of makes you think,

00:08:41.046 --> 00:08:45.032
you know, are you happy to get out of bed
if you're a value creator or not,

00:08:45.056 --> 00:08:48.447
and how is the price system itself
if you aren't determining that?

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.604
I mentioned it affects
how we think about output.

00:08:52.628 --> 00:08:55.356
If we only include, for example, in GDP,

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.107
those activities that have prices,

00:08:57.131 --> 00:08:59.398
all sorts of really weird things happen.
