00:05:28.324 --> 00:05:30.660
could produce 4,800 pins a day,

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:33.696
as opposed to just one
by an unspecialized worker.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.324
And he and his fellow classical economists

00:05:36.348 --> 00:05:39.700
also broke down activities
into productive and unproductive ones.

00:05:39.724 --> 00:05:40.774
(Laughter)

00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:42.519
And the unproductive ones weren't --

00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:45.985
I think you're laughing because
most of you are on that list, aren't you?

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.508
(Laughter)

00:05:47.532 --> 00:05:50.145
Lawyers! I think he was right
about the lawyers.

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.525
Definitely not the professors,
the letters of all kind people.

00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:57.574
So lawyers, professors,
shopkeepers, musicians.

00:05:57.598 --> 00:05:58.979
He obviously hated the opera.

00:05:59.003 --> 00:06:01.692
He must have seen
the worst performance of his life
