00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:01.890
and the CEO of Goldman Sachs said

00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:05.743
Goldman Sachs workers are the most
productive in the world.

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:08.193
Productivity and productiveness,
for an economist,

00:01:08.217 --> 00:01:09.967
actually has a lot to do with value.

00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:11.184
You're producing stuff,

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:13.484
you're producing it
dynamically and efficiently.

00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:16.896
You're also producing things
that the world needs, wants and buys.

00:01:20.197 --> 00:01:23.330

as well as many other banks --

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:25.644
I'm just kind of picking
on Goldman Sachs here --

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:28.616
at the center of the crisis, because
they had actually produced

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.592
some pretty problematic financial products
mainly but not only related to mortgages,
