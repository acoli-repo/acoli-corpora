00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:31.396
to the degree to which the value
that was being generated in the economy

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.586
was in fact being reinvested back in.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.603
And so what we have today is
an ultrafinancialized industrial sector

00:12:37.627 --> 00:12:41.298
where, increasingly, a share
of the profits and the net income

00:12:41.322 --> 00:12:44.182
are not actually going
back into production,

00:12:44.206 --> 00:12:47.805
into human capital training,
into research and development

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:51.714
but just being siphoned out
in terms of buying back your own shares,

00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:54.518
which boosts stock options,
which is, in fact, the way

00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:56.520
that many executives are getting paid.

00:12:56.544 --> 00:12:59.108
And, you know, some
share buybacks is absolutely fine,

00:12:59.132 --> 00:13:01.169
but this system
is completely out of whack.
