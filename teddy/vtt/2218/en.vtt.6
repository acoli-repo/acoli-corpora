00:02:57.878 --> 00:03:00.962
So it's not surprising
that the economists of the time,

00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:02.607
who were called the Physiocrats,

00:03:02.631 --> 00:03:06.005
actually put the center
of their attention to farm labor.

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.319
When they said, "Where
does value come from?"

00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:09.725
they looked at farming.

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:13.244
And they produced what I think was
probably the world's first spreadsheet,

00:03:13.268 --> 00:03:15.104
called the "Tableau Economique,"

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:19.154
and this was done by François Quesnay,
one of the leaders of this movement.

00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:20.547
And it was very interesting,

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:23.580
because they didn't just say,
"Farming is the source of value."

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:26.642
They then really worried about
what was happening to that value

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:27.834
when it was produced.

00:03:27.858 --> 00:03:29.545
What the Tableau Economique does --

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.177
and I've tried to make it
a bit simpler here for you --
