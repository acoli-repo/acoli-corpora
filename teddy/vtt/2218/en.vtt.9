00:04:29.897 --> 00:04:32.228
and this was no longer
the Agricultural Revolution

00:04:32.252 --> 00:04:33.777
but the Industrial Revolution,

00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:35.457
is that the classical economists,

00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:39.332
and these were Adam Smith, David Ricardo,
Karl Marx, the revolutionary,

00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:42.247
also asked the question "What is value?"

00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:45.191
But it's not surprising that
because they were actually living

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:48.377
through an industrial era
with the rise of machines and factories,

00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:50.246
they said it was industrial labor.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.083
So they had a labor theory of value.

00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:55.191
But again, their focus was reproduction,

00:04:55.215 --> 00:04:58.367
this real worry of what was happening
to the value that was created

00:04:58.391 --> 00:04:59.980
if it was getting siphoned out.
