00:03:57.746 --> 00:04:01.574
that if too much of the resources
are going to the landlords,

00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:06.416
you're actually putting the reproduction
potential of the system at risk.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.670
And so all these little arrows there
were their way of simulating --

00:04:09.694 --> 00:04:13.266
again, spreadsheets and simulators,
these guys were really using big data --

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.786
they were simulating what would
actually happen under different scenarios

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.277
if the wealth actually wasn't
reinvested back into production

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.090
to make that land more productive

00:04:22.114 --> 00:04:24.675
and was actually being
siphoned out in different ways,

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.325
or even if the proprietors
were getting too much.

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.897
And what later happened in the 1800s,

00:04:29.897 --> 00:04:32.228
and this was no longer
the Agricultural Revolution
