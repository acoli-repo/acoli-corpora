00:10:27.058 --> 00:10:30.044
in a group called the Systems
of National [Accounts], SNA.

00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:31.857
They called it the "banking problem,"

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:35.251
like, "Oh my God, this thing is huge,
and we're not even including it."

00:10:35.275 --> 00:10:38.442
So instead of stopping and actually
making that Tableau Economique

00:10:38.466 --> 00:10:40.597
or asking some of these
fundamental questions

00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:43.939
that also the classicals were asking
about what is actually happening,

00:10:43.963 --> 00:10:47.532
the division of labor between different
types of activities in the economy,

00:10:47.556 --> 00:10:50.005
they simply gave these
net interest payments a name.

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:53.359
So the commercial banks, they called this
"financial intermediation."

00:10:53.383 --> 00:10:55.281
That went into the NIPA accounts.

00:10:55.305 --> 00:10:58.945
And the investment banks
were called the "risk-taking activities,"

00:10:58.969 --> 00:11:00.120
and that went in.
