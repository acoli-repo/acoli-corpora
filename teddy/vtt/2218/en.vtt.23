And what I mean by that is finance,
insurance and real estate.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.783
In fact, in the UK,

00:11:33.807 --> 00:11:36.904
something like between
10 and 20 percent of finance

00:11:36.928 --> 00:11:39.465
finds its way into

00:11:39.489 --> 00:11:42.157

00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:43.899
into the IT sector,

00:11:43.923 --> 00:11:48.057
but most of it goes back
into that acronym, FIRE:

00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:49.815
finance, insurance and real estate.

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:52.398

00:11:55.986 --> 00:11:59.025
it's not to say that finance
is good or bad,

00:11:59.049 --> 00:12:00.459
but the degree to which,
