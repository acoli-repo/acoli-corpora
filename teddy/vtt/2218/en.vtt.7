00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.177
and I've tried to make it
a bit simpler here for you --

00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:34.619
is it broke down the classes
in society into three.

00:03:34.643 --> 00:03:38.046
The farmers, creating value,
were called the "productive class."

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.810
Then others who were just
moving some of this value around

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:42.560
but it was useful, it was necessary,

00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:43.782
these were the merchants;

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.486
they were called the "proprietors."

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.072
And then there was another class
that was simply charging the farmers a fee

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:51.281
for an existing asset, the land,

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:53.833
and they called them the "sterile class."

00:03:53.857 --> 00:03:57.722
Now, this is a really heavy-hitting word
if you think what it means:

00:03:57.746 --> 00:04:01.574
that if too much of the resources
are going to the landlords,
