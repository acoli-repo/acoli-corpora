And in "The Wealth of Nations,"

00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:05.331
Adam Smith had this really great example
of the pin factory where he said

00:05:05.355 --> 00:05:08.351
if you only have one person
making every bit of the pin,

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:10.923
at most you can make one pin a day.

00:05:10.947 --> 00:05:14.674
But if you actually invest in factory
production and the division of labor,

00:05:14.698 --> 00:05:15.858
new thinking --

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:18.960
today, we would use the word
"organizational innovation" --

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:20.957
then you could increase the productivity

00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:22.947
and the growth and the wealth of nations.

00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:25.430
So he showed that 10 specialized workers

00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:28.300
who had been invested in,
in their human capital,

00:05:28.324 --> 00:05:30.660
could produce 4,800 pins a day,
