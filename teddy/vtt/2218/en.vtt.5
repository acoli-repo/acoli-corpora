It doesn't mean that
they were right or wrong,

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.921
but you couldn't just call yourself
a value creator, a wealth creator.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.966
There was a lot of debate
within the economics profession.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.643
And what I want to argue is,
we've kind of lost our way,

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:43.054
and that has actually allowed this term,
"wealth creation" and "value,"

00:02:43.078 --> 00:02:45.462
to become quite weak and lazy

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:47.308
and also easily captured.

00:02:47.614 --> 00:02:50.164

300 years ago.

00:02:51.564 --> 00:02:53.923
Now, what was interesting 300 years ago

00:02:53.947 --> 00:02:57.854
is the society was still
an agricultural type of society.

00:02:57.878 --> 00:03:00.962
So it's not surprising
that the economists of the time,
