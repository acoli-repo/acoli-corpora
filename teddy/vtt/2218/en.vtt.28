00:13:57.344 --> 00:14:00.134
So in the sector where you have
lots of different actors --

00:14:00.158 --> 00:14:03.723
public, private, of course, but also
third-sector organizations --

00:14:03.747 --> 00:14:04.899
creating value,

00:14:04.923 --> 00:14:07.311
the way we actually measure
value in this sector

00:14:07.335 --> 00:14:09.540
is through the price system itself.

00:14:09.564 --> 00:14:11.077
Prices reveal value.

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:12.432
So when, recently,

00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:16.642
the price of an antibiotic
went up by 400 percent overnight,

00:14:16.666 --> 00:14:18.738
and the CEO was asked,
"How can you do this?

00:14:18.762 --> 00:14:20.560
People actually need that antibiotic.

00:14:20.584 --> 00:14:21.744
That's unfair."

00:14:21.768 --> 00:14:23.825
He said, "Well, we have a moral imperative

00:14:23.849 --> 00:14:26.593
to allow prices to go
what the market will bear,"

00:14:26.617 --> 00:14:29.676
completely dismissing the fact
that in the US, for example,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.012
the National Institutes of Health
spent over 30 billion a year
