00:09:29.464 --> 00:09:31.485
in the financial sector in GDP.

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:34.156
This also, by the way, is something
I'm always surprised

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.717
that many economists don't know.

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:37.242
Up until 1970,

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:40.981
most of the financial sector
was not even included in GDP.

00:09:41.005 --> 00:09:43.502
It was kind of indirectly,
perhaps not knowingly,

00:09:43.526 --> 00:09:46.253
still being seen through the eyes
of the Physiocrats

00:09:46.277 --> 00:09:50.334
as just kind of moving stuff around,
not actually producing anything new.

00:09:50.358 --> 00:09:54.398
So only those activities
that had an explicit price were included.

00:09:54.422 --> 00:09:57.579
For example, if you went to get
a mortgage, you were charged a fee.

00:09:57.603 --> 00:10:00.993
That went into GDP and the national
income and product accounting.
