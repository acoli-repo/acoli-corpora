00:10:03.794 --> 00:10:07.753
the difference between
what banks were earning in interest

00:10:07.777 --> 00:10:11.009
if they gave you a loan and what
they were paying out for a deposit.

00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:12.368
That wasn't being included.

00:10:12.392 --> 00:10:15.601

started to look at some data,

00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:18.356
which started to show
that the size of finance

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.862
and these net interest payments

00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:21.686
were actually growing substantially.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.822
And they called this
the "banking problem."

00:10:23.846 --> 00:10:27.034
These were some people working
inside, actually, the United Nations

00:10:27.058 --> 00:10:30.044
in a group called the Systems
of National [Accounts], SNA.
