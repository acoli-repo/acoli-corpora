00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:02.658
Value creation.

00:00:02.682 --> 00:00:03.983
Wealth creation.

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:05.641
These are really powerful words.

00:00:05.665 --> 00:00:08.356

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.439

00:00:12.463 --> 00:00:16.399
If we use that word, we must be implying

The couch potatoes?

00:00:18.863 --> 00:00:20.741

00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:30.383
And I'm here as an economist
to break it to you
