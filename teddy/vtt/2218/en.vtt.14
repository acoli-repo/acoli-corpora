00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.122
and this, by the way, is not often
taught in economics classes --

00:07:02.146 --> 00:07:05.080
the big revolution that happened
with the current system

00:07:05.104 --> 00:07:06.746
of economic thinking that we have,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.348
which is called "neoclassical economics,"

00:07:09.372 --> 00:07:11.898
was that the logic completely changed.

00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:13.231
It changed in two ways.

00:07:13.255 --> 00:07:17.684
It changed from this focus on
objective conditions to subjective ones.

00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:19.449
Let me explain what I mean by that.

00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:21.653
Objective, in the way I just said.

00:07:21.677 --> 00:07:24.308
Subjective, in the sense that
all the attention went to

00:07:24.332 --> 00:07:27.487
how individuals of different sorts
make their decisions.

00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:31.868
OK, so workers are maximizing
their choices of leisure versus work.
