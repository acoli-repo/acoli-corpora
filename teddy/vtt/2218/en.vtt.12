00:05:59.003 --> 00:06:01.692
He must have seen
the worst performance of his life

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:03.386
the night before writing this book.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.427
There's at least
three professions up there

00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:06.952
that have to do with the opera.

00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:09.949
But this wasn't an exercise
of saying, "Don't do these things."

00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:11.699
It was just, "What's going to happen

00:06:11.723 --> 00:06:15.321
if we actually end up allowing
some parts of the economy to get too large

00:06:15.345 --> 00:06:18.250
without really thinking about
how to increase the productivity

00:06:18.274 --> 00:06:21.572
of the source of the value
that they thought was key,

00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:23.437
which was industrial labor.

00:06:23.461 --> 00:06:26.571
And again, don't ask yourself
is this right or is this wrong,

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:27.914
it was just very contested.

00:06:27.938 --> 00:06:29.406
By making these lists,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.799
it actually forced them also
to ask interesting questions.
