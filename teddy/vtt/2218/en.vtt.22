00:10:58.969 --> 00:11:00.120
and that went in.

00:11:00.144 --> 00:11:02.149
In case I haven't explained this properly,

00:11:02.173 --> 00:11:04.142
that red line is showing how much quicker

00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:06.935
financial intermediation
as a whole was growing

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:10.152
compared to the rest of the economy,
the blue line, industry.

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:12.749
And so this was quite extraordinary,

00:11:12.749 --> 00:11:15.331
because what actually happened,
and what we know today,

00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:17.597
and there's different people
writing about this,

00:11:17.597 --> 00:11:19.768
this data here
is from the Bank of England,

00:11:19.768 --> 00:11:22.052
is that lots of what finance
was actually doing

00:11:22.052 --> 00:11:23.987
from the 1970s and '80s on

00:11:24.194 --> 00:11:26.724
was basically financing itself:

00:11:26.748 --> 00:11:28.601
finance financing finance.

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:32.156
And what I mean by that is finance,
insurance and real estate.
