We didn't hear the taxpayers bragging
that they were value creators,

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.411
but obviously, having bailed out

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:07.052
one of the biggest value-creating
productive companies,

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:08.341
perhaps they should have.

00:02:08.365 --> 00:02:11.488
What I want to do next
is kind of ask ourselves

00:02:11.512 --> 00:02:13.303
how we lost our way,

00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:14.686
how it could be, actually,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.224
that a statement like that
could almost go unnoticed,

00:02:17.248 --> 00:02:20.668
because it wasn't an after-dinner joke;
it was said very seriously.

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:25.698
So what I want to do is bring you back
300 years in economic thinking,

00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:28.376
when, actually, the term was contested.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.555
It doesn't mean that
they were right or wrong,
