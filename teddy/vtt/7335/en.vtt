00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:04.726
You can ask anyone you want,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.434
and they will tell you

00:00:06.458 --> 00:00:11.042
that they are sick and tired
of fighting for justice.

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:18.518
People of color and members
of the LGBT community are tired

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:21.518
of carrying the burden of speaking up

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:23.226
and stepping up

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.476
even when they're being silenced

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.643
and pushed back down.

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:29.476
And white allies

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.042
and cis allies are tired, too.
