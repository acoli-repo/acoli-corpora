00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:02.739
I have spent the last years

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:05.398
trying to resolve two enigmas:

00:00:05.398 --> 00:00:09.759
Why is productivity so disappointing

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.641
in all the companies where I work?

00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:15.335
I have worked with more than 500 companies.

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:17.780
Despite all the technological advances --

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.072
computers, I.T., communications, telecommunications,

00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:23.433
the Internet.

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:24.831
Enigma number two:

00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:27.863
Why is there so little engagement at work?

00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:29.967
Why do people feel so miserable,

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:33.617
even actively disengaged?
