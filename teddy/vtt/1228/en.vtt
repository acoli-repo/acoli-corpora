00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Good morning everybody.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The first thing is water.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now I see you've all been enjoying the water

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that's been provided for you here at the conference,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
over the past couple of days.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But what if it wasn't?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What if it was from a source like this?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Then statistics would actually say

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that half of you would now be suffering

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with diarrhea.
