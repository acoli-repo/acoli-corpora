00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because of a lack of donor organs.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The transplant community

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
has actively campaigned in organ donation.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And the gift of life

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
has been extended

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
from brain-dead donors

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to living, related donors --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
relatives who might donate an organ

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
or a part of an organ,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
like a split liver graft,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to a relative or loved one.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the gift of life was then extended

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
from living, related donors
