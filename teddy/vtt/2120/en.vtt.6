00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
an employee?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Where and how can we draw the line?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
In my part of the world,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
too many people live below the poverty line.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And in some areas,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
the commercial gifting of an organ

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
in exchange for monetary reward

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
has led to a flourishing trade

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
in living, unrelated donors.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I received my next assignment,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and that was to go to the prisons
