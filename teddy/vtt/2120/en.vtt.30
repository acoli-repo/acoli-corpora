00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
repair rather than replacement.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Stem cell therapies

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
may one day reduce the need for donor organs.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Powerful new technologies

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
always present enigmas.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
As we speak,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
is currently underway

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
following the USFDA approval.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And in the U.K.,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
neural stem cells to treat stroke

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
are being investigated in a phase one trial.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
The research success that we celebrate today
