00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
are racing

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
to convert aging adult cells --

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
aging adult cells from you and me --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
they are racing to reprogram these cells

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
back into more useful IPS cells.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And in our lab,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
we are focused on taking fat

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and reprogramming

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
mounds of fat

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
into fountains of youthful cells --

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
cells that we may use

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
to then form other,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
more specialized, cells,
