WEBVTT

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
releases stem cells

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
into our circulation.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And these stem cells

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
then float in the bloodstream

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and hone in to damaged organs

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
to release growth factors

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
to repair the damaged tissue.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Stem cells may be used as building blocks

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
to repair damaged scaffolds within our body,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
or to provide new liver cells

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
to repair damaged liver.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
As we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trials

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
researching the use of stem cells
