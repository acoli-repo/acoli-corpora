00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And I focused my research on stem cells

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
as a possible source

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
for cell transplants.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Today we realize

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
that there are many different types of stem cells.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Embryonic stem cells

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
have occupied center stage,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
chiefly because of their pluripotency --

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
that is their ease in differentiating

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
into a variety of different cell types.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But the moral controversy

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
surrounding embryonic stem cells --
