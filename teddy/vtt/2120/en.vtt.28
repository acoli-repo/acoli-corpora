00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
researching the use of stem cells

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
for liver diseases.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
What lies ahead?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Heart disease

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
is the leading cause of death worldwide.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
1.1 million Americans

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
suffer heart attacks yearly.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
4.8 million

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
suffer cardiac failure.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Stem cells may be used

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
to deliver growth factors

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
to repair damaged heart muscle

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
or be differentiated

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
into heart muscle cells

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
to restore heart function.
