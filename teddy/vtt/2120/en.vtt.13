00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
from whole organs to cells.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
In 1988, at the University of Minnesota,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I participated in a small series

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
of whole organ pancreas transplants.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I witnessed the technical difficulty.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And this inspired in my mind

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
a shift from transplanting whole organs

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to perhaps transplanting cells.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I thought to myself,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
why not take the individual cells

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
out of the pancreas --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes --
