00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
to restore heart function.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
There are 170 clinical trials

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
While still in a research phase,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
stem cells may one day herald

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
a quantum leap in the field of cardiology.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings --

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
small, incremental steps,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
cells rather than organs,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
repair rather than replacement.
