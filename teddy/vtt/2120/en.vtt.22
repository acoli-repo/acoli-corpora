00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
more specialized, cells,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
which one day may be used as cell transplants.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
If this research is successful,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
it may then reduce the need

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
to research and sacrifice

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
human embryos.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that the promise of stem cells

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
will one day provide cures

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
for a whole range of conditions.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Heart disease, stroke, diabetes,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy,
