00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So I was privileged to train in transplantation

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
under two great surgical pioneers:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Thomas Starzl,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
who performed the world's first successful liver transplant

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in 1967,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and Sir Roy Calne,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the following year.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I returned to Singapore

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and, in 1990,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
performed Asia's first successful

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
cadaveric liver transplant procedure,
