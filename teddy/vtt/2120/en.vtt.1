00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
cadaveric liver transplant procedure,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but against all odds.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now when I look back,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the transplant was actually the easiest part.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Next, raising the money to fund the procedure.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But perhaps the most challenging part

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
was to convince the regulators --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
a matter which was debated in the parliament --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that a young female surgeon

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
be allowed the opportunity

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to pioneer for her country.
