from living, related donors

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to now living, unrelated donors.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And this then has given rise

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to unprecedented and unexpected

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
moral controversy.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
How can one distinguish

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
a donation that is voluntary and altruistic

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
from one that is forced or coerced

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
from, for example,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
a submissive spouse, an in-law,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
a servant, a slave,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
an employee?
