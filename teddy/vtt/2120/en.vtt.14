00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes --

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and transplant these cells? --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
technically a much simpler procedure

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
than having to grapple with the complexities

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
of transplanting a whole organ.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And at that time,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
stem cell research

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
had gained momentum,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
following the isolation of the world's first

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
human embryonic stem cells

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
in the 1990s.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The observation that stem cells, as master cells,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
could give rise
