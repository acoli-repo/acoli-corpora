00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
nowadays available in abundant supply --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
you and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Fat-derived stem cells

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
are adult stem cells.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And adult stem cells

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
are found in you and me --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
in our blood, in our bone marrow,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in our fat, our skin and other organs.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And as it turns out,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
fat is one of the best sources

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
of adult stem cells.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But adult stem cells

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
are not embryonic stem cells.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And here is the limitation:
