00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The observation that stem cells, as master cells,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
could give rise

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to a whole variety of different cell types --

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
heart cells, liver cells,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
pancreatic islet cells --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
captured the attention of the media

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and the imagination of the public.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I too was fascinated

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
by this new and disruptive cell technology,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and this inspired a shift in my mindset,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
from transplanting whole organs

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
to transplanting cells.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And I focused my research on stem cells

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
as a possible source
