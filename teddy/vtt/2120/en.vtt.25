00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
This experience

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
taught me to empathize more with my patients,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and especially those with retinal diseases.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
37 million people worldwide

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
are blind,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and 127 million more

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
suffer from impaired vision.

Stem cell-derived retinal transplants,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
now in a research phase,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
may one day restore vision,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
or part vision,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide.
