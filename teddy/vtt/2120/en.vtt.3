00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The truth is,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
there are just simply not enough donor organs

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to go around.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
As the demand for donor organs

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
continues to rise,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in large part due to the aging population,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the supply has remained relatively constant.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In the United States alone,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
100,000 men, women and children

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
are on the waiting list for donor organs,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and more than a dozen die each day

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because of a lack of donor organs.
