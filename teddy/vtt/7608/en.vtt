Ten years ago,

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.897
I got a phone call that
changed my life.

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:10.849
At the time, I was 
cardiologist at UCLA,

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.286
specializing in cardiac 
imaging techniques.

00:00:14.286 --> 00:00:19.815
The call came from a veterinarian
at the Los Angeles Zoo.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:22.469
An elderly female chimpanzee

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:25.292
had woken up with a facial droop

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.628
and the veterinarians were worried
that she'd had a stroke.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.653
They asked if I'd 
come to the zoo
