00:06:28.548 --> 00:06:34.036
we were not fundamentally changing
the functions of the earth system.

00:06:35.072 --> 00:06:39.063
The global commons
had still enough capacity

00:06:39.087 --> 00:06:41.595
to take the punches we gave them.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.555
In fact, the fish were still plentiful,

00:06:47.325 --> 00:06:51.055
the fields for grazing were still vast.

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:55.397
Our mistake was to assume

00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:58.620
that the capacity
of the earth for self-repair

00:06:58.644 --> 00:06:59.952
had no limits.
