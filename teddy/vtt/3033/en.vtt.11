00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:35.045
I had worked for public finance
in my home country and around the world.

00:05:36.616 --> 00:05:39.450
I can tell you one thing for sure:

00:05:39.474 --> 00:05:41.815
during these 30 years,

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.888
the notion of the global commons
never crossed my mind.

00:05:46.657 --> 00:05:50.722
I didn't have a single conversation
about the global commons

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:52.004
with my colleagues.

00:05:53.244 --> 00:05:57.118
This tells me that the notion
of the global commons

00:05:57.142 --> 00:06:01.074
was not really entering
into the big money decisions
