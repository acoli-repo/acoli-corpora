This deforestation drives extinction.

00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:11.741

than the natural rate.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.923
And on top of all of that bad news,

00:10:17.947 --> 00:10:22.127
one third of food produced today globally

00:10:22.151 --> 00:10:23.341
is not eaten.

00:10:23.768 --> 00:10:25.485
