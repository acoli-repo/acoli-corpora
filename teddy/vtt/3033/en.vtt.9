00:04:39.165 --> 00:04:44.007
We broadly remained
within safe operating space,

00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:46.235
marked by the green line.

00:04:48.196 --> 00:04:50.394
But look at where we are now.

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:57.170
We have crossed four of those boundaries,

00:04:57.194 --> 00:04:59.948
and we will be crossing others
in the future.
