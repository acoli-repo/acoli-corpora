00:11:26.168 --> 00:11:30.304
In Sumatra, I met smallholder farmers

00:11:30.328 --> 00:11:34.946
who need to make a day-to-day living
from growing oil palm.

00:11:35.803 --> 00:11:38.652
I met global food companies,

00:11:38.676 --> 00:11:40.527
financial institutions

00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:42.606
and local government officials.

00:11:44.035 --> 00:11:49.846
All of them told me that they can't
make the change by themselves,

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:55.339
and only by working together
under a kind of new contract,

00:11:55.363 --> 00:11:56.926
or a new practice,

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.418
do they have a chance
to protect tropical forests.
