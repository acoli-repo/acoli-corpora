This is how communities in Asia
managed water,

00:01:34.954 --> 00:01:40.525
and this is how indigenous peoples
in the Amazon managed wildlife.

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:47.913
These communities realized
they relied on a finite, shared resource.

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:55.402
They developed rules and practices
on how to manage those resources,

00:01:55.426 --> 00:01:57.855
and they changed their behavior

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:04.426
so that they could continue
to rely on those shared resources tomorrow
