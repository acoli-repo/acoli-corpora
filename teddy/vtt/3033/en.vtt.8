that reminds us how vital
the global commons are.

00:04:02.536 --> 00:04:07.533
In 2009, a group of scientists proposed

00:04:07.557 --> 00:04:10.818
how to assess the health
of the global commons.

00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:17.798
They defined nine planetary boundaries
vital to our survival,

00:04:17.822 --> 00:04:21.275
then they measured how far we could go

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.879
before we cross over
the tipping points or thresholds

00:04:25.903 --> 00:04:31.164
that would lead us to the irreversible
or even catastrophic change.
