00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.461
How did we end up in this situation?

00:05:05.957 --> 00:05:09.258
Well, my personal story
may tell us something.

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:13.317
Five years ago, I was appointed

00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:17.985
as CEO of the GEF,
Global Environment Facility,

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.748
but I am not a conservationist

00:05:21.772 --> 00:05:24.437
or an environmental activist.

00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:27.188
I am an economist,

00:05:27.212 --> 00:05:29.561
and for the last 30 years,

00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:35.045
I had worked for public finance
in my home country and around the world.
