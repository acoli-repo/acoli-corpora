00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.700
Third, we need to change
our production-consumption system.

00:09:01.376 --> 00:09:07.725
We need to break away from current
take-make-waste consumption patterns.

00:09:08.686 --> 00:09:13.524
And finally, we need
to change our food system,

00:09:13.548 --> 00:09:16.114
what to eat and how to produce it.

00:09:16.644 --> 00:09:19.486
And all of those four systems

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:23.708
are putting enormous pressure
on the global commons,

00:09:23.732 --> 00:09:26.422
and it's also very difficult to flip them.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.918
They are extremely complex,

00:09:28.942 --> 00:09:31.610
with many decision-makers,
actors involved.
