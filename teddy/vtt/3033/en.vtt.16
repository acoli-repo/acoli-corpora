00:07:57.393 --> 00:08:01.291
Then we need to build
the stewardship of the global commons

00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:03.394
into all of our thinking,

00:08:03.418 --> 00:08:05.537
our business, our economy,

00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:07.077
our policy-making --

00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:08.838
in all of our actions.

00:08:09.567 --> 00:08:14.991
We need to recreate the social contract
of the fishing villages

00:08:15.015 --> 00:08:17.135
on the global scale.

00:08:19.539 --> 00:08:21.822
But what does it mean in practice?

00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:24.203
Where to start with?

00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:29.430
I see there are four key economic systems

00:08:29.454 --> 00:08:31.557
that fundamentally need to change.
