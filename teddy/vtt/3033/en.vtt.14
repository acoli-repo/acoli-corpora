The message from
the science is very clear:

00:07:07.213 --> 00:07:10.443
we humans have become
an overwhelming force

00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:14.634
to determine the future
living conditions on earth,

00:07:14.658 --> 00:07:17.959
and what's more,
we are running out of time.

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:22.656
If we don't act on them,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.038
we will be losing the global commons.

00:07:25.062 --> 00:07:28.720
It's only our generation
who are able to preserve it --

00:07:28.744 --> 00:07:30.847
preserve the commons as we know them.
