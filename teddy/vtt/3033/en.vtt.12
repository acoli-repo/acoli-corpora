00:05:57.142 --> 00:06:01.074
was not really entering
into the big money decisions

00:06:01.098 --> 00:06:04.383
like state budgets or investment plans.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.914
And I'm wondering,
why do we have this sheer ignorance

00:06:09.938 --> 00:06:11.858
about the global commons,

00:06:11.882 --> 00:06:13.961
including me, myself?

00:06:15.835 --> 00:06:19.676
One possible explanation might be

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.840
that until recently,
it didn't really matter too much.

00:06:24.394 --> 00:06:28.524
Even if we mess up
some part of the environment,

00:06:28.548 --> 00:06:34.036
we were not fundamentally changing
the functions of the earth system.
