00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:05.356
So our oceans, forests,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.314
once very close to us
as our local commons,

00:03:09.338 --> 00:03:12.210
moved very far away from us.

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:19.434
So today, we pump millions of tons
of greenhouse gases into the air,

00:03:21.098 --> 00:03:26.383
we dump plastics, fertilizers
and industrial waste

00:03:26.407 --> 00:03:28.890
into the rivers and oceans,

00:03:28.914 --> 00:03:32.351
and we cut down forests that absorb CO2.
