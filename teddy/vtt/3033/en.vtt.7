and we cut down forests that absorb CO2.

00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:37.629
We make the wild biodiversity
much more fragile.

00:03:39.163 --> 00:03:41.839
We seem to have totally forgotten

00:03:41.863 --> 00:03:46.465
that there is such a thing
as global commons:

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.749
air, water, forests and biodiversity.

00:03:53.664 --> 00:03:56.829
Now, it is modern science

00:03:56.853 --> 00:04:01.140
that reminds us how vital
the global commons are.
