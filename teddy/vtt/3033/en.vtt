Good evening, everyone.

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:06.098
I am from Japan,

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:11.550
so I'd like to start with a story
about Japanese fishing villages.

00:00:12.671 --> 00:00:19.075
In the past, every fisherman was tempted
to catch as many as fish as possible,

00:00:20.027 --> 00:00:23.431
but if everybody did that,

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:28.724
the fish, common shared resource
in the community, would disappear.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.601
The result would be hardship
and poverty for everyone.
