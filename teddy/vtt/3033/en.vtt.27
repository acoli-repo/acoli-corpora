00:13:30.546 --> 00:13:32.871
We breathe the same air,

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.887
we drink the same water,

00:13:34.911 --> 00:13:39.752
we depend on the same oceans,
forests, and biodiversity.

00:13:40.974 --> 00:13:44.379
There is no space
left on earth for egoism.

00:13:45.144 --> 00:13:50.659
The global commons must be kept
within their safe operating space,

00:13:50.683 --> 00:13:54.889
and we can only do it together.

00:13:56.071 --> 00:13:57.317
Thank you so much.

00:13:57.341 --> 00:14:00.920
