00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:03.497
of the fish they caught over 100 years ago.

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.666
Fishermen took paper, ink, and brushes

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.043
out to sea with them.

00:01:07.043 --> 00:01:10.297
They told stories of great adventures at sea.

00:01:10.297 --> 00:01:12.464
Since the Japanese revered certain fish,

00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:14.544
the fishermen would take a rubbing from these fish

00:01:14.544 --> 00:01:17.213
and release them.

00:01:17.213 --> 00:01:18.070
To make the rubbing,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.677
they would paint the fish with non-toxic sumi-e ink

00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:22.766
and print them on rice paper.

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.509
This way they could be released

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.857
or cleaned and sold at market.

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:29.500
The first prints like this were for records only

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.271
with no extra details.
