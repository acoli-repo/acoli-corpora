00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:31.279
long before photography could capture the moment,

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.461
Japanese fishermen invented their own way

00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:35.428
to record trophy catches.

00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:38.149
They called it Gyotaku.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.932
Gyotaku is the ancient art of printing fish

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:42.559
that originated in Japan

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.312
as a way to record trophy catches

00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:46.702
prior to the modern day camera.

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:49.959
Gyo means fish

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:52.151
and taku means impression.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.044
There are several different stories about

00:00:54.044 --> 00:00:55.823
how Gyotaku came about,

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:57.357
but it basically started with fishermen

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.827
needing a way to record the species and size

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:03.497
of the fish they caught over 100 years ago.
