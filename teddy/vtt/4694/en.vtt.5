00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.480
and pins them down on the board to dry.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.864
They then clean the fish with water.

00:02:33.864 --> 00:02:35.348
When it comes time to print,

00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:37.316
there are two different methods.

00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:40.603
The indirect method begins with pasting moist fabric or paper

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:43.106
onto the fish using rice paste.

00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:45.243
Then, the artist uses a tompo,

00:02:45.243 --> 00:02:46.905
or a cotton ball covered in silk,

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:50.532
to put ink on the fabric or paper to produce the print.

00:02:50.532 --> 00:02:52.117
This method requires more skill

00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:53.841
and great care needs to be taken

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.610
when pulling the paper off the fish

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.623
so the paper doesn't tear.

00:02:58.623 --> 00:02:59.591
In the direct method,

00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:01.674
the artist paints directly on the fish,
