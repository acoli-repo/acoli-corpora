Many prints hung in the palace during the Edo period.

00:02:01.484 --> 00:02:04.108
After this period, Gyotaku was not as popular

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:06.653
and began to fade away.

00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:09.113
Today, Gyotaku has become a popular art form,

00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:10.407
enjoyed by many.

00:02:10.407 --> 00:02:13.076
And the prints are said to bring good luck to the fishermen.

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:15.844
But the art form is quite different than it used to be.

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:19.387
Most artists today learn on their own by trial and error.

00:02:19.387 --> 00:02:21.376
Before the artist begins to print,

00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:23.848
the fish needs to be prepared for printing.

00:02:23.848 --> 00:02:25.849
First, the artist places the fish

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.517
on a hollowed out surface.

00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:29.420
Then the artist spreads the fins out

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.480
and pins them down on the board to dry.
