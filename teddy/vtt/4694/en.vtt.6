00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:01.674
the artist paints directly on the fish,

00:03:01.674 --> 00:03:05.589
and then gently presses the moist fabric or paper into the fish.

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:06.926
With both of these methods,

00:03:06.926 --> 00:03:08.833
no two prints are exactly alike,

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:11.922
but both reveal dramatic images of the fish.

00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:13.055
For the final touch,

00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:15.223
the artist uses a chop, or a stamp,

00:03:15.223 --> 00:03:16.903
and signs their work,

00:03:16.903 --> 00:03:18.226
and can hold it up to say,

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:21.119
"The fish was exactly this big!"
