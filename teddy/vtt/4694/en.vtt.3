with no extra details.

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:33.113
It wasn't until the mid 1800's

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:34.908
that they began painting eye details

00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:37.498
and other embellishments onto the prints.

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:40.911
One famous nobleman, Lord Sakai, was an avid fisherman,

00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:42.330
and, when he made a large catch,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.032
he wanted to preserve the memory

00:01:44.032 --> 00:01:46.322
of the large, red sea bream.

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:50.212
To do so, he commissioned a fisherman to print his catch.

00:01:50.212 --> 00:01:52.307
After this, many fisherman would bring

00:01:52.307 --> 00:01:54.598
their Gyotaku prints to Lord Sakai,

00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:55.794
and if he liked their work,

00:01:55.794 --> 00:01:57.685
he would hire them to print for him.

00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:01.484
Many prints hung in the palace during the Edo period.
