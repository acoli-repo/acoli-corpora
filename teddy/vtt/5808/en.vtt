00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.944
Concrete is all around us,

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:05.786
but most of us don't even
notice that it's there.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.856
We use concrete to build our roads,
buildings, bridges, airports;

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.063
it's everywhere.

00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:14.126
The only resource we use
more than concrete is water.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.646
And with population
growth and urbanization,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.733
we're going to need
concrete more than ever.

00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:20.176
But there's a problem.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.686
Cement's the glue
that holds concrete together.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.188
And to make cement,

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:30.606
you burn limestone with other ingredients
in a kiln at very high temperatures.
