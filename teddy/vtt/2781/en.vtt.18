00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.736
And I also realized
that my silence, our silence,

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.080
allows abuse like this to continue.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.496
So I decided that I wanted to put
my childhood superpower to some use

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.216
by trying to make people on the different
sides of these issues understand

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.360
what it's like to be a young person stuck
between your family and your country.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.480
So I started making films,
and I started telling these stories.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.296
And I also wanted people to understand
the deadly consequences of us

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.400
not taking these problems seriously.
