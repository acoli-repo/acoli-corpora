In exchange he gave me
a crappy little Casio keyboard and --

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.256
(Laughter)

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.296
Yeah. And singing lessons.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.096
And he forced me, basically, to practice
for hours and hours every single day.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.376
Very quickly, he also had me performing
for larger and larger audiences,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.176
and bizarrely, I became
almost a kind of poster child

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.280
for Norwegian multiculturalism.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.496
I felt very proud, of course.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.856
Because even the newspapers at this point

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.456
were starting to write
nice things about brown people,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.640
so I could feel
that my superpower was growing.
