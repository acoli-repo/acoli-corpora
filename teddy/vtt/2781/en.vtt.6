even as it was mixing with my tears.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.696
I remember looking around,
hoping that any minute now,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.376
a grown-up is going to come
and make this guy stop.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.720
But instead, people kept hurrying past me
and pretended not to see me.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.760
I was very confused
because I was thinking, well,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.936
"My white people, come on!
Where are they? What's going on?

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.080
How come they're not
coming and rescuing me?"

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.016
So, needless to say,
I didn't buy the sweets.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.160
I just ran home as fast as I could.
