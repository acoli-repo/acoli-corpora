And surely people who look like me,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.736
young women who come
from backgrounds like me,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.856
should be subject to the same rights,
the same protections

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.880
as anybody else in our country, why not?

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.096

Muslim kids in Europe

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.080
are drawn to extremism and violence.
