within their families
and within their families' communities,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.520
but they're also meeting misunderstandings

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.160
and apathy in the countries
that they grow up in.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.336
When their own families betray them,
they look to the rest of us,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.416
and when we don't understand,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.640
we lose them.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.296
So while I was making this film,
several people said to me,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.856
"Well, Deeyah, you know,
this is just their culture,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.071
this is just what those people
do to their kids

00:11:29.095 --> 00:11:30.655
and we can't really interfere."
