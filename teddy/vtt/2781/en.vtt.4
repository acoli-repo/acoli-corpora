00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.936
So when I was 12 years old,
walking home from school,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.176
I took a little detour

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.735
because I wanted to buy
my favorite sweets called "salty feet."

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.520
I know they sound kind of awful,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.136
but I absolutely love them.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.600
They're basically these little
salty licorice bits in the shape of feet.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.360
And now that I say it out loud,
I realize how terrible that sounds,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.776
but be that as it may,
I absolutely love them.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.896
So on my way into the store,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.456
there was this grown white guy
in the doorway blocking my way.
