00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:00.889
My brown people now starting
to treat me like this -- how come?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.656
Instead of bridging the worlds,
the two worlds,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.680
I felt like I was falling
between my two worlds.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.600
I suppose, for me, spit was kryptonite.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.576
So by the time I was 17 years old,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.616
the death threats were endless,
and the harassment was constant.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.402
It got so bad, at one point
my mother sat me down and said,

00:05:20.426 --> 00:05:23.896
"Look, we can no longer protect you,
we can no longer keep you safe,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.696
so you're going to have to go."

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.120
So I bought a one-way ticket to London,
I packed my suitcase and I left.
