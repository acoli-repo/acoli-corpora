00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.376
So I kind of got lost.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.936
I kind of fell apart.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.296
But I decided that what I wanted to do

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.656
is spend the next
however many years of my life

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.336
supporting young people

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.256
and to try to be there in some small way,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.976
whatever way that I could.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.256
I started volunteering
for various organizations

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.920
that were working
with young Muslims inside of Europe.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.096
And, to my surprise, what I found was

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.600
so many of these young people
were suffering and struggling.
