00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.096
And of course, I could understand

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.536
and relate to the feelings
of white people.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.400
The white Norwegians of my country.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.056
You know, white, brown, whatever --

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.896
I loved them all.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.176
I understood them all,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.536
even if they didn't always
understand each other;

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.800
they were all my people.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.536
My father, though,
was always really worried.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.896
He kept saying that
even with the best education,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.096
I was not going to get a fair shake.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.536
I would still face discrimination,
according to him.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.376
And that the only way
to be accepted by white people
