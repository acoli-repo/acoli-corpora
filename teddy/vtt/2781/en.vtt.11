00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.120
So I bought a one-way ticket to London,
I packed my suitcase and I left.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.856
My biggest heartbreak at that point
was that nobody said anything.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.240
I had a very public exit from Norway.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.656
My brown people, my white people --
nobody said anything.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.800
Nobody said, "Hold on, this is wrong.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.656
Support this girl, protect this girl,
because she is one of us."

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.296
Nobody said that.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.360
Instead, I felt like --
you know at the airport,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.976
on the baggage carousel
you have these different suitcases

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.256
going around and around,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.776
and there's always
that one suitcase left at the end,
