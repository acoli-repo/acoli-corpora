Coronaviruses are zoonotic,

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.218
which means that they transmit
from animals to people.

00:03:37.242 --> 00:03:41.872
Some coronaviruses, like COVID-19,
also transmit person to person.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.956
The person-to-person ones
travel faster and travel farther,

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.605
just like COVID-19.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.415
Zoonotic illnesses
are really hard to get rid of,

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.690
because they have an animal reservoir.

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:57.251
One example is avian influenza,

00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:02.376
where we can abolish it
in farmed animals, in turkeys, in ducks,
