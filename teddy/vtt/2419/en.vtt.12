00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:05.076
But the fact is, it's really hard
to get a good quarantine in place.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.176
It's really hard
to set up travel restrictions.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.848
Even the countries that have made
serious investments in public health,

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:13.568
like the US and South Korea,

00:06:13.592 --> 00:06:16.281
can't get that kind of restriction
in place fast enough

00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:18.588
to actually stop an outbreak instantly.

00:06:19.123 --> 00:06:22.643
There's logistical reasons for that,
and there's medical reasons.

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:25.502
If you look at COVID-19 right now,

00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:29.550
it seems like it could have a period
where you're infected and show no symptoms

00:06:29.574 --> 00:06:31.668
that's as long as 24 days.
