00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:01.714
that go from stuff like
a dry cough and a fever

00:03:01.738 --> 00:03:05.386
all the way out to fatal viral pneumonia.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.699
And that range of symptoms
is one of the reasons

00:03:08.723 --> 00:03:12.070
it's actually been so hard
to track this outbreak.

00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:17.190
Plenty of people get
COVID-19 but so gently,

00:03:17.214 --> 00:03:21.173
their symptoms are so mild, they don't
even go to a health care provider.

00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:23.095
They don't register in the system.

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.879
Children, in particular, have it
very easy with COVID-19,

00:03:26.903 --> 00:03:29.300
which is something
we should all be grateful for.
