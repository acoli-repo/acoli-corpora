I want to lead here by talking
a little bit about my credentials

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.230
to bring this up with you,

00:00:06.254 --> 00:00:08.471
because, quite honestly,

00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:12.963
you really, really should not listen
to any old person with an opinion

00:00:12.987 --> 00:00:14.578
about COVID-19.

00:00:24.822 --> 00:00:28.700
and what happens when health systems
experience severe shocks.

00:00:28.724 --> 00:00:31.193
I've also worked
in global health journalism;
