00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:32.428
If you remember SARS,
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:33.623
or MERS,

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:35.575
Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome,

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.638
those were coronaviruses.

00:02:37.662 --> 00:02:40.779
And they're both called
respiratory syndromes,

00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:43.692
because that's what coronaviruses do --

00:02:43.716 --> 00:02:45.514
they go for your lungs.

00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:48.882
They don't make you puke, they don't
make you bleed from the eyeballs,

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:50.390
they don't make you hemorrhage.

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:51.698
They head for your lungs.

00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:54.694
COVID-19 is no different.

00:02:55.193 --> 00:02:58.517
It causes a range of respiratory symptoms

00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:01.714
that go from stuff like
a dry cough and a fever
