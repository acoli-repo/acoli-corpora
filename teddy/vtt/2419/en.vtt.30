00:14:57.117 --> 00:15:02.405
panic, xenophobia,
agoraphobia, authoritarianism,

00:15:02.429 --> 00:15:07.243
oversimplified lies that make us think
that hate and fury and loneliness

00:15:07.267 --> 00:15:09.420
are the solution to outbreaks.

00:15:09.444 --> 00:15:10.658
But they're not.

00:15:10.682 --> 00:15:12.784
They just make us less prepared.

00:15:13.356 --> 00:15:17.566
There's also a boring
but useful set of options

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.302
that we can use in response to outbreaks,

00:15:20.326 --> 00:15:23.724
things like improving health care
here and everywhere;

00:15:23.748 --> 00:15:26.943
investing in health infrastructure
and disease surveillance

00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:29.302
so that we know
when the new diseases come;

00:15:29.326 --> 00:15:32.268
building health systems
all over the world;
