00:06:54.727 --> 00:07:00.695
We saw in the Ebola outbreak that as soon
as you put a quarantine in place,

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:03.126
people start trying to evade it.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.202
Individual patients, if they know
there's a strict quarantine protocol,

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:09.354
may not go for health care,

00:07:09.378 --> 00:07:12.823
because they're afraid of the medical
system or they can't afford care

00:07:12.847 --> 00:07:16.134
and they don't want to be separated
from their family and friends.

00:07:16.158 --> 00:07:18.074
Politicians, government officials,

00:07:18.098 --> 00:07:20.561
when they know that they're
going to get quarantined

00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:22.448
if they talk about outbreaks and cases,

00:07:22.472 --> 00:07:26.903
may conceal real information for fear
of triggering a quarantine protocol.

00:07:27.522 --> 00:07:31.271
And, of course, these kinds
of evasions and dishonesty
