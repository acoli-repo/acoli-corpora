00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:32.615
That's a time lag at a time
when it's most important to move quickly.

00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:37.410
If we'd been perfectly
prepared for COVID-19,

00:10:37.434 --> 00:10:40.961
China would have identified
the outbreak faster.

00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:44.539
They would have been ready
to provide care to infected people

00:10:44.563 --> 00:10:47.103
without having to build new buildings.

00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:50.364
They would have shared
honest information with citizens

00:10:50.388 --> 00:10:52.797
so that we didn't see these
crazy rumors spreading

00:10:52.821 --> 00:10:54.798
on social media in China.

00:10:54.822 --> 00:10:58.172
And they would have shared information
with global health authorities

00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:01.097
so that they could start reporting
to national health systems
