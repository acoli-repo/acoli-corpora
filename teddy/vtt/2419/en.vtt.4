00:01:57.687 --> 00:02:01.426
They use RNA instead of DNA
as their genetic material,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.573
and they're covered in spikes
on the surface of the virus.

00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:07.484
They use those spikes to invade cells.

00:02:07.508 --> 00:02:11.010
Those spikes are the corona
in coronavirus.

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:16.035
COVID-19 is known as a novel coronavirus

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:20.173
because, until December,
we'd only heard of six coronaviruses.

00:02:20.197 --> 00:02:22.113
COVID-19 is the seventh.

00:02:22.137 --> 00:02:23.297
It's new to us.

00:02:23.321 --> 00:02:24.912
It just had its gene sequencing,

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.131
it just got its name.

00:02:26.155 --> 00:02:27.487
That's why it's novel.

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:32.428
If you remember SARS,
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,
