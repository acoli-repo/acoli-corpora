00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.075
and 10 is the World Health Organization,

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:34.823
I'd say you can probably put me
at like a seven or an eight.

00:01:34.847 --> 00:01:37.386
So keep that in mind as I talk to you.

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:42.116
I'll start with the basics here,
because I think that's gotten lost

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.557

00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:50.251
So, COVID-19 is a coronavirus.

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:54.228
Coronaviruses are
a specific subset of virus,

00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:57.663
and they have some unique
characteristics as viruses.

00:01:57.687 --> 00:02:01.426
They use RNA instead of DNA
as their genetic material,
