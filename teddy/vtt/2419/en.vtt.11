bacteria, viruses,
stuff we're not ready for.

00:05:32.612 --> 00:05:34.085
Bats, in particular,

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:37.378
have a knack for hosting illnesses
that can infect people,

00:05:37.402 --> 00:05:39.589
but they're not
the only animals that do it.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.250
So as long as we keep making
our remote places less remote,

00:05:45.274 --> 00:05:47.238
the outbreaks are going to keep coming.

00:05:49.093 --> 00:05:53.737
We can't stop the outbreaks
with quarantine or travel restrictions.

00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:55.673
That's everybody's first impulse:

00:05:55.697 --> 00:05:59.567
"Let's stop the people from moving.
Let's stop this outbreak from happening."

00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:05.076
But the fact is, it's really hard
to get a good quarantine in place.
