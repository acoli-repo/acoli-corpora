00:00:59.397 --> 00:01:02.486
I have a master's degree
in International Health.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.048
I'm not a physician. I'm not a nurse.

00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:09.345
My specialty isn't patient care
or taking care of individual people.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.050
My specialty is looking at populations
and health systems,

00:01:13.074 --> 00:01:16.135
what happens when diseases
move on the large level.

00:01:17.288 --> 00:01:20.946
If we're ranking sources
of global health expertise

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.549
on a scale of one to 10,

00:01:23.573 --> 00:01:27.196
one is some random person
ranting on Facebook

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.075
and 10 is the World Health Organization,
