00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:02.376
where we can abolish it
in farmed animals, in turkeys, in ducks,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.623
but it keeps coming back every year
because it's brought to us by wild birds.

00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:08.062
You don't hear a lot about it

00:04:08.086 --> 00:04:10.896
because avian influenza
doesn't transmit person-to-person,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.235
but we have outbreaks in poultry farms
every year all over the world.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:20.735
COVID-19 most likely skipped
from animals into people

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.316
at a wild animal market in Wuhan, China.

00:04:24.987 --> 00:04:27.115
Now for the less basic parts.

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:31.727
This is not the last major outbreak
we're ever going to see.
