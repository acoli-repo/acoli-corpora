00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:31.727
This is not the last major outbreak
we're ever going to see.

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:36.371
There's going to be more outbreaks,
and there's going to be more epidemics.

00:04:36.395 --> 00:04:39.225
That's not a maybe. That's a given.

00:04:39.672 --> 00:04:42.861
And it's a result of the way
that we, as human beings,

00:04:42.885 --> 00:04:44.770
are interacting with our planet.

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:48.273
Human choices are driving us
into a position

00:04:48.297 --> 00:04:50.920
where we're going to see more outbreaks.

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.301
Part of that is about climate change

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:56.275
and the way a warming climate
makes the world more hospitable

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:57.850
to viruses and bacteria.

00:04:58.287 --> 00:05:04.328
But it's also about the way we're pushing
into the last wild spaces on our planet.
