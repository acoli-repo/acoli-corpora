The truth is, countries like this
don't have the resources

00:08:32.194 --> 00:08:34.356
to respond to an infectious disease --

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.085
not to treat people
and not to report on it fast enough

00:08:37.109 --> 00:08:38.773
to help the rest of the world.

00:08:40.878 --> 00:08:45.795
I led an evaluation of Ebola
treatment centers in Sierra Leone,

00:08:45.819 --> 00:08:48.922
and the fact is that
local doctors in Sierra Leone

00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:51.917
identified the Ebola crisis very quickly,

00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:54.897
first as a dangerous,
contagious hemorrhagic virus

00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:57.399
and then as Ebola itself.

00:08:57.423 --> 00:09:01.555
But, having identified it,
they didn't have the resources to respond.
