I've also worked
in global health journalism;

00:00:31.217 --> 00:00:34.928
I've written about
global health and biosecurity

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:38.064
for newspapers and web outlets,

00:00:38.088 --> 00:00:40.243
and I published a book a few years back

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:43.693
about the major global health threats
facing us as a planet.

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:48.047
I have supported and led
epidemiology efforts

00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:51.939
that range from evaluating
Ebola treatment centers

00:00:51.963 --> 00:00:56.092
to looking at transmission
of tuberculosis in health facilities

00:00:56.116 --> 00:00:58.872
and doing avian influenza preparedness.
