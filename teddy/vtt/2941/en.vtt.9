00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:33.341
The largest clam in the world
is facing the threat of extinction,

00:04:33.365 --> 00:04:37.895
with more than 50 percent
of the wild population severely depleted.

00:04:38.603 --> 00:04:42.407
And the ecological benefits
of having giant clams on coral reefs

00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:46.942
are likely to continue
only if populations are healthy,

00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:49.303
making their conservation paramount.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.597
So I stand here today to give a voice
to the giant clams,

00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:56.628
because I care a whole lot
for these amazing animals,

00:04:56.652 --> 00:04:58.770
and they deserve to be cared for.

00:04:59.603 --> 00:05:03.159
It is time for the giant clams
to step out of their shells,
