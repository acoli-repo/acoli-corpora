We think that walking is important
for getting away from predators

00:03:08.858 --> 00:03:10.846
and finding mates for breeding.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.923
While it can hard to imagine
any movement in these enormous animals,

00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:18.431
giant clams up to 400 pounds
can still walk,

00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:20.163
they just move slower.

00:03:21.528 --> 00:03:25.915
During my PhD, I discovered
more secrets about the giant clams.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.164
But there was something
missing in my work.
