00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:31.493
The biggest recorded individual
was four-and-a-half-feet long

00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:33.891
and weighed about 550 pounds.

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:37.172
That is almost as heavy
as three baby elephants.

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:42.863
South Pacific legends once described
giant clams as man-eaters

00:00:42.887 --> 00:00:46.888
that would lie in wait on the seabed
to trap unsuspecting divers.

00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:50.569
A story goes that a diver
had lost his legs

00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:53.508
while trying to retrieve a pearl
from a giant clam.

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:55.490
I thought, "Really?"

00:00:56.438 --> 00:00:58.102
So out of curiosity,

00:00:58.126 --> 00:01:00.773
I did an experiment using myself as bait.
