00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:31.589
such as the whales and coral reefs,

00:02:31.613 --> 00:02:35.313
it is easy to forget that other
marine life needs our help, too.

00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:40.651
My fascination with giant clams
got me started on conservation research

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:43.918
to fill in the knowledge gaps
on their ecology and behavior.

00:02:44.472 --> 00:02:47.864
One of the discoveries that we made
was that giant clams could walk

00:02:47.888 --> 00:02:49.293
across the seafloor.

00:02:50.352 --> 00:02:51.874
Yes, you heard me right:

00:02:51.898 --> 00:02:53.099
they can walk.

00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:54.728
To find out,

00:02:54.752 --> 00:02:56.985
we placed numerous baby clams on a grid.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.907
Now watch what happens over 24 hours.
