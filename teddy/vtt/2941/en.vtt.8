00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:00.543
In a nutshell,

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:02.936
giant clams play a major contributing role

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.287
as residents of their own reef home,

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:08.414
and just having them around
keeps the reef healthy.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.291
And because they can live
up to 100 years old,

00:04:12.315 --> 00:04:15.685
giant clams make vital indicators
of coral reef health.

00:04:16.267 --> 00:04:19.313
So when giant clams
start to disappear from coral reefs,

00:04:19.957 --> 00:04:21.954
their absence can serve as an alarm bell

00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:24.262
for scientists to start paying attention,

00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:26.537
similar to the canary in a coal mine.

00:04:27.138 --> 00:04:29.081
But giant clams are endangered.

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:33.341
The largest clam in the world
is facing the threat of extinction,
