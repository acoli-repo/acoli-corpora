Considered a delicacy throughout
the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans,

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:33.056
giant clams have been traditionally
fished as seafood.

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:37.334
Fishermen are particularly interested
in their adductor muscles,

00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:40.887
which are organs that hold
the two shells together like a hinge.

00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:43.128
Just for their muscles,

00:01:43.152 --> 00:01:45.491
giant clams were almost
hunted to extinction

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:48.180
between the 1960s and 1980s.

00:01:49.217 --> 00:01:52.737
Clamshells are also popular
in the ornamental trade

00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:54.727
as jewelry and for display.

00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:57.037
In the South China Sea,

00:01:57.061 --> 00:02:00.963
fishermen went out of their way
to collect fossilized clamshells
