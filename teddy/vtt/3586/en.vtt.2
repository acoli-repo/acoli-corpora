00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:00.979
So the businesses are getting
out their checkbooks.

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:03.002
What they're not really doing is hiring.

00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:04.552
So this red line

00:01:04.576 --> 00:01:07.114
is the employment-to-population ratio,

00:01:07.138 --> 00:01:11.267
in other words, the percentage
of working-age people in America

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.677
who have work.

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:15.807
And we see that it cratered
during the Great Recession,

00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:18.728
and it hasn't started
to bounce back at all.

00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:21.671
But the story is not
just a recession story.

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:23.775
The decade that we've
just been through had

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.012
relatively anemic job growth
all throughout,

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:29.659
especially when we compare it
to other decades,

00:01:29.683 --> 00:01:32.713
and the 2000s are the only time
we have on record
