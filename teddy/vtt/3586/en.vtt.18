00:08:58.757 --> 00:09:00.788
of the Industrial Revolution

00:09:00.812 --> 00:09:04.088
changed the world and influenced
human history so much,

00:09:04.112 --> 00:09:06.514
that in the words
of the historian Ian Morris,

00:09:06.538 --> 00:09:10.329
"... they made mockery out of all
that had come before."

00:09:10.353 --> 00:09:13.880
And they did this by infinitely
multiplying the power of our muscles,

00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:16.298
overcoming the limitations of our muscles.

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.820
Now, what we're in the middle of now

00:09:18.844 --> 00:09:21.877
is overcoming the limitations
of our individual brains

00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:24.812
and infinitely multiplying
our mental power.

00:09:24.836 --> 00:09:28.013
How can this not be as big a deal

00:09:28.037 --> 00:09:30.741
as overcoming the limitations
of our muscles?
