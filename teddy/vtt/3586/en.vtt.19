00:09:28.037 --> 00:09:30.741
as overcoming the limitations
of our muscles?

00:09:30.765 --> 00:09:33.625
So at the risk of repeating
myself a little bit,

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:37.402
when I look at what's going on
with digital technology these days,

00:09:37.426 --> 00:09:40.536
we are not anywhere near
through with this journey.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.066
And when I look at what is happening
to our economies and our societies,

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.179
my single conclusion is that

00:09:47.203 --> 00:09:48.929
The best days are really ahead.

00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:50.954
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:09:50.978 --> 00:09:53.351
Economies don't run on energy.

00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:56.414
They don't run on capital,
they don't run on labor.

00:09:56.438 --> 00:09:58.843
Economies run on ideas.

00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:02.208
So the work of innovation,
the work of coming up with new ideas,
