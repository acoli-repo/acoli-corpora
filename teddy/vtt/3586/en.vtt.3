00:01:29.683 --> 00:01:32.713
and the 2000s are the only time
we have on record

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:36.269
where there were fewer people working
at the end of the decade

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:37.695
than at the beginning.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.392
This is not what you want to see.

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:43.107
When you graph the number
of potential employees

00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:45.687
versus the number of jobs in the country,

00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:49.561
you see the gap gets bigger
and bigger over time,

00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:52.895
and then, during the Great Recession,
it opened up in a huge way.

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:54.379
I did some quick calculations.

00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:56.835
I took the last 20 years of GDP growth

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.131
and the last 20 years
of labor-productivity growth
