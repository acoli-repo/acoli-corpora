systems of philosophy
in both the West and the East

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.903
that have changed how a lot
of people think about the world.

00:07:03.927 --> 00:07:05.420
And then other people will say,

00:07:05.444 --> 00:07:07.905
"No, actually, the big stories,
the big developments

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:10.512
are the founding
of the world's major religions,

00:07:10.536 --> 00:07:13.762
which have changed civilizations
and have changed and influenced

00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:16.380
how countless people
are living their lives."

And then some other folk will say,

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:20.515
"Actually, what changes civilizations,

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:25.324
what modifies them and what changes
people's lives are empires,

00:07:25.348 --> 00:07:27.753
so the great developments in human history

00:07:27.777 --> 00:07:30.539
are stories of conquest and of war."
