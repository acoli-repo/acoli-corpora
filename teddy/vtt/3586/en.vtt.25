00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.672
So as I look around at all the evidence

00:12:31.696 --> 00:12:34.133
and I think about the room
that we have ahead of us,

00:12:34.157 --> 00:12:35.985
I become a huge digital optimist

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:40.585
and I start to think that this wonderful
statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson

00:12:40.609 --> 00:12:42.347
is actually not hyperbole.

00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:44.880
This is an accurate assessment
of what's going on.

00:12:44.904 --> 00:12:47.602
Our technologies are great gifts,

00:12:47.626 --> 00:12:50.673
and we, right now,
have the great good fortune

00:12:50.697 --> 00:12:54.427
to be living at a time when
digital technology is flourishing,

00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:57.846
when it is broadening and deepening
and becoming more profound

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.148
all around the world.

00:12:59.172 --> 00:13:02.447
So, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs,
