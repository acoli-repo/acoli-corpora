Throughout all of history,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.570
if you wanted something translated
from one language into another,

00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:06.319
you had to involve a human being.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.798
Now we have multi-language, instantaneous,

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:14.242
automatic translation services
available for free

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:17.409
via many of our devices,
all the way down to smartphones.

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:19.229
And if any of us have used these,

00:03:19.253 --> 00:03:22.768
we know that they're not perfect,
but they're decent.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.252
Throughout all of history,
if you wanted something written,

00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:29.613
a report or an article,
you had to involve a person.
