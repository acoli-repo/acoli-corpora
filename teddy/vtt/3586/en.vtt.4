00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.131
and the last 20 years
of labor-productivity growth

00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:02.873
and used those in a fairly
straightforward way

00:02:02.897 --> 00:02:05.920
to try to project how many jobs
the economy was going to need

00:02:05.944 --> 00:02:07.247
to keep growing,

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:09.396
and this is the line that I came up with.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.162
Is that good or bad?

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:13.097
This is the government's projection

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:16.457
for the working-age
population going forward.

00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:21.579
So if these predictions are accurate,
that gap is not going to close.

00:02:21.603 --> 00:02:24.629
The problem is, I don't think
these projections are accurate.

00:02:24.653 --> 00:02:28.132
In particular, I think my projection
is way too optimistic,

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:29.603
because when I did it,

00:02:29.627 --> 00:02:33.845
I was assuming that the future
was kind of going to look like the past,
