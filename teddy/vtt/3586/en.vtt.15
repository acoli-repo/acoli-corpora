00:07:27.777 --> 00:07:30.539
are stories of conquest and of war."

00:07:30.563 --> 00:07:33.344
And then some cheery soul
usually always pipes up and says,

00:07:33.368 --> 00:07:35.050
"Hey, don't forget about plagues!"

00:07:35.074 --> 00:07:38.983
(Laughter)

00:07:39.007 --> 00:07:41.530
There are some optimistic
answers to this question,

00:07:41.554 --> 00:07:43.968
so some people will bring up
the Age of Exploration

00:07:43.992 --> 00:07:45.537
and the opening up of the world.

00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:49.339
Others will talk about intellectual
achievements in disciplines like math

00:07:49.363 --> 00:07:51.857
that have helped us get
a better handle on the world,

00:07:51.881 --> 00:07:55.321
and other folk will talk about periods
when there was a deep flourishing

00:07:55.345 --> 00:07:56.950
of the arts and sciences.

00:07:56.974 --> 00:07:58.561
So this debate will go on and on.

00:07:58.585 --> 00:08:00.046
It's an endless debate
