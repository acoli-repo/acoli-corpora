I've got no problem with this.

00:10:31.729 --> 00:10:34.034
(Laughter)

00:10:35.345 --> 00:10:36.552
But some other people do,

00:10:36.576 --> 00:10:38.361
and they've kind of crashed the party

00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:40.530
and loosened up
the dress code of innovation.

00:10:40.554 --> 00:10:41.586
(Laughter)

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.810
So here are the winners of a Topcoder
programming challenge,

00:10:44.834 --> 00:10:47.526
and I assure you that nobody cares

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.306
where these kids grew up,
where they went to school,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.830
or what they look like.

00:10:52.854 --> 00:10:56.697
All anyone cares about is the quality
of the work, the quality of the ideas.

00:10:56.721 --> 00:10:58.957
And over and over again,
we see this happening

00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:01.505
in the technology-facilitated world.
