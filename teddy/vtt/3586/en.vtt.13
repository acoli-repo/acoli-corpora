00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:30.163
personally, I'm still
a huge digital optimist,

00:06:30.187 --> 00:06:32.391
and I am supremely confident

00:06:32.415 --> 00:06:35.003
that the digital technologies
that we're developing now

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:37.677
are going to take us
into a Utopian future,

00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:39.413
not a dystopian future.

00:06:39.437 --> 00:06:40.588
And to explain why,

00:06:40.612 --> 00:06:43.191
I want to pose a ridiculously
broad question.

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:44.366
I want to ask:

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.736
what have been the most important
developments in human history?

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.721
Now, I want to share some
of the answers that I've gotten

00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:52.142
in response to this question.

00:06:52.166 --> 00:06:55.334
It's a wonderful question to ask
and start an endless debate about,

00:06:55.358 --> 00:06:57.332
because some people are going to bring up

00:06:57.356 --> 00:07:00.656
systems of philosophy
in both the West and the East
