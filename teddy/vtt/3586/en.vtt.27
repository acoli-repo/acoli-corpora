to a guy who had a front-row seat
for digital progress,

00:13:36.593 --> 00:13:38.165
our old friend Ken Jennings.

00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:40.432
I'm with him; I'm going to echo his words:

00:13:40.456 --> 00:13:43.372
"I, for one, welcome our new
computer overlords."

00:13:43.396 --> 00:13:44.477
(Laughter)

00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:45.985
Thanks very much.

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:47.167
(Applause)
