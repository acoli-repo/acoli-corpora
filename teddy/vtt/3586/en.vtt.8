One of the most impressive
knowledge workers in recent memory

00:04:02.732 --> 00:04:04.253
is a guy named Ken Jennings.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:09.011
He won the quiz show
"Jeopardy!" 74 times in a row.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.800
Took home three million dollars.

00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:15.595
That's Ken on the right,
getting beat three-to-one

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:19.996
by Watson, the Jeopardy-playing
supercomputer from IBM.

00:04:20.642 --> 00:04:24.157
So when we look at what technology can do
to general knowledge workers,

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:27.259
I start to think there might not be
something so special

00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:29.051
about this idea of a generalist,

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:33.405
particularly when we start doing things
like hooking Siri up to Watson,
