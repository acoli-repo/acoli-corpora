As it turns out, when tens of millions
of people are unemployed

00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:05.526
or underemployed,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.716
there's a fair amount of interest
in what technology might be doing

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.902
to the labor force.

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:11.815
And as I look at the conversation,

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.519
it strikes me that it's focused
on exactly the right topic,

00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:18.368
and at the same time,
it's missing the point entirely.

00:00:18.392 --> 00:00:19.933
The topic that it's focused on,

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:24.440
the question is whether or not all these
digital technologies are affecting

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:26.481
people's ability to earn a living,

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.490
or, to say it a little bit different way,

00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:30.603
are the droids taking our jobs?
