00:11:28.792 --> 00:11:32.285
The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting
hugely from technology.

00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:35.869
The economist Robert Jensen
did this wonderful study a while back

00:11:35.893 --> 00:11:37.826
where he watched, in great detail,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.468
what happened to the fishing
villages of Kerala, India,

00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:44.373
when they got mobile phones
for the very first time.

00:11:44.397 --> 00:11:47.206
And when you write for the Quarterly
Journal of Economics,

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.112
you have to use very dry
and very circumspect language.

00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:51.398
But when I read his paper,

00:11:51.422 --> 00:11:53.629
I kind of feel Jensen
is trying to scream at us

00:11:53.653 --> 00:11:55.977
and say, "Look, this was a big deal.

00:11:56.001 --> 00:11:59.652
Prices stabilized, so people
could plan their economic lives.

00:11:59.676 --> 00:12:03.350
Waste was not reduced --
it was eliminated.
