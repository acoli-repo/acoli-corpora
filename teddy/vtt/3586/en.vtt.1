00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:30.603
are the droids taking our jobs?

00:00:30.627 --> 00:00:32.564
And there's some evidence that they are.

00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:36.633
The Great Recession ended
when American GDP resumed

00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:39.524
its kind of slow, steady march upward,

00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:42.818
and some other economic indicators
also started to rebound,

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:45.135
and they got kind of healthy
kind of quickly.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.326
Corporate profits are quite high;

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.246
in fact, if you include bank profits,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.261
they're higher than they've ever been.

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:54.772
And business investment
in gear -- in equipment

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:57.640
and hardware and software --
is at an all-time high.

00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:00.979
So the businesses are getting
out their checkbooks.
