00:04:58.222 --> 00:05:02.068
So I start to think a lot of knowledge
work is going to be affected by this.

00:05:02.092 --> 00:05:05.828
And digital technologies are not
just impacting knowledge work,

00:05:05.852 --> 00:05:09.591
they're starting to flex their muscles
in the physical world as well.

00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:13.340
I had the chance a little while back
to ride in the Google autonomous car,

00:05:13.364 --> 00:05:15.641
which is as cool as it sounds.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:17.853
(Laughter)

00:05:17.877 --> 00:05:22.298
And I will vouch that it handled
the stop-and-go traffic on US 101

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.575
very smoothly.

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.250
There are about three and a half million
people who drive trucks for a living

00:05:27.274 --> 00:05:28.425
in the United States;

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.517
I think some of them are going
to be affected by this technology.
