00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.517
I think some of them are going
to be affected by this technology.

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:34.641
And right now, humanoid robots
are still incredibly primitive.

00:05:34.665 --> 00:05:36.622
They can't do very much.

00:05:36.646 --> 00:05:38.618
But they're getting better quite quickly

00:05:38.642 --> 00:05:42.179
and DARPA, which is the investment arm
of the Defense Department,

00:05:42.203 --> 00:05:44.180
is trying to accelerate their trajectory.

00:05:44.204 --> 00:05:48.646
So, in short, yeah, the droids
are coming for our jobs.

00:05:49.845 --> 00:05:52.737
In the short term, we can
stimulate job growth

00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:54.898
by encouraging entrepreneurship

00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:56.836
and by investing in infrastructure,

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.398
because the robots today
still aren't very good at fixing bridges.
