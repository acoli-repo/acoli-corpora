00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:02.208
So the work of innovation,
the work of coming up with new ideas,

00:10:02.232 --> 00:10:05.930
is some of the most powerful, most
fundamental work that we can do

00:10:05.954 --> 00:10:07.105
in an economy.

00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:10.247
And this is kind of how
we used to do innovation.

00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:13.247
We'd find a bunch of fairly
similar-looking people ...

00:10:13.271 --> 00:10:16.767
(Laughter)

00:10:16.791 --> 00:10:18.784
We'd take them out of elite institutions,

00:10:18.808 --> 00:10:20.887
we'd put them into other
elite institutions

00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:22.497
and we'd wait for the innovation.

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:23.690
Now --

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:26.143
(Laughter)

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:29.655
as a white guy who spent
his whole career at MIT and Harvard,

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.705
I've got no problem with this.
