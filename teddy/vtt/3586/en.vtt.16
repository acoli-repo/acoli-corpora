00:07:58.585 --> 00:08:00.046
It's an endless debate

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.303
and there's no conclusive,
single answer to it.

00:08:03.327 --> 00:08:04.844
But if you're a geek like me,

00:08:04.868 --> 00:08:07.549
you say, "Well, what do the data say?"

00:08:07.573 --> 00:08:08.905
And you start to do things

00:08:08.929 --> 00:08:11.613
like graph things
that we might be interested in --

00:08:11.637 --> 00:08:14.716
the total worldwide
population, for example,

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.105
or some measure of social development

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:19.617
or the state of advancement of a society.

00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:23.764
And you start to plot the data,
because, by this approach,

00:08:23.788 --> 00:08:26.393
the big stories, the big
developments in human history,

00:08:26.417 --> 00:08:28.927
are the ones that will bend
these curves a lot.

00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:31.171
So when you do this
and when you plot the data,
