00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:33.405
particularly when we start doing things
like hooking Siri up to Watson,

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:36.698
and having technologies
that can understand what we're saying

00:04:36.722 --> 00:04:38.706
and repeat speech back to us.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.633
Now, Siri is far from perfect,
and we can make fun of her flaws,

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.156
but we should also keep in mind

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.544
that if technologies like Siri and Watson
improve along a Moore's law trajectory,

00:04:49.568 --> 00:04:51.090
which they will,

00:04:51.114 --> 00:04:54.704
in six years, they're not going to be two
times better or four times better,

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:58.198
they'll be 16 times better
than they are right now.

00:04:58.222 --> 00:05:02.068
So I start to think a lot of knowledge
work is going to be affected by this.
