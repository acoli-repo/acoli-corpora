00:12:59.172 --> 00:13:02.447
So, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs,

00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:06.042
but focusing on that fact
misses the point entirely.

00:13:06.066 --> 00:13:09.566
The point is that then we
are freed up to do other things,

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.877
and what we're going to do,
I am very confident,

00:13:11.901 --> 00:13:14.417
what we're going to do is reduce poverty

00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:16.910
and drudgery and misery around the world.

00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:20.939
I'm very confident we're going to learn
to live more lightly on the planet,

00:13:20.963 --> 00:13:24.388
and I am extremely confident
that what we're going to do

00:13:24.412 --> 00:13:25.787
with our new digital tools

00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:28.803
is going to be so profound
and so beneficial

00:13:28.827 --> 00:13:32.311
that it's going to make a mockery
out of everything that came before.
