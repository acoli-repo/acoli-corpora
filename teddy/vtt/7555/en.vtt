00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:03.708
So when I was 10 years old,

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:06.419
I was a lonely, geeky girl;

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:12.175
a first-generation Latina growing up
in a small Midwestern town

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:16.345
where hardly anyone else
had parents who spoke with thick accents.

00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:21.309
But then I came across
Tolkien’s fantasy trilogy,

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:22.852
“The Lord of the Rings,”

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:24.645
and I fell in love.

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:25.938
(Applause)

00:00:26.773 --> 00:00:29.233
What a cool world of elves,

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:30.234
