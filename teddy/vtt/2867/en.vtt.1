00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.387
and I had the privilege
of growing up there.

00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:34.922
I was nine years old,

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:36.708
I loved kicking around a soccer ball,

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:38.979
and I was a total math and science geek.

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:43.231
I was living the kind of life
that, really, any child would dream of.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.906
But no condition is permanent.

00:00:48.346 --> 00:00:51.269
On Christmas Eve in 1989,

00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:53.824
civil war erupted in Liberia.

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:57.036
The war started in the rural countryside,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.767
and within months, rebel armies
had marched towards our hometown.
