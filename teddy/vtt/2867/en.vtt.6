00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.931
The war had left us with just 51 doctors

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:03.393
to serve a country of four million people.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:06.900
It would be like the city of San Francisco
having just 10 doctors.

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.484
So if you got sick in the city
where those few doctors remain,

00:03:10.508 --> 00:03:11.957
you might stand a chance.

00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.847
But if you got sick in the remote,
rural rainforest communities,

00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:18.236
where you could be days
from the nearest clinic --

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.001
I was seeing my patients die
from conditions no one should die from,

00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:24.168
all because they were
getting to me too late.

00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:27.614
Imagine you have a two-year-old
who wakes up one morning with a fever,

00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:30.042
and you realize she could have malaria,
