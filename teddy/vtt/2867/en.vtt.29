00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.493
it would have been impossible for us
to be able to employ A.B. and Musu.

00:14:35.464 --> 00:14:38.146
And I think it's time
for technology to help us train,

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.710
to help us train people faster
and better than ever before.

00:14:42.578 --> 00:14:43.728
As a doctor,

00:14:43.752 --> 00:14:47.243
I use technology to stay up-to-date
and keep certified.

00:14:47.267 --> 00:14:49.962
I use smartphones, I use apps,
I use online courses.

00:14:49.986 --> 00:14:52.198
But when A.B. wants to learn,

00:14:52.222 --> 00:14:54.317
he's got to jump back in that canoe

00:14:55.152 --> 00:14:56.792
and get to the training center.

00:14:56.816 --> 00:14:59.008
And when Musu shows up for training,

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.315
her instructors are stuck using
flip charts and markers.
