00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.767
and within months, rebel armies
had marched towards our hometown.

00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:02.461
My school shut down,

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:05.957
and when the rebel armies captured
the only international airport,

00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:08.466
people started panicking and fleeing.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.108
My mom came knocking one morning
and said, "Raj, pack your things --

00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:14.421
we have to go."

00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:17.224
We were rushed to the center of town,

00:01:17.248 --> 00:01:21.421
and there on a tarmac,
we were split into two lines.

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:25.126
I stood with my family in one line,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.550
and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch

00:01:27.574 --> 00:01:28.755
of a rescue plane.

00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:32.261
And there on a bench,
I was sitting with my heart racing.
