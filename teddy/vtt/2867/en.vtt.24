00:12:00.349 --> 00:12:02.947
We've learned that blind spots
in rural health care

00:12:02.971 --> 00:12:04.769
can lead to hot spots of disease,

00:12:04.793 --> 00:12:07.209
and that places all of us at greater risk.

00:12:07.702 --> 00:12:10.394
We've learned that the most efficient
emergency system

00:12:10.418 --> 00:12:12.446
is actually an everyday system,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.196
and that system has to reach
all communities,

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.495
including rural communities like Emile's.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.691
And most of all,

00:12:19.715 --> 00:12:23.176
we've learned from the courage
of Liberia's community health workers

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.921
that we as people are not defined
by the conditions we face,

00:12:26.945 --> 00:12:29.009
no matter how hopeless they seem.
