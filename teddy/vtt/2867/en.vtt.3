00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:32.261
And there on a bench,
I was sitting with my heart racing.

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:34.704
As I looked out the open hatch,

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:37.567
I saw hundreds of Liberians
in another line,

00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:39.527
children strapped to their backs.

00:01:40.514 --> 00:01:43.360
When they tried to jump in with us,

00:01:43.384 --> 00:01:45.743
I watched soldiers restrain them.

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:48.404
They were not allowed to flee.

00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:50.619
We were the lucky ones.

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.101
We lost what we had,

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:55.537
but we resettled in America,

00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:58.692
and as immigrants, we benefitted
from the community of supporters

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:00.054
that rallied around us.
