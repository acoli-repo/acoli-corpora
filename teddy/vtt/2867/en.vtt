I want to share with you
something my father taught me:

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:07.718
no condition is permanent.

00:00:09.283 --> 00:00:12.167
It's a lesson he shared with me
again and again,

00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:15.738
and I learned it to be true the hard way.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.507
Here I am in my fourth-grade class.

00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.265
This is my yearbook picture
taken in my class in school

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.001
in Monrovia, Liberia.

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:29.915
My parents migrated from India
to West Africa in the 1970s,

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.387
and I had the privilege
of growing up there.
