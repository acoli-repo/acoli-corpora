We're defined by how we respond to them.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.351
For the past 15 years,

00:12:37.249 --> 00:12:39.252
I've seen the power of this idea

00:12:39.276 --> 00:12:43.373
to transform everyday citizens
into community health workers --

00:12:43.397 --> 00:12:45.260
into everyday heroes.

00:12:46.124 --> 00:12:47.926
And I've seen it play out everywhere,

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.008
from the forest communities
of West Africa,

00:12:50.032 --> 00:12:52.277
to the rural fishing villages of Alaska.

00:12:52.979 --> 00:12:54.129
It's true,

00:12:54.153 --> 00:12:57.202
these community health workers
aren't doing neurosurgery,

00:12:57.226 --> 00:12:58.718
but they're making it possible

00:12:58.742 --> 00:13:01.814
to bring health care within reach
of everyone everywhere.
