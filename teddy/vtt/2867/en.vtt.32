00:15:59.988 --> 00:16:01.150
Thank you.

00:16:01.175 --> 00:16:04.777
(Applause)

00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:05.959
Thank you.

00:16:07.816 --> 00:16:09.360
Here's the idea:

00:16:09.384 --> 00:16:11.454
we'll create and curate

00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:15.941
the best in digital education resources.

00:16:16.802 --> 00:16:21.437
We will bring those to community
health workers around the world,

00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:22.714
including A.B. and Musu.

00:16:22.738 --> 00:16:25.540
They'll get video lessons
on giving kids vaccines

00:16:25.564 --> 00:16:28.777
and have online courses
on spotting the next outbreak,

00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:30.684
so they're not stuck using flip charts.
