00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:33.104
I'd once had my hopes crushed in a war,

00:02:34.037 --> 00:02:35.305
but because of them,

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.194
I had a chance to pursue my dream
to become a doctor.

00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:41.135
My condition had changed.

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.426
It had been 15 years
since I escaped that airfield,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.219
but the memory of those two lines
had not escaped my mind.

00:02:48.243 --> 00:02:50.763
I was a medical student in my mid-20s,

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:52.021
and I wanted to go back

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:54.915
to see if I could serve
the people we'd left behind.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:56.935
But when I got back,

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.786
what I found was utter destruction.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.931
The war had left us with just 51 doctors
