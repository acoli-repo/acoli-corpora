00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:31.291
At the height of the crisis,

00:10:31.315 --> 00:10:35.760
when we were told that 1.4 million
people could be infected,

00:10:35.784 --> 00:10:39.287
when we were told
that most of them would die,

00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:41.725
when we had nearly lost all hope,

00:10:43.678 --> 00:10:46.550
I remember standing with a group
of health workers

00:10:46.574 --> 00:10:49.332
in the rainforest where
an outbreak had just happened.

00:10:49.356 --> 00:10:52.345
We were helping train and equip
them to put on the masks,

00:10:52.369 --> 00:10:54.409
the gloves and the gowns that they needed

00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:56.428
to keep themselves safe from the virus

00:10:56.452 --> 00:10:58.760
while they were serving their patients.

00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:01.085
I remember the fear in their eyes.
