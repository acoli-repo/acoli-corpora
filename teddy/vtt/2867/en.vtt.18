A.B. took me to visit Prince,
and he's a chubby little guy.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.297
(Laughter)

00:09:02.321 --> 00:09:05.493
He's meeting his milestones,
he's pulled himself up to a stand,

00:09:05.517 --> 00:09:07.474
and is even starting to say a few words.

00:09:07.498 --> 00:09:09.997
I'm so inspired by these
community health workers.

00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:12.309
I often ask them why they do what they do,

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:14.067
and when I asked A.B.,

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:18.929
he said, "Doc, since I dropped out
of school, this is the first time

00:09:18.953 --> 00:09:21.332
I'm having a chance
to hold a pen to write.

00:09:22.036 --> 00:09:24.306
My brain is getting fresh."

00:09:26.104 --> 00:09:29.782
The stories of A.B. and Musu
have taught me something fundamental

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:31.114
about being human.
