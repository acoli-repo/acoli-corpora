00:04:58.804 --> 00:05:02.512
that the work of diagnosing disease
and prescribing medicines

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:05.644
is limited to a team of nurses
and doctors like me.

00:05:06.418 --> 00:05:09.063
But nurses and doctors
are concentrated in cities,

00:05:09.087 --> 00:05:12.423
so rural communities like Musu's
have been left behind.

00:05:12.902 --> 00:05:14.657
So we started asking some questions:

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.214
What if we could reorganize
the medical care system?

00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:20.156
What if we could have community
members like Musu

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.457
be a part or even be the center
of our medical team?

00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:27.406
What if Musu could help us bring
health care from clinics in cities

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.554
to the doorsteps of her neighbors?
