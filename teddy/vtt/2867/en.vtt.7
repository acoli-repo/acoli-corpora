00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:30.042
and you realize she could have malaria,

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:33.067
and you know the only way to get her
the medicine she needs

00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:34.944
would be to take her to the riverbed,

00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:37.043
get in a canoe, paddle to the other side

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:39.682
and then walk for up to two days
through the forest

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:41.513
just to reach the nearest clinic.

00:03:42.157 --> 00:03:45.276
One billion people live
in the world's most remote communities,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.945
and despite the advances we've made
in modern medicine and technology,

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.668
our innovations are not
reaching the last mile.

00:03:51.692 --> 00:03:53.653
These communities have been left behind,

00:03:53.677 --> 00:03:55.876
because they've been thought
too hard to reach

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.450
and too difficult to serve.

00:03:58.282 --> 00:03:59.969
Illness is universal;

00:03:59.993 --> 00:04:02.198
access to care is not.
