00:03:59.993 --> 00:04:02.198
access to care is not.

00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:04.784
And realizing this lit a fire in my soul.

00:04:04.808 --> 00:04:09.066
No one should die because they live
too far from a doctor or clinic.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.535
No condition should be permanent.

00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:16.004
And help in this case
didn't come from the outside,

00:04:16.028 --> 00:04:17.681
it actually came from within.

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:19.706
It came from the communities themselves.

00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:21.537
Meet Musu.

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:22.946
Way out in rural Liberia,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.139
where most girls have not had
a chance to finish primary school,

00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:28.686
Musu had been persistent.
