00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:00.054
that rallied around us.

00:02:01.932 --> 00:02:03.735
They took my family into their home,

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.086
they mentored me.

00:02:06.096 --> 00:02:08.239
And they helped my dad
start a clothing shop.

00:02:08.263 --> 00:02:10.632
I'd visit my father
on weekends as a teenager

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:13.110
to help him sell sneakers and jeans.

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:15.467
And every time business would get bad,

00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:17.974
he'd remind me of that mantra:

00:02:17.998 --> 00:02:19.923
no condition is permanent.

00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:25.222
That mantra and my parents' persistence
and that community of supporters

00:02:25.246 --> 00:02:27.571
made it possible for me
to go through college

00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:29.312
and eventually to medical school.
