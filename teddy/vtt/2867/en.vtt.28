00:13:58.896 --> 00:14:00.919
to try to help them do the same thing.

00:14:02.005 --> 00:14:04.695
If we could help these countries scale,

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.182
we could save millions of lives,

00:14:07.206 --> 00:14:08.562
and at the same time,

00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:10.367
we could create millions of jobs.

00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:14.797
We simply can't do that, though,
without technology.

00:14:15.286 --> 00:14:18.374
People are worried that technology
is going to steal our jobs,

00:14:18.398 --> 00:14:20.597
but when it comes
to community health workers,

00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:23.877
technology has actually
been vital for creating jobs.

00:14:23.901 --> 00:14:26.317
Without technology --
without this smartphone,

00:14:26.341 --> 00:14:29.063
without this rapid test --

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.493
it would have been impossible for us
to be able to employ A.B. and Musu.
