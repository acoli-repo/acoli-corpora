00:06:25.494 --> 00:06:30.397
Our goal is to bring a health worker
within reach of everyone, everywhere.

00:06:30.421 --> 00:06:32.355
We designed a three-step process --

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:33.843
train, equip and pay --

00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:37.224
to invest more deeply
in volunteers like Musu

00:06:37.248 --> 00:06:38.847
to become paraprofessionals,

00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:41.045
to become community health workers.

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:45.626
First we trained Musu to prevent,
diagnose and treat

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.359
the top 10 diseases afflicting
families in her village.

00:06:49.903 --> 00:06:53.157
A nurse supervisor visited her
every month to coach her.

00:06:53.883 --> 00:06:56.424
We equipped her with modern
medical technology,

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:59.818
like this $1 malaria rapid test,

00:06:59.842 --> 00:07:03.571
and put it in a backpack
full of medicines like this
