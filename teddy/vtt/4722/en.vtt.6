00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:01.483
all-encircling theory of the Earth,

00:03:01.483 --> 00:03:05.556
from a gallstone to a 4.5 billion-year-old planet.

00:03:05.556 --> 00:03:06.907
Now think bigger,

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:08.022
take it to biology.

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:10.160
Say you see shark teeth in one layer

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.539
and a fossil of an organism

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.188
you've never seen under that.

00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:15.447
The deeper fossil's older, yes?

00:03:15.447 --> 00:03:16.502
You now have evidence

00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:19.707
of the origin and extinction of species over time.

00:03:19.707 --> 00:03:21.171
Get uniformitarian.

00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:23.350
Maybe a process still active today

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.844
caused changes not just in rocks but in life.

00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:28.982
It might also explain similarities and differences

00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:30.421
between species
