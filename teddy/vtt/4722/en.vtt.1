00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:30.642
whose school chums died of plague.

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:32.559
He survived to cut up corpses

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.726
as an anatomist,

00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:36.357
studying organs shared across species.

00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:38.249
He found a duct in animal skulls

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.227
that sends saliva to the mouth.

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:41.728
He refuted Descartes' idea

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:43.862
that only humans had a pineal gland,

00:00:43.862 --> 00:00:46.113
proving it wasn't the seat of the soul,

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:48.942
arguably, the debut of neuroscience.

00:00:48.942 --> 00:00:51.949
Most remarkable for the time was his method.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.200
Steno never let ancient texts,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.708
Aristotelian metaphysics,

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:57.503
or Cartesian deductions

00:00:57.503 --> 00:01:01.173
overrule empirical, experimental evidence.
