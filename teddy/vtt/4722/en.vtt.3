Pliny the Elder, old Roman naturalist,

00:01:31.203 --> 00:01:33.530
said these fell from the sky.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.703
In the Dark Ages,

00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:36.493
folks said they were snake tongues,

00:01:36.493 --> 00:01:38.254
petrified by Saint Paul.

00:01:38.254 --> 00:01:41.058
Steno saw that tongue stones were shark teeth

00:01:41.058 --> 00:01:42.393
and vice versa,

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:45.003
with the same signs of structural growth.

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:47.757
Figuring similar things are made in similar ways,

00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:49.396
he argued the ancient teeth

00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:50.877
came from ancient sharks

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.679
in waters that formed rock around the teeth

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.420
and became mountains.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.637
Rock layers were once layers of watery sediment,

00:01:58.637 --> 00:02:00.280
which would lay out horizontally,
