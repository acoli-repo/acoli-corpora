00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:09.163
Nicolas Steno is rarely heard of

00:00:09.163 --> 00:00:11.436
outside Intro to Geology,

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:14.245
but anyone hoping to understand life on Earth

00:00:14.245 --> 00:00:17.174
should see how Steno expanded and connected

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:18.675
those very concepts:

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.758
Earth, life, and understanding.

00:00:21.758 --> 00:00:25.226
Born Niels Stensen in 1638 Denmark,

00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:26.813
son of a goldsmith,

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:28.139
he was a sickly kid

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:30.642
whose school chums died of plague.
