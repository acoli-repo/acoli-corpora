00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:30.421
between species

00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:32.621
found by anatomists like Steno.

00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.729
It's a lot to ponder,

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.269
but Charles Darwin had the time

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.902
on a long trip to the Galapagos,

00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:40.467
reading a copy of his friend Charles Lyell's

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:42.323
"Principles of Geology,"

00:03:42.323 --> 00:03:44.496
which Steno sort of founded.

00:03:44.496 --> 00:03:46.530
Sometimes giants stand on the shoulders

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.529
of curious little people.

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.882
Nicolas Steno helped evolve evolution,

00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:52.431
broke ground for geology,

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:55.041
and showed how unbiased, empirical observation

00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:56.890
can cut across intellectual borders

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.936
to deepen our perspective.

00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:00.752
His finest accomplishment, though,
