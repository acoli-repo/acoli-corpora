00:02:26.628 --> 00:02:30.134
Steno planted seeds for uniformitarianism,

00:02:30.134 --> 00:02:33.091
the idea that the past was shaped by processes

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:34.798
observable today.

00:02:34.798 --> 00:02:36.754
In the 18th and 19th centuries,

00:02:36.754 --> 00:02:39.255
English uniformitarian geologists,

00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:41.468
James Hutton and Charles Lyell,

00:02:41.468 --> 00:02:43.972
studied current, very slow rates

00:02:43.972 --> 00:02:46.014
of erosion and sedimentation

00:02:46.014 --> 00:02:48.190
and realized the Earth had to be way older

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.308
than the biblical guestimate, 6000 years.

00:02:51.308 --> 00:02:53.316
Out of their work came the rock cycle,

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:55.056
which combined with plate tectonics

00:02:55.056 --> 00:02:56.436
in the mid-twentieth century

00:02:56.436 --> 00:02:58.907
to give us the great molten-crusting, quaking,

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:01.483
all-encircling theory of the Earth,
