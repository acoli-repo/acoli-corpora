His vision, uncluttered by speculation or rationalization,

00:01:10.426 --> 00:01:11.768
They obeyed molding principles

he knew from the goldsmith trade,

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:15.155
rules useful across disciplines

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:16.739
for understanding solids

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:18.771
