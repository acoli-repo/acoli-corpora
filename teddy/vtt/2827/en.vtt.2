WEBVTT

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.280
we fail everyone
who loves mothers and babies:

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.256
the fathers, the partners,
the grandparents, the aunties,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.360
the friends and kin
that make our human social networks.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.216
It's time that we abandon
simple solutions and simple slogans,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.960
and grapple with the nuance.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.776
I was very fortunate

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.456
to run smack-dab
into that nuance very early,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.520
during my first interview
with a journalist

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.856
when she asked me,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.160
"How long should a mother
breastfeed her baby?"
