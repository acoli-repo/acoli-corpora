I'm talking to you, job creators
and collective bargaining units,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.320
and workers, and shareholders.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.296
We all have a stake
in the public health of our community,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.280
and we all have a role
to play in achieving it.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.280
Breast milk is a part
of improving human health.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.016
In the NICU, when infants are born
early or sick or injured,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.760
milk or bioactive constituents in milk
can be critically important.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.776
Environments or ecologies,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.016
or communities where there's
high risk of infectious disease,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.496
breast milk can be incredibly protective.
