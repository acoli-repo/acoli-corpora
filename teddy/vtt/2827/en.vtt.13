Sex.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.456
And nobody expects us
to start out being good at it.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.640
(Laughter)

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.016
Clinicians best deliver
quality equitable care

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.056
when they have continuing education

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.200

And in order to have
that continuing education,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.216

to cutting-edge research

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.736

and the social sciences,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.456
