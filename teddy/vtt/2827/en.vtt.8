These mothers and babies
deserve our best science.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.736
Recent research has shown
that milk doesn't just grow the body,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.000
it fuels behavior
and shapes neurodevelopment.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.816
In 2015, researchers discovered

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.816
that the mixture of breast milk
and baby saliva --

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.896
specifically, baby saliva --

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.736
causes a chemical reaction
that produces hydrogen peroxide

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.520
that can kill staph and salmonella.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.056
And from humans and other mammal species,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.496
we're starting to understand
that the biological recipe of milk

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.640
can be different when produced
for sons or daughters.
