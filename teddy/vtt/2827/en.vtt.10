00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.336
Increasingly common medical conditions

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.976
C-section and preterm births

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.600
all can disrupt the underlying
biology of lactation.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.000
And many women do not have
knowledgeable clinical support.

Twenty-five years ago,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.216
that provide the optimal level
of support for mother-infant bonding

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.560
and infant feeding.
