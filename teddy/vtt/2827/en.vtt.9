00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.640
can be different when produced
for sons or daughters.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.176
When we reach for donor milk
in the neonatal intensive care unit,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.176
or formula on the store shelf,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.520
it's nearly one-size-fits-all.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.216
We aren't thinking about how sons
and daughters may grow at different rates,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.456
or different ways,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.200

Mothers have gotten the message

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.576
and the vast majority of mothers
intend to breastfeed,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.440
but many do not reach
their breastfeeding goals.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.616
That is not their failure;
