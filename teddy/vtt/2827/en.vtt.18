is not just about messaging to mothers

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.760

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.176
It's also about understanding
what is important in breast milk

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.976
so that we can deliver better formulas

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.800

social and economic equality,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.776
