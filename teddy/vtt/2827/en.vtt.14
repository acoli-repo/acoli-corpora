00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.760
that too often

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.056
historical traumas and implicit biases

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.600
sit in the space between
a new mother and her clinician.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.280
The body is political.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.456
If our breastfeeding support
is not intersectional,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.360
it's not good enough.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.096
And for moms who have to return for work,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.136
because countries like the United States
do not provide paid parental leave,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.320
they can have to go back in as short
as just a few days after giving birth.
