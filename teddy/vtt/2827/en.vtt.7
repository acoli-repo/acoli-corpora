00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.816
I'm not saying we shouldn't
know about those things --

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.536
I'm a scientist, I think
we should know about everything.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.896
But that we know so much less --

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.696
(Laughter)

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.016
about breast milk --

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.816
the first fluid a young mammal
is adapted to consume --

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.200
should make us angry.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.456
Globally, nine out of 10 women will
have at least one child in her lifetime.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.936
That means that nearly 130 million
babies are born each year.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.080
These mothers and babies
deserve our best science.
