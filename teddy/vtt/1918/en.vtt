Living with a physical
disability isn't easy

00:00:03.897 --> 00:00:06.096
anywhere in the world,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.925
but if you live in a country
like the United States,

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.018
there's certain appurtenances available

you can take an elevator.

If you're crossing the street,
you have sidewalk cutouts.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:19.234

00:00:19.258 --> 00:00:22.401

there's accessible vehicles,

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.262
and if you can't afford one of those,

00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:26.635
there's accessible public transportation.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.326
But in the developing world,
things are quite different.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.545
There's 40 million people who need
a wheelchair but don't have one,
