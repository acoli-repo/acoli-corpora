I'd like to tell you today
about an orca named Tahlequah.

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:09.234
Tahlequah is also known
as J35 to scientists,

00:00:09.258 --> 00:00:12.661
because she swims with the J Pod
in the Salish Sea.

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:16.424
These are the waters off of
British Columbia and Washington State.

00:00:16.987 --> 00:00:20.151
Now, last year, in July 2018,

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:24.391
she was well along
in her 17-month pregnancy,

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:26.406
and scientists were very excited

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.615
because no baby had survived
in this pod for three long years.
