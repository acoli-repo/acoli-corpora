[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]

00:00:06.413 --> 00:00:08.246
I grew up in Kuwait in the early â€™90s,

00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:10.288
where I was raised by screens.

00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:14.704
The main windows to reality for me
were television and the internet.

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:16.996
Not because of their accuracy,

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:19.329
but because there were
storytelling machines.

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:21.996
These machines told stories
that contradict one another,

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:23.621
but all somehow seem true.

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:26.913
The Arab region knew Kuwait to be
one of the leading voices in media,

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:29.246
specifically for comedy shows and theater.

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:31.829
The rest of the world knew Kuwait
to be a small country
