00:12:27.208 --> 00:12:30.667
we all need to see ourselves
as chief executive officers.

00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:33.643
If we really want change,

00:12:33.667 --> 00:12:35.167
we have to be willing

00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.518
to bear the backlash.

00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:40.458
We're not always going to get it right,

00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:42.125
and that's OK.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.417
Real, substantive change takes time.

00:12:47.292 --> 00:12:49.625
The right answer keeps changing.

00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:53.500
But we have to try to do better.

00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:57.018
There's a quote that I love
that really captures

00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:58.375
the essence of this moment.

00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:02.083
It's by the American poet
Gwendolyn Brooks.
