00:03:02.592 --> 00:03:06.268
By definition,
a board can stand in the way

00:03:06.292 --> 00:03:08.750

Because often, a board
is elected by shareholders.

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:17.268
It represents their interests.

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:19.833
It's there to act on their behalf.

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.292
That's not just a dictionary definition.

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:26.518

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:28.226
and this can really limit

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.976
how much change a CEO or board can effect
