00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:02.083
It's by the American poet
Gwendolyn Brooks.

00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:05.976
"We are each other's harvest.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.351
We are each other's business.

00:13:08.375 --> 00:13:11.792
We are each other's magnitude and bond."

00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:18.018
Business is a set
of ever-changing human bonds

00:13:18.042 --> 00:13:23.059
through which we plant and grow and reap.

00:13:23.083 --> 00:13:26.184
Our harvest is our lives and livelihoods,

00:13:26.208 --> 00:13:29.917
our civil liberties,
our skills and communities.
