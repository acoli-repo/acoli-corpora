00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:31.309
So we already know that we cannot
just appoint a chief stakeholder officer

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:34.518
if we really want to serve
all stakeholders.

00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:36.958
Instead, we need to reset.

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.226
If we really want to serve
stakeholder needs,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.958
we need to get everyone involved.

00:02:43.917 --> 00:02:45.809
There are no quick fixes,

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:48.351
but I do have a few ideas.

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:51.143
Let's start at the top: the boardroom.

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:54.976
This is where a company's strategy
is set and governed,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.226
and if all stakeholder needs
aren't accounted for here,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.250
really, nothing's changing.
