00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:30.434
This is a change that business
absolutely needs to make,

00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:32.833
but that does not mean
it is going to be easy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.101
It's like going from being a young couple

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:37.851
to having kids.

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:39.684
When you're trying to make decisions

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:42.268
with just one other person
in the relationship,

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:43.976
it's pretty straightforward.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.059
Where should we have Sunday lunch?

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:47.792
What should we watch for the movie?

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:51.351
But when you add one child,

00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:52.893
a second child,

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:54.726
new decision makers,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.393
life gets complicated.

00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:00.726
And each one has their own unique needs
