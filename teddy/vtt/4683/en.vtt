Lately, a lot of chief executives

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:06.851
have promised to shift
their business model.

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:10.018
They pledge to serve all stakeholders,

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.184
not just shareholders.

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:14.601
Investment return, they say,

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.643
will no longer take precedence

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.268
over the health and welfare of employees,

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:20.601
suppliers,

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:22.351
even planet Earth.

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:24.268
Not just in a crisis,

00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:26.434
but every day.

00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:30.434
This is a change that business
absolutely needs to make,
