WEBVTT

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:02.476
We've all gone digital.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.184
We've responded
to new health care regulations.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.018
We've improved their productivity,

00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:09.851
made them more diverse and inclusive.

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:11.393
It took us a while to learn

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:15.101
that you can't actually
make a company more digital

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:18.184
by appointing a chief digital officer,

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:20.601
or that a chief diversity officer

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:24.917
could not single-handedly
make a company's culture more inclusive.

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:31.309
So we already know that we cannot
just appoint a chief stakeholder officer
