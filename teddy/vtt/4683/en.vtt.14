Working with activists and pension funds,

00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:06.184
they set three-year rolling goals

00:07:06.208 --> 00:07:09.042
with progress markers year by year.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.184
By 2050, they hope to reduce
their net carbon footprint

00:07:14.208 --> 00:07:15.726
by almost two thirds.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.083
That is a major reduction.

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:21.351
Initially, these targets
are linked to the bonuses

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:23.833
of their top 150 decision makers,

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.851
and over time the pay
of nearly 17,000 employees
