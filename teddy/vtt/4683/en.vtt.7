00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.976
how much change a CEO or board can effect

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.934
if they want to serve the needs
of more stakeholders.

00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.393
For years, if we're honest,

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:40.643
we've been ticking boxes:

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:43.583
ethnicity, age, gender.

00:03:44.417 --> 00:03:47.518
We've been looking for people
who look different,

00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:50.684
but boards still do the same thing.

00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:53.893
They look after the interests
of shareholders.

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:55.768
We don't need tokens.

00:03:55.792 --> 00:04:00.268
We need people who truly
understand the experience
