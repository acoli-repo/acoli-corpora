00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:38.601
But they each have real experience

00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:39.917
Every board is different.

00:04:40.917 --> 00:04:46.018
Imagine a world where corporate governance
was very different than today:

00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:50.184
community leaders sitting
on the boards of their local bank;

00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:54.393
moral philosophers
advising social media companies;

00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:59.268
environmental activists
as directors of global energy companies.

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:01.851
CEOs keep making pledges.
