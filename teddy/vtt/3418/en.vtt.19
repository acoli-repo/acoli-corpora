00:09:26.582 --> 00:09:30.148
Our spaces, our technology
will know what we're feeling.

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:33.521
We will know more about each other
than we ever have.

00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:38.218
We get a chance to reach in and connect
to the experience and sentiments

00:09:38.242 --> 00:09:39.984
that are fundamental to us as humans

00:09:40.008 --> 00:09:42.418
in our senses, emotionally and socially.

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:46.022
I believe it is the era of the empath.

00:09:46.046 --> 00:09:51.268
And we are enabling the capabilities
that true technological partners can bring

00:09:51.292 --> 00:09:54.339
to how we connect with each other
and with our technology.

00:09:54.363 --> 00:09:57.752
If we recognize the power
of becoming technological empaths,

00:09:57.776 --> 00:09:59.712
we get this opportunity

00:09:59.736 --> 00:10:04.160
where technology can help us bridge
the emotional and cognitive divide.
