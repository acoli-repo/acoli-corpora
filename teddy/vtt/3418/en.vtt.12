00:06:00.008 --> 00:06:04.008
just by analyzing the timing dynamics
of our speech and language

00:06:04.032 --> 00:06:05.475
picked up by microphones.

00:06:06.038 --> 00:06:09.918
Groups have shown that changes
in the statistics of our language

00:06:09.942 --> 00:06:11.362
paired with machine learning

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:14.547
can predict the likelihood
someone will develop psychosis.

00:06:15.442 --> 00:06:17.193
I'm going to take it a step further

00:06:17.217 --> 00:06:19.804
and look at linguistic changes
and changes in our voice

00:06:19.828 --> 00:06:22.067
that show up with a lot
of different conditions.

00:06:22.091 --> 00:06:26.458
Dementia, diabetes can alter
the spectral coloration of our voice.

00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:30.324
Changes in our language
associated with Alzheimer's
