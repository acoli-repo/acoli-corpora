00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:30.553
I could have made one louder.

You would have seen the same thing.

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:37.792
We might think we have more agency
over the reveal of our internal state

00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:39.395
than that spider,

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.685
but maybe we don't.

00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:43.990
Today's technology is starting
to make it really easy

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:46.704
to see the signals and tells
that give us away.

00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:50.403
The amalgamation of sensors
paired with machine learning

00:04:50.427 --> 00:04:52.840
on us, around us and in our environments,

00:04:52.864 --> 00:04:57.517
is a lot more than cameras and microphones
tracking our external actions.
