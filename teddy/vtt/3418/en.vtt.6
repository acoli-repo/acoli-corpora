it's wearing its internal
state on its sleeve.

00:03:01.768 --> 00:03:03.423
But us, humans --

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.334
we're different.

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:11.634
We like to think we have cognitive control
over what people see, know and understand

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.067
about our internal states --

00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:17.394
our emotions, our insecurities,
our bluffs, our trials and tribulations --

00:03:17.418 --> 00:03:18.685
and how we respond.

00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:22.209
We get to have our poker face.

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:24.999
Or maybe we don't.

00:03:25.728 --> 00:03:26.910
Try this with me.

00:03:26.934 --> 00:03:29.624
Your eye responds
to how hard your brain is working.
