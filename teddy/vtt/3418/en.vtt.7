00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:33.593
The response you're about to see
is driven entirely by mental effort

00:03:33.617 --> 00:03:36.252
and has nothing to do
with changes in lighting.

00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:37.926
We know this from neuroscience.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.510
I promise, your eyes are doing
the same thing as the subject in our lab,

00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:44.268
whether you want them to or not.

00:03:44.292 --> 00:03:46.465
At first, you'll hear some voices.

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.767
Try and understand them
and keep watching the eye in front of you.

00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:51.289
It's going to be hard at first,

00:03:51.313 --> 00:03:53.704
one should drop out,
and it should get really easy.

00:03:53.728 --> 00:03:57.053
You're going to see the change in effort
in the diameter of the pupil.
