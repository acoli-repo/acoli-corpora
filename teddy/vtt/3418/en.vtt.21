00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.345
between someone having
a mental health crisis

00:10:31.369 --> 00:10:33.195
and a different type of aggression,

00:10:33.219 --> 00:10:35.019
and responding accordingly.

00:10:35.609 --> 00:10:38.882
Or an artist, knowing
the direct impact of their work.

00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:42.816
Leo Tolstoy defined his perspective of art

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.625
by whether what the creator intended

00:10:44.649 --> 00:10:47.235
was experienced by the person
on the other end.

00:10:47.259 --> 00:10:49.825
Today's artists can know
what we're feeling.

00:10:50.204 --> 00:10:53.209
But regardless of whether
it's art or human connection,

00:10:54.608 --> 00:10:57.410
today's technologies
will know and can know

00:10:57.434 --> 00:10:59.482
what we're experiencing on the other side,

00:10:59.506 --> 00:11:02.124
and this means we can be
closer and more authentic.
