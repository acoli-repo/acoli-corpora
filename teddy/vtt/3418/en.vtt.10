00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:03.347
Our bodies radiate our stories

00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:06.037
from changes in the temperature
of our physiology.

00:05:06.546 --> 00:05:08.807
We can look at these
as infrared thermal images

00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:09.991
showing up behind me,

00:05:10.015 --> 00:05:12.085
where reds are hotter
and blues are cooler.

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:15.641
The dynamic signature
of our thermal response

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:18.696
gives away our changes in stress,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.728
how hard our brain is working,

00:05:20.752 --> 00:05:22.688
whether we're paying attention

00:05:22.712 --> 00:05:25.339
and engaged in the conversation
we might be having

00:05:25.363 --> 00:05:29.458
and even whether we're experiencing
a picture of fire as if it were real.

00:05:29.482 --> 00:05:32.125
We can actually see
people give off heat on their cheeks
