(Video) (Two overlapping voices talking)

00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:03.694
(Single voice) Intelligent technology
depends on personal data.

00:04:06.188 --> 00:04:09.164

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.006
PC: Your pupil doesn't lie.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.430
Your eye gives away your poker face.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.903
When your brain's having to work harder,

00:04:15.927 --> 00:04:18.712
your autonomic nervous system
drives your pupil to dilate.

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:20.291
When it's not, it contracts.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.371
When I take away one of the voices,

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.657
the cognitive effort
to understand the talkers

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:25.839
gets a lot easier.

00:04:25.863 --> 00:04:28.863
I could have put the two voices
in different spatial locations,

00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:30.553
I could have made one louder.
