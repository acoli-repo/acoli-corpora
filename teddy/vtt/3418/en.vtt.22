00:10:59.506 --> 00:11:02.124
and this means we can be
closer and more authentic.

00:11:02.498 --> 00:11:06.791
But I realize a lot of us
have a really hard time

00:11:06.815 --> 00:11:09.082
with the idea of sharing our data,

00:11:09.673 --> 00:11:12.784
and especially the idea
that people know things about us

00:11:12.808 --> 00:11:15.129
that we didn't actively choose to share.

00:11:16.728 --> 00:11:18.944
Anytime we talk to someone,

00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:21.501
look at someone

00:11:21.525 --> 00:11:22.993
or choose not to look,

00:11:23.017 --> 00:11:25.664
data is exchanged, given away,

00:11:26.533 --> 00:11:28.738
that people use to learn,

00:11:28.762 --> 00:11:32.029
make decisions about
their lives and about ours.
