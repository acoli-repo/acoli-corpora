Changing the music and the sound effects

00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:05.172
completely alter the emotional
impact of that scene.

00:09:05.196 --> 00:09:07.330
And we can see it in our breath.

00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:10.458
Suspense, fear, joy

00:09:10.482 --> 00:09:14.989
all show up as reproducible,
visually identifiable moments.

00:09:15.473 --> 00:09:19.624
We broadcast a chemical signature
of our emotions.

00:09:23.249 --> 00:09:25.382
It is the end of the poker face.

00:09:26.582 --> 00:09:30.148
Our spaces, our technology
will know what we're feeling.
