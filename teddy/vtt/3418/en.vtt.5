00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:32.562
And likely, the harmonics
of my voice as it went higher

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.316
coupled with how loud I was singing

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.807
recreated either the predatory call
of an echolocating bat or a bird,

00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:40.712
and the spider did what it should.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.117
It predictively told me to bug off.

00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:45.974
I love this.

00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:49.855
The spider's responding
to its external world

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.229
in a way that we get to see and know
what's happening to its internal world.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.275
Biology is controlling
the spider's response;

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.075
it's wearing its internal
state on its sleeve.
