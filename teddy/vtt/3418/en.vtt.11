We can actually see
people give off heat on their cheeks

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:34.349
in response to an image of flame.

00:05:36.013 --> 00:05:38.942
But aside from giving away
our poker bluffs,

00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:43.712
what if dimensions of data
from someone's thermal response

00:05:43.736 --> 00:05:46.395
gave away a glow
of interpersonal interest?

00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:50.498
Tracking the honesty of feelings
in someone's thermal image

00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:54.148
might be a new part of how
we fall in love and see attraction.

00:05:54.172 --> 00:05:57.865
Our technology can listen,
develop insights and make predictions

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:59.984
about our mental and physical health
