00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:05.337
What happens when technology
knows more about us than we do?

00:00:05.992 --> 00:00:09.664
A computer now can detect
our slightest facial microexpressions

00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:13.299
and be able to tell the difference
between a real smile and a fake one.

00:00:13.323 --> 00:00:15.057
That's only the beginning.

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.331
Technology has become
incredibly intelligent

00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:21.755
and already knows a lot
about our internal states.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:24.371
And whether we like it or not,

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:27.894
we already are sharing
parts of our inner lives

00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:29.651
that's out of our control.
