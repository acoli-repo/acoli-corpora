That seems like a problem,

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:36.104
because a lot of us like to keep
what's going on inside

00:00:36.128 --> 00:00:37.775
from what people actually see.

00:00:38.323 --> 00:00:42.743
We want to have agency
over what we share and what we don't.

00:00:43.473 --> 00:00:45.794
We all like to have a poker face.

00:00:47.584 --> 00:00:50.930
But I'm here to tell you
that I think that's a thing of the past.

00:00:51.347 --> 00:00:56.117
And while that might sound scary,
it's not necessarily a bad thing.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.800
I've spent a lot of time
studying the circuits in the brain

00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:03.517
that create the unique perceptual
realities that we each have.
