00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:31.212
between how they respond
to the world around them

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:33.244
and the state of their biological systems.

00:01:33.268 --> 00:01:37.077
This is where evolutionary pressures
like eating, mating

00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:38.863
and making sure we don't get eaten

00:01:38.887 --> 00:01:43.044
drive deterministic behavioral responses
to information in the world.

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:46.600
And we get to see into this window,

00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:50.260
into their internal states
and their biological experiences.

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:51.926
It's really pretty cool.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.053
Now, stay with me for a moment --
I'm a violinist, not a singer.

00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:59.667
But the spider's already
given me a critical review.
