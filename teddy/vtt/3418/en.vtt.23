make decisions about
their lives and about ours.

00:11:33.469 --> 00:11:37.437
I'm not looking to create a world
where our inner lives are ripped open

00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:39.809
and our personal data
and our privacy given away

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.546
to people and entities
where we don't want to see it go.

00:11:43.117 --> 00:11:45.879
But I am looking to create a world

00:11:45.903 --> 00:11:49.311
where we can care about
each other more effectively,

00:11:49.335 --> 00:11:52.395
we can know more about when
someone is feeling something

00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:54.291
that we ought to pay attention to.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.135
And we can have richer experiences
from our technology.

00:11:58.887 --> 00:12:01.244
Any technology
can be used for good or bad.
