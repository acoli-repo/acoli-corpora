00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.817
that lets us measure, in real time,
with high precision,

00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:04.763
the continuous differential
concentration of CO2.

00:08:05.246 --> 00:08:10.754
The clouds on the sides are actually
the real-time data visualization

00:08:10.778 --> 00:08:12.776
of the density of our CO2.

00:08:13.374 --> 00:08:17.073
You might still see
a patch of red on the screen,

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:20.802
because we're showing increases
with larger colored clouds,

00:08:20.826 --> 00:08:23.022
larger colored areas of red.

00:08:23.046 --> 00:08:25.605
And that's the point
where a lot of us jumped.

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:31.088
It's our collective suspense
driving a change in carbon dioxide.
