00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:03.683
It wasn't easy being Bobby, either.

00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:05.928
He was also the sibling of a president.

00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:08.303
But he adored his brother, Jack.

00:01:08.327 --> 00:01:09.787
He fought for him,

00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:11.371
he worked for him.

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:14.375
And when Jack died, he bled for him, too.

00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:18.699
In the years that followed,
Bobby would smile,

00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:20.354
but it seemed labored.

00:01:20.378 --> 00:01:22.485
He'd lose himself in his work,

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.469
but it seemed tortured.

00:01:24.493 --> 00:01:28.194
Bobby's own death, so similar to John's,

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:29.736
seems somehow fitting.
