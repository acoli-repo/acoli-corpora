00:02:00.174 --> 00:02:01.692
There's pageantry.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.914
There's petulance, too,

00:02:04.938 --> 00:02:07.381
as when Neil Bush,

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:11.314
sibling of both a president
and a governor, famously griped,

00:02:11.338 --> 00:02:16.460
"I've lost patience for being compared
to my older brothers,"

00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:20.291
as if Jeb and George W
were somehow responsible

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:23.179
for the savings and loan scandal
and the messy divorce

00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:25.894
that marked Neil in the public eye.

00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:29.950
But more important
than all of these things,

00:02:29.974 --> 00:02:33.195
the sibling bond can be
a thing of abiding love.
