TED has already persuaded me
to change my life in one small way,

00:00:05.395 --> 00:00:08.742
by persuading me to change
the opening of my speech.

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.841
I love this idea of engagement.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.073
So, when you leave here today,

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:18.023
I'm going to ask you
to engage or re-engage

00:00:18.047 --> 00:00:20.809
with some of the most important
people in your lives:

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:22.292
your brothers and sisters.

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:26.898
It can be a profoundly
life-affirming thing to do,

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:28.739
even if it isn't always easy.

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:32.411
