00:02:29.974 --> 00:02:33.195
the sibling bond can be
a thing of abiding love.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.022
Our parents leave us too early,

00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:39.012
our spouse and our children
come along too late.

00:02:39.036 --> 00:02:42.074
Our siblings are the only ones
who are with us

00:02:42.098 --> 00:02:43.574
for the entire ride.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.927
Over the arc of decades,
there may be nothing

00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:50.476
that defines us and forms us
more powerfully

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.699
than our relationship
with our sisters and brothers.

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:55.707
It was true for me,

00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:57.785
it's true for your children

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.293
and if you have siblings,
it's true for you, too.
