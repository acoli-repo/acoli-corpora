00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:32.411
This is a man named Elliot,

00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:35.387
for whom things were very difficult.

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:37.151
Elliot was a drunk.

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:41.149
He spent most of his life
battling alcoholism,

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:43.768
depression, morphine addiction,

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:47.195
and that life ended
when he was just 34 years old.

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:52.229
What made things harder for Elliot
is that his last name was Roosevelt.

00:00:52.253 --> 00:00:55.112
And he could never quite
get past the comparisons

00:00:55.136 --> 00:00:56.851
with his big brother Teddy,

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.972
for whom things always seemed
to come a little bit easier.
