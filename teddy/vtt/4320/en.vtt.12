As long as you can keep breathing,
you may as well keep stocking.

00:06:04.432 --> 00:06:08.112
Now, nature is perfectly happy
with that arrangement,

00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:10.824
because our primal directive here

00:06:10.848 --> 00:06:14.556
is to get as many of our genes
as possible into the next generation.

00:06:15.581 --> 00:06:18.377
Animals wrestle with
these same issues, too,

00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:21.829
but they have a more straightforward way
of dealing with things.

00:06:21.853 --> 00:06:25.540
A crested penguin that has laid two eggs
will take a good look at them

00:06:25.564 --> 00:06:28.199
and boot the smaller one out of the nest,

00:06:28.223 --> 00:06:31.885
the better to focus her attentions
on the presumably heartier chick
