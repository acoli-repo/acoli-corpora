00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.293
and if you have siblings,
it's true for you, too.

00:03:01.227 --> 00:03:05.169
This picture was taken when Steve,
on the left, was eight years old.

00:03:05.193 --> 00:03:10.152
I was six, our brother Gary was five
and my brother Bruce was four.

00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:12.326
I will not say what year it was taken.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.943
It was not this year.

00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:15.284
(Laughter)

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:18.067
I open my new book, "The Sibling Effect,"

00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:19.555
on a Saturday morning,

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.967
not long before this picture was taken,

00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:25.711
when the three older brothers decided
that it might be a very good idea

00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:29.218
to lock the younger brother
in a fuse cabinet in our playroom.

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.376
(Laughter)
