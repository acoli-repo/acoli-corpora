00:12:28.569 --> 00:12:30.994
in an area in which it could be scarce.

00:12:31.018 --> 00:12:34.573
Firstborns are also
vaccinated more reliably

00:12:34.597 --> 00:12:38.092
and tend to have more
follow-up visits to doctors

00:12:38.116 --> 00:12:39.388
when they get sick.

00:12:39.412 --> 00:12:41.539
And this pattern continues today.

00:12:41.563 --> 00:12:45.567
This IQ question is, sadly -- I can
say this as a second-born --

00:12:45.591 --> 00:12:47.280
a very real thing.

00:12:47.304 --> 00:12:51.053
Firstborns have a three-point
IQ advantage over second borns

00:12:51.077 --> 00:12:55.006
and second borns have a 1.5 IQ
advantage over later borns,

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.489
partly because of the exclusive attention
firstborns get from mom and dad,

00:12:59.513 --> 00:13:03.522
and partly because they get a chance
to mentor the younger kids.
