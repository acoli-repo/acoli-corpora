00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:01.283
The problem for scientists

00:07:01.892 --> 00:07:06.773
was that this whole idea of siblings
as second-class citizens

00:07:06.797 --> 00:07:09.634
never really seemed to hold up.

00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:13.672
After the researchers
had learned all they could

00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:19.616
from the relationships in the family,
mothers and other relationships,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.851
they still came up with some
temperamental dark matter

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.218
that was pulling at us,

00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:26.397
exerting a gravity all its own.

00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:28.753
And that could only be our siblings.

00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:33.818
Humans are no different from animals.
