00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:32.682
We're not alone.

00:05:32.706 --> 00:05:34.484
Until 15 years ago,

00:05:34.508 --> 00:05:37.862
scientists didn't really pay much
attention to the sibling bond.

00:05:37.886 --> 00:05:39.125
And with good reason:

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:42.275
you have just one mother,
you have just one father

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:45.599
if you do marriage right,
you have one spouse for life.

00:05:45.623 --> 00:05:48.201
Siblings can claim
none of that uniqueness.

00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:52.610
They're interchangeable, fungible,
a kind of household commodity.

00:05:52.634 --> 00:05:56.895
Parents set up shop and begin stocking
their shelves with inventory,

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.956
the only limitation being sperm,
egg and economics.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:00.987
