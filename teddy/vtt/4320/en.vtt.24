Long before scientists
began looking at this,

00:12:01.664 --> 00:12:05.114
parents noticed that there are
certain temperamental templates

00:12:05.138 --> 00:12:07.337
associated with all birth rankings:

00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:10.278
the serious, striving firstborn;

00:12:10.302 --> 00:12:12.659
the caught-in-a-thicket's middle born;

00:12:12.683 --> 00:12:15.285
the wild child of a last born.

00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:17.930
And once again, when science
did crack this field,

00:12:17.954 --> 00:12:20.298
they found out mom and dad are right.

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:24.721
Firstborns across history have tended
to be bigger and healthier

00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:26.015
than later borns,

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:28.545
in part, because of the head start
they got on food

00:12:28.569 --> 00:12:30.994
in an area in which it could be scarce.
