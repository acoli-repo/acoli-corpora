00:13:29.573 --> 00:13:31.977
the ability to charm and disarm,

00:13:32.001 --> 00:13:34.906
to intuit what's going on
in someone else's head,

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.525
the better to duck
the punch before it lands.

00:13:37.549 --> 00:13:38.922
(Laughter)

00:13:38.946 --> 00:13:41.603
They're also flat-out funnier,

00:13:41.627 --> 00:13:43.850
which is another thing
that comes in handy,

00:13:43.874 --> 00:13:47.802
because a person who's making you laugh
is a very hard person to slug.

00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:48.982
(Laughter)

00:13:49.006 --> 00:13:52.880
It's perhaps no coincidence
that over the course of history,

00:13:52.904 --> 00:13:54.945
some of our greatest satirists --

00:13:54.969 --> 00:13:56.145
Swift,

00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:57.787
Twain,

00:13:58.396 --> 00:13:59.681
Voltaire,
