00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:02.081
Molo ka mana tёw їwekїtomo?

00:00:02.707 --> 00:00:05.877
I am an Indigenous woman
from the Amazon rainforest.

00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:08.379
I don't look Indigenous, do I?

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:12.300
"You're Indigenous?" people always ask me.

00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:14.594
But don't worry, I get that a lot.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.598
I bet you expected
an exotic Indigenous woman

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:21.934
with a painted face
and feathers in her hair.

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:24.437
Probably a bow and arrow too.

00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:29.525
Well, today I won't be talking
about the looks of Indigenous people.
