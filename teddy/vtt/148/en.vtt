00:00:00.683 --> 00:00:05.083
It was November 1, 2002,

00:00:06.208 --> 00:00:08.958
my first day as a principal,

00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:14.469
but hardly my first day
in the school district of Philadelphia.

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:18.176
I graduated from
Philadelphia public schools,

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:22.375
and I went on to teach
special education for 20 years

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:25.792
in a low-income, low-performing school

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:27.783
in North Philadelphia,

00:00:28.292 --> 00:00:29.875
where crime is rampant
