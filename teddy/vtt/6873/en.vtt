In Warsaw, late October 1943,

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:16.204
Irena Sendler and Janina Grabowska 
were enjoying a rare moment of peace

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:17.954
in their war-torn city.

00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:23.788
But their laughter froze when they heard
the Gestapo pounding on Sendler’s door.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.454
Sendler rushed to the window to dispose
of incriminating evidence—

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:31.996
only to see more police patrolling below.
