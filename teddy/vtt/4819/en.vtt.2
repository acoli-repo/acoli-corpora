00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:03.211
funneling the unwanted fluid
into two muscular tubes called ureters.

00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:07.250
These carry it downward into
the hollow organ known as the bladder.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.591
This organ's muscular wall is made of
tissue called detrusor muscle

00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:16.769
which relaxes as the bladder fills
allowing it to inflate like a balloon.

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:19.820
As the bladder gets full, 
the detrusor contracts.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.041
The internal urethral sphincter
automatically and involuntarily opens,

00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:26.711
and the urine is released.

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:29.263
Whooshing downwards, 
the fluid enters the urethra

00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:32.210
and stops short at the external
urethral sphincter.
