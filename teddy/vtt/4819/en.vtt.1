00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:32.329
How bad is this habit,
and how long can our bodies withstand it?

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.589
The answers lie in the workings
of the bladder,

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:37.280
an oval pouch 
that sits inside the pelvis.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.568
Surrounding this structure 
are several other organs

00:00:40.568 --> 00:00:43.460
that together make up the whole
urinary system.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.599
Two kidneys,

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:45.939
two ureters,

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:48.030
two urethral sphincters,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.039
and a urethra.

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.110
Constantly trickling down from the kidneys
is the yellowish liquid known as urine.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.779
The kidneys make urine from a mix
of water and the body's waste products,

00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:03.211
funneling the unwanted fluid
into two muscular tubes called ureters.
