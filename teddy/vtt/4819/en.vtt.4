00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.103
and increasing the bladder's pressure
so you're aware that it's filling up.

00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:06.832
Simultaneously, the internal 
urethral sphincter opens.

00:02:06.832 --> 00:02:08.962
This is called the micturition reflex.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.754
The brain can counter it if it's not
a good time to urinate

00:02:11.754 --> 00:02:16.282
by sending another signal to contract
the external urethral sphincter.

00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:20.021
With about 150 to 200 milliliters of urine
inside of it,

00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:22.311
the bladder's muscular wall 
is stretched enough

00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:24.363
for you to sense 
that there's urine within.

00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:28.554
At about 400 to 500 milliliters,
the pressure becomes uncomfortable.

00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:31.233
The bladder can go on stretching,
but only to a point.
