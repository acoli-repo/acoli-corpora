00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:32.210
and stops short at the external
urethral sphincter.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.861
This works like a tap.

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:37.070
When you want to delay urinating,
you keep the sphincter closed.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.570
When you want to release it,
you can voluntarily open the flood gates.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.800
But how do you sense 
your bladder's fullness

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.400
so you know when to pee?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.181
Inside the layers of detrusor muscles
are millions of stretch receptors

00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:50.420
that get triggered as the bladder fills.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.792
They send signals along your nerves
to the sacral region in your spinal cord.

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:57.052
A reflex signal travels back to
your bladder,

00:01:57.052 --> 00:01:59.400
making the detrusor muscle 
contract slightly

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.103
and increasing the bladder's pressure
so you're aware that it's filling up.
