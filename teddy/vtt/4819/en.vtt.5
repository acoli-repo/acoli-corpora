00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:31.233
The bladder can go on stretching,
but only to a point.

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:33.742
Above 1,000 milliliters, it may burst.

00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:36.574
Most people would lose bladder
control before this happens,

00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:37.973
but in very rare cases,

00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:40.662
such as when as a person can't sense
the need to urinate,

00:02:40.662 --> 00:02:44.823
the pouch can rupture painfully
requiring surgery to fix.

00:02:44.823 --> 00:02:46.523
But under normal circumstances,

00:02:46.523 --> 00:02:50.583
your decision to urinate stops the brain's
signal to the external urethral sphincter,

00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:53.424
causing it to relax 
and the bladder to empty.

00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:56.963
The external urethral sphincter
is one of the muscles of the pelvic floor,

00:02:56.963 --> 00:02:59.933
and it provides support to the urethra
and bladder neck.

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.143
It's lucky we have these 
pelvic floor muscles
