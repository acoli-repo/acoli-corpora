00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.143
It's lucky we have these 
pelvic floor muscles

00:03:02.143 --> 00:03:04.833
because placing pressure on the system
by coughing,

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:05.625
sneezing,

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:06.462
laughing,

00:03:06.462 --> 00:03:09.085
or jumping could cause bladder leakage.

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:11.852
Instead, the pelvic floor muscles
keep the region sealed

00:03:11.852 --> 00:03:13.574
until you're ready to go.

00:03:13.574 --> 00:03:15.124
But holding it in for too long,

00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:17.254
forcing out your urine too fast,

00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:19.634
or urinating without proper
physical support

00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:24.244
may over time weaken or overwork
that muscular sling.

00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:26.475
That can lead to an overactive
pelvic floor,

00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:27.663
bladder pain,

00:03:27.663 --> 00:03:28.621
urgency,

00:03:28.621 --> 00:03:30.785
or urinary incontinence.
