in black and brown
middle-class communities,

00:07:01.652 --> 00:07:05.255
like the one that I visited
when I met a homeowner named Glenn.

00:07:06.982 --> 00:07:08.847
Glenn had owned a home

00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:12.442
on a leafy street in the Mount Pleasant
neighborhood of Cleveland

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:13.957

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:17.093

00:07:19.553 --> 00:07:21.131
he'd received a knock on the door

00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:23.948
from a broker promising
to refinance his mortgage.

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:28.858
But what the broker didn't tell him
was that this was a new kind of mortgage.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.426
A mortgage with an inflated interest rate,
