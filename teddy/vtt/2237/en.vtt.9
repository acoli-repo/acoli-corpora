In the 1930s and '40s,

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:36.449
the United States went on a nationwide
building boom of public amenities

00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:38.647
funded by tax dollars,

00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:43.338
which in Montgomery, Alabama,
included the Oak Park pool,

00:04:43.362 --> 00:04:46.260
which was the grandest one for miles.

00:04:46.284 --> 00:04:49.416
You know, back then,
people didn't have air conditioners,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.910
and so they spent their hot summer days

00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:56.739
in a steady rotation
of sunning and splashing

00:04:56.763 --> 00:05:00.355
and then cooling off
under a ring of nearby trees.
