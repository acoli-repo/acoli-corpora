00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:01.474
And it's made me rethink

00:03:01.498 --> 00:03:03.982
many of the economic problems
I've been focusing on

00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:05.616
my entire career.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:07.878
I wondered,

00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:13.704
is it possible that our society's racism

00:03:13.728 --> 00:03:19.355
has likewise been backfiring
on the very same people

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.934
set up to benefit from privilege?

00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:25.450
Driven by this question,

00:03:25.474 --> 00:03:27.919
I've spent the past few years
traveling the country,

00:03:27.943 --> 00:03:30.010
researching and writing a book.
