00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:39.022

00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:41.838
"Thank you."

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:45.684
I thanked him for admitting his prejudice,

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:48.328

and for knowing, somehow,

00:01:48.352 --> 00:01:51.168

The exchange between Gary

00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:59.287

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:02.684
and inspired waves
of social media commentary
