00:12:27.272 --> 00:12:30.707
about the newcomers
being a drain on the town,

00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:36.045
a bipartisan think tank found
that the local refugee community there

00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:38.720
created 40 million dollars in tax revenue,

00:12:38.744 --> 00:12:40.839
and 130 million in income.

00:12:41.149 --> 00:12:43.054
And I talked to the town administrator,

00:12:43.078 --> 00:12:46.472
who was boasting about the fact
that Lewiston was building a new school,

00:12:46.496 --> 00:12:49.386
when all the rest of towns
like theirs in Maine

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.610
was closing them.

00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:56.029
You know, it costs us so much
to remain divided.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.030
This zero-sum thinking,

00:12:58.054 --> 00:13:01.441
that's what's good for one group
has to come at the expense of another,
