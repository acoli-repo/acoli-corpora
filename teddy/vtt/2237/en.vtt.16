to see the crisis for what it was

00:08:02.123 --> 00:08:04.723
back when we still had time to stop it.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.430
But that's all it was.

00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:08.604
A stereotype.

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:14.588
The majority of subprime mortgages
went to people who had good credit,

00:08:14.612 --> 00:08:15.940
like Glenn.

00:08:15.964 --> 00:08:20.416
And African Americans and Latinos
were three times as likely --

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.384
even if they had good credit --

00:08:22.408 --> 00:08:25.249
than white people,
to get sold these toxic loans.

00:08:25.273 --> 00:08:27.085
The problem wasn't the borrower --

00:08:27.109 --> 00:08:28.776
the problem was the loan.
