00:08:33.903 --> 00:08:39.045
most of the nation's big lenders,
from Wells Fargo to Countrywide,

00:08:39.069 --> 00:08:42.180
would go on to be fined
for racial discrimination.

00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:44.920
But that realization came too late.

00:08:45.586 --> 00:08:48.547
These loans, superprofitable
for the lenders

00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:50.928
but designed to fail for the borrowers,

00:08:50.952 --> 00:08:52.839
spread out past the confines

00:08:52.863 --> 00:08:55.291
of black and brown
neighborhoods like Glenn's

00:08:55.315 --> 00:08:58.950
and into the wider,
whiter mortgage market.
