00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:02.880
I am a public policy wonk.

00:00:03.317 --> 00:00:08.111
I investigate data that points to problems
in the American economy --

00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:11.236
problems like rising household debt,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.212
declining wages and benefits,

00:00:13.236 --> 00:00:15.331
shortfalls in public revenue.

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:18.164
And I try to pinpoint solutions

00:00:18.188 --> 00:00:21.456
to make our economy
more prosperous for more people.

00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:25.918
I geek out about tax policy

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.990
and infrastructure investments,

00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:29.681
and I get really excited

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:32.664
by a gracefully designed
regulatory regime.
