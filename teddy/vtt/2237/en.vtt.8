00:03:57.681 --> 00:04:01.726
America's underinvestment
in our public goods,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.546
the things that we all need,
that we share in common --

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.731
our schools and roads and bridges.

00:04:07.755 --> 00:04:10.096
Our infrastructure gets a D plus

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.008
from the American Society
of Civil Engineers,

00:04:13.032 --> 00:04:16.722
and we invest less per capita
than almost every other advanced nation.

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:19.196
But it wasn't always this way.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.823
I traveled to Montgomery, Alabama,

00:04:21.847 --> 00:04:26.570
and there, I saw how racism
can destroy a public good

00:04:26.594 --> 00:04:28.860
and the public will to support it.
