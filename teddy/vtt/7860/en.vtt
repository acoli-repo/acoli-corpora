00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:03.291
People often ask me

00:00:03.332 --> 00:00:07.128
what they can do to help
address the climate crisis.

00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:08.838
But what they usually mean

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:12.925
is whatâ€™s one quick, easy,
simple thing they can do.

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:16.095
Well, that particular ship has sailed.

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.474
The climate challenge is gargantuan.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:21.768
Thanks largely to fossil fuel executives

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:24.979
and the PR firms and politicians
doing their bidding.

00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:28.524
We need to eliminate
greenhouse gas emissions

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:32.904
from electricity, transportation,
agriculture, industry and buildings.
