00:00:00.944 --> 00:00:02.967
I want to talk to you tonight

00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:06.227
about the work that makes
all other work possible,

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.638
about the millions of women
who go to work in our homes

00:00:11.662 --> 00:00:13.843
every single day,

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:17.648
caring for children as nannies,

00:00:17.672 --> 00:00:21.142
caring for our loved ones
with disabilities and our elders,

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.754
as home care workers,

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:27.474
maintaining sanity
in our homes as cleaners.

00:00:27.498 --> 00:00:30.440
It's the work that makes
all other work possible.
