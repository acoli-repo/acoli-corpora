00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:01.128
going back to antiquity.

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:03.078
But unlike his predecessors,

00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:06.248
Machiavelli didn’t try to describe an 
ideal government

00:01:06.248 --> 00:01:09.928
or exhort his audience to rule 
justly and virtuously.

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:13.208
Instead, he focused on the 
question of power–

00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:16.628
how to acquire it, and how to keep it.

00:01:16.628 --> 00:01:18.898
And in the decades after it was published,

00:01:18.898 --> 00:01:22.648
The Prince gained a diabolical reputation.

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:24.888
During the European Wars of Religion,

00:01:24.888 --> 00:01:28.118
both Catholics and Protestants 
blamed Machiavelli

00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:32.768
for inspiring acts of violence and tyranny
committed by their opponents.
