00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:33.388
But is it possible that we’ve been using 
that word wrong this whole time?

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:37.388
The early 16th century statesman Niccoló 
Machiavelli

00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:41.468
wrote many works of history, philosophy, 
and drama.

00:00:41.468 --> 00:00:47.638
But his lasting notoriety comes from a 
brief political essay known as The Prince,

00:00:47.638 --> 00:00:51.088
framed as advice to current 
and future monarchs.

00:00:51.088 --> 00:00:53.818
Machiavelli wasn’t the first to do this–

00:00:53.818 --> 00:00:58.648
in fact there was an entire tradition of 
works known as “mirrors for princes”

00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:01.128
going back to antiquity.
