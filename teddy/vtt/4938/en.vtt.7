But what we know about Machiavelli might
not fit this picture.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.423
The author had served in his native 
Florence for 14 years as a diplomat,

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:38.880

against would-be monarchs.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.440
When the Medici family seized power,

but a scathing description 
of how it operates.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.930
Indeed, Enlightenment figures like Spinoza
