00:02:54.711 --> 00:03:00.181
and a desire for peace in an Italy torn by
internal and external conflict.

00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:01.481
According to this view,

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.111
Machiavelli was the first to understand 
a difficult truth:

00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.411
the greater good of political stability

00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:12.191
is worth whatever unsavory tactics 
are needed to attain it.

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:16.751
The philosopher Isaiah Berlin suggested 
that rather than being amoral,

00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:20.111
The Prince hearkens back to 
ancient Greek morality,

00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:26.281
placing the glory of the state above the 
Christian ideal of individual salvation.

00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:30.370
But what we know about Machiavelli might
not fit this picture.
