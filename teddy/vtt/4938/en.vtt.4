and to commit them in a single stroke

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.359
to ensure future stability.

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.359
Attacking neighboring territories and 
oppressing religious minorities

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.869
such as honesty or generosity,

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:32.689
but being ready to abandon them as soon 
as one’s interests are threatened.
