for inspiring acts of violence and tyranny
committed by their opponents.

00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:34.251
By the end of the century,

00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:39.111
Shakespeare was using “Machiavel” to 
denote an amoral opportunist,

00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:42.321
leading directly to our popular use of 
“Machiavellian”

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:45.741
as a synonym for manipulative villainy.

00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:46.981
At first glance,

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:51.861
The Prince’s reputation as a manual for 
tyranny seems well-deserved.

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:57.141
Throughout, Machiavelli appears entirely 
unconcerned with morality,

00:01:57.141 --> 00:02:02.258
except insofar as it’s helpful or harmful 
to maintaining power.
