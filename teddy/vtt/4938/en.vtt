From Shakespeare’s plays 
to modern TV dramas,

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:15.966
the unscrupulous schemer for whom 
the ends always justify the means

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:20.040
has become a familiar character type 
we love to hate.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.925
So familiar, in fact, that for centuries

00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:28.235
we’ve had a single word to describe 
such characters: Machiavellian.

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:33.388
But is it possible that we’ve been using 
that word wrong this whole time?
