00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.460
this much.

00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:33.107
Now, this much.

00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.569
That's how much time we spend
of that free time in front of our screens.

00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:39.896
This yellow area, this thin sliver,
is where the magic happens.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.502
That's where your humanity lives.

00:03:41.526 --> 00:03:43.558
And right now, it's in a very small box.

00:03:44.243 --> 00:03:45.868
So what do we do about this?

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.249
Well, the first question is:

00:03:47.273 --> 00:03:49.132
What does that red space look like?

00:03:49.156 --> 00:03:51.261
Now, of course, screens are miraculous

00:03:51.285 --> 00:03:52.713
in a lot of ways.

00:03:52.737 --> 00:03:53.994
I live in New York,

00:03:54.018 --> 00:03:56.016
a lot of my family lives in Australia,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.470
and I have a one-year-old son.

00:03:57.494 --> 00:04:01.392
The way I've been able to introduce
them to him is with screens.
