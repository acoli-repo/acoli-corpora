00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.183
as a professor of business and psychology,

00:02:01.207 --> 00:02:03.911
I've been studying the effect
of screens on our lives.

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:08.971
And I want to start by just focusing
on how much time they take from us,

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.501
and then we can talk about
what that time looks like.

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:14.192
What I'm showing you here
is the average 24-hour workday

00:02:14.216 --> 00:02:16.554
at three different points in history:

00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:18.580
2007 -- 10 years ago --

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:20.063
2015

00:02:20.087 --> 00:02:23.105
and then data that I collected,
actually, only last week.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.878
And a lot of things haven't changed

00:02:24.902 --> 00:02:26.053
all that much.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.095
We sleep roughly seven-and-a-half
to eight hours a day;
