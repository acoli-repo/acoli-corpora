These apps make them much less happy.

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.703
About half the people, when you interrupt
them and say, "How do you feel?"

00:04:35.727 --> 00:04:37.835
say they don't feel good about using them.

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:39.490
What's interesting about these --

00:04:39.514 --> 00:04:41.224
dating, social networking, gaming,

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:43.974
entertainment, news, web browsing --

00:04:43.998 --> 00:04:46.604
people spend 27 minutes a day
on each of these.

00:04:46.628 --> 00:04:50.180
We're spending three times longer
on the apps that don't make us happy.

00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:51.872
That doesn't seem very wise.

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:55.424
One of the reasons we spend
so much time on these apps

00:04:55.448 --> 00:04:56.600
that make us unhappy

00:04:56.624 --> 00:04:58.156
is they rob us of stopping cues.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.559
Stopping cues were everywhere
in the 20th century.
