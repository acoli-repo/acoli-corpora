00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.095
We sleep roughly seven-and-a-half
to eight hours a day;

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.436
some people say that's declined slightly,
but it hasn't changed much.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.714
We work eight-and-a-half
to nine hours a day.

00:02:36.738 --> 00:02:38.470
We engage in survival activities --

00:02:38.494 --> 00:02:41.621
these are things like eating
and bathing and looking after kids --

00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:42.801
about three hours a day.

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:44.353
That leaves this white space.

00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:46.044
That's our personal time.

00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:48.856
That space is incredibly important to us.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:52.168
That's the space where we do things
that make us individuals.

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.293
That's where hobbies happen,
where we have close relationships,

00:02:55.317 --> 00:02:58.199
where we really think about our lives,
where we get creative,

00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:00.037
where we zoom back and try to work out
