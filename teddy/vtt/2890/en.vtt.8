The way I've been able to introduce
them to him is with screens.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:03.506
I couldn't have done that
15 or 20 years ago

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.688
in quite the same way.

00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:06.869
So there's a lot of good
that comes from them.

00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:08.739
One thing you can do is ask yourself:

00:04:08.763 --> 00:04:10.846
What goes on during that time?

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.308
How enriching are the apps
that we're using?

00:04:13.332 --> 00:04:14.606
And some are enriching.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.072
If you stop people while
they're using them and say,

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:18.684
"Tell us how you feel right now,"

00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:21.104
they say they feel pretty good
about these apps --

00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:24.488
those that focus on relaxation,
exercise, weather, reading,

00:04:24.512 --> 00:04:26.055
education and health.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:29.213
They spend an average of nine
minutes a day on each of these.

00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:31.567
These apps make them much less happy.
