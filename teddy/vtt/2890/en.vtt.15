00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:31.042
as far away as possible.

00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:33.375
Because we're really bad
at resisting temptation.

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.470
But when you have a stopping cue
that, every time dinner begins,

00:07:36.494 --> 00:07:37.650
my phone goes far away,

00:07:37.674 --> 00:07:39.342
you avoid temptation all together.

00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:41.083
At first, it hurts.

00:07:41.107 --> 00:07:42.729
I had massive FOMO.

00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:43.819
(Laughter)

00:07:43.843 --> 00:07:45.009
I struggled.

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:47.299
But what happens is, you get used to it.

00:07:47.323 --> 00:07:50.421
You overcome the withdrawal
the same way you would from a drug,

00:07:50.445 --> 00:07:53.230
and what happens is, life becomes
more colorful, richer,

00:07:53.254 --> 00:07:54.409
more interesting --

00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:56.083
you have better conversations.

00:07:56.107 --> 00:07:59.131
You really connect with the people
who are there with you.

00:07:59.155 --> 00:08:00.799
I think it's a fantastic strategy,
