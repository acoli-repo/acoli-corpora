00:06:59.346 --> 00:07:01.645
about what we should do
at home in our own lives,

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.351
so I want to make some suggestions.

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:07.868
It's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm,
I'm going to not use my phone.

00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:11.323
The problem is, 5 and 6pm
looks different on different days.

00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:13.534
I think a far better strategy is to say,

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.027
I do certain things every day,

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:17.405
there are certain occasions
that happen every day,

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:18.688
like eating dinner.

00:07:18.712 --> 00:07:20.030
Sometimes I'll be alone,

00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:21.560
sometimes with other people,

00:07:21.584 --> 00:07:22.863
sometimes in a restaurant,

00:07:22.887 --> 00:07:24.075
sometimes at home,

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:27.745
but the rule that I've adopted is:
I will never use my phone at the table.

00:07:28.123 --> 00:07:29.557
It's far away,

00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:31.042
as far away as possible.
