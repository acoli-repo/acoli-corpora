way better than a laptop,
way better than a smartphone.

00:01:01.698 --> 00:01:03.225
It's an incredible experience."

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.034
A couple of months later,
he was approached by a journalist

00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:07.214
from the New York Times,

00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:08.737
and they had a long phone call.

00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:09.931
At the end of the call,

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:13.345
the journalist threw in a question
that seemed like a sort of softball.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.944
He said to him, "Your kids
must love the iPad."

00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:18.432
There's an obvious answer to this,

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:21.075
but what Jobs said
really staggered the journalist.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:22.290
He was very surprised,

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:24.889
because he said, "They haven't used it.

00:01:24.913 --> 00:01:27.835
We limit how much technology
our kids use at home."

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.722
This is a very common thing
in the tech world.
