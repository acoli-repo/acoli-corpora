And at 6pm every day,

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:03.428
it doesn't matter who you're emailing
or what you're doing,

00:06:03.452 --> 00:06:04.929
the desks rise to the ceiling.

00:06:04.953 --> 00:06:06.061
(Laughter)

00:06:06.085 --> 00:06:07.335
(Applause)

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:11.602
Four days a week, the space
turns into a yoga studio,

00:06:11.626 --> 00:06:13.257
one day a week, into a dance club.

00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:15.810
It's really up to you which ones
you stick around for.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.521
But this is a great stopping rule,

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:19.432
because it means at the end of the day,

00:06:19.456 --> 00:06:21.493
everything stops, there's no way to work.

00:06:21.517 --> 00:06:24.961
At Daimler, the German car company,
they've got another great strategy.

00:06:24.985 --> 00:06:26.515
When you go on vacation,

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.743
instead of saying,
"This person's on vacation,

00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:30.490
they'll get back to you eventually,"
