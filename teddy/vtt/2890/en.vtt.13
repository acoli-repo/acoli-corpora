they'll get back to you eventually,"

00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:33.736
they say, "This person's on vacation,
so we've deleted your email.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.406
This person will never see
the email you just sent."

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.446
(Laughter)

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.111
"You can email back in a couple of weeks,

00:06:40.135 --> 00:06:41.621

and you're actually on vacation.

00:06:53.026 --> 00:06:54.995
The people who work at this company feel

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:57.381
that they actually get a break from work.

00:06:57.405 --> 00:06:59.322
But of course, that doesn't tell us much

00:06:59.346 --> 00:07:01.645
about what we should do
at home in our own lives,
