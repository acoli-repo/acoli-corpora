00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.559
Stopping cues were everywhere
in the 20th century.

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:02.447
They were baked into everything we did.

00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:05.887
A stopping cue is basically a signal
that it's time to move on,

00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:08.608
to do something new,
to do something different.

00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:11.828
And -- think about newspapers;
eventually you get to the end,

00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:14.149
you fold the newspaper away,
you put it aside.

00:05:14.173 --> 00:05:17.331
The same with magazines, books --
you get to the end of a chapter,

00:05:17.355 --> 00:05:20.132
prompts you to consider
whether you want to continue.

00:05:20.504 --> 00:05:23.202
You watched a show on TV,
eventually the show would end,

00:05:23.226 --> 00:05:25.631
and then you'd have a week
until the next one came.

00:05:25.655 --> 00:05:27.409
There were stopping cues everywhere.

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:31.183
But the way we consume media today
is such that there are no stopping cues.
