WEBVTT

00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:00.037
where we zoom back and try to work out

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:01.921
whether our lives have been meaningful.

00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:03.773
We get some of that from work as well,

00:03:03.797 --> 00:03:05.712
but when people look back on their lives

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:07.740
and wonder what their lives have been like

00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:09.007
at the end of their lives,

00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:10.918
you look at the last things they say --

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:14.643
they are talking about those moments
that happen in that white personal space.

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:16.670
So it's sacred; it's important to us.

00:03:16.694 --> 00:03:18.545
Now, what I'm going to do is show you

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.821
how much of that space
is taken up by screens across time.

00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:23.170
In 2007,

00:03:23.194 --> 00:03:24.345
this much.

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.349
That was the year that Apple
introduced the first iPhone.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.571
Eight years later,

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.460
this much.
