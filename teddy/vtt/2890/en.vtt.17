00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:33.845
But the way we use them is a lot like
driving down a really fast, long road,

00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:37.032
and you're in a car where the accelerator
is mashed to the floor,

00:08:37.056 --> 00:08:39.104
it's kind of hard
to reach the brake pedal.

00:08:39.128 --> 00:08:40.620
You've got a choice.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.673
You can either glide by, past,
say, the beautiful ocean scenes

00:08:45.697 --> 00:08:48.793
and take snaps out the window --
that's the easy thing to do --

00:08:48.817 --> 00:08:52.357
or you can go out of your way
to move the car to the side of the road,

00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:53.853
to push that brake pedal,

00:08:53.877 --> 00:08:55.030
to get out,

00:08:55.054 --> 00:08:56.935
take off your shoes and socks,

00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:59.224
take a couple of steps onto the sand,

00:08:59.248 --> 00:09:01.488
feel what the sand feels like
under your feet,
