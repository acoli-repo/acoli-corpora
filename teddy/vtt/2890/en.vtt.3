This is a very common thing
in the tech world.

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:34.181
In fact, there's a school
quite near Silicon Valley

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:36.478
called the Waldorf School

00:01:47.342 --> 00:01:50.857

00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:55.894
and to my family and the people I loved,

00:01:55.918 --> 00:01:57.180
and to people at large.

00:01:57.204 --> 00:01:59.126
So for the last five years,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.183
as a professor of business and psychology,
