So, a few years ago I heard
an interesting rumor.

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:06.777
Apparently, the head
of a large pet food company

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.056
would go into the annual
shareholder's meeting

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.541
with can of dog food.

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:12.666
And he would eat the can of dog food.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.243
And this was his way of convincing them
that if it was good enough for him,

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:17.944
it was good enough for their pets.

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:20.404
This strategy is now known
as "dogfooding,"

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:22.747
and it's a common strategy
in the business world.

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:25.255
It doesn't mean everyone
goes in and eats dog food,

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.500
but businesspeople
will use their own products

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:29.061
to demonstrate that they feel --

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:30.790
that they're confident in them.
