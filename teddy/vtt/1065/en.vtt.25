00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
which is going to be life in the country for everybody.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
the country villa along the railroad line,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
but to return to the countryside every night.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
so it really was a form of country living.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
But what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years
