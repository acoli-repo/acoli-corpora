00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
You know, that's not good enough.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
We have to do good buildings.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it:

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
To spatially denote the pedestrian realm,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and to soften the hardscape of the buildings

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and to create a ceiling -- a vaulted ceiling -- over the street, at its best.
