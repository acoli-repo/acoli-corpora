If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
It's really incredible.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Anyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
when we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
where the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Of course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.
