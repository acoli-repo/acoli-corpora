When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And I want you to think about that when you think about

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
spilling their blood in the sand,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and ask yourself, "What is their last thought of home?"

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We need better places in this country.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Public space. This is a good public space.
