in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It's not that complicated:

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
you know, apartments, offices, and so on.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.
