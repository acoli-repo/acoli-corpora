By the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter)

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and they shouted at me and said,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
"It was raining that day when you took that picture!"

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Because this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter)

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
You know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter)
