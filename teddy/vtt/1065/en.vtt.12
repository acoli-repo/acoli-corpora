00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
designed by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Boston City Hall Plaza.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter)

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This is the other side of the building.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
This was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
It wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.000
but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block.
