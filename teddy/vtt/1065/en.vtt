00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The immersive ugliness

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of our everyday environments in America

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is entropy made visible.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We can't overestimate the amount of despair

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that we are generating with places like this.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do better

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America.
