00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There are a lot of ways you can describe this.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You know, I like to call it "the national automobile slum."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck.
