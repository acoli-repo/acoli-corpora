Of course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
we pop a handicapped ramp on that,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And that's how we do it.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I call them "nature Band-Aids" because there's a general idea in America

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.
