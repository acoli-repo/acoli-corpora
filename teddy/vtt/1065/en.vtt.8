If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and try to look at the Target store over here,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
These will be places that are not worth caring about.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We have about, you know, 38,000 places

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that are not worth caring about in the United States today.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending.
