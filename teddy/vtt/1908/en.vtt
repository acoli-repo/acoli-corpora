00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.952
I made a film that was impossible to make,

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:07.603
but I didn't know it was impossible,

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:10.395
and that's how I was able to do it.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.855
"Mars et Avril" is a science fiction film.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:17.053
It's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future.

00:00:17.053 --> 00:00:19.255
No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:22.937
because it's expensive, it's set in the future,

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:24.597
and it's got tons of visual effects,

00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:27.028
and it's shot on green screen.

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.179
Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.164
ever since I was a kid, really,
