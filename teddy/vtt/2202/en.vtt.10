WEBVTT

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:02.059
It has a massively elongated orbit

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:06.018
that takes 10,000 years
to go around the Sun.

00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:08.059
We named this object Sedna

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:09.934
after the Inuit goddess of the sea,

00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:14.018
in honor of the cold, icy places
where it spends all of its time.

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:15.643
We now know that Sedna,

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:17.434
it's about a third the size of Pluto

00:05:17.458 --> 00:05:19.518
and it's a relatively typical member

00:05:19.542 --> 00:05:22.351
of those icy bodies out beyond Neptune.

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:26.226
Relatively typical,
except for this bizarre orbit.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.018
You might look at this orbit and say,

00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:30.768
"Yeah, that's bizarre,
10,000 years to go around the Sun,"
