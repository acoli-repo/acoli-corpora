00:06:30.208 --> 00:06:33.101
I actually thought I knew
what the answer was.

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:37.143
Sure, it could have been
some distant, giant planet

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:38.434
in the outer solar system,

00:06:38.458 --> 00:06:40.809
but by this time,
that idea was so ridiculous

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.684
and had been so thoroughly discredited

00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:44.518
that I didn't take it very seriously.

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:45.809
But 4.5 billion years ago,

00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:50.684
when the Sun formed in a cocoon
of hundreds of other stars,

00:06:50.708 --> 00:06:51.976
any one of those stars

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.643
could have gotten
just a little bit too close to Sedna

00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:58.643
and perturbed it onto the orbit
that it has today.

00:06:58.667 --> 00:07:02.559
When that cluster of stars
dissipated into the galaxy,
