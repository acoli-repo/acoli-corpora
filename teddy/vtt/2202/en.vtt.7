00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:30.184
and in that little circle
in the very center is the Earth

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:33.184
and the Sun and almost everything
that you know and love.

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:35.018
And those yellow circles at the edge

00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:37.809
are these icy bodies
out beyond the planets.

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:40.101
These icy bodies are pushed and pulled

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:42.268
by the gravitational fields of the planets

00:03:42.292 --> 00:03:44.809
in entirely predictable ways.

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:49.542
Everything goes around the Sun
exactly the way it is supposed to.

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.226
Almost.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.309
So in 2003,

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.226
I discovered what was at the time

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.934
the most distant known object
in the entire solar system.

00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.434
It's hard not to look
at that lonely body out there
