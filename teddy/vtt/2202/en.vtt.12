00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.393
in that region of icy bodies,

00:06:00.417 --> 00:06:02.941
had gotten a little bit
too close to Neptune one time,

00:06:02.965 --> 00:06:05.799
and then got slingshot out
and is now on its way back in.

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:12.059
But Sedna never comes close
to anything known in the solar system

00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:14.476
that could have given it that slingshot.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.518
Neptune can't be responsible,

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:19.643
but something had to be responsible.

00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:22.601
This was the first time since 1845

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:27.559
that we saw the gravitational effects
of something in the outer solar system

00:06:27.583 --> 00:06:29.083
and didn't know what it was.
