00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:30.518
messing with those orbits.

00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:33.101
And so when Pluto was discovered in 1930

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:34.768
at the Lowell Observatory,

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:39.226
everybody assumed that it must be
the planet that Lowell had predicted.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.643
They were wrong.

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:45.768
It turns out, Uranus and Neptune
are exactly where they're supposed to be.

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:47.351
It took 100 years,

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.143
but Bouvard was eventually right.

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:52.768
Astronomers needed to do
better measurements.

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:54.559
And when they did,

00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:57.768
those better measurements
had turned out that

00:02:57.792 --> 00:03:02.809
there is no planet just beyond
the orbit of Uranus and Neptune
