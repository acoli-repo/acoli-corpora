00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.792
I'm going to tell you a story
from 200 years ago.

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:08.059
In 1820, French astronomer Alexis Bouvard

00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:13.309
almost became the second person
in human history to discover a planet.

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.643
He'd been tracking the position
of Uranus across the night sky

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:18.393
using old star catalogs,

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:20.726
and it didn't quite go around the Sun

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.184
the way that his predictions
said it should.

00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:25.309
Sometimes it was a little too fast,

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.018
sometimes a little too slow.

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:30.768
Bouvard knew that
his predictions were perfect.
