00:08:28.417 --> 00:08:31.726
but they're all looking 45 degrees
to the direction of motion.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.583
What could cause something like that?

00:08:34.917 --> 00:08:36.184
I have no idea.

00:08:36.208 --> 00:08:39.934
It's very difficult to think of any reason
that that would happen.

00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.309
(Laughter)

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:44.184
And this is essentially
what that clustering

00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:47.601
in argument of perihelion was telling us.

00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:51.184
Scientists were generally baffled
and they assumed it must just be a fluke

00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:52.559
and some bad observations.

00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:54.351
They told the astronomers,

00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:56.768
"Do better measurements."

00:08:56.792 --> 00:08:59.893
I actually took a very careful look
at those measurements, though,

00:08:59.917 --> 00:09:01.184
and they were right.
