00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.726
that is forcing these patterns
for these objects

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.768
in the outer solar system.

00:10:32.792 --> 00:10:34.934
Guess what else a planet like this does.

00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.809
Remember that strange orbit of Sedna,

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:39.768
how it was kind of pulled away
from the Sun in one direction?

00:10:39.792 --> 00:10:43.518
A planet like this would make
orbits like that all day long.

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.851
We knew we were onto something.

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:48.851
So this brings us to today.

00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:53.059
We are basically 1845, Paris.

00:10:53.083 --> 00:10:54.268
(Laughter)

00:10:54.292 --> 00:10:59.601
We see the gravitational effects
of a distant, giant planet,

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:01.851
and we are trying to work out
the calculations
