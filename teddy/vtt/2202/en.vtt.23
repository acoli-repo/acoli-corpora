This is the fifth largest planet
in our entire solar system.

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:36.018
For context, let me show you
the sizes of the planets.

00:11:36.042 --> 00:11:40.184
In the back there,
you can the massive Jupiter and Saturn.

Next to them, a little bit smaller,
Uranus and Neptune.

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:46.352
Up in the corner, the terrestrial planets,
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.

00:11:46.376 --> 00:11:47.726
You can even see that belt

00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:55.215

00:11:56.583 --> 00:11:59.018
Planet Nine is big.

00:11:59.042 --> 00:12:00.309
Planet Nine is so big,
