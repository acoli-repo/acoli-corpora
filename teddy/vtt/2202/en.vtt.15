00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:31.684
which is super exciting.

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:33.232
But what's even more interesting

00:07:33.256 --> 00:07:36.018
is that they found that all these objects

00:07:36.042 --> 00:07:39.934
are not only on these distant,
elongated orbits,

00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:45.309
they also share a common value
of this obscure orbital parameter

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:49.292
that in celestial mechanics we call
argument of perihelion.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.184
When they realized it was clustered
in argument of perihelion,

00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:54.976
they immediately jumped up and down,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.976
saying it must be caused
by a distant, giant planet out there,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.059
which is really exciting,
except it makes no sense at all.
