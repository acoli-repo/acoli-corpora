00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.059
which is really exciting,
except it makes no sense at all.

00:08:01.083 --> 00:08:03.601
Let me try to explain it
to you why with an analogy.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:06.934
Imagine a person walking down a plaza

00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.292
and looking 45 degrees to his right side.

00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:13.184
There's a lot of reasons
that might happen,

00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:15.143
it's super easy to explain, no big deal.

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:16.976
Imagine now many different people,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.893
all walking in different
directions across the plaza,

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:24.184
but all looking 45 degrees
to the direction that they're moving.

00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:26.226
Everybody's moving
in different directions,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.393
everybody's looking
in different directions,

00:08:28.417 --> 00:08:31.726
but they're all looking 45 degrees
to the direction of motion.
