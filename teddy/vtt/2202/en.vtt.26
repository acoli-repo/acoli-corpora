00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:00.643
But we're underway.

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:02.976
And I think we're getting close.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.518
So I would say, get ready.

00:13:05.542 --> 00:13:09.518
We are not going to match Le Verrier's

00:13:09.542 --> 00:13:10.809
"make a prediction,

00:13:10.833 --> 00:13:12.726
have the planet found in a single night

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.934
that close to where
you predicted it" record.

00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.893
But I do bet that within
the next couple of years

00:13:18.917 --> 00:13:21.309
some astronomer somewhere

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:23.559
will find a faint point of light,

00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:25.851
slowly moving across the sky

00:13:25.875 --> 00:13:29.184
and triumphantly announce
the discovery of a new,

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:31.643
and quite possibly not the last,
