Bouvard knew that
his predictions were perfect.

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:34.059
So it had to be that those
old star catalogs were bad.

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:36.143
He told astronomers of the day,

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:38.601
"Do better measurements."

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:39.893
So they did.

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:42.059
Astronomers spent the next two decades

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:46.143
meticulously tracking the position
of Uranus across the sky,

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:49.851
but it still didn't fit
Bouvard's predictions.

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:52.018
By 1840, it had become obvious.

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:55.101
The problem was not
with those old star catalogs,

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:57.976
the problem was with the predictions.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.518
And astronomers knew why.

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:03.726
They realized that there must be
a distant, giant planet
