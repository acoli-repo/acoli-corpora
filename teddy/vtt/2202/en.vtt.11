00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:30.768
"Yeah, that's bizarre,
10,000 years to go around the Sun,"

00:05:30.792 --> 00:05:32.726
but that's not really the bizarre part.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.941
The bizarre part is
that in those 10,000 years,

00:05:34.965 --> 00:05:38.934
Sedna never comes close
to anything else in the solar system.

00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.268
Even at its closest approach to the Sun,

00:05:41.292 --> 00:05:43.601
Sedna is further from Neptune

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:45.833
than Neptune is from the Earth.

00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:49.184
If Sedna had had an orbit like this,

00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:51.809
that kisses the orbit of Neptune
once around the Sun,

00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:54.851
that would have actually been
really easy to explain.

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:56.643
That would have just been an object

00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:58.934
that had been in
a circular orbit around the Sun

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.393
in that region of icy bodies,
