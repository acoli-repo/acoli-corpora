00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:03.726
They realized that there must be
a distant, giant planet

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.434
just beyond the orbit of Uranus

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:07.268
that was tugging along at that orbit,

00:01:07.292 --> 00:01:09.851
sometimes pulling it along a bit too fast,

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:11.542
sometimes holding it back.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.768
Must have been frustrating back in 1840

00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:18.184
to see these gravitational effects
of this distant, giant planet

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:21.976
but not yet know how to actually find it.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.059
Trust me, it's really frustrating.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.559
(Laughter)

00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:27.809
But in 1846, another French astronomer,

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:29.143
Urbain Le Verrier,

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:30.434
worked through the math
