00:06:58.667 --> 00:07:02.559
When that cluster of stars
dissipated into the galaxy,

00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:06.351
the orbit of Sedna would have been
left as a fossil record

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:08.851
of this earliest history of the Sun.

00:07:08.875 --> 00:07:10.684
I was so excited by this idea,

00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:12.184
by the idea that we could look

00:07:12.208 --> 00:07:14.434
at the fossil history
of the birth of the Sun,

00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:16.059
that I spent the next decade

00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:18.809
looking for more objects
with orbits like Sedna.

00:07:18.833 --> 00:07:22.268
In that ten-year period, I found zero.

00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:23.309
(Laughter)

00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:26.851
But my colleagues, Chad Trujillo
and Scott Sheppard, did a better job,

00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:29.893
and they have now found several objects
with orbits like Sedna,

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:31.684
which is super exciting.
