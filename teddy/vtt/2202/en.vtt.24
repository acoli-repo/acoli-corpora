00:11:59.042 --> 00:12:00.309
Planet Nine is so big,

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:02.934
you should probably wonder
why haven't we found it yet.

00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.226
Well, Planet Nine is big,

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.351
but it's also really, really far away.

00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:11.059
It's something like
15 times further away than Neptune.

00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:14.351
And that makes it about 50,000 times
fainter than Neptune.

00:12:14.375 --> 00:12:17.309
And also, the sky is a really big place.

00:12:17.333 --> 00:12:19.476
We've narrowed down where we think it is

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.018
to a relatively small area of the sky,

00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:23.934
but it would still take us years

00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.309
to systematically cover
the area of the sky

00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:28.184
with the large telescopes that we need

00:12:28.208 --> 00:12:31.518
to see something that's
this far away and this faint.
