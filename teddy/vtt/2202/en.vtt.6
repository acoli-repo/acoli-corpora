00:02:57.792 --> 00:03:02.809
there is no planet just beyond
the orbit of Uranus and Neptune

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:05.518
and Pluto is thousands of times too small

00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:08.184
to have any effect on those orbits at all.

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:11.851
So even though Pluto
turned out not to be the planet

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.476
it was originally thought to be,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.934
it was the first discovery
of what is now known to be

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:21.684
thousands of tiny, icy objects
in orbit beyond the planets.

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:24.601
Here you can see the orbits of Jupiter,

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:27.143
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,

00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:30.184
and in that little circle
in the very center is the Earth
