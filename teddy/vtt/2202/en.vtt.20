00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.559
trying to come up with any explanation
other than a distant, giant planet

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:05.851
in the outer solar system.

00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:11.309
We did not want to be the 33rd and 34th
people in history to propose this planet

00:10:11.333 --> 00:10:13.667
to yet again be told we were wrong.

00:10:14.792 --> 00:10:16.559
But after a year,

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:17.893
there was really no choice.

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:20.059
We could come up with no other explanation

00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:22.583
other than that there is a distant,

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:25.893
massive planet on an elongated orbit,

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.976
inclined to the rest of the solar system,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.726
that is forcing these patterns
for these objects
