00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.601
the astronomers were trying
to answer about Uranus 200 years ago.

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:35.393
They did it by using
overlooked observations of Uranus

00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:37.768
from 91 years before its discovery

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:39.518
to figure out its entire orbit.

00:04:39.542 --> 00:04:41.559
We couldn't go quite that far back,

00:04:41.583 --> 00:04:46.184
but we did find observations
of our object from 13 years earlier

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:48.893
that allowed us to figure out
how it went around the Sun.

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:50.184
So the question is,

00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:52.934
is it in a circular orbit
around the Sun, like a planet,

00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.351
or is it on its way back in,

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.268
like one of these typical icy bodies?

00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:57.976
And the answer is

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.268
no.

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:02.059
It has a massively elongated orbit
