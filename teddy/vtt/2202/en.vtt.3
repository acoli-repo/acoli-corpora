00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:30.434
worked through the math

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:33.184
and figured out how to predict
the location of the planet.

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:36.184
He sent his prediction
to the Berlin observatory,

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:37.643
they opened up their telescope

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:40.726
and in the very first night
they found this faint point of light

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.851
slowly moving across the sky

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:44.143
and discovered Neptune.

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:48.292
It was this close on the sky
to Le Verrier's predicted location.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:54.393
The story of prediction
and discrepancy and new theory

00:01:54.417 --> 00:01:57.476
and triumphant discoveries is so classic

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.393
and Le Verrier became so famous from it,
