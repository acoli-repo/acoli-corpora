It's hard not to look
at that lonely body out there

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:04.518
and say, oh yeah, sure,
so Lowell was wrong,

00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:06.476
there was no planet just beyond Neptune,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.059
but this, this could be a new planet.

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:10.559
The real question we had was,

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.893
what kind of orbit
does it have around the Sun?

00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:14.851
Does it go in a circle around the Sun

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:16.434
like a planet should?

00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:20.351
Or is it just a typical member
of this icy belt of bodies

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:24.434
that got a little bit tossed outward
and it's now on its way back in?

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:26.976
This is precisely the question

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.601
the astronomers were trying
to answer about Uranus 200 years ago.
