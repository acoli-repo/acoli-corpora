00:09:28.042 --> 00:09:30.101
If you look at these
objects the right way,

00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:34.184
they are all actually lined up
in space in the same direction,

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:37.934
and they're all tilted in space
in the same direction.

00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.309
It's as if all those people on the plaza
are all walking in the same direction

00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:45.768
and they're all looking
45 degrees to the right side.

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:47.059
That's easy to explain.

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:49.559
They're all looking at something.

00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:53.708
These objects in the outer solar system
are all reacting to something.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.726
But what?

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.726
Konstantin and I spent a year

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.559
trying to come up with any explanation
other than a distant, giant planet
