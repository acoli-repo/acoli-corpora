and Le Verrier became so famous from it,

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:03.143
that people tried to get in
on the act right away.

00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:05.684
In the last 163 years,

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:11.309
dozens of astronomers have used
some sort of alleged orbital discrepancy

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:15.250
to predict the existence
of some new planet in the solar system.

00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:19.000
They have always been wrong.

00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:22.309
The most famous
of these erroneous predictions

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:23.768
came from Percival Lowell,

00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:28.518
who was convinced that there must be
a planet just beyond Uranus and Neptune,

00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:30.518
messing with those orbits.
