00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I want to talk to you about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is what we can learn from studying the genomes

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of living people

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and extinct humans.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But before doing that,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I just briefly want to remind you about what you already know:

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that our genomes, our genetic material,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in the form of DNA,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which is this famous double-helical molecule.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And the genetic information

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is contained in the form of a sequence

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of four bases

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
abbreviated with the letters A, T, C and G.
