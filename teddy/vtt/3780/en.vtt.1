00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:32.315
Today, I am still performing in front of the camera

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:36.162
and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman.

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:39.840
I focus on balancing meaningful message,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.860
aesthetic, beauty, composition, 
some irony, and artifacts.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.312
Today, I'm going to tell you about my project,

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:52.271
which is named Desperate Romantics.

00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:53.989
They're my artifacts, or paintings

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.817
from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England

00:00:58.817 --> 00:01:00.926
mid-19th century.
