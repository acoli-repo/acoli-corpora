00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:10.345
Working in Vienna at the turn 
of the 20th century,

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:12.975
he began his career as a neurologist

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:16.749
before pioneering the discipline 
of psychoanalysis.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.749
He proposed that people are motivated 
by unconscious desires

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:22.439
and repressed memories,

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.399
and their problems can be addressed

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:28.399
by making those motivations conscious 
through talk therapy.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.754
His influence towers above that of all 
other psychologists in the public eye.
