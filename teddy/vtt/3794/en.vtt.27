00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:32.954
your life is going to be full
of joy and sadness,

00:13:32.954 --> 00:13:35.633
because there are a lot of people
we cannot help,

00:13:35.633 --> 00:13:39.557
a lot of people we cannot protect,
a lot of people we did not save.

00:13:39.557 --> 00:13:41.800
I call them my ghost,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.757
and by having witnessed
their suffering from close,

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:48.904
you take a bit 
of that suffering on yourself.

00:13:49.304 --> 00:13:51.970
Many young humanitarian workers

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.988
go through their first experience
with a lot of bitterness.

00:13:54.988 --> 00:13:57.960
They are thrown into situations
where they are witness,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.072
but they are powerless
to bring any change.
