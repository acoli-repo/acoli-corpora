00:07:29.302 --> 00:07:31.113
After my kidnapping,

00:07:31.113 --> 00:07:34.270
I was transferred
from North Ossetia to Chechnya,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.590
three days of slow travel
in the trunks of different cars,

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.889
and upon arrival, I was interrogated

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:44.554
for 11 days by a guy called Ruslan.

00:07:44.554 --> 00:07:46.318
The routine was always the same:

00:07:46.318 --> 00:07:48.710
a bit more light, 45 minutes.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.985
He would come down to the cellar,

00:07:50.985 --> 00:07:53.249
he would ask the guards
to tie me on the chair,

00:07:53.249 --> 00:07:56.349
and he would turn on the music loud.

00:07:56.349 --> 00:07:59.530
And then he would yell questions.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.325
He would scream. He would beat me.
