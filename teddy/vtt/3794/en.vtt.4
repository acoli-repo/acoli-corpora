00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.038
This is why I am here today with you.

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:03.435
We need to find better ways
to remember them.

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:10.566
We also need to explain the key values
to which they dedicated their lives.

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:14.778
We also need to demand justice.

00:02:16.058 --> 00:02:17.939
When in '96 I was sent

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.654
by the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees to the North Caucasus,

00:02:21.654 --> 00:02:23.526
I knew some of the risks.

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:25.879
Five colleagues had been killed,

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.946
three had been seriously injured,

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:30.291
seven had already been taken hostage.
