a boy, maybe two or three years old.

00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:35.776
Footsteps, confusion, people running.

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:39.900
So when Ruslan came the day after,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.369
before he put the first question to me,

00:08:42.369 --> 00:08:45.968
I asked him, "How is your son today?
Is he feeling better?"

00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:48.754
Ruslan was taken by surprise.

00:08:48.754 --> 00:08:51.583
He was furious that the guards
may have leaked some details

00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:54.161
about his private life.

00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:58.874
I kept talking about NGOs
supplying medicines to local clinics

00:08:58.874 --> 00:09:01.785
that may help his son to get better.
