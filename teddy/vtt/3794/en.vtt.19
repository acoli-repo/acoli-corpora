He did not touch me anymore.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.936
He did not ask any other questions.

00:09:32.936 --> 00:09:36.791
I was no longer just a commodity.

00:09:36.791 --> 00:09:41.760
Two days after, I was transferred
to another place.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.866
There, a guard came to me,
very close -- it was quite unusual --

00:09:46.866 --> 00:09:50.025
and he said with
a very soft voice, he said,

00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:52.649
"I'd like to thank you

00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:56.689
for the assistance your organization
provided my family

00:09:56.689 --> 00:10:00.738
when we were displaced
in nearby Dagestan."
