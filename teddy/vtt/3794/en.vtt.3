00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:32.661
to provide some assistance,
some comfort, some protection,

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:35.587
but when they needed
protection themselves,

00:01:35.587 --> 00:01:37.295
it wasn't there.

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:40.858
When you see the headlines
of your newspaper these days

00:01:40.858 --> 00:01:43.923
with the war in Iraq or in Syria --

00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:48.087
aid worker abducted, hostage executed --

00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:50.100
but who were they?

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.025
Why were they there?

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:54.033
What motivated them?

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:57.909
How did we become
so indifferent to these crimes?

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.038
This is why I am here today with you.
