00:15:28.631 --> 00:15:32.157
Gone are the days when
a U.N. blue flag or a Red Cross

00:15:32.157 --> 00:15:35.933
would automatically protect us.

00:15:35.933 --> 00:15:39.195
Criminal groups and some political groups

00:15:39.195 --> 00:15:42.051
have cross-fertilized
over the last 20 years,

00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:45.186
and they've created these sort of hybrids

00:15:45.186 --> 00:15:48.052
with whom we have no way of communicating.

00:15:48.052 --> 00:15:53.426
Humanitarian principles are tested,
questioned, and often ignored,

00:15:53.426 --> 00:15:58.312
but perhaps more importantly,
we have abandoned the search for justice.

00:15:58.312 --> 00:16:01.532
There seems to be
no consequence whatsoever
