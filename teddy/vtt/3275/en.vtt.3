00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.001
and got my act together.

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:33.042
And this kind of reminds me
of what we've been seeing

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.812
in the cryptocurrency space,
at least in 2017,

00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:39.425
where the only thing that's been going up
faster than the markets themselves

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:41.926
is the number of "senior
investment specialists"

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.338
who have been appearing out of nowhere.

00:01:44.362 --> 00:01:47.328
Now I'm not saying it's not possible
to have a strategic edge,

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:50.432
but at the same time,
it's very easy to feel like a genius

00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:52.868
when you're in a market
that's going up so fast

00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:55.298
that even the worst strategies
are making a profit.

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:57.631
So when we're experiencing success,

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:00.512
it's important to take a moment
to really ask ourselves
