00:00:00.944 --> 00:00:03.318
So I'm a professional poker player,

00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:08.612
and today, I want to talk about
three things that the game has taught me

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:12.464
around decision-making
that I find apply to everyday life.

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:15.852
Now the first of these things
is about luck.

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:20.714
Now, like poker, life is also
a game of skill and luck,

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:23.416
and when it comes
to the biggest things we care about --

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.217
health, wealth and relationships --

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:30.075
these outcomes don't only depend
on the quality of our decision-making,
