00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:01.697
But when it comes to the really big stuff,

00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:04.245
like what's our career path going to be

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:05.951
or who should we marry,

00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:09.500
why should we assume that our intuitions

00:05:09.524 --> 00:05:13.226
are better calibrated for these
than slow, proper analysis?

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.710
I mean, they don't have
any data to be based off.

00:05:16.528 --> 00:05:20.306
So my third lesson is,
while we shouldn't ignore our intuitions,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.703
we shouldn't overprivilege them either.

00:05:22.727 --> 00:05:25.155
And I'd like to summarize
these three lessons today

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:26.807
with my own set of memes,

00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.886
with more of a poker-player twist.

00:05:29.957 --> 00:05:34.092
"Success is sweetest when you achieve it
across a large sample size."
