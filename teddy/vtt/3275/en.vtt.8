00:03:59.292 --> 00:04:02.762
These are some of the best
poker players in the world right now.

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:07.247
Do they look like people who live
purely off feelings and intuitions?

00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:08.272
(Laughter)

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:09.945
Look at them!

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:14.549
Obviously, these guys
are about slow, careful analysis,

00:04:14.573 --> 00:04:17.080
and that's because the game
has outgrown the days

00:04:17.104 --> 00:04:20.112
where pure street smarts
and people-reading

00:04:20.136 --> 00:04:21.957
can get you to the top.

00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:25.283
And that's because our intuitions
aren't nearly as perfect

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:26.577
as we'd like to believe.

00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:29.143
I mean, it'd be great,
whenever we're in a tough spot,

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:33.173
to just have an answer appear to us
from some magical source of inspiration.
