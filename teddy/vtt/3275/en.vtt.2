00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.251
And because I'd only been playing
full-time for about a year,

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:03.170
when I won, I assumed
I must be rather brilliant.

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:05.948
In fact, I thought I was so brilliant

00:01:05.972 --> 00:01:09.416
that I not only got rather lazy
with studying the game,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.090
but I also got more risky,

00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:14.122
started playing in
the biggest tournaments I could

00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:16.661
against the very best in the world.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:20.177
And then my profit graph went
from a thing of beauty

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:22.613
to something kind of sad,

00:01:22.637 --> 00:01:24.997
with this worrying
downhill trend for a long time,

00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.486
until I finally realized
that I was overestimating my skill level,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.001
and got my act together.
