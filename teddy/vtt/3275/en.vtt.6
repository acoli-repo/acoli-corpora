"Hey, Liv, do you think you're going
to come along to that thing tonight?"

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:05.532
instead of just saying to them,
"Yeah, probably,"

00:03:05.556 --> 00:03:07.384
I actually give them my best estimate --

00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:09.250
say, 60 percent.

00:03:09.274 --> 00:03:11.377
Because -- I know that sounds
a little odd --

00:03:11.401 --> 00:03:14.473
but the thing is, I ran a poll on Twitter

00:03:14.497 --> 00:03:17.061
of what people understand
the word "probably" to mean,

00:03:17.085 --> 00:03:18.833
and this was the spread of answers.

00:03:18.857 --> 00:03:20.008
Enormous!

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.865
So apparently, it's absolutely useless

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.584
at actually conveying
any real information.

00:03:24.608 --> 00:03:28.249
So if you guys catch yourselves
using these vague words,

00:03:28.273 --> 00:03:31.169
like "probably" or "sometimes,"
