00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:30.429
So now, whenever I catch myself

00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:34.002
thinking vaguely about something
really important, like,

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:37.251
"It's unlikely I'll forget
what I want to say in my TED Talk,"

00:02:37.275 --> 00:02:39.966
I now try to estimate it numerically.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:41.820
(Laughter)

00:02:41.844 --> 00:02:44.318
Trust me, it helps a lot
with the planning process.

00:02:44.342 --> 00:02:47.762
And the thing is, almost anything
that could possibly happen here today,

00:02:47.786 --> 00:02:49.341
or at any point in the future,

00:02:49.365 --> 00:02:51.661
can also be expressed
as a probability, too.

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:55.048
(Laughter)

00:02:55.072 --> 00:02:58.477
So now I also try to speak
in numbers as well.

00:02:58.501 --> 00:02:59.652
So if someone asks me,

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:03.191
"Hey, Liv, do you think you're going
to come along to that thing tonight?"
