00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:00.512
it's important to take a moment
to really ask ourselves

00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:03.168
how much of it is truly down to us,

00:02:03.192 --> 00:02:07.684
because our egos love to downplay
the luck factor when we're winning.

00:02:09.058 --> 00:02:11.239
Now, a second thing poker taught me

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:14.606
is the importance
of quantifying my thinking.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.529
When you're playing,
you can't just get away with going,

00:02:17.553 --> 00:02:19.232

00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:21.480
That's just going to lose you
a bunch of money,

00:02:21.504 --> 00:02:24.703
because poker is a game
of probabilities and precision,

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:28.223
and so you have to train yourself
to think in numbers.

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:30.429
So now, whenever I catch myself
