00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:33.314
when used in combination with real,
in-flight training to train the pilots.

00:02:33.338 --> 00:02:34.963
And so we thought to ourselves:

00:02:35.532 --> 00:02:37.869
Why not just apply that to science?

00:02:37.893 --> 00:02:42.444
Why not build a virtual
laboratory simulator?

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:44.811
Well, we did it.

00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:46.653
We basically set out to create

00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:52.292
a fully simulated, one-to-one,
virtual reality laboratory simulator,

00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:54.513
where the students
could perform experiments

00:02:54.537 --> 00:02:56.447
with mathematical equations

00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:59.690
that would simulate what would
happen in a real-world lab.

00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:01.393
But not just simple simulations --
