One group would only use
the virtual laboratory simulations,

00:05:04.035 --> 00:05:07.735
the other group would only use
traditional teaching methods,

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.674
and they had the same amount of time.

00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:11.953
Then, interestingly,

00:05:11.977 --> 00:05:15.644
they gave the students a test
before and after the experiment,

00:05:15.668 --> 00:05:20.021
so they could clearly measure
the learning impact of the students.

00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:21.213
And what they found

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:27.038
was a surprisingly high 76 percent
increase in the learning effectiveness

00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:31.906
when using virtual laboratories
over traditional teaching methods.
