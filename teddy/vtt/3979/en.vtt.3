00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:31.679
in way too many universities
around the world:

00:01:31.703 --> 00:01:34.356
students that are bored, disengaged

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.985
and sometimes not even sure
why they're learning about a topic

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.208
in the first place.

00:01:39.763 --> 00:01:44.097
So we started looking around for new,
innovative teaching methods,

00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.944
but what we found was quite disappointing.

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:50.633
We saw that books were being
turned into e-books,

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:54.511
blackboards were being turned
into YouTube videos

00:01:54.535 --> 00:01:57.679
and lecture hall monologues
were being turned into MOOCs --

00:01:57.703 --> 00:02:00.004
massive online open courses.
