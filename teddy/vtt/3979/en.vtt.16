and what she does is guides me
through this whole laboratory.

00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:03.404
And very soon,

00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:06.396

that I'm in right now

00:08:09.003 --> 00:08:12.233
and help me, guide me,

00:08:12.257 --> 00:08:14.567
And now before I finalize this,

00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:17.559

an even cooler thing, I think --

something you cannot

00:08:20.643 --> 00:08:21.881
This is a PCR machine.

00:08:21.905 --> 00:08:24.385

00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:28.642
And what I just did is literally
shrunk myself a million times

00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:30.225
into the size of a molecule --
