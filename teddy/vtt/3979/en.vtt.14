Do you see me up on the screen?

00:07:00.025 --> 00:07:01.176
Audience: Yes.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.803
Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.

00:07:02.827 --> 00:07:05.725
So basically, I have just
turned my mobile phone

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:09.413
into a fully simulated, million-dollar
Ivy League laboratory

00:07:09.437 --> 00:07:12.262
with all this amazing equipment
that I can interact with.

00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:15.659
I can, for instance, pick up the pipette
and do experiments with it.

00:07:15.683 --> 00:07:18.103
I have my E-Ggel, my PCR
and -- oh, look there,

00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:20.648
I have my next-generation
sequencing machine,

00:07:20.672 --> 00:07:24.170
and there I even have
my electron microscope.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:27.624
I mean, who's carrying around
an electron microscope in their pocket?

00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:29.520
And here I have my machine,

00:07:29.544 --> 00:07:31.714
I can do different experiments
on the machine.
