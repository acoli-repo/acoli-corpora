00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:30.615
is so vitally important.

00:00:31.513 --> 00:00:32.674
If you think about it,

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.973
the world is growing incredibly fast.

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:39.207
And with that growth comes
a whole list of growing challenges,

00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:42.244
challenges such as dealing
with global warming,

00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:44.631
solving starvation and water shortages

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:46.107
and curing diseases,

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:47.656
to name just a few.

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:53.882
And who, exactly, is going to help us
solve all of these great challenges?

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:58.170
Well, to a very last degree,
it is these young students.

00:00:58.194 --> 00:01:02.036
This is the next generation
of young, bright scientists.
