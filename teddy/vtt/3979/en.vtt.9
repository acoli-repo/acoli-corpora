and ... and I didn't check Facebook."

00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:39.964

That's how engaging and immersive
this really is for the students.

And so, to investigate

And what they did is split
the students into two groups.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.011
One group would only use
the virtual laboratory simulations,
