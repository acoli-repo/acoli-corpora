00:01:57.703 --> 00:02:00.004
massive online open courses.

00:02:00.694 --> 00:02:01.941
And if you think about it,

00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:05.548
all we're really doing here
is taking the same content

00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:07.120
and the same format,

00:02:07.144 --> 00:02:10.070
and bringing it out to more students --

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:13.403
which is great, don't get me
wrong, that is really great --

00:02:13.427 --> 00:02:17.054
but the teaching method
is still more or less the same,

00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:19.374
no real innovation there.

00:02:19.863 --> 00:02:21.882
So we started looking elsewhere.

00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:26.533
What we found was that flight simulators
had been proven over and over again

00:02:26.557 --> 00:02:28.024
to be far more effective

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:33.314
when used in combination with real,
in-flight training to train the pilots.
