00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:31.906
when using virtual laboratories
over traditional teaching methods.

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:33.834
But even more interestingly,

00:05:33.858 --> 00:05:37.072
the second part of this study investigated

00:05:37.096 --> 00:05:40.000
what the teacher's impact
was on the learning.

00:05:40.024 --> 00:05:41.175
And what they found

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.861
was that when you combined
the virtual laboratories

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.489
with teacher-led coaching and mentoring,

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:52.329
then we saw a total 101 percent
increase in the learning effectiveness,

00:05:52.353 --> 00:05:56.785
which effectively doubles
the science teacher's impact

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:59.167
with the same amount of time spent.
