00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:01.393
But not just simple simulations --

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:03.483
we would also create advanced simulations

00:03:03.507 --> 00:03:05.431
with top universities like MIT,

00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:09.824
to bring out cutting-edge cancer
research to these students.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.403
And suddenly, the universities
could save millions of dollars

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:16.357
by letting the students
perform virtual experiments

00:03:16.381 --> 00:03:19.493
before they go into the real laboratory.

00:03:20.303 --> 00:03:22.835
And not only that; now,
they could also understand --

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.292
even on a molecular level
inside the machine --

00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:27.992
what is happening to the machines.

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:29.915
And then they could suddenly perform

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.567
dangerous experiments in the labs as well.
