00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:00.652
to create fun and engaging stories.

00:04:00.676 --> 00:04:02.510
For instance, here in this case,

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:06.657
where the students have to solve
a mysterious CSI murder case

00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:09.375
using their core science skills.

00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:14.305
And the feedback we got
when we launched all of this

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.281
was quite overwhelmingly positive.

00:04:16.305 --> 00:04:18.108
Here we have 300 students,

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:20.847
all passionately solving CSI murder cases

00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:22.736
while learning core science skills.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.005
And what I love the most about this

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:28.673
is really when the students
come up to me sometimes afterwards,

00:04:28.697 --> 00:04:30.812
all surprised and a little confused,
