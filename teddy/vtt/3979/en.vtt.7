00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.567
dangerous experiments in the labs as well.

00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.077
For instance also here,

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:37.713
learning about salmonella bacteria,
which is an important topic

00:03:37.737 --> 00:03:41.708
that many schools cannot teach
for good safety reasons.

00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:44.052
And we, of course, quiz the students

00:03:44.076 --> 00:03:46.481
and then give the teachers
a full dashboard,

00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:49.431
so they fully understand
where the students are at.

00:03:50.134 --> 00:03:51.342
But we didn't stop there,

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.691
because we had seen just
how important meaning is

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:56.001
for the students' engagement in the class.

00:03:56.025 --> 00:03:57.747
So we brought in game designers

00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:00.652
to create fun and engaging stories.
