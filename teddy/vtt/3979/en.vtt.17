00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:30.225
into the size of a molecule --

00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:32.598
and it really feels like it,
you have to try this.

00:08:32.622 --> 00:08:35.225
So now it feels like
I'm standing inside the machine

00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:37.842
and I'm seeing all the DNA,
and I see the molecules.

00:08:37.866 --> 00:08:41.469
I see the polymerase
and the enzymes and so forth.

00:08:41.493 --> 00:08:43.096
And I can see how in this case,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.197
DNA is being replicated millions of times,

00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:49.054
just like it's happening
inside your body right now.

00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:53.205
And I can really feel and understand
how all of this works.

00:08:54.219 --> 00:08:57.513
Now, I hope that gives you
a little bit of a sense

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:01.663
of the possibilities
in these new teaching methods.
