00:09:28.444 --> 00:09:32.799
I believe that the next big,
quantum leap in science education

00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:35.132
lies no longer with the technology,

00:09:35.156 --> 00:09:37.037
but rather with the teachers' decision

00:09:37.061 --> 00:09:40.266
to push forward and adopt
these technologies

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.037
inside the classrooms.

00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:45.898
And so it is our hope that more
universities and schools and teachers

00:09:45.922 --> 00:09:48.787
will collaborate with technology companies

00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:51.335
to realize this full potential.

00:09:52.989 --> 00:09:54.434
And so,

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:57.291
lastly, I'd like to leave you
with a little story

00:09:57.315 --> 00:09:58.877
that really inspires me.

00:09:58.901 --> 00:10:01.322
And that is the story of Jack Andraka.
