00:07:29.544 --> 00:07:31.714
I can do different experiments
on the machine.

00:07:31.738 --> 00:07:33.192
And over here I have the door,

00:07:33.216 --> 00:07:35.584
I can go into other experiments,

00:07:35.608 --> 00:07:37.541
I can perform in the laboratories.

00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:39.771
And here, I have my learning tablet.

00:07:39.795 --> 00:07:41.249
This is an intelligent tablet

00:07:41.273 --> 00:07:44.121
that allows me to read
about relevant theory.

00:07:44.145 --> 00:07:46.447
As you can see, I can interact with it.

00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:50.365
I can watch videos and see
content that is relevant

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:53.254
to the experiment
that I'm performing right now.

00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:55.477
Then over here, I have Marie.

00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:59.020
She is my teacher --
my lab assistant --

00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:02.221
and what she does is guides me
through this whole laboratory.
