00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:02.881
Today, I am going to show you

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:07.334
how this tablet and this virtual-reality
headset that I'm wearing

00:00:07.358 --> 00:00:11.399
are going to completely
revolutionize science education.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.895
And I'm also going to show you

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.703
how it can make any science teacher
more than twice as effective.

00:00:19.124 --> 00:00:22.588
But before I show you
how all of this is possible,

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:28.151
let's talk briefly about why improving
the quality of science education

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:30.615
is so vitally important.
