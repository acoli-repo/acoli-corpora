00:06:28.228 --> 00:06:30.861
I will explain briefly what this is.

00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:33.621
Basically, I take my mobile phone --

00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:36.351
most students already
have these, smartphones --

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:40.899
and I plug it into this virtual-reality
headset, a low-cost headset.

00:06:40.923 --> 00:06:42.892
And now what I can effectively do is,

00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:46.066
I can literally step
into this virtual world.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.174
We'll have some of you
in the audience also get to try this,

00:06:49.198 --> 00:06:52.354
because it is really something
that you have to try

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:54.673
to fully feel how immersive it really is.

00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:58.474
It literally feels like I just stepped
inside this virtual lab.

00:06:58.498 --> 00:07:00.001
Do you see me up on the screen?
