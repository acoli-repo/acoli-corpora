00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that anthropologists have looked at,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
material stuff

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
operates as a kind of language --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
a language of goods,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000

we have a system

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
that is locking economic structure with social logic --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together
