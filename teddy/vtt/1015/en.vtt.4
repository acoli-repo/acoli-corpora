00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I want to ask the question:

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
how far and how fast would be have to move?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
How clever would we have to be?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
How much technology would we need in this world

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to deliver our carbon targets?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And here in my chart --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
on the left-hand side is where we are now.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in the economy at the moment.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's around about 770 grams of carbon.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
In the world I describe to you,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
we have to be right over here at the right-hand side

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
at six grams of carbon.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's a 130-fold improvement,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and that is 10 times further and faster
