00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
we had moved into a new house.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
installing insulation around the windows and doors

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
to keep out the drafts.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And my, then, five year-old daughter

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
was helping me in the way that five year-olds do.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And we'd been doing this for a while,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
when she turned to me very solemnly and said,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
"Will this really keep out the giraffes?"

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
(Laughter)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
"Here they are, the giraffes."

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
You can hear the five-year-old mind working.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
These ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here
