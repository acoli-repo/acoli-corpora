00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to talk to you today about prosperity,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about our hopes

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for a shared and lasting prosperity.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And not just us,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but the two billion people worldwide

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
who are still chronically undernourished.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And hope actually is at the heart of this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In fact, the Latin word for hope

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is at the heart of the word prosperity.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
"Pro-speras," "speras," hope --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in accordance with our hopes and expectations.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The irony is, though,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that we have cashed-out prosperity
