00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The irony is, though,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that we have cashed-out prosperity

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
almost literally in terms of money and economic growth.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And we've grown our economies so much

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that we now stand

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in a real danger

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of undermining hope --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
running down resources, cutting down rainforests,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
changing the climate --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the only thing that has actually

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
remotely slowed down the relentless rise

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is recession.
