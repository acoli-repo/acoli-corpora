00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
as social beings.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and tradition or conservation.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Novelty is adaptive when things are changing

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and you need to adapt yourself.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Tradition is essential to lay down the stability

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
to raise families and form cohesive social groups.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So here, all of a sudden,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
we're looking at a map of the human heart.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And it reveals to us, suddenly,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
the crux of the matter.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
What we've done is we've created economies.
