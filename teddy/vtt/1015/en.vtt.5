00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's a 130-fold improvement,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and that is 10 times further and faster

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Maybe we can do it, maybe it's possible -- who knows?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Maybe we can even go further

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
which is what we're going to need to be doing

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
by the end of the century.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But shouldn't we just check first

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that the economic system that we have

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is remotely capable of delivering

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
this kind of improvement?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It's a bit complex, and I apologize for that.
