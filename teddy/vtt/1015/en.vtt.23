00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
the crux of the matter.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
What we've done is we've created economies.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
We've created systems,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
which systematically privilege, encourage,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
one narrow quadrant

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
of the human soul

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and left the others unregarded.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And in the same token, the solution becomes clear,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
because this isn't, therefore,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
about changing human nature.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It isn't, in fact, about curtailing possibilities.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
It is about opening up.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It is about allowing ourselves the freedom

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
to become fully human,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
recognizing the depth and the breadth
