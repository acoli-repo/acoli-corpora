00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Keynes called this the "paradox of thrift" --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
saving slows down recovery.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And politicians call on us continually

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
to draw down more debt,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
to draw down our own savings even further,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
just so that we can get the show back on the road,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
so we can keep this growth-based economy going.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It's an anomaly,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
it's a place where the system actually is at odds

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
with who we are as people.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Here's another one -- completely different one:

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Why is it

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
to combat climate change,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
very, very simple things
