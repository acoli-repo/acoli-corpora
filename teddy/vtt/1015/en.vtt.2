00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is recession.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And recession, of course,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
isn't exactly a recipe for hope either,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as we're busy finding out.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So we're caught in a kind of trap.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's a dilemma, a dilemma of growth.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We can't live with it; we can't live without it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Trash the system or crash the planet --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
it's a tough choice; it isn't much of a choice.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And our best avenue of escape from this actually

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is a kind of blind faith

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and doing things more efficiently.
