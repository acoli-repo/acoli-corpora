00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
"the process of creative destruction."

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
continually chasing expanding consumer markets,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
consumer goods, new consumer goods.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And this, this is where it gets interesting,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
because it turns out that human beings

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
have something of an appetite for novelty.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We love new stuff --

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
new material stuff for sure --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
but also new ideas, new adventures,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
new experiences.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But the materiality matters too,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
because in every society

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that anthropologists have looked at,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
material stuff
