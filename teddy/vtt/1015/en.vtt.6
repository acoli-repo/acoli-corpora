It's a bit complex, and I apologize for that.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
What I'll try and do, is I'll try and paraphrase it

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
is sort of human terms.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So it looks a little bit like this.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Firms produce goods for households -- that's us --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and provide us with incomes,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and that's even better, because we can spend those incomes

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
on more goods and services.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
That's called the circular flow of the economy.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It looks harmless enough.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I just want to highlight one key feature of this system,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which is the role of investment.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Now investment constitutes

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
only about a fifth of the national income

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in most modern economies,
