00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
whatever this new economy is,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
what we need the economy to do, in fact,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
is to put investment

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
back into the heart of the model,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
to re-conceive investment.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Only now, investment

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
isn't going to be

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
about the relentless and mindless

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
pursuit of consumption growth.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Investment has to be a different beast.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Investment has to be,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
in the new economy,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
protecting and nurturing

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
the ecological assets on which our future depends.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It has to be about transition.
