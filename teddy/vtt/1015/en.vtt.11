00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in his day, what that meant was a linen shirt,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and today, well, you still need the shirt,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
but you need the hybrid car,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
the HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the netbook and iPad, the list goes on --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
an almost inexhaustible supply of goods,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
driven by this anxiety.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And even if we don't want them,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
we need to buy them,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
because, if we don't buy them, the system crashes.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And to stop it crashing

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
over the last two to three decades,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
we've expanded the money supply,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
expanded credit and debt,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
so that people can keep buying stuff.
