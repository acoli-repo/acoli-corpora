These ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
But actually that childish misrepresentation

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
stuck with me,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
because it suddenly became clear to me

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
getting ourselves to work on time,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
surviving email overload

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and shop floor politics,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
foraging for groceries, throwing together meals,
