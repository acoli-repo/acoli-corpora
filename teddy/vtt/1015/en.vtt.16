00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
very, very simple things

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
like buying energy-efficient appliances,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
putting in efficient lights, turning the lights off occasionally,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
insulating our homes?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
These things save carbon, they save energy,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
they save us money.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So is it that, though they make perfect economic sense,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
we don't do them?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Well, I had my own personal insight into this

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
a few years ago.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
It was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and it was just after --

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
actually, to be honest, too long after --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
we had moved into a new house.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping,
