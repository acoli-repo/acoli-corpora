Ubuntu says, "I am

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
because we are."

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Prosperity is a shared endeavor.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Its roots are long and deep --

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
its foundations, I've tried to show,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
exist already, inside each of us.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
So this is not about

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
standing in the way of development.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
It's not about

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
overthrowing capitalism.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
It's not about

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
trying to change human nature.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
What we're doing here

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
is we're taking a few simple steps

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
towards an economics fit for purpose.
