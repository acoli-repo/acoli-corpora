00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Or might we actually occasionally be

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
something like the selfless altruist

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
depicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Well psychology actually says

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
there is a tension --

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
a tension between self-regarding behaviors

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and other regarding behaviors.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
so selfish behavior

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
is adaptive in certain circumstances --

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
fight or flight.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But other regarding behaviors

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
are essential to our evolution

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
as social beings.
