00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
So let me come back, with this sense of hope,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
to the two billion people

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
still trying to live each day

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
on less than the price of a skinny latte

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
from the cafe next door.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
What can we offer those people?

where growth really matters in those poorest nations.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And it's also clear that we will never achieve that

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
unless we're capable of redefining
