00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
only about a fifth of the national income

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in most modern economies,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
but it plays an absolutely vital role.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And what it does essentially

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
is to stimulate further consumption growth.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
It does this in a couple of ways --

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
chasing productivity,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But I want to concentrate

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
on the role of investment

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in seeking out novelty,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the production and consumption of novelty.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Joseph Schumpeter called this

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
"the process of creative destruction."

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty,
