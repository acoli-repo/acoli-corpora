00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.372
Last year,

00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:05.334
I spent several months photographing
the fast changes across Afghanistan,

00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:08.713
as we approached the 20th anniversary
of the US invasion.

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:10.173
At the time,

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:13.593
I wanted this assignment
to be a love letter to a troubled land

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.887
that I had called home for seven years.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:20.141
Little did I know that it will become
a goodbye letter to Afghanistan

00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:21.726
as I knew it.

00:00:21.768 --> 00:00:23.853
Along with our brave local colleagues,

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:25.688
we traveled across Afghanistan

00:00:25.688 --> 00:00:28.816
to look at how the last 20 years
impacted people.

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:32.028
I was specifically drawn
to hear from the youth
