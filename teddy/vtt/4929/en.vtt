On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship
Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight,

00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:18.454

2,200 crew members alive.

00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:21.534

00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:24.884
they found an unexpected survivor -

00:00:24.884 --> 00:00:28.244
a black and white
cat clinging to a floating plank.

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:32.264
For the next several months this cat
hunted rats and raised British morale -
