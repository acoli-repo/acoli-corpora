grain in large pits and short, clay silos.

00:01:31.814 --> 00:01:34.834
But these stores of food attracted
hordes of rodents,

00:01:38.924 --> 00:01:42.624
the wildcat found across North Africa
and Southwest Asia.

00:01:42.624 --> 00:01:45.994

00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:50.724

The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular,

00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:59.944
had striped coats, and were less social
