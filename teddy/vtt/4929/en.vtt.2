But cats have been working alongside
humans for thousands of years - 


00:01:02.994 --> 00:01:05.764
helping us just as often as we help them.

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:10.224
So how did these solitary creatures go 
from wild predator to naval officer

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:12.874
to sofa sidekick?


00:01:12.874 --> 00:01:14.574
The domestication of the modern house cat

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:18.444
can be traced back to more than
10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent,

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.944
at the start of the Neolithic era.


00:01:20.944 --> 00:01:23.294
People were learning to bend nature
to their will,

00:01:23.294 --> 00:01:26.484
producing much more food than
farmers could eat at one time.

00:01:26.484 --> 00:01:31.814
These Neolithic farmers stored their excess
grain in large pits and short, clay silos.
