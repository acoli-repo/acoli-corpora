00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:31.804
And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats

00:03:31.804 --> 00:03:35.794
– probably tamed at this point -- 
continued to travel across Europe,

00:03:35.794 --> 00:03:40.094
eventually setting sail for
Australia and the Americas.

00:03:40.104 --> 00:03:42.164
Today, most house cats have descended


00:03:42.164 --> 00:03:46.834
from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica.

00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:50.444
But close analysis of the genomes and
coat patterns of modern cats

00:03:50.444 --> 00:03:52.564
tells us that unlike dogs,

00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:55.364
which have undergone 
centuries of selective breeding,

00:03:55.364 --> 00:03:59.124
modern cats are genetically
very similar to ancient cats.

00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:01.964
And apart from making them
more social and docile,
