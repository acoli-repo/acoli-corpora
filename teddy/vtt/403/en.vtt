00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:03.524
So let me with start with Roy Amara.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.561
Roy's argument is that most new
technologies tend to be overestimated

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:10.653
in their impact to begin with,

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.079
and then they get underestimated
in the long term

00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:14.467
because we get used to them.

00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:16.687
These really are days
of miracle and wonder.

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:19.814
You remember that wonderful
song by Paul Simon?

00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:21.703
There were two lines in it.

00:00:21.727 --> 00:00:25.414
So what was it that was considered
miraculous back then?

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.465
Slowing down things -- slow motion --

00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.099
and the long-distance call.
