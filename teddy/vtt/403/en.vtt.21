Or you can store most of the information

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.559
DNA is a really powerful
information storage device.

00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:38.394
Second turn:

00:10:38.418 --> 00:10:41.202
you're beginning to see the rise
of theoretical biology.

00:10:42.256 --> 00:10:46.458
So, medical school departments are one
of the most conservative places on earth.

00:10:46.482 --> 00:10:49.899
The way they teach anatomy is similar

00:10:49.923 --> 00:10:51.089

00:10:51.113 --> 00:10:53.137
"Welcome, student. Here's your cadaver."

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:57.856
One of the things medical schools are
not good at is creating new departments,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.629
which is why this is so unusual.
