00:01:28.592 --> 00:01:32.196
little specks of dust
floating around distant suns.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.684
Imagine for a second that this
was a sun a billion light years away,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.237
and you had a little speck of dust
that came in front of it.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.067
That's what detecting
an exoplanet is like.

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:47.058
And the cool thing is, the telescopes
that are now being launched

00:01:48.138 --> 00:01:51.143
would allow you to see
a single candle lit on the moon.

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.107
And if you separated it by one plate,

00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:57.925
you could see two candles
separately at that distance.

00:01:59.124 --> 00:02:01.937
And that's the kind
of resolution that you need
