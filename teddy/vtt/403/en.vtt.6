00:02:56.935 --> 00:03:00.323
But the bottom line on life
is that life turns out to be code.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.850
And life as code is a really
important concept because it means,

00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:09.084
just in the same way
as you can write a sentence

00:03:09.108 --> 00:03:12.226
in English or in French or Chinese,

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:16.052
just in the same way
as you can copy a sentence,

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:18.602
just in the same way
as you can edit a sentence,

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:20.976
just in the same way
as you can print a sentence,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.719
you're beginning to be able
to do that with life.

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:28.748
It means that we're beginning
to learn how to read this language.

00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:32.008
And this, of course, is the language
that is used by this orange.
