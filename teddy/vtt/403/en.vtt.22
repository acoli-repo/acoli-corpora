Isaac Kohane has now created a department
based on informatics, data, knowledge

00:11:06.873 --> 00:11:08.384
at Harvard Medical School.

00:11:09.408 --> 00:11:11.585
And in a sense,
what's beginning to happen is

00:11:11.609 --> 00:11:14.091
biology is beginning to get enough data

00:11:14.115 --> 00:11:16.881
that it can begin to follow
the steps of physics,

00:11:16.905 --> 00:11:20.293
which used to be observational physics

00:11:20.317 --> 00:11:22.288
and experimental physicists,

00:11:22.312 --> 00:11:24.474
and then started creating
theoretical biology.

00:11:24.498 --> 00:11:26.502
Well, that's what you're beginning to see

00:11:26.526 --> 00:11:28.506
because you have so many medical records,

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.562
because you have
so much data about people:
