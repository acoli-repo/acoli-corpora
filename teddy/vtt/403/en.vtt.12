So this is what happens
if you have colorectal cancer

00:06:00.084 --> 00:06:04.291
for a very specific patient
on the letter-by-letter resolution.

00:06:06.148 --> 00:06:09.258
So what we're doing in this stuff
is we're gathering information

00:06:09.282 --> 00:06:11.798
and just generating
enormous amounts of information.

00:06:11.822 --> 00:06:14.696
This is one of the largest
databases on the planet

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.592
and it's growing faster
than we can build computers to store it.

00:06:20.063 --> 00:06:22.529
You can create some incredible
maps with this stuff.

00:06:23.292 --> 00:06:26.263
You want to understand the plague
and why one plague is bubonic

00:06:26.287 --> 00:06:28.511
and the other one
is a different kind of plague

00:06:28.535 --> 00:06:30.845
and the other one
is a different kind of plague?
