00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.286
One of the things you can do
is you can start producing

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.533
close to carbon-neutral fuels

00:10:02.557 --> 00:10:04.983
on a commercial scale by 2025,

00:10:06.054 --> 00:10:07.815
which we're doing with Exxon.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.279
But you can also substitute
for agricultural lands.

00:10:11.303 --> 00:10:16.054
Instead of having 100 hectares
to make oils or to make proteins,

00:10:16.078 --> 00:10:17.937
you can make it in these vats

00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:20.829
at 10 or 100 times
the productivity per hectare.

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:24.870
Or you can store information,
or you can make all the world's vaccines

00:10:24.894 --> 00:10:26.193
in those three vats.

00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:31.225
Or you can store most of the information
that's held at CERN in those three vats.
