00:08:59.537 --> 00:09:00.733
created power --

00:09:01.273 --> 00:09:03.937
in the same way CERN
is changing the world,

00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.308
using new instruments
and our concept of the universe --

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.954
programmable life forms
are also going to change the world

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.465
because once you can program cells

00:09:13.489 --> 00:09:16.017
in the same way as you
program your computer chip,

00:09:17.736 --> 00:09:19.429
then you can make almost anything.

00:09:20.369 --> 00:09:23.148
So your computer chip
can produce photographs,

00:09:23.172 --> 00:09:25.245
can produce music, can produce film,

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:27.682
can produce love letters,
can produce spreadsheets.

00:09:27.706 --> 00:09:29.950
It's just ones and zeroes
flying through there.
