00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:08.240
It's not just zooming in.

00:07:09.042 --> 00:07:11.896
This is one of the coolest maps
ever done by human beings.

00:07:12.446 --> 00:07:15.502
What they've done is taken
all the genetic information they have

00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:17.007
about all the species,

00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:20.461

00:07:20.485 --> 00:07:22.063
that you can zoom in and out of.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:26.205
So this is what came first,
how did it diversify, how did it branch,

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:27.459
how large is that genome,

00:07:27.483 --> 00:07:28.680
on a single page.

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:31.682
It's kind of the universe
of life on Earth,
