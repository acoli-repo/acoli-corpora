00:15:57.687 --> 00:16:00.804
call it a decade, maybe two decades --

00:16:00.828 --> 00:16:02.798
from generating life from scratch

00:16:04.285 --> 00:16:06.088
out of proto-communities.

00:16:07.512 --> 00:16:09.158
Second long-term trend:

00:16:10.273 --> 00:16:13.799
we've been living and are living
through the digital age --

00:16:13.823 --> 00:16:16.342
we're starting to live through
the age of the genome

00:16:16.366 --> 00:16:19.981
and biology and CRISPR
and synthetic biology --

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.777
and all of that is going to merge
into the age of the brain.

00:16:24.743 --> 00:16:28.724
So we're getting to the point where
we can rebuild most of our body parts,

00:16:28.748 --> 00:16:32.404
in the same way as if you break a bone
or burn your skin, it regrows.
