00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.562
because you have
so much data about people:

00:11:30.586 --> 00:11:32.996
you've got their genomes,
you've got their viromes,

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.514
you've got their microbiomes.

00:11:34.538 --> 00:11:36.519
And as this information stacks,

00:11:36.543 --> 00:11:38.606
you can begin to make predictions.

00:11:40.149 --> 00:11:43.404
The third thing that's happening
is this is coming to the consumer.

00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:48.785
So you, too, can get your genes sequenced.

00:11:49.698 --> 00:11:52.426
And this is beginning to create
companies like 23andMe,

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.928
and companies like 23andMe
are going to be giving you

00:11:54.952 --> 00:11:56.304
more and more and more data,

00:11:56.328 --> 00:11:57.872
not just about your relatives,

00:11:58.562 --> 00:11:59.922
but about you and your body,

00:11:59.946 --> 00:12:01.477
and it's going to compare stuff,
