Be more careful where you sit.

00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:31.490
(Laughter)

00:04:33.014 --> 00:04:36.489
What's happening on this stuff
is it was really expensive to begin with.

00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:38.208
It was like long-distance calls.

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:43.005
But the cost of this is dropping
50 percent faster than Moore's law.

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:47.741
The first $200 full genome
was announced yesterday by Veritas.

00:04:48.494 --> 00:04:50.624
And so as you're looking at these systems,

00:04:50.648 --> 00:04:54.450
it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter,
it doesn't matter, and then it does.

00:04:54.474 --> 00:04:57.879
So let me just give you
the map view of this stuff.

00:04:58.973 --> 00:05:01.532
This is a big discovery.
