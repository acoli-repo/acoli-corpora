People thought it was just
going to ruin all religion.

00:01:03.473 --> 00:01:04.623
(Laughter)

00:01:06.862 --> 00:01:09.576
So we're not paying that much
attention to telescopes.

00:01:10.628 --> 00:01:14.710
But, of course, telescopes launched
10 years ago, as you just heard,

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:17.725
could take this Volkswagen,
fly it to the moon,

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:23.605
and you could see the lights
on that Volkswagen light up on the moon.

00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:27.886
And that's the kind of resolution power
that allowed you to see

00:01:28.592 --> 00:01:32.196
little specks of dust
floating around distant suns.
