00:01:59.124 --> 00:02:01.937
And that's the kind
of resolution that you need

00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:04.429
to begin to image
that little speck of dust

00:02:04.453 --> 00:02:05.739
as it comes around the sun

00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:07.812
and see if it has a blue-green signature.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.191
And if it does have
a blue-green signature,

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:13.435
it means that life
is common in the universe.

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.655
The first time you ever see a blue-green
signature on a distant planet,

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.672

00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:20.977
there's water there,

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.873
and the chances that you saw
the only other planet with photosynthesis

00:02:24.897 --> 00:02:26.260
are about zero.

00:02:27.108 --> 00:02:29.004
And that's a calendar-changing event.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.422
There's a before and after
we were alone in the universe:
