00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.099
and the long-distance call.

00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:34.800
Because, of course, you used
to get interrupted by operators

00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:37.821
who'd tell you, "Long distance calling.
Do you want to hang up?"

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:40.547
And now we think nothing of calling
all over the world.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.670
Well, something similar may be happening

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:45.766
with reading and programming life.

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:48.364
But before I unpack that,

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.753
let's just talk about telescopes.

00:00:52.798 --> 00:00:57.109
Telescopes were overestimated
originally in their impact.

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.302
This is one of Galileo's early models.
