00:06:28.535 --> 00:06:30.845
and the other one
is a different kind of plague?

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:32.599
Well, here's a map of the plague.

00:06:33.037 --> 00:06:34.857
Some are absolutely deadly to humans,

00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:36.066
some are not.

00:06:36.486 --> 00:06:39.082
And note, by the way,
as you go to the bottom of this,

00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:40.859
how does it compare to tuberculosis?

00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:45.337
So this is the difference between
tuberculosis and various kinds of plagues,

00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:47.696
and you can play detective
with this stuff,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.195
because you can take
a very specific kind of cholera

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:51.409
that affected Haiti,

00:06:52.377 --> 00:06:55.063
and you can look at
which country it came from,

00:06:55.087 --> 00:06:56.813
which region it came from,

00:06:57.496 --> 00:07:02.238
and probably which soldier took that
from that African country to Haiti.
