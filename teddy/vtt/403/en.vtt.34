00:16:58.174 --> 00:17:00.285
That's the next frontier, along with:

00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:02.656
"How common is life in the universe?"

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.486
"Where did we come from?"

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.144
and questions like that.

00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:11.221
Let me end this with
an apocryphal quote from Einstein.

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.916
[You can live as if
everything is a miracle,

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.212
or you can live as if
nothing is a miracle.]

00:17:16.236 --> 00:17:17.749
It's your choice.

00:17:18.555 --> 00:17:21.034
You can focus on the bad,
you can focus on the scary,

00:17:21.058 --> 00:17:23.474
and certainly there's
a lot of scary out there.

00:17:24.012 --> 00:17:28.744
But use 10 percent of your brain
to focus on that, or maybe 20 percent,

00:17:28.768 --> 00:17:30.594
or maybe 30 percent.
