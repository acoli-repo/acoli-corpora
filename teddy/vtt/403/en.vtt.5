00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.422
There's a before and after
we were alone in the universe:

00:02:32.446 --> 00:02:34.916
forget about the discovery
of whatever continent.

00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:38.331
So as you're thinking about this,

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:41.257
we're now beginning
to be able to image most of the universe.

00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:43.535
And that is a time of miracle and wonder.

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:45.911
And we kind of take that for granted.

00:02:47.562 --> 00:02:49.477
Something similar is happening in life.

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:52.539
So we're hearing about life
in these little bits and pieces.

00:02:52.563 --> 00:02:55.221
We hear about CRISPR,
and we hear about this technology,

00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:56.911
and we hear about this technology.

00:02:56.935 --> 00:03:00.323
But the bottom line on life
is that life turns out to be code.
