00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:01.026
And I know you're really
excited by this picture.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.161
(Laughter)

00:08:02.185 --> 00:08:04.559
It only took us four years
and 40 million dollars

00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:06.185
to be able to take this picture.

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:07.439
(Laughter)

00:08:07.463 --> 00:08:08.834
And what we did

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:12.861
is we took the full gene code
out of a cell --

00:08:12.885 --> 00:08:16.796
not a gene, not two genes,
the full gene code out of a cell --

00:08:18.016 --> 00:08:19.856
built a completely new gene code,

00:08:20.825 --> 00:08:22.400
inserted it into the cell,

00:08:22.424 --> 00:08:25.356
figured out a way to have the cell
execute that code

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.634
and built a completely new species.

00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:31.369
So this is the world's first
synthetic life form.
