It's kind of the universe
of life on Earth,

00:07:31.706 --> 00:07:34.155
and it's being constantly
updated and completed.

00:07:34.982 --> 00:07:36.841
And so as you're looking at this stuff,

00:07:36.865 --> 00:07:40.216
the really important change is
the old biology used to be reactive.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.960
You used to have a lot of biologists
that had microscopes,

00:07:42.984 --> 00:07:46.283
and they had magnifying glasses
and they were out observing animals.

00:07:46.897 --> 00:07:48.766
The new biology is proactive.

00:07:49.433 --> 00:07:52.452
You don't just observe stuff,
you make stuff.

00:07:53.135 --> 00:07:54.783
And that's a really big change

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:57.616
because it allows us
to do things like this.

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:01.026
And I know you're really
excited by this picture.
