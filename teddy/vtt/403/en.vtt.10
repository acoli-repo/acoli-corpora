00:04:58.973 --> 00:05:01.532
This is a big discovery.

00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:03.479
There's 23 chromosomes.

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:04.731
Cool.

00:05:05.287 --> 00:05:08.966
Let's now start using a telescope version,
but instead of using a telescope,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.310
let's use a microscope to zoom in

00:05:11.334 --> 00:05:13.406
on the inferior of those chromosomes,

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.051
which is the Y chromosome.

00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:19.446
It's a third the size of the X.
It's recessive and mutant.

00:05:20.443 --> 00:05:21.594
But hey,

00:05:22.262 --> 00:05:23.481
just a male.

00:05:24.914 --> 00:05:27.194
And as you're looking at this stuff,

00:05:27.218 --> 00:05:30.668
here's kind of a country view
