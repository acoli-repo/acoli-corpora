00:14:27.547 --> 00:14:30.107
Now, some people say,

00:14:30.964 --> 00:14:34.429
"That's going to affect the environment
in an extreme way, don't do it."

00:14:35.326 --> 00:14:36.481
Other people say,

00:14:36.505 --> 00:14:39.732
"This is one of the things
that's killing millions of people yearly.

00:14:39.756 --> 00:14:43.304
Who are you to tell me
that I can't save the kids in my country?"

00:14:45.183 --> 00:14:47.036
And why is this debate so complicated?

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.941
Because as soon as you
let this loose in Brazil

00:14:49.965 --> 00:14:51.388
or in Southern Florida --

00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:52.953
mosquitoes don't respect walls.

00:14:52.977 --> 00:14:55.278
You're making a decision for the world

00:14:55.302 --> 00:14:57.209
when you put a gene drive into the air.
