00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:02.183
I am a cultural omnivore,

00:00:02.207 --> 00:00:06.843
one whose daily commute is made possible
by attachment to an iPod --

00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:09.096
an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.136
pop diva Christina Aguilera,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.776
country singer Josh Turner,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.235
gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin,

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.632
concerti, symphonies and more and more.

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:19.170
I'm a voracious reader,

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:22.125
a reader who deals with Ian McEwan
down to Stephanie Meyer.

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:25.354
I have read the Twilight tetralogy.

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:27.796
And one who lives for my home theater,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.799
a home theater where I devour
DVDs, video on demand
