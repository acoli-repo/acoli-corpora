00:00:01.436 --> 00:00:04.556
I remember climbing to the top
of our airing cupboard at home --

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:06.396
I must've been six or seven --

00:00:06.436 --> 00:00:08.596
I'm trying to flick my wrists
in the right way

00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:10.276
to make the spider web shoot out.

00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:12.356
I thought I had some super powers,

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:14.276
I just had to work out what they were.

00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:15.876
It was a disappointing afternoon.

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.076
(Laughter)

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:20.036
In the end, it didn't come with a suit,

00:00:20.076 --> 00:00:23.396
but I found there aren't many people
like me in the environment sector

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:25.996
and being a Black economist
who grew up in Derby

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:28.436
is my superpower in the fight
for the environment.

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:30.596
And we're facing huge challenges,
