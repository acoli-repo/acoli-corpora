and then they can get some cash.

00:07:30.292 --> 00:07:31.851
For the past several decades,

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:33.809
the entire country and the kabadiwalas,

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:36.143
and the bhandiwallas,
we have been doing that.

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:38.851
I'm very positive
that in three to five years,

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:42.434
you'll wake up, you know
that the plastic is being recycled,

00:07:42.458 --> 00:07:44.184
you're going to pick up a packaging,

00:07:44.208 --> 00:07:46.476

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.893
that uses recycled plastics,

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:49.893
so I'm super optimistic about this.

00:07:49.917 --> 00:07:51.559
Even as an entrepreneur.

00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:54.518

SRK: When I see a youngster
do what he has done and achieved,

00:07:57.458 --> 00:08:00.434
I want that part to also be
a source of encouragement
