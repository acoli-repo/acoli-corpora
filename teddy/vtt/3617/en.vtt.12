00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:00.684
from our recycled plastics.

00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:05.059
(Applause)

00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:06.601
But this is just the beginning.

00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:08.226
In the next five years,

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.309
we aspire to build an India

00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:13.018
where 100 percent of discarded plastics

00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:16.518
are recycled and
repurposed scientifically --

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:20.143
where plastic waste
no longer threatens our water bodies,

00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:23.684
and the very survival
of our terrestrial and marine life.

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:27.184
So the next time you go to a store
and pick up a shampoo bottle,

00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:31.518
see if that bottle uses safe
and sustainable recycled plastic.
