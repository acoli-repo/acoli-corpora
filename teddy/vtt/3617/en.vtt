Shah Rukh Khan: Say no to plastic.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.476
The one thing that
all environmental warriors teach us.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.101
But we begin and end the day

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:08.851
with products that have been made

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.976
from this virtually
indestructible material.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.018
The truth is that our consumption
and disposal of plastic has reached

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.476
such unsustainable proportions

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.768
that we need to address this
using every idea and resource at hand.

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:27.309
Please welcome someone who's helping
solve India's waste management issues,

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.684
Mani Vajipey,

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:33.851
recycler and cofounder/CEO
