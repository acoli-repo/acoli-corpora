00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.226
can be recycled several times over

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.934
without any compromise in quality.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:09.101
If we can recover and reuse
our discarded plastic,

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.893
then we save a significant
amount of virgin plastic

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:14.768
that we would have otherwise
produced and consumed.

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:16.226
And this is very important,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.393
because virgin plastic
is made from fossil fuels

00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:22.018
that are an exhaustible resource.

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:24.809
The more virgin plastic
we produce and consume,

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:28.309
the more plastic waste we have to manage.
