00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:04.309
SRK: Thank you, Mani.

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:08.726
When I was young, I used to --
(sings in Hindi).

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.726
How little do we know sometimes
that we are, as a nation,

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.726
the biggest recycler
of plastics and waste,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.059
if not just plastic,

00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:18.226
and we didn't know this
about our own country.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.351
MV: May I say something really cool?

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:22.768
Cities like New York and Paris today

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:25.184
are looking to put out
reverse vending machines

00:07:25.208 --> 00:07:28.226
so that people can go
and put trash in that

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.268
and then they can get some cash.
