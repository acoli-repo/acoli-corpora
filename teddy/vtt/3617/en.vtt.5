Mismanagement of plastic waste

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:34.184
leads to the leakage of such materials
into our water bodies.

00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:37.351
It's now common knowledge
that by the year 2050

00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:41.559
we'll have more plastics
in our oceans than fish.

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:43.059
About seven years ago,

00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:45.976
my friend and cofounder Raj and I,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.518
we decided that we were going to focus
on solving this massive problem.

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:51.393
We went around the city of Hyderabad,

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:53.184
talking to local recyclers.

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:54.726
Very soon, we found out

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.934
that there were many recyclers
just in Hyderabad alone.

00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.226
We soon realized

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.018
that the plastic recycling
industry of today
