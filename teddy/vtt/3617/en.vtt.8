00:03:57.708 --> 00:04:00.851
or before brands
could use recycled plastic,

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:02.601
we had to solve two things.

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.434
Quality and scale.

00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:09.351
For us, to make a shampoo bottle
from discarded plastics,

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:13.643
we had to collect tens of thousands
of tons of discarded plastics.

00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:15.476
For that, we needed data.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.018
Raj and I built a simple
data intelligence platform

00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:21.893
that allowed us to map all the recyclers,

00:04:21.917 --> 00:04:25.518
giving us a bird's eye view
of every recycler in Hyderabad.

00:04:25.542 --> 00:04:27.434
The results were astounding.

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:31.143
There were 2,000 kabadiwalas
just in Hyderabad alone.
