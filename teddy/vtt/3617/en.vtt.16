00:07:57.458 --> 00:08:00.434
I want that part to also be
a source of encouragement

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:01.726
for people to take over.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.809
So tell me, are you making a lot of money?

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:06.768
MV: What's so brilliant
about plastic recycling now is

00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:08.851
it's an idea whose time has come.

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:10.768
And we're very fortunate to have signed

00:08:10.792 --> 00:08:13.518
a really big, multimillion-dollar contract

00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:15.518
with some of the top FMCG companies.

00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:18.643
So we are at the inflection
point in India.

00:08:18.667 --> 00:08:19.934
And --

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.018
SRK: Tell us the money,
money, money, Mani.

00:08:22.042 --> 00:08:23.059
MV: (Laughs)

00:08:23.083 --> 00:08:25.274
SRK: Give the figure,
it will encourage people,

00:08:25.298 --> 00:08:27.934
it's not for greed,
it's not for any of the reasons ...

00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.226
Say to them.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.893
They are making good money, yeah.
