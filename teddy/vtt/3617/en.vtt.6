00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.018
that the plastic recycling
industry of today

00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:04.393
is not very different
from the milk industry

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.226
of the '60s and '70s.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.976
Milk in India is produced
by marginal milk farmers,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.018
with two or three cows or buffalos,

00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:14.518
who produce five to ten
liters of milk a day.

00:03:14.542 --> 00:03:17.559
Instead of blindly aping
solutions from the West,

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:20.851
India championed
the milk cooperative model,

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:24.934
where thousands of such
small-scale recyclers

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.143
were brought together into groups.

00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:31.143
With scale came innovations
and investments.
