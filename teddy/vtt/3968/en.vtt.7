00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.376
In practice, geography means
that countries proximate the conflict

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.000
take the overwhelming majority
of the world's refugees.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.456
The system isn't broken
because the rules are wrong.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.400
It's that we're not applying them
adequately to a changing world,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.840
and that's what we need to reconsider.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.936
So I want to explain to you a little bit
about how the current system works.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.120
How does the refugee regime actually work?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.336
But not from a top-down
institutional perspective,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.680
rather from the perspective of a refugee.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.696
So imagine a Syrian woman.
