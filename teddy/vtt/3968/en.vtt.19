00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.176
but he wanted to be a filmmaker.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.136
So with friends and colleagues,
he started a community radio station,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.896
he rented a video camera,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.416
and he's now making films.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.416
He made two documentary films

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.416
with and for our team,

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.760
and he's making a successful business
out of very little.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.616
It's those kinds of examples

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.376
that should guide
our response to refugees.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.736
Rather than seeing refugees

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.016
as inevitably dependent
upon humanitarian assistance,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.440
we need to provide them
with opportunities for human flourishing.
