00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.696
So imagine a Syrian woman.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.320
Let's call her Amira.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.760
And Amira to me represents
many of the people I've met in the region.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.896
Amira, like around 25 percent
of the world's refugees,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.200
is a woman with children,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.096
and she can't go home
because she comes from this city

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.136
that you see before you, Homs,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.896
a once beautiful and historic city

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.416
now under rubble.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.280
And so Amira can't go back there.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.336
But Amira also has no hope
of resettlement to a third country,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.856
because that's a lottery ticket
