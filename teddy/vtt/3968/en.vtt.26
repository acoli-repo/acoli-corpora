My colleagues Will Jones
and Alex Teytelboym

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.936
have explored ways in which that idea
could be applied to refugees,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.496
to ask refugees to rank
their preferred destinations,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.296
but also allow states to rank
the types of refugees they want

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.136
on skills criteria or language criteria

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.856
and allow those to match.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.976
Now, of course
you'd need to build in quotas

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.256
on things like diversity
and vulnerability,

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.816
but it's a way of increasing
the possibilities of matching.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.336
The matching idea
has been successfully used

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.496
to match, for instance,
students with university places,
