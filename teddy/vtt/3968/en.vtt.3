00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.200
What are we doing?

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.056
How has the situation come to this,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.880
that we've adopted such an inhumane
response to a humanitarian crisis?

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.696
I don't believe
it's because people don't care,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.896
or at least I don't want to believe
it's because people don't care.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.736
I believe it's because
our politicians lack a vision,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.376
a vision for how to adapt
an international refugee system

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.536
created over 50 years ago

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.360
for a changing and globalized world.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.336
And so what I want to do
is take a step back
