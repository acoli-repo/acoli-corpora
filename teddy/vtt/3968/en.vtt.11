00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.976
Alternatively, Amira can head
to an urban area

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.040
in a neighboring country,
like Amman or Beirut.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.040
That's an option that about 75 percent
of Syrian refugees have taken.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.920
But there, there's
great difficulty as well.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.016
Refugees in such urban areas
don't usually have the right to work.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.000
They don't usually get
significant access to assistance.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.136
And so when Amira and her family
have used up their basic savings,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.840
they're left with very little
and likely to face urban destitution.
