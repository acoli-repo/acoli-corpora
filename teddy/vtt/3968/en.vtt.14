Politicians frame the issue
as a zero-sum issue,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.576
that if we benefit refugees,
we're imposing costs on citizens.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.656
We tend to have a collective assumption

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.336
that refugees are an inevitable cost
or burden to society.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.440
But they don't have to.
They can contribute.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.296
So what I want to argue

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.296
is there are ways in which we can
expand that choice set

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.336
and still benefit everyone else:

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.216
the host states and communities,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.560
our societies and refugees themselves.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.056
And I want to suggest four ways

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.920
we can transform the paradigm
of how we think about refugees.
