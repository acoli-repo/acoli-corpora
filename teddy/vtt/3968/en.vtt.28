00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.296
So matching markets offer a potential way
to bring those preferences together

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.256
and listen to the needs and demands
of the populations that host

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.120
and the refugees themselves.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.560
The fourth idea I want to put to you
is of humanitarian visas.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.936
Much of the tragedy and chaos
we've seen in Europe

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.960
was entirely avoidable.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.496
It stems from a fundamental contradiction
in Europe's asylum policy,

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.896
which is the following:

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.416
that in order to seek asylum in Europe,

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.456
you have to arrive spontaneously
by embarking on those dangerous journeys
