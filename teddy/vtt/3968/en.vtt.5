like the situation we see in Syria today.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.536
Through an international convention
signed by 147 governments,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.576
the 1951 Convention
on the Status of Refugees,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.776
and an international organization, UNHCR,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.576
states committed to reciprocally
admit people onto their territory

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.120
who flee conflict and persecution.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.280
But today, that system is failing.
