00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.416
We have international treaties

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.656
that recognize that refugees
are a shared responsibility,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.736
and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.400
hosts more Syrians
than the whole of Europe combined.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.776
and yet we make that the only viable route

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.880
to seek asylum in Europe.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.696

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.176
and yet we exclude people who fit
our economic and demographic needs
