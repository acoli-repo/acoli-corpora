00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.256
There are times when I feel
really quite ashamed

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.520
to be a European.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.055
In the last year,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.656
more than a million people
arrived in Europe in need of our help,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.960
and our response,
frankly, has been pathetic.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.320
There are just so many contradictions.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.816
We mourn the tragic death

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.000
of two-year-old Alan Kurdi,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.856
and yet, since then,
more than 200 children

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240
have subsequently drowned
in the Mediterranean.
