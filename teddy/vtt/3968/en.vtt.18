00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.136
we found examples of Congolese refugees

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.696
running digital music exchange businesses.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.496
We found a Rwandan
who runs a business that's available

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.256
to allow the youth to play computer games

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.040
on recycled games consoles
and recycled televisions.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.256
Against the odds of extreme constraint,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.600
refugees are innovating,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.749
and the gentleman you see before you
is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.856
Demou-Kay arrived
in the settlement with very little,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.176
but he wanted to be a filmmaker.
