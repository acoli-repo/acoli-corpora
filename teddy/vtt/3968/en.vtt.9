00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.856
because that's a lottery ticket

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.320
only available to less than one percent
of the world's refugees.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.136
So Amira and her family

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.336
face an almost impossible choice.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.760
They have three basic options.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.520
The first option is that Amira
can take her family to a camp.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.680
In the camp, she might get assistance,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.856
but there are very few prospects
for Amira and her family.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.136
Camps are in bleak, arid locations,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.400
often in the desert.
