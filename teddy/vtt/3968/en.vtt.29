00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.456
you have to arrive spontaneously
by embarking on those dangerous journeys

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.680
that I described.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.256
But why should those journeys be necessary
in an era of the budget airline

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.696
and modern consular capabilities?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.056
They're completely unnecessary journeys,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.856
and last year, they led to the deaths
of over 3,000 people

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.360
on Europe's borders
and within European territory.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.976
If refugees were simply allowed

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.776
to travel directly
and seek asylum in Europe,

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.096
we would avoid that,

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.656
and there's a way of doing that
