00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.456
is preference matching
between states and refugees

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.616
to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes
you see here in the selfie

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.520
featuring Angela Merkel
and a Syrian refugee.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.440
What we rarely do is ask refugees
what they want, where they want to go,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.816
but I'd argue we can do that

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.920
and still make everyone better off.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.776
The economist Alvin Roth has developed
the idea of matching markets,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.040
ways in which the preference ranking
of the parties shapes an eventual match.
