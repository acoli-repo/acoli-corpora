00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.256
Together with my colleagues in Oxford,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.936
we've embarked on
a research project in Uganda

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.000
looking at the economic lives of refugees.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.896
We chose Uganda not because
it's representative of all host countries.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.400
It's not. It's exceptional.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.336
Unlike most host countries
around the world,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.816
what Uganda has done

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.216
is give refugees economic opportunity.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.600
It gives them the right to work.
It gives them freedom of movement.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.096
And the results of that are extraordinary

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.720
both for refugees and the host community.
