In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.160
you can hear the shells
across the border in Syria at nighttime.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.176
There's restricted economic activity.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.360
Education is often of poor quality.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.296
And around the world,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.416
some 80 percent of refugees
who are in camps

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.976
have to stay for at least five years.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.896
It's a miserable existence,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.296
and that's probably why, in reality,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.920
only nine percent of Syrians
choose that option.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.976
