Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food

00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:07.216
are all important in the emergency phase,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.840
but we need to also look beyond that.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.536
We need to provide opportunities
to connectivity, electricity,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.840
education, the right to work,

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.120
access to capital and banking.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.696
All the ways in which we take for granted

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.856
that we are plugged in
to the global economy

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.440
can and should apply to refugees.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.760
The second idea I want to discuss
is economic zones.
