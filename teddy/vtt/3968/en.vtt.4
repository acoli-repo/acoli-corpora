00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.336
And so what I want to do
is take a step back

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.776
and ask two really fundamental questions,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.256
the two questions we all need to ask.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.576
First, why is the current
system not working?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.000
And second, what can we do to fix it?

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.816
So the modern refugee regime

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.920
was created in the aftermath
of the Second World War by these guys.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.136
Its basic aim is to ensure

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.376
that when a state fails,
or worse, turns against its own people,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.976
people have somewhere to go,
