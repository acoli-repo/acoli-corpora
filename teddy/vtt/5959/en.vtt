I've got to be honest,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.830
companies tend to underestimate me

00:00:06.863 --> 00:00:08.330
and I want to change that.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.697
I think that when companies talk
about bringing their products and services

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.663
to my European and Asian peers,

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:19.563
they automatically consider things
like, where those peers shop,

00:00:19.597 --> 00:00:22.763
what are the considerations
before purchasing a product,

00:00:22.797 --> 00:00:26.430
are they brand-loyal
and who are their influencers?

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.997
That's great.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.263
It's smart business and good marketing.
