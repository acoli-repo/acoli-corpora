00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.896
yet we call people maniacs
and psychos, shaming them.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.336
We are creating barriers
for people that need help.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.840
Why are we embarrassing each other?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.696
Let's make it easier, not harder,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.440
for people to access
better mental health care.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.096
What else? Sexism, racism
and poverty affect gun ownership

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.880
and gun-related fatalities.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.296
On average, it's estimated that 50 women
were fatally shot each month

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.936
between 2010 and 2014
