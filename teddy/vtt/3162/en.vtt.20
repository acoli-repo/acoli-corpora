00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.880
And also, gun owners
can take personal initiative.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.736
If you own a gun,

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.960
ask yourself:

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.920
Do I have an extra gun I don't need?

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.336
Could it fall into the wrong hands?

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.800
Have I attended the latest training?

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.656
Perhaps as a gun owner,

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.936
you should also ask

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.016
whether you have been
taking care of your mental health?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.136
When it comes to gun violence,
the mental health argument falls flat

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.616
if we don't acknowledge
our own personal vulnerabilities
