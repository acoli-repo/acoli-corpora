Perhaps for some of us

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.160
it's time to lay down our arms.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.616
Then we have Choice C:

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.880
this will end when we do a better job
of taking care of each other.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.536
Many social issues affect
why people buy and use guns.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.096
Sixty-two percent of US gun fatalities

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.680
between 2012 and 2016 were suicides,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.896
yet we call people maniacs
and psychos, shaming them.
