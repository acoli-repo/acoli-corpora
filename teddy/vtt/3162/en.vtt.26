All right, discussion time is over.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.816
It's now time to answer the question.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.896
How do we stop this senseless violence?

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.040
Is it Choice A,

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.000
Choice B,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.200
Choice C?

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.736
Now, I know what you're all thinking.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.816
You remember that
multiple-choice questions

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.456
almost never end
with just three possibilities.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.680
There's always that fourth,
Choice D: all of the above.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.440
Maybe that's the answer here.
