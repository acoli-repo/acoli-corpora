00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.176
Fast-forward 80 years, to 1871.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.536
The American Civil War
had ended a few years prior,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.496
but a couple of Union officers

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.440
had witnessed some pretty shoddy
marksmanship on the battlefield.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.736
So in an attempt to prepare their men
for any future conflicts,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.776
they founded the National
Rifle Association

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.400
to promote rifle practice.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.416
In short, the Second Amendment
was written to ensure

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.216
that our newly formed and fragile country

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.216
had access to organized state militias.
