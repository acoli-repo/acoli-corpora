hold ourselves accountable

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:43.216
and regulate the estimated
300 million guns available in America.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.576
Yes, voting is one of the best ways

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.576

for gun violence.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.536
Making sure that our lawmakers

those 300 million guns under control.
