00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.256
And like I always do when I don't know
the answer to one of my questions,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.320
I began doing my homework.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.656
And as a history teacher,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.120
I knew I needed to start
with the Second Amendment and the NRA.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.896
In case it's been a while since
you've been sitting in a history class,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.536
here is what the Second Amendment

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.760
actually says:

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.616
"A well regulated Militia,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.016
being necessary
to the security of a free State,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.896
the right of the people
to keep and bear arms,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.480
shall not be infringed."
