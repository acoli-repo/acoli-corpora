00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.936
between 2010 and 2014

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.256
due to domestic violence,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.336
and women are still dying in their homes.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.856
Let's empower women

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.856
and give our young boys a chance to learn

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.040
how to work out their conflicts
and emotions with words, not weapons.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.016
And the "Washington Post"
reported that last year,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.696
nearly 1,000 people were fatally wounded

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.696
by on-duty police officers.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.816
Talk to Black Lives Matter
and the police union about that.
