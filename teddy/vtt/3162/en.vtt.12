00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.416
influenced how we as a people

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.920
manufacture, debate,
regulate and feel about guns.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.800
A lot of change has occurred.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.336
As a matter of fact, it wasn't until 2008

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.376
that the Supreme Court
ruled for the first time

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.776
the Second Amendment protects
an individual right to possess a firearm

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.336
unconnected with service in a militia

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.176
and to use that arm
for traditionally lawful purposes,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.136
such as self-defense within the home.
