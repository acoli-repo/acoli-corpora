00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.776
It's an incredibly complex
and dynamic history lesson,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.056
but it's not the lesson
I'm here to teach today,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.736
because we don't have time.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.336
I'm not talking about time,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.696
the time that I have here
to stand and speak.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.096
I'm talking about the fact
we don't have time to lose.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.216
According to the CDC,

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.496
over the last five years,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:29.176
on average, each day 96 people
are killed by guns in the United States,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.160
and if we don't figure out how to answer
my students' question soon,
