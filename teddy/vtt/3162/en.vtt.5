00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.376
the hardest question:

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.520
How can we stop the senseless violence?

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.200
This was the most difficult
question I've been asked.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.256
But it was not the first time
I've been humbled by a student's question.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.976
I've been teaching
in the public schools for 33 years,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.416
so I know you have to admit
what you don't know

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.680
before you can share what you do know.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.096
In fact, there's a method
to being an engaged student,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.040
teacher, citizen.
