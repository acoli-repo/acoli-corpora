00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.256
We sat there, only understanding
that somehow, Valentine's Day

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.056
had ended up with our babies dead,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.960
and we didn't know what to do next.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.856
It's been two months,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.696
and every day I still hear the echoes
of the "pop, pop" sound of the gunfire.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.336
I remember the fearful faces
of my students

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.080
when we knew it wasn't a drill.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.880
Still, there's no constant emotion,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.456
except for flashes
of pain, grief and anger
