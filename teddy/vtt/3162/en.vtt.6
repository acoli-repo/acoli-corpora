teacher, citizen.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.600
First, listen closely
to the person asking you a question.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.000
Second, admit your vulnerability.
Admit what you don't know.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.736
Third, do your homework.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.336
Fourth, humbly share your knowledge.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.536
I know all about this process.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.656
My students ask really
thoughtful questions all the time.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.296
They're eager to learn,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.080
and sometimes they're eager
to prove their smarts.
