00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.216
but I do remember I went into crisis mode,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.536
mother mode.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.760
There was no emotion.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.896
I lined up the kids,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.816
I held up a sign so they could
follow me through the hall,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.160
just like a fire drill.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.080
I heard shots from one direction.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.000
Luckily, we were already
moving in the opposite direction.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.680
We made it outside.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.120
We made it to safety.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.400
I called my mother.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.536
"I'm OK."

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.040
I called my husband.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.456
"I'm OK."
