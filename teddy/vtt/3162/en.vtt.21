00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.840
to mental illness.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.976
One in six Americans
will struggle with mental illness.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.816
If we own a gun, we should be
rigorously engaged in the upkeep

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.056
of our emotional well-being

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.016
so we don't pull a trigger

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.400
in times of illness.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.536
Otherwise, we should

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.400
whether we really have the time
and attention to own a gun.
