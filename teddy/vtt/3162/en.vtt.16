Choice A: this will end when we
hold gun manufacturers responsible

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.400
for the deadliness of their products.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.256
It might surprise you to learn that we've
actually thought about this before.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.176
Between 1998 and 2000,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.016
30 counties and cities
sued gun manufacturers,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.696
saying they should
make their products safer

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.400
and do a better job of tracking
where their products are sold.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.696
In response, manufacturers argued

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.560
that they had no direct liability
for how their products were used.
