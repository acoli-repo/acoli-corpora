00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:30.426
Architecture plays a key role
in whether a community crumbles

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.689
or comes together.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.565
Syrian society has long lived
the coexistence

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.945
of different traditions and backgrounds.

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.699
Syrians have experienced
the prosperity of open trade

00:02:39.723 --> 00:02:41.475
and sustainable communities.

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.570
They have enjoyed the true meaning
of belonging to a place,

00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:47.297
and that was reflected
in their built environment,

00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:49.789
in the mosques and churches
built back-to-back,

00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:52.060
in the interwoven souks and public venues,

00:02:52.084 --> 00:02:56.297
and the proportions and sizes based
on principles of humanity and harmony.

00:02:56.948 --> 00:03:00.360
This architecture of mixity
can still be read in the remains.
