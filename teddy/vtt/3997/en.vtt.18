00:08:57.524 --> 00:09:00.696
a place that's worth keeping,
contributing to,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.077
or whether they see it
as an alienating place,

00:09:03.101 --> 00:09:04.576
full of seeds of anger.

00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:09.307
In order for a place to give,
its architecture should be giving, too.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.104
Our built environment matters.

00:09:12.128 --> 00:09:16.112
The fabric of our cities is reflected
in the fabric of our souls.

00:09:16.802 --> 00:09:19.753
And whether in the shape
of informal concrete slums

00:09:19.777 --> 00:09:21.403
or broken social housing

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:23.186
or trampled old towns

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.956
or forests of skyscrapers,

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.083
the contemporary urban archetypes

00:09:27.107 --> 00:09:29.815
that have emerged
all across the Middle East

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:34.138
have been one cause of the alienation
and fragmentation of our communities.
