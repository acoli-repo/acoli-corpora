00:07:29.714 --> 00:07:32.240
Almost two years ago,
I introduced this design

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:35.261
into a UN-Habitat competition
for rebuilding it.

00:07:35.285 --> 00:07:39.623
The idea was to create an urban fabric
inspired by a tree,

00:07:39.647 --> 00:07:42.568
capable of growing
and spreading organically,

00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:45.814
echoing the traditional bridge
hanging over the old alleys,

00:07:45.838 --> 00:07:49.590
and incorporating apartments,
private courtyards, shops,

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:52.987
workshops, places for parking
and playing and leisure,

00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:54.594
trees and shaded areas.

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:57.611
It's far from perfect, obviously.

00:07:57.635 --> 00:08:00.906
I drew it during the few hours
of electricity we get.
