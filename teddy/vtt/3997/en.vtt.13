Hopefully, the war will end,

00:06:37.517 --> 00:06:41.011
and the question that,
as an architect, I have to ask, is:

00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:42.793
How do we rebuild?

00:06:43.317 --> 00:06:45.953
What are the principles
that we should adopt

00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:48.735
in order to avoid repeating

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:52.638
From my point of view, the main focus
should be on creating places

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.830
that make their people feel they belong.

00:06:54.854 --> 00:06:57.349

some of the traditional values
that did just that,
