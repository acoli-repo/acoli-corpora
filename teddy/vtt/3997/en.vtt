Hi. My name is Marwa,
and I'm an architect.

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:12.993
I was born and raised in Homs,

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:15.735
a city in the central
western part of Syria,

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.088
and I've always lived here.

00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:19.477
After six years of war,

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.429
Homs is now a half-destroyed city.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.128
My family and I were lucky;
our place is still standing.

00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:28.335
Although for two years,
we were like prisoners at home.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.048
Outside there were demonstrations
and battles and bombings and snipers.
