00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.048
Outside there were demonstrations
and battles and bombings and snipers.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.132
My husband and I used to run
an architecture studio

00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:38.798
in the old town main square.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.092
It's gone, as is most
of the old town itself.

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:44.566
Half of the city's other neighborhoods

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.747
are now rubble.

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:48.646
Since the ceasefire in late 2015,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.585
large parts of Homs
have been more or less quiet.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.302
The economy is completely broken,
and people are still fighting.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.803
The merchants who had stalls
in the old city market

00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:00.272
now trade out of sheds on the streets.
