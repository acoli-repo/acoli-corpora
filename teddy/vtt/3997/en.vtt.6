00:02:56.948 --> 00:03:00.360
This architecture of mixity
can still be read in the remains.

00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:04.122
The old Islamic city in Syria
was built over a multilayered past,

00:03:04.147 --> 00:03:06.578
integrating with it
and embracing its spirit.

00:03:06.602 --> 00:03:08.229
So did its communities.

00:03:08.253 --> 00:03:10.181
People lived and worked with each other

00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:12.411
in a place that gave them
a sense of belonging

00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:14.440
and made them feel at home.

00:03:14.464 --> 00:03:16.764
They shared a remarkably
unified existence.

00:03:17.748 --> 00:03:19.213
But over the last century,

00:03:19.237 --> 00:03:23.738
gradually this delicate balance
of these places has been interfered with;

00:03:23.762 --> 00:03:26.442
first, by the urban planners
of the colonial period,

00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:28.680
when the French went
enthusiastically about,

00:03:28.704 --> 00:03:31.962
transforming what they saw
as the un-modern Syrian cities.
