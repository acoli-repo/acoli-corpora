00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.946
The coherent urbanism
of the old Islamic city

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.866
and of many old European
towns, for instance,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.623
promote integration,

00:08:37.647 --> 00:08:40.884
while rows of soulless housing
or tower blocks,

00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:42.673
even when they are luxurious,

00:08:42.697 --> 00:08:45.362
tend to promote isolation and "otherness."

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.208
Even simple things

00:08:47.232 --> 00:08:51.088
like shaded places or fruit plants
or drinking water inside the city

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:54.287
can make a difference
in how people feel towards the place,

00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:57.500
and whether they consider it
a generous place that gives,

00:08:57.524 --> 00:09:00.696
a place that's worth keeping,
contributing to,
