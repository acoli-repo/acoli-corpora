We started this project 
10 years ago in IIT Madras

00:03:32.568 --> 00:03:37.054
and since then, many companies
have used it to grow their business.

00:03:37.368 --> 00:03:39.904
There is another aspect 
to this innovation.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:46.184
A person’s voice is also his identity,
just like his fingerprint.

00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:48.968
This is known as voice biometrics.

00:03:49.888 --> 00:03:55.464
Now Radha, who had to send money, 
won't need to remember a pin or password.

00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:59.224
She just has to say in her own voice,
“My voice is my identity."

00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:02.384
And say, “Send Rs. 500
to my daughter, Devi."
