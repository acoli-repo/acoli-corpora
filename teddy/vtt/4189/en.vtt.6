By stressing on three different words,

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:05.744
we have changed the meaning a little.

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:07.144
It is so complex

00:03:07.168 --> 00:03:09.478
that sometimes even
human beings don’t get it,

00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:11.968
then how will machines understand?

00:03:11.968 --> 00:03:15.384
To fill this gap, research 
is being done across the world.

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:21.704
And now in India, our team at Uniphore 
has taught 17 Indian languages

00:03:21.728 --> 00:03:25.064
and about 80 international 
languages to machines,

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:28.654
making the communication
between man and machine easy.

00:03:28.968 --> 00:03:32.544
We started this project 
10 years ago in IIT Madras
