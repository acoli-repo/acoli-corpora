My work began with this thought in mind.

00:01:30.168 --> 00:01:35.424
Technology will be under our control 
when each person, whether rich or poor,

00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:39.024
educated or uneducated is able to use it.

00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:43.024
This is possible only when we can
recognize the power of our voice

00:01:43.048 --> 00:01:45.744
and use it effectively.

00:01:45.768 --> 00:01:50.224
The easiest way to communicate 
is through conversation.

00:01:50.248 --> 00:01:55.434
Just imagine if we could speak
to machines the way we speak to humans,

00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:57.904
how easy would our lives be.

00:01:57.928 --> 00:02:00.064
Business would be so simple.
