Today we are programming machines

00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:10.008
in such a way that, 
through artificial intelligence,

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.974
they can understand not just
our language, our dialect, our tone,

00:02:13.974 --> 00:02:17.608
but even the feelings 
conveyed through our voice.

00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:19.824
But it's not easy.

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:26.074
There are more than six thousand languages
in the world and even more dialects.

00:02:26.288 --> 00:02:29.488
In India alone we have 780 languages.
