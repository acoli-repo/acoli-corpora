00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.430
Microbes are everywhere.

00:00:03.463 --> 00:00:05.430
They live in the air, the ocean,

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:09.563
the soil and on our bodies, lots of them.

00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:11.930
But before you reach
for the hand sanitizer,

00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:14.630
take a look at these beautiful
bacterial mats

00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:16.863
in Yellowstone's Grand Prismatic Spring.

00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:18.463
They’re absolutely amazing

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:21.330
because they’ve somehow figured out 
how to grow happily

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.463
at near boiling temperatures.

00:00:23.497 --> 00:00:27.597
Ever since life on Earth began,
probably in a place like this,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.363
microbes have kept planetary
chemical cycles in balance.
