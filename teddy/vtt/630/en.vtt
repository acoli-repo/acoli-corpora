00:00:00.391 --> 00:00:02.977
We are today talking
about moral persuasion:

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.983
What is moral and immoral
in trying to change people's behaviors

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.460
by using technology and using design?

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:11.316
And I don't know what you expect,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.293
but when I was thinking about that issue,

00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:17.356
I early on realized what I'm not able
to give you are answers.

00:00:17.943 --> 00:00:20.714
I'm not able to tell you
what is moral or immoral,

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:23.285
because we're living
in a pluralist society.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:27.551
My values can be radically
different from your values,

00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:30.752
which means that what I consider
moral or immoral based on that
