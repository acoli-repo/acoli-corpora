he cobbled together fragments 
of myth and poetry

00:02:30.597 --> 00:02:34.736
to compensate for the almost 
complete lack of official records.

00:02:34.736 --> 00:02:37.191
A few of his sources contained 
mentions of Arthur,

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.538
and some others were realistic accounts 
of battles and places.

00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:43.672
But many featured mythic heroes 
fighting long odds

00:02:43.672 --> 00:02:47.181
with the help of magical swords 
and sorcery.

00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:48.703
Geoffrey blended them all:

00:02:48.703 --> 00:02:51.640
A magical sword called Caledfwlch

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.762
and a Roman fortress called Caerleon 
appeared in his source material,

00:02:55.762 --> 00:03:00.973
so Geoffrey’s Arthur ruled from Caerleon
and wielded Caliburnus,
