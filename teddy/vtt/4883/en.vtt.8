He introduced tales of individual knights 
like Lancelot and Gawain,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.706
and mixed elements of romance 
in with the adventures.

00:04:03.706 --> 00:04:05.245
He conceived Arthur,

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.322
Lancelot,

00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:08.753
and Guinevere’s love triangle.

00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:14.568
In addition to interpersonal intrigue,
he also introduced the Holy Grail.

00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:21.063
Chrétien probably based his Grail’s powers
on magical objects in Celtic mythology.

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:23.675
He lived in the middle of the Crusades,

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:28.170
and others imposed the preoccupations 
of the time on the Grail,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.716
casting it as a powerful relic 
from the crucifixion.
