00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:31.118
One of the poems, The Gododdin, contains
the very first reference to Arthur,

00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:34.345
though Arthur himself 
doesn’t actually appear in it.

00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:37.717
It says a different warrior,
named Gwawrddur,

00:01:37.717 --> 00:01:42.024
was skilled at slaying his enemies, 
but was no Arthur.

00:01:42.024 --> 00:01:43.578
That’s not much to go on,

00:01:43.578 --> 00:01:45.566
but whoever this Arthur was,

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:48.817
he must’ve been 
the gold standard of warriors.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:54.405
Whether he ruled anyone, or even lived 
at all is, unfortunately, less clear.

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:56.164
Despite this uncertainty,

00:01:56.164 --> 00:02:00.016
references to Arthur caught 
the attention of an aspiring historian
