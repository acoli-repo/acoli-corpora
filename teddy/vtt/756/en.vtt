00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want you now to imagine

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a wearable robot

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that gives you superhuman abilities,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or another one that takes wheelchair users

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
up standing and walking again.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We at Berkeley Bionics

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
call these robots exoskeletons.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
These are nothing else

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
than something that you put on in the morning,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and it will give you extra strength,
