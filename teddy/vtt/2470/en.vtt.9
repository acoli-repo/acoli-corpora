00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.405
that blast, that one shot,
made him duck quickly under the table,

00:04:34.204 --> 00:04:35.418
like a child.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.333
He was shaking, panicking.

00:04:37.357 --> 00:04:42.165
And since then, he has never
been able to get up and fight.

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.881
He ended up working as a croupier

00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:47.027
in a Beirut casino
where I later found him,

00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:49.920
because he couldn't sleep,
so it was quite a suitable job.

00:04:50.378 --> 00:04:52.195
So I thought to myself,

00:04:52.957 --> 00:04:55.218
"What is this thing that can kill you

00:04:56.035 --> 00:05:00.592
without leaving
any visible scars?
