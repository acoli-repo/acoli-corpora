is to put human words to it.

00:12:30.234 --> 00:12:32.660
Because these people
feel excluded from humanity.

00:12:32.684 --> 00:12:35.890
No one wants to see them anymore
and they don't want to see anyone.

00:12:35.914 --> 00:12:38.335
They feel dirty, defiled, ashamed.

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:41.603
Someone said, "Doctor,
I don't use the subway anymore

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:44.841
because I'm afraid people
will see the horror in my eyes."

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:47.731
Another guy thought he had
a terrible skin disease

00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:51.592
and spent six months with dermatologists,
going from doctor to doctor.

00:12:51.616 --> 00:12:54.155
And then one day, they sent him
to a psychiatrist.

00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:56.584
During his second session,
he told the psychiatrist

00:12:56.608 --> 00:12:58.938
he had a terrible skin disease
from head to toe.

00:12:58.962 --> 00:13:01.881
The psychiatrist asked,
"Why are you in this state?"
