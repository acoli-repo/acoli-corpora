I don't know if you've ever had
an experience with death --

00:06:01.952 --> 00:06:03.835
I'm not talking about dead bodies,

00:06:03.859 --> 00:06:07.460
or someone's grandfather
lying in a hospital bed,

00:06:07.484 --> 00:06:11.058
or someone who got hit by a car.

00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:16.594
I'm talking about facing
the void of death.

00:06:17.688 --> 00:06:23.861
And that is something
no one is supposed to see.

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:25.727
People used to say,

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:29.726
"Neither the sun, nor death
can be looked at with a steady eye."

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.984
A human being should not
have to face the void of death.
