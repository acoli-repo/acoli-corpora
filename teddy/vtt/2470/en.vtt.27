00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:30.156
And if we can do that,
if we can talk about these things,

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.605
then step by step,
by working it out verbally,

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:36.557
we can reclaim our place in humanity.

00:13:37.549 --> 00:13:38.813
And it is important.

00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:40.525
Silence kills us.

00:13:41.789 --> 00:13:43.211
So what does this mean?

00:13:43.235 --> 00:13:45.251
It means that after a trauma,

00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:48.910
without question, we lose
our "unbearable lightness of being,"

00:13:48.934 --> 00:13:51.688
that sense of immortality
that keeps us here --

00:13:51.712 --> 00:13:55.624
meaning, if we're here, we almost feel
like we're immortal, which we're not,

00:13:55.648 --> 00:13:58.991
but if we didn't believe that,
we'd say, "What's the point of it all?"

00:13:59.015 --> 00:14:01.805
But trauma survivors have lost
that feeling of immortality.
