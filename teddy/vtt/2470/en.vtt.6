00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.785
And that's what I did.

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.713
I went upstairs, wrote
my article and sent it off.

00:03:15.077 --> 00:03:18.998
Later, aside from the feeling
of having lost my colleagues,

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:22.418

00:03:22.442 --> 00:03:26.209

00:03:28.735 --> 00:03:31.123
and I couldn't understand what it meant.
