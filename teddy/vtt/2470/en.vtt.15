00:07:28.282 --> 00:07:31.085
For example, a soldier
who enters a building

00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:33.943
and comes face to face
with another soldier aiming at him.

00:07:33.967 --> 00:07:36.530
He looks at the gun,
straight down the barrel.

00:07:36.554 --> 00:07:40.138
And this barrel suddenly
becomes enormous, deformed.

00:07:40.162 --> 00:07:42.916
It becomes fluffy, swallowing everything.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.540
And he says --

00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:48.718
later he will say, "I saw death.

00:07:48.742 --> 00:07:51.243
I saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead."

00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:55.124
And from then on, he knows he is dead.

00:07:55.148 --> 00:08:00.033
It is not a perception --
he is convinced that he is dead.
