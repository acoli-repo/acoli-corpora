00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:05.182
It was April 8, 2003.

00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:10.381
I was in Baghdad,
covering the war in Iraq.

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:15.063
That day, Americans tanks
started arriving in Baghdad.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.333
We were just a few journalists
in the Palestine Hotel,

00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:25.858
and, as happens in war,

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:28.886
the fighting began to approach
outside our windows.
