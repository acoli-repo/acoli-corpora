00:11:28.382 --> 00:11:30.627
So why do we not talk about it?

00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:33.096
Why have we not talked about it?

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.588
The problem is that
if you don't talk about it,

00:11:38.642 --> 00:11:40.237
you're heading for disaster.

00:11:41.528 --> 00:11:44.343
The only way to heal --

00:11:44.367 --> 00:11:47.565
and the good news here
is that this is treatable --

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:50.900
think Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. --

00:11:50.924 --> 00:11:52.209
it's indeed treatable.

00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:56.793
The only way to heal from this trauma,

00:11:56.817 --> 00:12:01.873
from this encounter with death
that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you
