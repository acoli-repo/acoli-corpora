00:11:56.817 --> 00:12:01.873
from this encounter with death
that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you

00:12:01.897 --> 00:12:05.897
is to find a way to express it.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.279
People used to say,

00:12:08.303 --> 00:12:11.870
"Language is the only thing
that holds all of us together."

00:12:11.894 --> 00:12:14.235
Without language, we're nothing.

00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:16.876
It's the thing that makes us human.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.877
In the face of such a horrible image --

00:12:18.901 --> 00:12:24.427
a wordless image of oblivion
that obsesses us --

00:12:24.451 --> 00:12:26.910
the only way to cope with it

00:12:28.109 --> 00:12:30.210
is to put human words to it.
