00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:30.828
And no one understands.

00:09:30.852 --> 00:09:34.620
They say, "There's nothing wrong with you.
You seem fine, you have no injuries.

00:09:34.644 --> 00:09:37.138
You went to war, came back; you're fine."

00:09:38.231 --> 00:09:40.113
These people suffer tremendously.

00:09:40.137 --> 00:09:41.716
Some commit suicide.

00:09:42.035 --> 00:09:44.749

00:09:44.773 --> 00:09:47.084

00:09:49.067 --> 00:09:53.097
Some commit suicide,

Everyone remembers
that grandfather or uncle or neighbor

00:09:57.517 --> 00:09:59.487
who used to drink, never said a word,

00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:01.280
always in a bad mood, beat his wife
