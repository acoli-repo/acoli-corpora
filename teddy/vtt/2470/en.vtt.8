00:03:59.177 --> 00:04:02.083
a 25-year-old veteran
who had been fighting for five years --

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:04.450
a real veteran -- who we would
follow everywhere.

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:07.960
He would crawl in the dark
with confidence --

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:11.143
he was a great soldier, a true soldier --

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:14.524
so we would follow him,
knowing that we would be safe with him.

00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:16.856
And one day, as I was told --

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.476
and I've seen him again since --

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.841
he was back in the camp, playing cards,

00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:22.746
when someone came in next door,

00:04:24.158 --> 00:04:26.294
and discharged their weapon.

00:04:26.318 --> 00:04:27.826
As the gun went off,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.405
that blast, that one shot,
made him duck quickly under the table,
