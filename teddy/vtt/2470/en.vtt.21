00:10:28.075 --> 00:10:30.559
After 20 minutes, people
were giving me dirty looks,

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:32.588
the hostess had her nose in the ashtray.

00:10:32.612 --> 00:10:35.583
It was horrible and I realized
I ruined the whole evening.

00:10:35.607 --> 00:10:37.516
So I don't talk about it anymore.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.081
We're just not ready to listen.

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.833
People say outright: "Please, stop."

00:10:40.857 --> 00:10:42.954
Is that a rare occurrence?

00:10:42.978 --> 00:10:45.380
No, it's extremely common.

00:10:45.404 --> 00:10:47.557

00:10:50.127 --> 00:10:53.267
one third of the US soldiers
who went to Iraq

00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:54.929
suffer from PTSD.

00:10:54.953 --> 00:11:00.874
In 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers
from the First World War
