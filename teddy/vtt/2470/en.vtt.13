00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.984
A human being should not
have to face the void of death.

00:06:34.008 --> 00:06:35.849
But when that happens,

00:06:37.801 --> 00:06:41.549
it can remain invisible for a while --

00:06:41.573 --> 00:06:44.341
days, weeks, months, sometimes years.

00:06:44.365 --> 00:06:46.126
And then, at some point,

00:06:47.587 --> 00:06:48.873
it explodes,

00:06:48.897 --> 00:06:52.641
because it's something
that has entered your brain --

00:06:52.665 --> 00:06:57.316
a sort of window between an image
and your mind --

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.665
that has penetrated your brain,

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:04.279
staying there and taking up
all the space inside.
