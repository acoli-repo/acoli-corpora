00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.040
it starves the water of oxygen.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.736
As soon as you do that,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.680
the other organisms
in the water can't survive.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.096
So, what do we do?

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.136
We try to produce a robot
that will eat the algae,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.016
consume it and make it safe.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.400
So that's the first problem.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.456
The second problem is also of our making,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.360
and it's to do with oil pollution.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.536
Now, oil comes out
of the engines that we use,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.896
the boats that we use.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.976
Sometimes tankers
flush their oil tanks into the sea,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.256
so oil is released into the sea that way.
