Hi, I'm an engineer

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.136
and I make robots.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.656
Now, of course you all know
what a robot is, right?

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.856
If you don't, you'd probably go to Google,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.736
and you'd ask Google what a robot is.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.000
So let's do that.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.376
We'll go to Google
and this is what we get.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.576
Now, you can see here there are
lots of different types of robots,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.336
but they're predominantly
humanoid in structure.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.016
And they look pretty conventional

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.496
because they've got plastic,
they've got metal,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.816
they've got motors and gears and so on.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.456
Some of them look quite friendly,
