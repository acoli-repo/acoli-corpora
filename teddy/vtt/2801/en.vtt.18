00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.496
if you use it, it takes about one watt.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.336
So that's a thousand or a million times
as much energy that that uses

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.320
compared to the microbial fuel cell.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.576
How can we cope with that?

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.456
Well, when the Row-bot
has done its digestion,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.936
when it's taken the food in,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.496
it will sit there and it will wait
until it has consumed all that food.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.736
That could take some hours,
it could take some days.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.456
A typical cycle for the Row-bot
looks like this:

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.736
you open your mouth,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.016
you move,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.296
you close your mouth

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.176
and you sit there for a while waiting.
