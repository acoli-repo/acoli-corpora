00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.376
and current robots can't either.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.576
They do all sorts of great things
like moving around on the floor;

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.856
they go into our gardens
and they eat our crops;

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.136
they climb trees;

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.376
they go in water, they come out of water;

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.976
they trap insects and digest them.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.816
So they do really interesting things.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.216
They live, they breathe, they die,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.056
they eat things from the environment.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.656
Our current robots don't really do that.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.896
Now, wouldn't it be great

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.576
if you could use some of those
characteristics in future robots

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.296
so that you could solve
some really interesting problems?
