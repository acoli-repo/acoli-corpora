00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.256
it contains motors, it contains wires,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.736
it contains components
which themselves are not biodegradable.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.496
Current Row-bots contain
things like toxic batteries.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.496
You can't leave those in the environment,

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.016
so you need to track them,

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.376
and then when they've finished
their job of work,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.656
you need to collect them.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.016
That limits the number
of Row-bots you can use.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.296
If, on the other hand,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.456
you have robot a little bit
like a biological organism,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.576
when it comes to the end of its life,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.056
it dies and it degrades to nothing.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.416
So wouldn't it be nice if these robots,

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.679
instead of being like this,
made out of plastic,

00:10:59.703 --> 00:11:01.296
were made out of other materials,
