00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.296
so that you could solve
some really interesting problems?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.376
I'm going to look at a couple of problems
now in the environment

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.136
where we can use
the skills and the technologies

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.176
derived from these animals

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.736
and from the plants,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.856
and we can use them
to solve those problems.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.240
Let's have a look
at two environmental problems.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.376
They're both of our making --

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.856
this is man interacting
with the environment

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.256
and doing some rather unpleasant things.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.920
The first one is to do
with the pressure of population.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.856
Such is the pressure
of population around the world

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.016
that agriculture and farming is required
to produce more and more crops.
