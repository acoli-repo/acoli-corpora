00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.496
it stops and then it closes the mouth --

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.936
slowly closes the mouths --

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.616
and then it will sit there,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.280
and it will digest the food.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.696
Of course these microbial fuel cells,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.976
they contain microbes.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.856
What you really want is lots of energy

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.496
coming out of those microbes
as quickly as possible.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.096
But we can't force the microbes

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.136
and they generate a small amount
of electricity per second.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.416
They generate milliwatts, or microwatts.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.296
Let's put that into context.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.856
Your mobile phone for example,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.256
one of these modern ones,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.496
if you use it, it takes about one watt.
