00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.416
Then the question is: Can you do this?

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.616
Well, yes, we have shown
that you can do this.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.736
You can make robots
which are biodegradable.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.616
What's really interesting
is you can use household materials

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.336
to make these biodegradable robots.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.936
I'll show you some;
you might be surprised.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.856
You can make a robot out of jelly.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.656
Instead of having a motor,
which we have at the moment,

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.136
you can make things
called artificial muscles.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.456
Artificial muscles are smart materials,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.936
you apply electricity to them,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.136
and they contract,
or they bend or they twist.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.376
They look like real muscles.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.400
So instead of having a motor,
you have these artificial muscles.
