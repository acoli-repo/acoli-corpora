00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.016
it could go straight through you,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.256
into the toilet,

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.496
and be degraded safely in the environment.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.760
So this changes the way, again,
in which we think about robots.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.016
So, we started off looking
at robots that would eat pollution,

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.696
and then we're looking
at robots which we can eat.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.376
I hope this gives you some idea

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.840
of the kinds of things
we can do with future robots.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.456
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.963
