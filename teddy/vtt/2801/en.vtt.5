00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.696
then they go into streams,
into lakes, into rivers

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.920
and into the sea.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.016
Now, if you put all
of these chemicals, these nitrates,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.656
into those kinds of environments,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.456
there are organisms in those environments
that will be affected by that --

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.096
algae, for example.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.656
Algae loves nitrates, it loves fertilizer,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.776
so it will take in all these chemicals,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.736
and if the conditions are right,
it will mass produce.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.016
It will produce masses
and masses of new algae.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.576
That's called a bloom.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.776
The trouble is that
when algae reproduces like this,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.040
it starves the water of oxygen.
