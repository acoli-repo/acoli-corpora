00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.176
and you sit there for a while waiting.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.576
Once you digest your food,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.416
then you can go about
doing the same thing again.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.416
But you know what, that looks
like a real organism, doesn't it?

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.296
It looks like the kind of thing we do.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.176
OK, if we're lucky with this cycle,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.736
at the end of the cycle
we'll have enough energy left over

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.896
for us to be able to do something else.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.936
We could send a message, for example.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.456
We could send a message saying,
