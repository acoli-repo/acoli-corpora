00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.680
you can use the microbial fuel cell
to treat some of the pollution.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.016
If you choose the right microbes,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.656
the microbes will eat the algae.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.016
If you use other kinds of microbes,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.560
they will eat petroleum
spirits and crude oil.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.656
So you can see
how this stomach could be used

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.936
to not only treat the pollution

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.760
but also to generate electricity
from the pollution.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.176
So the robot will move
through the environment,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.296
taking food into its stomach,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.816
digest the food, create electricity,
