00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.176
they look like this.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.976
So I've got the Row-bot here.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.416
I'll just hold it up for you.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.096
It gives you a sense of the scale,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.256
and it doesn't look
anything like the others.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.896
OK, so it's made out of plastic,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.976
and we'll have a look now
at the components

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.316
that make up the Row-bot --

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.721
what makes it really special.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.576
The Row-bot is made up of three parts,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.896
and those three parts are really
like the parts of any organism.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.576
It's got a brain,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.976
it's got a body

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.296
and it's got a stomach.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.736
It needs the stomach to create the energy.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.976
Any Row-bot will have
those three components,
