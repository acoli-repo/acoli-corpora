00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.056
Here. So instead of having batteries,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.256
instead of having
a conventional power system,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.536
it's got one of these.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.816
This is its stomach.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.096
And it really is a stomach

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.536
because you can put energy in this side
in the form of pollution,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.216
and it creates electricity.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.456
So what is it?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.136
It's called a microbial fuel cell.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.256
It's a little bit
like a chemical fuel cell,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.296
which you might have
come across in school,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.936
or you might've seen in the news.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.096
Chemical fuel cells
take hydrogen and oxygen,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.936
and they can combine them together
and you get electricity.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.376
That's well-established technology;
it was in the Apollo space missions.
