00:10:59.703 --> 00:11:01.296
were made out of other materials,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.056
which when you throw them out there,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.416
they biodegrade to nothing?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.536
That changes the way
in which we use robots.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.936
Instead of putting 10 or 100
out into the environment,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.216
having to track them,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.576
and then when they die,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.816
collect them,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.536
you could put a thousand,

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.296
a million, a billion robots
into the environment.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.136
Just spread them around.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.776
You know that at the end of their lives,
they're going to degrade to nothing.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.496
You don't need to worry about them.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.136
So that changes the way
in which you think about robots

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.536
and the way you deploy them.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.416
Then the question is: Can you do this?
