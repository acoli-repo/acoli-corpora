00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.096
So you can see really
it's got a mouth and a derriere,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.336
or a --

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.376
(Laughter)

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.136
something where the stuff comes out,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.856
which is just like a real organism.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.696
So it's starting to look
like that basking shark.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.096
So that's the body.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.256
The second component might be the stomach.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.176
We need to get the energy into the robot
and we need to treat the pollution,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.736
so the pollution goes in,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.256
and it will do something.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.856
It's got a cell in the middle here
called a microbial fuel cell.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.640
I'll put this down,
and I'll lift up the fuel cell.
