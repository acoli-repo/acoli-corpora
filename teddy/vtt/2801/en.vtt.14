00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.376
That's well-established technology;
it was in the Apollo space missions.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.880
That's from 40, 50 years ago.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.696
This is slightly newer.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.176
This is a microbial fuel cell.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.456
It's the same principle:

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.896
it's got oxygen on one side,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.016
but instead of having
hydrogen on the other,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.336
it's got some soup,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.176
and inside that soup
there are living microbes.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.896
Now, if you take some organic material --

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.256
could be some waste products, some food,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.776
maybe a bit of your sandwich --

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.616
you put it in there,
the microbes will eat that food,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.520
and they will turn it into electricity.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.896
Not only that, but if you select
the right kind of microbes,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.680
you can use the microbial fuel cell
to treat some of the pollution.
