00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.800
and it swims through the water,
collecting plankton.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.096
As it does that, it digests the food,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.640
and then it uses that energy
in its body to keep moving.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.256
So, could we make a robot like that --

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.816
like the basking shark
that chugs through the water

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.200
and eats up pollution?

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.896
Well, let's see if we can do that.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.976
But also, we take the inspiration
from other organisms.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.056
I've got a picture here
of a water boatman,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.896
and the water boatman is really cute.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.496
When it's swimming in the water,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.000
it uses its paddle-like legs
to push itself forward.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.616
So we take those two organisms
