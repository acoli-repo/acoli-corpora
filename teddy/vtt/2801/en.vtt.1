Some of them look quite friendly,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.536
and you could go up
and you could hug them.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.976
Some of them not so friendly,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.456
they look like they're
straight out of "Terminator,"

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.016
in fact they may well be
straight out of "Terminator."

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.776
You can do lots of really cool
things with these robots --

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.416
you can do really exciting stuff.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.376
But I'd like to look
at different kinds of robots --

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.376
I want to make different kinds of robots.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.816
And I take inspiration
from the things that don't look like us,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.240
but look like these.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.256
So these are natural biological organisms

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.856
and they do some
really cool things that we can't,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.376
and current robots can't either.
