00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.616
So we take those two organisms

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.640
and we combine them together
to make a new kind of robot.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.496
In fact, because we're using
the water boatman as inspiration,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.296
and our robot sits on top of the water,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.576
and it rows,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.816
we call it the "Row-bot."

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.696
So a Row-bot is a robot that rows.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.416
OK. So what does it look like?

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.176
Here's some pictures of the Row-bot,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.416
and you'll see,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.776
it doesn't look anything like the robots
we saw right at the beginning.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.936
Google is wrong;
robots don't look like that,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.176
they look like this.
