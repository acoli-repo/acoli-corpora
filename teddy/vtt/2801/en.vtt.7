00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.256
so oil is released into the sea that way.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.856
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could treat that in some way

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.600
using robots that could eat the pollution
the oil fields have produced?

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.776
So that's what we do.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.400
We make robots that will eat pollution.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.216
To actually make the robot,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.440
we take inspiration from two organisms.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.416
On the right there
you see the basking shark.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.976
The basking shark is a massive shark.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.576
It's noncarnivorous,
so you can swim with it,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.056
as you can see.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.936
And the basking shark opens its mouth,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.800
and it swims through the water,
collecting plankton.
