00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.016
that agriculture and farming is required
to produce more and more crops.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.256
Now, to do that,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.656
farmers put more and more
chemicals onto the land.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.816
They put on fertilizers,
nitrates, pesticides --

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.216
all sorts of things
that encourage the growth of the crops,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.376
but there are some negative impacts.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.856
One of the negative impacts is
if you put lots of fertilizer on the land,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.296
not all of it goes into the crops.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.896
Lots of it stays in the soil,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.376
and then when it rains,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.896
these chemicals go into the water table.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.176
And in the water table,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.696
then they go into streams,
into lakes, into rivers
