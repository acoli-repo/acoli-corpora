(Laughter) -- as a photographer
is the quality of vulnerability.

00:05:41.626 --> 00:05:45.330
The physical exterior reveals a crack
in which you can get a glimpse

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.511

00:05:51.878 --> 00:05:56.499
but as I watched Stacey's dates
and talked to her about them,

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:02.512
I realized how different
photographic love is from real love.
