He said, "You're in an elevator
running late for a meeting.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.397
Someone makes a dash for the elevator.

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:37.346
Do you hold it open for them?"

00:03:37.346 --> 00:03:39.343
And I said I would not.

00:03:39.343 --> 00:03:41.926
(Laughter)

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:47.818
Cliff said the first thing he notices
about a woman is her teeth,

00:03:47.818 --> 00:03:50.813
and we complimented each other's teeth.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:53.181
Because he's an open mouth sleeper,

00:03:53.181 --> 00:03:57.384
he says he has to floss more
to help prevent gum disease,

00:03:57.384 --> 00:03:59.799
and so I asked him how often he flosses,

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.399
and he said, "Every other day."
