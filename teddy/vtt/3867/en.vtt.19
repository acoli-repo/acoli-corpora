we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples
if they had an old wedding photograph.

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:39.712
In their case, they simultaneously
pulled out of their wallets

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:44.008
the exact same photograph.

00:09:44.008 --> 00:09:47.142
What's more beautiful,
I thought to myself,

00:09:47.142 --> 00:09:51.438
this image of a young couple
who has just fallen in love

00:09:51.438 --> 00:09:56.644
or the idea of these two people
holding onto this image for decades?

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.122
Thank you.
