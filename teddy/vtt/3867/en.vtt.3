She said yes, and that was it.

00:01:31.173 --> 00:01:35.469
I then asked Alec if he'd be interested
in doing a photography project

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.280
exploring this question.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.320
AS: And I was interested in the question,
but I was actually much more interested

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.796
in Stacey's motivation for asking it,

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:48.727
particularly since I'd never known
Stacey to have a boyfriend.

00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:51.513
So as part of this project,
I thought it'd be interesting

00:01:51.513 --> 00:01:53.626
if she tried to meet someone.

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:58.471
So my idea was to have Stacey here
go speed dating

00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:02.542
in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day.
