I took the picture of her parents,

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:35.074
but I was actually more excited
about photographing Stacey.

00:00:35.074 --> 00:00:36.832
The picture I made that day

00:00:36.832 --> 00:00:39.946
ended up becoming
one of my best-known portraits.

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.031
At the time I made this picture,
Stacey was working as an attorney

00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:46.686
for the State of Texas.

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:51.386
Not long after, she left her job
to study photography in Maine,

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:53.651
and while she was there,
she ended up meeting

00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:56.786
the director of photography
at the New York Times Magazine

00:00:56.786 --> 00:01:00.153
and was actually offered a job.
