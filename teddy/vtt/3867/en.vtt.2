00:00:56.786 --> 00:01:00.153
and was actually offered a job.

00:01:00.153 --> 00:01:02.982
Stacey Baker: In the years since,
Alec and I have done

00:01:02.982 --> 00:01:05.214
a number of magazine projects together,

00:01:05.214 --> 00:01:07.165
and we've become friends.

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:11.948
A few months ago, I started talking
to Alec about a fascination of mine.

00:01:11.948 --> 00:01:15.338
I've always been obsessed
with how couples meet.

00:01:15.338 --> 00:01:18.310
I asked Alec how he
and his wife Rachel met,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.166
and he told me the story
of a high school football game

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.091
where she was 16 and he was 15,

00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:26.181
and he asked her out.

00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:28.015
He liked her purple hair.

00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:31.173
She said yes, and that was it.
