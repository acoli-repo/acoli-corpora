00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:02.542
in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day.

00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:08.463
(Laughter) (Applause) (Music)

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:13.664
SB: We ended up at what was advertised
as the world's largest speed dating event.

00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:15.684
I had 19 dates

00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:18.679
and each date lasted three minutes.

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.616
Participants were given a list of ice-
breaker questions to get the ball rolling,

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:26.563
things like, "If you could be any kind
of animal, what would you be?"

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:28.444
That sort of thing.

00:02:28.444 --> 00:02:30.858
My first date was Colin.
