00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:00.878
What was more interesting

00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:04.593
was how they managed to stay together.

00:09:04.593 --> 00:09:08.773
AS: They all had this beautiful
quality of endurance,

00:09:08.773 --> 00:09:11.048
but that was true of the singles, too.

00:09:11.048 --> 00:09:14.856
The world is hard,
and the singles were out there

00:09:14.856 --> 00:09:17.201
trying to connect with other people,

00:09:17.201 --> 00:09:19.825
and the couples
were holding onto each other

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:21.592
after all these decades.

00:09:23.842 --> 00:09:27.151
My favorite pictures on this trip
were of Joe and Roseanne.

00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:29.395
Now, by the time we met Joe and Roseanne,

00:09:29.395 --> 00:09:34.906
we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples
if they had an old wedding photograph.
