I realized how different
photographic love is from real love.

00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:06.162
What is real love? How does it work?

00:06:06.162 --> 00:06:10.504
In order to work on this question
and to figure out how someone goes

00:06:10.504 --> 00:06:15.078
from meeting on a date
to having a life together,

00:06:15.078 --> 00:06:17.632
Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin,

00:06:17.632 --> 00:06:21.769
which is the largest
retirement community in Las Vegas.

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:27.638
Our contact there was George,
who runs the community's photography club.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.447
He arranged for us to meet other couples
in their makeshift photo studio.
