Clearly, you could use it
as a third eyeball for a giraffe, right?

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.327
Maybe. That's sort of interesting,
kind of new. But is it creative?

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.452
So people came up with
as many ideas as they could,

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:09.641
and we had to decide:

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:11.265
Is this creative or not?

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:15.723
The definition of creativity
that a lot of people go with

00:01:15.747 --> 00:01:17.392
is "appropriate novelty."

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:20.487
For something to be appropriate,
it has to be realistic,

00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:24.376
so unfortunately, you can't use
a key as an eyeball.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.568
Boo!

00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:30.439
But "novel," the second thing,
is that nobody had to have said it.
