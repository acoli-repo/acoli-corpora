00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.008
they walked on the treadmill first,
and then they sat.

00:02:32.762 --> 00:02:36.520
OK, so the two groups
that sat together for the first test,

00:02:36.544 --> 00:02:38.605
they looked pretty similar to each other,

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.578
and they averaged
about 20 creative ideas per person.

00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:44.574
The group that was walking
on the treadmill

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:46.411
did almost twice as well.

00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:50.419
And they were just walking
on a treadmill in a windowless room.

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:54.788
Remember, they took the test twice.

00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:58.506
The people who sat twice for that second
test didn't get any better;

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.738
practice didn't help.
