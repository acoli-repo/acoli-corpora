00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:32.426
You were either walking
indoors or outdoors.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.038
And all of these studies
found the same conclusion.

00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:38.716
I'm only going to tell you
about one of them today.

00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:43.321
One of the tests we used for creativity
was alternate uses.

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:45.080
In this test, you have four minutes.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:48.981
Your job is to come up with as many other
ways to use common everyday objects

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:50.216
as you can think of.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.152
So, for example,
what else would you do with a key,

00:00:53.176 --> 00:00:55.593
other than to use it
for opening up a lock?

00:00:56.238 --> 00:01:00.226
Clearly, you could use it
as a third eyeball for a giraffe, right?
