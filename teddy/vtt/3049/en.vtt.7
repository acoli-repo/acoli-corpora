First, you want to pick a problem
or a topic to brainstorm.

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:34.645
So, this is not the shower effect,

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.861
when you're in the shower
and all of a sudden,

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:38.924
a new idea pops out of the shampoo bottle.

00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:41.527
This is something
you're thinking about ahead of time.

00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:45.114
They're intentionally thinking about
brainstorming a different perspective

00:03:45.138 --> 00:03:46.468
on the walk.

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.358
Secondly -- I get asked this a lot:

00:03:48.382 --> 00:03:50.353
Is this OK while running?

00:03:50.377 --> 00:03:53.195
Well, the answer for me
is that if I were running,

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.545
the only new idea I would have
would be to stop running, so ...

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.861
(Laughter)

00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:02.006
But if running for you
is a comfortable pace, good.
