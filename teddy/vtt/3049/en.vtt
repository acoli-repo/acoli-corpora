The creative process -- you know this --

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:05.807
from the first idea to the final product,

00:00:05.831 --> 00:00:07.624
is a long process.

00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:10.387
It's super-iterative, lots of refinement,

00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:12.484
blood, sweat, tears and years.

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:15.067
And we're not saying
you're going to go out for a walk

00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:17.782
and come back with the Sistine Chapel
in your left hand.

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:20.494
So what frame of the creative
process did we focus on?

00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:21.984
Just this first part.

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:24.577
Just brainstorming,
coming up with a new idea.

00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:29.984
We actually ran four studies
with a variety of people.
