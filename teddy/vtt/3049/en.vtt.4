00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:00.935
(Laughter)

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.244
And it's a creative idea,
because it's appropriate and it's novel.

00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:07.672
You either did this test and came up
with ideas while you were seated

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:10.248
or while you were walking on a treadmill.

00:02:10.272 --> 00:02:11.540
(Laughter)

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:14.940
They did the test twice,
with different objects.

00:02:14.964 --> 00:02:18.047
Three groups: the first group sat first

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.914
and then sat again for the second test.

00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:23.496
The second group sat first

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.863
and then did the second test
while walking on a treadmill.

00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:29.036
The third group --
and this is interesting --

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.008
they walked on the treadmill first,
and then they sat.
