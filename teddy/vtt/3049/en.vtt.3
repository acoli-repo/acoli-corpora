00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:30.439
But "novel," the second thing,
is that nobody had to have said it.

00:01:30.463 --> 00:01:33.367
So for us, it had to be appropriate first,

00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:34.934
and then for novelty,

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.743
nobody else in the entire population
that we surveyed could have said it.

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:42.466
So you might think you could use
a key to scratch somebody's car,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.405
but if somebody else said that,
you didn't get credit for it.

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:46.604
Neither of you did.

00:01:46.628 --> 00:01:49.607
However, only one person said this:

00:01:50.592 --> 00:01:53.474
"If you were dying
and it were a murder mystery,

00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:56.492
and you had to carve the name
of the murderer into the ground

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.103
with your dying words."

00:01:58.127 --> 00:01:59.810
One person said this.

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:00.935
(Laughter)
