00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:02.006
But if running for you
is a comfortable pace, good.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.588
It turns out, whatever physical
activity is not taking a lot of attention.

00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:09.411
So just walking at a comfortable
pace is a good choice.

00:04:10.576 --> 00:04:13.342
Also, you want to come up with
as many ideas as you can.

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:16.814
One key of creativity
is to not lock on that first idea.

00:04:16.838 --> 00:04:18.089
Keep going.

00:04:18.113 --> 00:04:21.849
Keep coming up with new ones,
until you pick one or two to pursue.

00:04:23.007 --> 00:04:26.104
You might worry that you don't want
to write them down,

00:04:26.128 --> 00:04:27.963
because what if you forget them?

00:04:27.987 --> 00:04:29.872
So the idea here is to speak them.

00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:31.848
Everybody was speaking their new ideas.
