00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.266
And to really get somewhere,
we need to filter all our facts here,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.846
through friends and neighbors
and parents and children

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.902
and coworkers and newspapers
and magazines,

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:38.006
to finally be grounded in real knowledge,

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.077
which is something that a search engine
is a poor help to achieve.

00:02:43.284 --> 00:02:49.612
So, I promised you an example
just to show you why it's so hard

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:53.040
to get to the point of true, clean,
objective knowledge --

00:02:53.064 --> 00:02:54.532
as food for thought.

00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:58.449
I will conduct a couple of simple
queries, search queries.

00:02:58.473 --> 00:03:02.513
We'll start with "Michelle Obama,"
