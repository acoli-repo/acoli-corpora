So whenever I visit a school
and talk to students,

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:05.747
I always ask them the same thing:

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:08.188
Why do you Google?

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:12.021
Why is Google the search engine
of choice for you?

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.407
Strangely enough, I always get
the same three answers.

00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:17.470
One, "Because it works,"

00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:20.400
which is a great answer;
that's why I Google, too.

00:00:20.424 --> 00:00:22.457
Two, somebody will say,

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:25.121
"I really don't know of any alternatives."

00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:28.836
It's not an equally great answer
and my reply to that is usually,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.781
"Try to Google the word 'search engine,'
