00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:32.818
that distorted monkey picture
showed up among the first results.

00:04:32.842 --> 00:04:36.408
Now, the results are self-cleansing,

00:04:36.432 --> 00:04:38.185
and that's sort of the beauty of it,

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:41.612
because Google measures relevance
every hour, every day.

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:44.350
However, Google didn't settle
for that this time,

00:04:44.374 --> 00:04:47.498
they just thought, "That's racist
and it's a bad search result

00:04:47.522 --> 00:04:50.657
and we're going to go back
and clean that up manually.

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.613
We are going to write
some code and fix it,"

00:04:53.637 --> 00:04:54.884
which they did.

00:04:55.454 --> 00:04:59.196
And I don't think anyone in this room
thinks that was a bad idea.

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:00.953
Me neither.
