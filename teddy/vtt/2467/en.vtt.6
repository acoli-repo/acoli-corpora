00:02:58.473 --> 00:03:02.513
We'll start with "Michelle Obama,"

00:03:02.537 --> 00:03:04.341
the First Lady of the United States.

00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:06.094
And we'll click for pictures.

00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:09.279
It works really well, as you can see.

00:03:09.303 --> 00:03:12.331
It's a perfect search
result, more or less.

00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:15.105
It's just her in the picture,
not even the President.

00:03:15.664 --> 00:03:16.977
How does this work?

00:03:17.837 --> 00:03:19.209
Quite simple.

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.448
Google uses a lot of smartness
to achieve this, but quite simply,

00:03:22.472 --> 00:03:24.532
they look at two things
more than anything.

00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:29.712
First, what does it say in the caption
under the picture on each website?

00:03:29.736 --> 00:03:31.951
Does it say "Michelle Obama"
under the picture?
