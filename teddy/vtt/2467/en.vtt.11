00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:30.841
Almost 80 people died that day.

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:36.956
And a lot of people would describe
this act of terror as two steps,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.391
that he did two things: he blew up
the buildings and he shot those kids.

00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:41.580
It's not true.

00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:44.469
It was three steps.

00:05:44.493 --> 00:05:46.707
He blew up those buildings,
he shot those kids,

00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:50.375
and he sat down and waited
for the world to Google him.

00:05:51.227 --> 00:05:53.854
And he prepared
all three steps equally well.

00:05:54.544 --> 00:05:57.334
And if there was somebody
who immediately understood this,

00:05:57.358 --> 00:05:58.882
it was a Swedish web developer,

00:05:58.906 --> 00:06:02.529
a search engine optimization expert
in Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist.
