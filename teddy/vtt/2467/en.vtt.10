00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:00.953
Me neither.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.834
But then, a couple of years go by,

00:05:05.858 --> 00:05:08.842
and the world's most-Googled Anders,

00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:11.145
Anders Behring Breivik,

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.875
did what he did.

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:14.900
This is July 22 in 2011,

00:05:14.924 --> 00:05:17.573
and a terrible day in Norwegian history.

00:05:17.597 --> 00:05:21.384
This man, a terrorist, blew up
a couple of government buildings

00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:24.291
walking distance from where we are
right now in Oslo, Norway

00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:26.366
and then he traveled
to the island of Utøya

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.613
and shot and killed a group of kids.

00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:30.841
Almost 80 people died that day.
