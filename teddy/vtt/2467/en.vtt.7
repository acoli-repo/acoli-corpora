00:03:29.736 --> 00:03:31.951
Does it say "Michelle Obama"
under the picture?

00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:34.331
Pretty good indication
it's actually her on there.

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:36.741
Second, Google looks at the picture file,

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:39.797
the name of the file as such
uploaded to the website.

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.490
Again, is it called "MichelleObama.jpeg"?

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.761
Pretty good indication it's not
Clint Eastwood in the picture.

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:50.050
So, you've got those two and you get
a search result like this -- almost.

00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:56.677
Now, in 2009, Michelle Obama
was the victim of a racist campaign,

00:03:56.701 --> 00:04:00.716
where people set out to insult her
through her search results.
