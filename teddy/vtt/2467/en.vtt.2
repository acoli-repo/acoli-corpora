00:00:59.472 --> 00:01:04.358
even if I, too, realize that that trust,
that idea of the unbiased search result

00:01:04.382 --> 00:01:08.237
is a cornerstone in our collective love
for and appreciation of Google.

00:01:08.658 --> 00:01:12.916
I will show you why that, philosophically,
is almost an impossibility.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.194
But let me first elaborate,
just a little bit, on a basic principle

00:01:16.218 --> 00:01:19.331
behind each search query
that we sometimes seem to forget.

00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:21.931
So whenever you set out
to Google something,

00:01:21.955 --> 00:01:25.882
start by asking yourself this:
"Am I looking for an isolated fact?"

00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:29.495
What is the capital of France?

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:31.944
What are the building blocks
of a water molecule?
