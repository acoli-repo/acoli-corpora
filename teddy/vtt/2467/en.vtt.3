What are the building blocks
of a water molecule?

00:01:31.968 --> 00:01:34.309
Great -- Google away.

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.453
There's not a group of scientists
who are this close to proving

00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:39.474
that it's actually London and H30.

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.869
You don't see a big conspiracy
among those things.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.426
We agree, on a global scale,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.175
what the answers are
to these isolated facts.

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:51.501
But if you complicate your question
just a little bit and ask something like,

00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:54.208
"Why is there
an Israeli-Palestine conflict?"

00:01:54.978 --> 00:01:57.618
You're not exactly looking
for a singular fact anymore,

00:01:57.642 --> 00:01:59.475
you're looking for knowledge,

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.077
which is something way more
complicated and delicate.
