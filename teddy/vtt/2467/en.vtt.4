00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.077
which is something way more
complicated and delicate.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.149
And to get to knowledge,

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:07.204
you have to bring 10 or 20
or 100 facts to the table

00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:10.204
and acknowledge them and say,
"Yes, these are all true."

00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:11.902

but this is more important
to me than that."

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:21.695
And this is where it becomes interesting,

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.865
because this is where we become human.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.885
This is when we start
to argue, to form society.

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.266
And to really get somewhere,
we need to filter all our facts here,
