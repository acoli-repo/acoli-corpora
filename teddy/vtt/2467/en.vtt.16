00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.270
with the authority to say who's who.

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:03.623
"We like you, we dislike you.

00:08:03.647 --> 00:08:05.686
We believe in you,
we don't believe in you.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.257
You're right, you're wrong.
You're true, you're false.

00:08:08.281 --> 00:08:10.086
You're Obama, and you're Breivik."

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.791
That's power if I ever saw it.

00:08:15.206 --> 00:08:18.858
So I'm asking you to remember
that behind every algorithm

00:08:18.882 --> 00:08:20.659
is always a person,

00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:23.178
a person with a set of personal beliefs

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:25.727
that no code can ever
completely eradicate.

00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:28.185
And my message goes
out not only to Google,

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:31.019
but to all believers in the faith
of code around the world.
