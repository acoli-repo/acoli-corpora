00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.508
it suggested that I might like to try
and get hold of the work

00:06:01.532 --> 00:06:04.111
of the Panamanian author
Juan David Morgan.

00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:07.468
I found Morgan's website
and I sent him a message,

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.924
asking if any of his
Spanish-language novels

00:06:09.948 --> 00:06:11.938
had been translated into English.

00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:14.863
And he said that nothing
had been published,

00:06:14.887 --> 00:06:17.317
but he did have an unpublished translation

00:06:17.341 --> 00:06:19.325
of his novel "The Golden Horse."

00:06:19.887 --> 00:06:21.225
He emailed this to me,

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:24.383
allowing me to become
one of the first people ever

00:06:24.407 --> 00:06:26.251
to read that book in English.

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:29.579
Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith

00:06:29.603 --> 00:06:31.593
to share his work with me in this way.
