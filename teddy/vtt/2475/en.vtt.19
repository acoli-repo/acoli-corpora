00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.853
That can be an uncomfortable experience,

00:09:32.877 --> 00:09:34.649
particularly if you're reading a book

00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:38.097
from a culture that may have quite
different values to your own.

00:09:38.601 --> 00:09:40.750
But it can also be really enlightening.

00:09:41.402 --> 00:09:45.316
Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas
can help clarify your own thinking.

00:09:45.742 --> 00:09:47.909
And it can also show up blind spots

00:09:47.933 --> 00:09:50.575
in the way you might have
been looking at the world.

00:09:51.072 --> 00:09:53.954
When I looked back at much
of the English-language literature

00:09:53.978 --> 00:09:55.664
I'd grown up with, for example,

00:09:55.688 --> 00:09:58.725
I began to see how narrow a lot of it was,

00:09:58.749 --> 00:10:01.561
compared to the richness
that the world has to offer.
