00:07:57.525 --> 00:08:01.788
But, within a week of me putting
a call out on Twitter and Facebook

00:08:01.812 --> 00:08:03.766
for Portuguese speakers,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.361
I had more people than I could
involve in the project,

00:08:07.385 --> 00:08:11.743
including Margaret Jull Costa,
a leader in her field,

00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:17.068
who has translated the work
of Nobel Prize winner José Saramago.

00:08:18.443 --> 00:08:20.378
With my nine volunteers in place,

00:08:20.402 --> 00:08:22.990
I managed to find a book
by a São Toméan author

00:08:23.014 --> 00:08:25.524
that I could buy enough copies of online.

00:08:25.548 --> 00:08:26.702
Here's one of them.

00:08:27.268 --> 00:08:30.832
And I sent a copy out
to each of my volunteers.
