From Sweden to Palau,

00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:37.792
writers and translators
sent me self-published books

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:39.546
and unpublished manuscripts of books

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.450
that hadn't been picked
up by Anglophone publishers

00:06:42.474 --> 00:06:44.496
or that were no longer available,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.228
giving me privileged glimpses

about the Southern African king
Ngungunhane, who led the resistance

00:06:55.797 --> 00:06:58.459
against the Portuguese
in the 19th century;

00:06:59.113 --> 00:07:01.884
and about marriage rituals
in a remote village
