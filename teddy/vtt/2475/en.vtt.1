00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:30.974
were by British or North American authors,

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.534
and there was almost
nothing in translation.

00:00:34.327 --> 00:00:38.177
Discovering this massive,
cultural blind spot in my reading

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:40.002
came as quite a shock.

00:00:40.026 --> 00:00:43.519
And when I thought about it,
it seemed like a real shame.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.915
I knew there had to be lots
of amazing stories out there

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:50.316
by writers working in languages
other than English.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.642
And it seemed really sad to think
that my reading habits meant

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.023
I would probably never encounter them.

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:59.301
So, I decided to prescribe myself

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.943
an intensive course of global reading.
