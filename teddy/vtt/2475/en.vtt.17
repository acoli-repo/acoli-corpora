And I sent a copy out
to each of my volunteers.

00:08:30.856 --> 00:08:34.030
They all took on a couple
of short stories from this collection,

00:08:34.054 --> 00:08:37.681
stuck to their word, sent
their translations back to me,

00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:41.494
and within six weeks,
I had the entire book to read.

00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:46.884
In that case, as I found so often
during my year of reading the world,

00:08:46.908 --> 00:08:50.993

about my limitations

00:08:51.017 --> 00:08:53.158
had become a big opportunity.

00:08:53.935 --> 00:08:56.122
When it came to São Tomé and Príncipe,

00:08:56.146 --> 00:08:59.492
it was a chance not only
to learn something new

00:08:59.516 --> 00:09:02.191
and discover a new collection of stories,
