00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:31.989
I couldn't tell you how to source
a story from Swaziland.

00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:34.648
I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia.

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.718
There was no hiding it --

00:03:36.742 --> 00:03:40.065
I was a clueless literary xenophobe.

00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:42.995
So how on earth was I
going to read the world?

00:03:43.777 --> 00:03:45.634
I was going to have to ask for help.

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:49.157
So in October 2011, I registered my blog,

00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:50.952
ayearofreadingtheworld.com,

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:53.461
and I posted a short appeal online.

00:03:53.863 --> 00:03:55.092
I explained who I was,

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:57.124
how narrow my reading had been,

00:03:57.148 --> 00:03:59.005
and I asked anyone who cared to

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:01.594
to leave a message suggesting
what I might read
