00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.163
with strong publishing networks

00:02:31.187 --> 00:02:35.354
and lots of industry professionals
primed to go out and sell those titles

00:02:35.378 --> 00:02:37.338
to English-language publishers.

00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:42.283
So, for example, although well over 100
books are translated from French

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:44.210
and published in the UK each year,

00:02:44.234 --> 00:02:48.647
most of them will come from countries
like France or Switzerland.

00:02:49.107 --> 00:02:51.845
French-speaking Africa, on the other hand,

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.511
will rarely ever get a look-in.

00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:57.607
The upshot is that there are
actually quite a lot of nations

00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:01.262
that may have little or even no
commercially available literature
