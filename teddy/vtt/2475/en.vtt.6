that may have little or even no
commercially available literature

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:02.439
in English.

00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:06.140
Their books remain invisible to readers

00:03:06.164 --> 00:03:09.002
of the world's most published language.

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:11.820
But when it came to reading the world,

00:03:11.844 --> 00:03:13.614
the biggest challenge of all for me

00:03:13.638 --> 00:03:16.772
was that fact that I didn't
know where to start.

00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.559
Having spent my life reading
almost exclusively British

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:22.232
and North American books,

00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:25.845
I had no idea how to go about
sourcing and finding stories

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.580
and choosing them from much
of the rest of the world.

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:31.989
I couldn't tell you how to source
a story from Swaziland.
