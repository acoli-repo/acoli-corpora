I then had to face up to the fact
that I might even not be able

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.947
to get books in English
from every country.

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:08.291
Only around 4.5 percent
of the literary works published

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.966
each year in the UK are translations,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.616
and the figures are similar for much
of the English-speaking world.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.593
Although, the proportion
of translated books published

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:20.409
in many other countries is a lot higher.

00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:24.409
4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with,

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:26.268
but what that figure doesn't tell you

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:28.965
is that many of those books
will come from countries

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.163
with strong publishing networks
