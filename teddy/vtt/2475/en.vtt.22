00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:03.995
It's the story of the power
books have to connect us

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:08.764
across political, geographical,
cultural, social, religious divides.

00:11:09.422 --> 00:11:13.564
It's the tale of the potential
human beings have to work together.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.662
And, it's testament

00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:20.309
to the extraordinary times we live
in, where, thanks to the Internet,

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:22.250
it's easier than ever before

00:11:22.274 --> 00:11:26.703
for a stranger to share a story,
a worldview, a book

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:30.520
with someone she may never meet,
on the other side of the planet.
