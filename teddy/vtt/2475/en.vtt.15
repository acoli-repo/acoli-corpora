00:07:29.598 --> 00:07:33.432
when I tried to get hold of a book
from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking

00:07:33.456 --> 00:07:36.723
African island nation
of São Tomé and Príncipe.

00:07:37.364 --> 00:07:41.013
Now, having spent several months
trying everything I could think of to find

00:07:41.037 --> 00:07:44.376
a book that had been translated
into English from the nation,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.642
it seemed as though
the only option left to me

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:49.873
was to see if I could get something
translated for me from scratch.

00:07:50.404 --> 00:07:51.905
Now, I was really dubious

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:54.325
whether anyone was going
to want to help with this,

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.848
and give up their time
for something like that.

00:07:57.525 --> 00:08:01.788
But, within a week of me putting
a call out on Twitter and Facebook
