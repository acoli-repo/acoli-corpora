WEBVTT

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.943
an intensive course of global reading.

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:06.340
2012 was set to be a very
international year for the UK;

00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:08.436
it was the year of the London Olympics.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.982
And so I decided to use it
as my time frame

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.213
to try to read a novel,
short story collection

00:01:15.237 --> 00:01:19.554
or memoir from every country in the world.

00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:22.104
And so I did.

00:01:22.128 --> 00:01:23.755
And it was very exciting

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:25.675
and I learned some remarkable things

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:27.814
and made some wonderful connections

00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:29.707
that I want to share with you today.
