to leave a message suggesting
what I might read

00:04:01.618 --> 00:04:03.302
from other parts of the planet.

00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:07.986
Now, I had no idea whether
anyone would be interested,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.124
but within a few hours
of me posting that appeal online,

00:04:11.148 --> 00:04:13.584
people started to get in touch.

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:16.106
At first, it was friends and colleagues.

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:18.017
Then it was friends of friends.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.660
And pretty soon, it was strangers.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.201
Four days after I put that appeal online,

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:27.956
I got a message from a woman
called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur.

00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:30.967
She said she loved
the sound of my project,
