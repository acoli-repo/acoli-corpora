00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.258
‘Cause I’m “articulate”

00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:34.815
So when my father asks, “Wha’ kinda ting is dis?”

00:00:34.815 --> 00:00:37.953
My “articulate” answer never goes amiss

00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:41.469
I say “father, this is the impending problem at hand”

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:42.796
And when I’m on the block

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:44.491
I switch it up just because I can

00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:47.129
So when my boy says, “What’s good with you son?”

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.539
I just say, “I jus’ fall out wit dem people but I done!”

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.131
And sometimes in class

00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:57.060
I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.725
“Yo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples”
