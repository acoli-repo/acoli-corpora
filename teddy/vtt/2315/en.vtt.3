00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:31.000
I stop him and say “Noooo …

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.144
You’re being inarticulate …

00:01:33.144 --> 00:01:35.307
the proper way is to say ‘what’s good’”

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:38.922
Now you may think that’s too hood, that’s not cool

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:41.900
But I’m here to tell you that
even our language has rules


00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.512
So when Mommy mocks me and says

00:01:44.512 --> 00:01:46.770

I say “Mommy, no, that sentence is not following the law

00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:55.447
Never does the word "madd" go 
before a present participle

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:57.950
That’s simply the principle of this English”

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.620
If I had the vocal capacity I would

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.674
sing this from every mountaintop,
