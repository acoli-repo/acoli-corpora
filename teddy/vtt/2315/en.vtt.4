00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.674
sing this from every mountaintop,

00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:03.950
From every suburbia, and every hood

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.503
‘Cause the only God of language is
the one recorded in the Genesis

00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:09.220
Of this world saying “it is good"

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.791
So I may not always come before you

00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:13.185
with excellency of speech

00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:15.716
But do not judge me by my language and assume

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:17.235
That I’m too ignorant to teach

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:18.785
‘Cause I speak three tongues

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:19.933
One for each:

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:21.678
Home, school and friends

00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:23.882
I’m a tri-lingual orator

00:02:23.882 --> 00:02:25.851
Sometimes I’m consistent with my language now

00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:27.810
Then switch it up so I don’t bore later

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.687
Sometimes I fight back two tongues

00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:31.622
While I use the other one in the classroom
