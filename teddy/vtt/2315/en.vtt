00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:02.684
Today,

00:00:02.684 --> 00:00:04.324
a baffled lady observed

00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:06.316
the shell where my soul dwells

00:00:06.316 --> 00:00:09.457
And announced that I'm

00:00:09.457 --> 00:00:11.364
"articulate"

00:00:11.364 --> 00:00:13.702
Which means that when it comes

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:15.697
to enunciation and diction

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:16.703
I don't even think of it

00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:19.390
‘Cause I’m "articulate"

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.970
So when my professor asks a question

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.129
And my answer is tainted with a connotation

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:25.477
of urbanized suggestion

00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:27.943
There’s no misdirected intention

00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:28.920
Pay attention

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.258
‘Cause I’m “articulate”
