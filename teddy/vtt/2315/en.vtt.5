00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:31.622
While I use the other one in the classroom

00:02:31.622 --> 00:02:33.547
And when I mistakenly mix them up

00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:37.040
I feel crazy like … I’m cooking in the bathroom

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.632
I know that I had to borrow your language

00:02:41.632 --> 00:02:44.477
because mines was stolen

00:02:44.477 --> 00:02:48.377
But you can’t expect me to speak your history wholly

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:49.879
while mines is broken

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.398
These words are spoken

00:02:51.398 --> 00:02:53.705
By someone who is simply fed up with

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:56.325
the Eurocentric ideals of this season

00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:59.808
And the reason I speak a composite
version of your language

00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:03.560
Is because mines was raped
away along with my history
