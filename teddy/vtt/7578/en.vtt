00:00:01.247 --> 00:00:03.833
So I come from Bosnia.

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:05.334
I mean, I live in Sweden now,

00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:07.962
but you don't need to know
my whole life story.

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:12.175
But the story that I do want to share
is from my home country.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:15.678
So close to 50 percent
of the land in Bosnia

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.431

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:22.310

00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:23.644
to set up a budget,

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:26.647
to set up the requirements
for the people to receive the budget,

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.775
and then to disburse the funds.

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:31.360
So they do that, and towards
the end of the process,
