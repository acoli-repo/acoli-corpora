00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.332
About two years ago,
I answered my doorbell

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:07.420
to find a postal worker
holding a large, heavy box.

00:00:07.462 --> 00:00:10.089
It was a package
from my client, Chris Young.

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:14.761
Chris was being transferred
from a federal prison in Kentucky

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:17.638
to one hundreds of miles away in Texas.

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:22.685
When I slid open the box,
the handwritten note from Chris fell out.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:25.438
"Please take care of these
for me, Brittany.

00:00:25.438 --> 00:00:27.732
I don't want them messed up in the move.

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:29.025
They're all I've got."
