00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:30.286
but by the time they lost the news cycle,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.747
that's when the needs came in,

00:07:31.771 --> 00:07:34.941
yet they had this massive resource
of what people were able to give

00:07:34.965 --> 00:07:37.729
and they've been able to meet
the needs of their residents.

00:07:37.753 --> 00:07:39.809
CO: So it's working,
but it could be better.

00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:42.511
Emergency preparedness is a big deal
in disaster recovery

00:07:42.535 --> 00:07:44.784
because it makes towns safer
and more resilient.

00:07:44.808 --> 00:07:47.699
Imagine if we could have
these systems ready to go in a place

00:07:47.723 --> 00:07:49.496
before a disaster.

00:07:49.972 --> 00:07:51.780
So that's what we're working on.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:55.013
We're working on getting the software
to places so people expect it,

00:07:55.037 --> 00:07:56.378
so people know how to use it

00:07:56.402 --> 00:07:58.184
and so it can be filled ahead of time

00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:00.590
with that micro-information
that drives recovery.
