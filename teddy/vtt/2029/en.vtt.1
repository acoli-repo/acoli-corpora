Morgan O'Neill: So, on June 1,
we weren't disaster experts,

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.835
but on June 3, we started faking it.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.865
This experience changed our lives,

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:39.326
and now we're trying
to change the experience.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.795
CO: So, tornadoes
don't happen in Massachusetts,

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:45.320
and I was cleverly standing in the front
yard when one came over the hill.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:48.644
After a lamppost flew by, my family
and I sprinted into the basement.

00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:51.564
Trees were thrown against the house,
the windows exploded.

00:00:51.588 --> 00:00:53.457
When we finally got out the back door,

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:55.458
transformers were burning in the street.

00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:57.212
MO: I was here in Boston.

00:00:57.236 --> 00:00:58.953
I'm a PhD student at MIT,

00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:01.270
and I happen to study atmospheric science.
