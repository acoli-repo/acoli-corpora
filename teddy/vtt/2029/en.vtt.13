00:06:28.782 --> 00:06:31.004
Now try to imagine
the sinking feeling you get

00:06:31.028 --> 00:06:34.876
when you've just sent out 2,000 volunteers
and you can't prove it.

00:06:35.622 --> 00:06:38.059
CO: These are three problems
with a common solution.

00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:41.112
If we can get the right tools
at the right time

00:06:41.136 --> 00:06:43.102
to the people who will inevitably step up

00:06:43.126 --> 00:06:45.481
and start putting
their communities back together,

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:48.207
we can create new standards
in disaster recovery.

00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:51.165
MO: We needed canvasing tools,
donations databasing,

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:54.179
needs reporting, remote volunteer access,

00:06:54.203 --> 00:06:56.050
all in an easy-to-use website.

00:06:56.074 --> 00:06:57.511
CO: And we needed help.

00:06:57.535 --> 00:07:00.699
Alvin, our software engineer
and co-founder, has built these tools.
