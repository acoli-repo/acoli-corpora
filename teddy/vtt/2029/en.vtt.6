00:02:58.557 --> 00:03:01.620
MO: My church group of 50
would like housing and meals for a week

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:02.974
while we repair properties.

00:03:02.998 --> 00:03:05.911
CO: You sent me to that place
on Washington Street yesterday,

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.589
and now I'm covered in poison ivy.

00:03:07.613 --> 00:03:08.712
(Laughter)

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:10.502
So this is what filled our days.

00:03:10.526 --> 00:03:12.740
We had to learn
how to answer questions quickly

00:03:12.764 --> 00:03:15.014
and to solve problems in a minute or less;

00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:17.238
otherwise, something
more urgent would come up,

00:03:17.262 --> 00:03:18.596
and it wouldn't get done.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.427
MO: We didn't get our authority
from the board of selectmen

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:24.307
or the emergency management
director or the United Way.

00:03:24.331 --> 00:03:26.957
We just started answering questions
and making decisions

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:29.616
because someone -- anyone -- had to.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.995
And why not me? I'm a campaign organizer.
