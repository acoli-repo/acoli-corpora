00:05:59.688 --> 00:06:02.670
And you've only got about four days
of interest in Dallas.

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:05.160
MO: Data.

00:06:05.184 --> 00:06:07.018
Data is inherently unsexy,

00:06:07.042 --> 00:06:09.264
but it can jump-start an area's recovery.

00:06:09.288 --> 00:06:12.305
FEMA and the state will pay
85 percent of the cost

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:13.924
of a federally-declared disaster,

00:06:13.948 --> 00:06:16.589
leaving the town to pay
the last 15 percent of the bill.

00:06:16.613 --> 00:06:18.222
Now that expense can be huge,

00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:22.200
but if the town can mobilize X amount
of volunteers for Y hours,

00:06:22.224 --> 00:06:27.065
the dollar value of that labor used
goes toward the town's contribution.

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:28.417
But who knows that?

00:06:28.782 --> 00:06:31.004
Now try to imagine
the sinking feeling you get
