CO: I decided to stay in the country,
give up the master's in Moscow

00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:33.908
and to work full-time to make this happen.

00:04:33.932 --> 00:04:35.425
In the course of the past year,

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.909
we've become experts in the field
of community-powered disaster recovery.

00:04:38.933 --> 00:04:41.417
And there are three main problems
that we've observed

00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:43.131
with the way things work currently.

00:04:43.496 --> 00:04:44.647
MO: The tools.

00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:48.606
Large aid organizations are exceptional
at bringing massive resources to bear

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.793
after a disaster,

00:04:49.817 --> 00:04:53.232
but they often fulfill very specific
missions, and then they leave.

00:04:53.256 --> 00:04:57.474
This leaves local residents to deal with
the thousands of spontaneous volunteers,

00:04:57.498 --> 00:04:58.657
thousands of donations,

00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:00.688
and all with no training and no tools.
