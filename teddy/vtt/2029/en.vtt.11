WEBVTT

00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:33.117
to capture 50 percent of all
of the Web searches that will ever be made

00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:34.556
to help your area.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.167
Then some sporting event happens,

00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:39.207
and you've got only the resources
that you've collected thus far

00:05:39.231 --> 00:05:41.584
to meet the next five years
of recovery needs.

00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:44.610
This is the slide for Katrina.

00:05:45.047 --> 00:05:47.145
This is the curve for Joplin.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.293
And this is the curve
for the Dallas tornadoes in April,

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:51.667
where we deployed software.

00:05:51.995 --> 00:05:53.153
There's a gap here.

00:05:53.693 --> 00:05:56.902
Affected households have to wait
for the insurance adjuster to visit

00:05:56.926 --> 00:05:59.664
before they can start accepting help
on their properties.

00:05:59.688 --> 00:06:02.670
And you've only got about four days
of interest in Dallas.
