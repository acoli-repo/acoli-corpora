00:04:00.015 --> 00:04:02.188
we realized it shouldn't be this hard.

00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:05.057
CO: In a country like ours
where we breathe Wi-Fi,

00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:08.612
leveraging technology for a faster
recovery should be a no-brainer.

00:04:08.636 --> 00:04:11.180
Systems like the ones
that we were creating on the fly

00:04:11.204 --> 00:04:12.497
could exist ahead of time.

00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:16.050
And if some community member
is in this organizing position

00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:18.620
in every area after every disaster,

00:04:18.644 --> 00:04:20.446
these tools should exist.

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.956
MO: So, we decided to build them:

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.490
a recovery in a box, something that
could be deployed after every disaster

00:04:26.514 --> 00:04:28.010
by any local organizer.

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:31.820
CO: I decided to stay in the country,
give up the master's in Moscow
