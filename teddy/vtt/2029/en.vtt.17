June 1 this year marked the one-year
anniversary of the Monson tornado,

00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:34.374
and our community's never been
more connected or more empowered.

00:08:34.398 --> 00:08:38.630
We've been able to see the same
transformation in Texas and in Alabama.

00:08:38.654 --> 00:08:40.477
Because it doesn't take Harvard or MIT

00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:42.566
to fly in and fix problems
after a disaster;

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.914
it takes a local.

00:08:43.938 --> 00:08:46.793
No matter how good an aid organization
is at what they do,

00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:48.492
they eventually have to go home.

00:08:48.516 --> 00:08:50.730
But if you give locals the tools,

00:08:50.754 --> 00:08:53.559
if you show them
what they can do to recover,

00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:55.138
they become experts.

00:08:57.007 --> 00:08:58.031
(Applause)

00:08:58.055 --> 00:08:59.207
MO: All right. Let's go.

00:08:59.231 --> 00:09:02.460
(Applause)
