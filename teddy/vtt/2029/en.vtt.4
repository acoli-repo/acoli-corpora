00:01:58.274 --> 00:02:01.446
And then, armed with just
two laptops and one air card,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.560
we built a recovery machine.

00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:08.082
(Applause)

00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:11.114
CO: That was a tornado, and everyone's
heading to the church

00:02:11.138 --> 00:02:12.804
to drop things off and volunteer.

00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:14.408
MO: Everyone's donating clothing.

00:02:14.432 --> 00:02:16.826
We should inventory
the donations piling up here.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.787
CO: And we need a hotline.
Can you make a Google Voice number?

00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:22.393
MO: Sure. And we need to tell people
what not to bring.

00:02:22.417 --> 00:02:24.830
I'll make a Facebook account.
Can you print flyers?

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:27.910
CO: Yeah, but we don't even know
what houses are accepting help.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:29.939
We need to canvas and send out volunteers.

00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:32.076
MO: We need to tell people
what not to bring.
