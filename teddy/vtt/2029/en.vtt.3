The town hall and the police department
had also suffered direct hits,

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:34.765
and so people wanting to help
or needing information went to the church.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.824
CO: We walked to the church because
we heard they had hot meals,

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:39.720
but when we arrived, we found problems.

00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:42.189
There were a couple large,
sweaty men with chainsaws

00:01:42.213 --> 00:01:45.623

of the damage yet.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.121
As we watched, they became
frustrated and left

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:52.100
to go find somebody to help on their own.

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:54.783
MO: So we started organizing.
Why? It had to be done.

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:58.250
We found Pastor Bob and offered to give
the response some infrastructure.

00:01:58.274 --> 00:02:01.446
And then, armed with just
two laptops and one air card,
