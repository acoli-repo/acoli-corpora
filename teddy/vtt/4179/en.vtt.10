00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.600
Even if you are a stranger, 
we have a right to trust you,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.640
just like you have the same right.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.640
To walk under
a starlit night is our right.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.160
We have the right to smell 
the night-blooming jasmine.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.000
The right to bury
the Museum of Street Weapons of Defense.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.720
The right to live alone,
unapologetic and free.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.840
The right to give myself permission.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:33.860
