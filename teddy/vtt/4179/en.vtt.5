Ten years ago, I asked women 
on the streets of Bangalore

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.040
what is the one thing 
they did not leave their house without.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.800
Cockroach spray, hairpin, safety pin, 


00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.620
nail filer, red chili powder … 
the list is in front of you.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.030
This just proved women have a relationship

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.440
of fear with their own public space.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.870
With these objects,
we started an online project,

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.800
"Museum of Street Weapons of Defence."

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.800
Through this, Action Heroes
recognize and examine hidden fears.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.030
What were you wearing 
when you were sexually assaulted?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.390
Whenever I ask this question, 
women remember those clothes.
