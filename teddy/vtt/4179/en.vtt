Shah Rukh Khan: If something
or some place around you scares you,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.660

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.950

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.500

Take two steps towards the place 
where your dread lives.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.670
This fearless point of view
is that of Kolkata-born artist,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.450
