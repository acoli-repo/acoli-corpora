00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.190
have blamed women 
for the violence they are facing.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.100
"Either she was wearing revealing clothes;
or she was of questionable character."

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.120
First the society imprisons us in fear.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.490
And when after an incident, 
we gather the courage to ask for justice,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.480
we are blamed and told to shut up.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.140
As long as a woman’s way of behaving, 
thinking and identity is controlled,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.350
sexual violence will never end.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.240
This can only end when the person causing
violence takes responsibility for it,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.390
and when we ask ourselves 
what kind of masculinity and violence

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.280
are we perpetuating 
through this blame game.
