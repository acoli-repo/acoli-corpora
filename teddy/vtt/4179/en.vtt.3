00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.830
on the road, a man suddenly touched me.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.960
I was shocked.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.810
By the time I realized it was wrong, 
the man had run away.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.660
I didn’t tell anyone about the incident.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.190
Maybe there were no words 
to understand this;

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.790
just a sense of violation, 
which is there even today.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.320
I changed the way I walked.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.960
Elbows out, school bag in front,
fists clenched, angry eyes,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.500
which said: beware, don't come close
or I will fight back.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.080
Living with this fear became a habit.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.280
And yet a desire to understand 
this fear also came alive.
