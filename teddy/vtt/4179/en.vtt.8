00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.280
are we perpetuating 
through this blame game.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.530
Action Heroes understand 
the deep relationship

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.410
between fear, abuse and blame.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.560
Based on that they are creating 
the "I Never Ask For It" project.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.070
In this project, they are
bringing out the clothes,

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.080
which they were wearing 
when they were sexually abused.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.589
These clothes are the voice 
and witness of abuse.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.880
In five years, these clothes 
will be seen at public places.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.080
Together and strong.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.320
“I am not alone.”

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.100
“We are not responsible 
for this violence.”
