In West Africa, where I live,

00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:05.668
there are 60 million smallholder farmers.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.670
Smallholder farmers are the largest group

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:10.006
of people living
on less than two dollars a day.

00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:13.676
Many go hungry each year
because they don't grow enough to eat.

00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:15.887
Government subsidies,

00:00:15.887 --> 00:00:19.724

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:24.896

to large farms and male farmers,

00:00:24.937 --> 00:00:27.815
even though women
are the backbone of farming in Africa.

00:00:28.858 --> 00:00:30.401
Despite these investments,
