00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let me introduce to you Rezero.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This little fellow was developed

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
by a group of 10 undergraduate students

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
at ETH-Zurich.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Our robot belongs to a family of robots

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
called Ballbots.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Instead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and moving on one single ball.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The main characteristics of such a system is

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that there's one sole contact point to the ground.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This means that the robot

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is inherently unstable.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's like when I am trying to stand
