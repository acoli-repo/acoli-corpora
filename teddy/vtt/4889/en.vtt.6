00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.210
by density and the flames 
have a totally different shape.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.520
We can see all of this because combustion

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.340
also generates light.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.180
Molecules emit light when heated,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.950
and the color of the light depends

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.860
on the temperature of the molecules.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.230
The hottest flames are white or blue.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.340
The type of molecules in a fire can

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.470
also influence flame color.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.470
For instance, any unreacted 
carbon atoms from the logs

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.360
form little clumps of soot that rise

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.090
into the flames and emit the yellow-orange
