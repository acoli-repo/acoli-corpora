00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:03.418
plasmas don’t exist in a stable
state on earth.

00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:08.558
They only form when gas is exposed
to an electric field or superheated

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:13.378
to temperatures of thousands 
or tens of thousands of degrees.

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:16.588
By contrast, fuels like wood 
and paper burn

00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:19.228
at a few hundred degrees —far below the

00:01:19.228 --> 00:01:24.218
threshold of what's usually
considered a plasma.

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:27.358
So if fire isn’t a solid, liquid, gas,

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:30.068
or a plasma, what does that leave?
