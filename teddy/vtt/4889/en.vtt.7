00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.090
into the flames and emit the yellow-orange

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.150
light we associate with a campfire.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.230
Substances like copper, calcium chloride,

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.230
and potassium chloride can add their

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.610
own characteristic hues to the mix.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.610
Besides colorful flames,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.350
fire also continues to generate heat
as it burns.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.020
This heat sustains the flames by keeping

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.960
the fuel at or above ignition temperature.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.600
Eventually, though, even the hottest fires

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.040
run out of fuel or oxygen.
