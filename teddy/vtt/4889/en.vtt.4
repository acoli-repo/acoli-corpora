00:01:57.426 --> 00:02:00.896
our senses at the same time, 
creating the kind of vivid

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:05.516
experience we expect to come
from a physical thing.

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:08.226
Combustion creates that sensory experience

00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:11.846
using fuel, heat, and oxygen.

00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:15.699
In a campfire, when the logs are 
heated to their ignition temperature,

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.069
the walls of their cells decompose,

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.239
releasing sugars and other 
molecules into the air.

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.019
These molecules then react 
with airborne oxygen

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.789
to create carbon dioxide and water.

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.540
At the same time, any trapped
water in the logs
