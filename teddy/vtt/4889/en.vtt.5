00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.540
At the same time, any trapped
water in the logs

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.600
vaporizes, expands, ruptures 
the wood around it,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.110
and escapes with a satisfying crackle.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.110
As the fire heats up, the carbon 
dioxide and water vapor

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.850
created by combustion expand.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.590
Now that they’re less dense,
they rise in a thinning column.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.850
Gravity causes this expansion and rising, 
which gives

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.440
flames their characteristic taper.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.720
Without gravity, molecules don’t separate

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.210
by density and the flames 
have a totally different shape.
