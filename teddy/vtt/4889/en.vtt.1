00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:33.068
Mingling with the air, they’re 
more like a gas,

00:00:33.068 --> 00:00:35.418
but more visible--and more fleeting.

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:39.418
And on a scientific level, 
fire differs from gas

00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:43.418
because gases can exist in 
the same state indefinitely

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:47.368
while fires always burn out eventually.

00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:50.638
One misconception is that
fire is a plasma,

00:00:50.638 --> 00:00:53.438
the fourth state of matter in which atoms

00:00:53.438 --> 00:00:55.988
are stripped of their electrons.

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:58.998
Like fire and unlike the
other kinds of matter,

00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:03.418
plasmas don’t exist in a stable
state on earth.
