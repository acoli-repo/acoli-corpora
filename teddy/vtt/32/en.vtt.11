00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.880
and they are receiving
100,000 takedown requests every hour.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.656
Of course, they can't process
this amount of data by hand,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.336
so they are using machine learning

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.920
to decide if it's really
a copyright violation or not.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.040
But these filters do make mistakes.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.816
They're removing everything
from documentation of human rights abuses,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.736
lectures about copyrights

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.976
and search results

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.040
that point to criticism
of this new Article 13.
