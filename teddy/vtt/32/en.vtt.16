Why would anyone spend thousands of hours
on something anyone can freely copy,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.400
rename, or even sell?

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.336
Well, in my case,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.800
one of the reasons was
to do something meaningful.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.256
During my daily regular job
as a web developer,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.496
I didn't have the feeling
that I'm working on something

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.160
that had a chance to be a bigger than me.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.816
Simply, I just wanted to make
my short presence in this world

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.400
to be meaningful.
