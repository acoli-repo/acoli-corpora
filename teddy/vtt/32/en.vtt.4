"No one should have this power."

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.616
As a response, one of
the employees asked him,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.280
"Is this the day the Internet dies?"

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.216
I don't think we are actually
killing the internet,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.176
but I do think that we are in the middle

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.976
of a kind of irresponsible
centralization process

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.640
that makes our internet more fragile.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.456
The decentralized, people-to-people web

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.536
solves this problem
by removing the central points,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.160
the web-hosting services.
