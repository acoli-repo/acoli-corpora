00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.320
They don't have to worry
about maintaining the physical servers.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.936
I can't blame them, but I found
this trend to be very dangerous,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.216
because this way, these giant corporations

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.080
have unlimited control
over the hosting services.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
And it's very easy to abuse this power.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.216
For example, last year, a CEO of a company

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.856
that acts as a gatekeeper
for nine million websites
