00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.176
including the original founders
of the internet and the World Wide Web,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.080
Vint Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.016
But despite this strong opposition,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.416
on the last European Parliament vote,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.320
two thirds of the representatives
supported this law.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.800
The final vote will be early 2019.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.896
The result is important,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.616
but whatever happens,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.936
I'm pretty sure it will be followed
by many other similar proposals
