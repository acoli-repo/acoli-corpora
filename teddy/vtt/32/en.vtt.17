Last year, the Great Firewall of China
started blocking this network I created.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.655
This move officially made me the enemy

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.120
of the government-supported
internet censorship.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.696
Since then, it's been really
a game of cat and mouse.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.456
They make new rules in the firewall

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.496
and I try to react to it as fast as I can

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.616
so the users can keep hosting content
and create websites

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.000
that otherwise would be censored
by the centralized Chinese internet.
