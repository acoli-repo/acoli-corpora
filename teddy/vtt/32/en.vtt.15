00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.936
I'm pretty sure it will be followed
by many other similar proposals

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.160
around the world.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.456
These kinds of regulations
would be very hard to enforce

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.936
through a decentralized web,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.240
as there is no hosting companies.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.280
The websites are served
by the visitors themselves.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.920
I started to build
this network three years ago.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.376
Since then, I've spent thousands,
tens of thousands of hours

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.600
on the development.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.376
Why?

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.176
Why would anyone spend thousands of hours
on something anyone can freely copy,
