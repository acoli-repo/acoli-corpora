00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.600
And this happens every time
you want to reach a website on the web.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.896
But these gatekeepers are
vulnerable to internet attacks

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.720
and also makes the censorship
and the surveillance easier.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.760
And the situation is getting worse.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.536
Everything is moving to the cloud,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.640
where the data is hosted
by giant corporations.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.680
This move creates much,
much more powerful middlemen.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.856
Now, move to the cloud makes sense

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.936
because this way it's easier and cheaper
