Another increasing threat

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.440
to internet freedom

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.840
is overregulation.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.256
I have the impression

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.976
that our delegates

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.856
who vote on the internet regulation laws

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.080
are not fully aware of their decisions.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.416
For example, the European Parliament
has a new law on the table,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.416
a new copyright protection law,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.080
that has a part called Article 13.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.016
If it passes, it would require
every big website
