00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.440
Three years ago,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.496
I started building a decentralized web

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.800
because I was worried
about the future of our internet.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.296
The current internet we are using
is about gatekeepers.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.696
If you want to reach something on the web,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.096
then you need to go
through multiple middlemen.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.576
First, a domain name server,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.136
then a server hosting company,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.896
which usually points you to a third party,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.880
to a web hosting service.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.600
And this happens every time
you want to reach a website on the web.
