The security of the network
is provided by public-key cryptography.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.256
This makes sure that no one
can modify the sites

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.960
but only the real owner.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.816
Think of it like instead of getting
electricity from big power plants,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.896
you put solar panels on top of your house,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.816
and if your neighbor down the street
needs some extra energy,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.520
then they can just download
some from your house.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.576
So by using the decentralized web,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.920
we can help to keep content
accessible for other visitors.
