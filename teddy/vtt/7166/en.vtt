[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]

00:00:05.163 --> 00:00:08.121
Iâ€™m going to start by telling you
a story about Danielle.

00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:11.621
When she was a senior in college,
Danielle's dad passed away,

00:00:11.663 --> 00:00:14.371
which left her mom
with no way to support herself.

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:16.913
So Danielle had to drop out of college

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:22.371
and pick up three jobs as a barista,
a bartender and a car washer.

00:00:22.413 --> 00:00:26.704
Altogether, the three jobs paid Danielle
23,000 dollars per year,

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:28.163
which wasn't a whole lot,

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:31.704
but it allowed her to feed her mom
and keep a roof over their head.
