00:01:57.594 --> 00:02:03.391
Clearly, current efforts to address
maternal mortality rates

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:08.240
and the racial and health
disparities in that area

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:10.512
remain woefully inadequate.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.357
Only when race stops being the precursor

00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:19.082
to how Black women are treated
or not treated in the health care system,

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:22.059
then outcomes will be
drastically different.

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:26.089
I want to be abundantly clear now.

00:02:27.532 --> 00:02:33.107
The medical community is failing
Black mothers in America.
