Well, improvements
in data accuracy are critical

00:09:04.749 --> 00:09:06.391
but not nearly enough.

00:09:06.944 --> 00:09:09.959
Algorithms, checklists, apps --

00:09:10.762 --> 00:09:12.453
they all play an important role,

00:09:12.477 --> 00:09:14.349
but they're no panacea either.

00:09:15.564 --> 00:09:19.202
And I really can't emphasize enough

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:24.229
that implicit bias training
without explicit,

00:09:24.253 --> 00:09:27.917
explicit measures of accountability

00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:30.313
will make absolutely no difference at all.
