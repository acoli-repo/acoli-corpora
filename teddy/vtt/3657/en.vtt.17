which result in Black women,
just like Shalon,

00:08:31.408 --> 00:08:36.426

than white women.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.986
It's been well documented,

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.139
year after year,

00:08:41.163 --> 00:08:43.514
decade after decade,

00:08:43.538 --> 00:08:46.412
generation after generation,

00:08:46.436 --> 00:08:50.444
and nothing effective
has been done to fix it.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.594

Is there a definitive answer
to eradicating disparities

00:08:58.242 --> 00:08:59.857
in maternal mortality?
