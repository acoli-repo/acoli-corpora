00:14:27.329 --> 00:14:30.690
Let us vow to be a part of the solution

00:14:30.714 --> 00:14:35.546
until Black women are no longer
marginalized and dying needlessly

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.396
in the health care system.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.013
And like my daughter,

00:14:40.037 --> 00:14:42.797
(Voice breaking)
Dr. Shalon MauRene Irving,

00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:46.571
let us each vow to create a better earth.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.301
Thank you.

00:14:48.325 --> 00:14:54.238
