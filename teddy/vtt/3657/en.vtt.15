Or perhaps we should say
that a relative handful of hospitals,

00:07:32.674 --> 00:07:36.585
which happen to be the ones
that are largely used by Black women

00:07:36.609 --> 00:07:38.220
and other minorities,

00:07:38.244 --> 00:07:41.879
are at the epicenter of maternal
mortality in America.

00:07:43.187 --> 00:07:47.908
But I would argue that focusing
on a handful of individuals

00:07:47.932 --> 00:07:50.437
or a handful of hospitals

00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:53.139
is defining the problem way too narrowly.

00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:57.484
The problem behavior
isn't about the actions

00:07:57.508 --> 00:08:00.262
of specific individuals or hospitals --
