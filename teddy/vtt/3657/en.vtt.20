00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.215
The next step requires
taking responsibility

00:10:01.239 --> 00:10:03.039
and owning that failure.

00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:05.716
But the most important step

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.677
is actively taking the necessary actions

00:10:09.701 --> 00:10:13.136
to right the wrongs
created by that failure.

00:10:15.743 --> 00:10:17.553
A wise woman once told me,

00:10:17.577 --> 00:10:19.581
"If you want something different,

00:10:19.605 --> 00:10:22.104
you have to do something different."

00:10:22.596 --> 00:10:26.188
My daughter was committed
to doing something different.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.868
Shalon was known
as a woman of great integrity

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:31.873
and high moral values.
