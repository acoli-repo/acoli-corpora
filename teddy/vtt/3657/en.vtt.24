00:11:58.483 --> 00:12:01.488
We're actively working
with the legislative office.

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:05.436
We're promoting accountability
measures and postpartum bills,

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.433
and we want them enshrined in the law.

00:12:09.226 --> 00:12:13.071
We're embarking upon
a community-based research project

00:12:13.095 --> 00:12:17.694
which will redefine quality
of medical care for Black women.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:24.050
Ultimately, we will tilt more power
into the hands of Black women.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.612
How are we going to do that?

00:12:26.636 --> 00:12:30.629
By empowering Black women
and their birthing partners
