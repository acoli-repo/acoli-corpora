Shalon went to her health care providers
again and again in distress.

00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:07.057
Obviously, with her education
and training,

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:12.315
she could and she did articulate
her concerns very clearly.

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:20.395
Yet her cries for help
were minimized and dismissed

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.608
by the covert bias
of her medical provider.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.726
That very bias,
fueled by structural racism,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.629
is the root cause
of disparities in health care.
