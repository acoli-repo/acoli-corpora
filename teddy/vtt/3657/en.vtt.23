00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:31.964
To get things started,

00:11:31.988 --> 00:11:35.917
I joined forces with several
of Shalon's friends

00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:37.773
and CDC colleagues.

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:39.580
We founded a nonprofit.

00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:44.785
We're working hard to eliminate
preventable deaths among Black mothers.

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:47.143
And here's how we're doing it:

00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:51.243
with action, action and more action.

00:11:52.315 --> 00:11:53.999
We're engaging stakeholders

00:11:54.023 --> 00:11:58.459
at every point of the public health
and health care spectrum.

00:11:58.483 --> 00:12:01.488
We're actively working
with the legislative office.
