It is the hippocampus, strongly associated
with emotion, that aids recollection

00:02:04.047 --> 00:02:08.673
by encoding important experiences
into long-term memories.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.394
The ability to distinguish this importance
makes elephant memory

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:16.828
a complex and adaptable faculty
beyond rote memorization.

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:19.949
It's what allows elephants who survived
a drought in their youth

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.790
to recognize its warning signs
in adulthood,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.029
which is why clans with older matriarchs
have higher survival rates.

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.672
Unfortunately, it's also what makes
elephants one of the few non-human animals
