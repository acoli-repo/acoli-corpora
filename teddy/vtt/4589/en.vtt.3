00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:31.316
Looking inside their heads,
we can see why.

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:34.770
The elephant boasts the largest brain
of any land mammal,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.826
as well as an impressive
encephalization quotient.

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:40.759
This is the size of the brain
relative to what we'd expect

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.252
for an animal's body size,

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:46.785
and the elephant's EQ is nearly as high
as a chimpanzee's.

00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:48.740
And despite the distant relation,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.105
convergent evolution has made it
remarkably similar to the human brain,

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:55.262
with as many neurons and synapses

00:01:55.262 --> 00:01:59.821
and a highly developed hippocampus
and cerebral cortex.

00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:04.047
It is the hippocampus, strongly associated
with emotion, that aids recollection
