Elephants remember
not only their herd companions

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:06.051
but other creatures who have made
a strong impression on them.

00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.250
In one case, two circus elephants
that had briefly performed together

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.866
rejoiced when crossing paths
23 years later.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:18.622
This recognition isn't limited to others
of their species.

00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:23.339
Elephants have also recognized humans
they've bonded with after decades apart.

00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:28.556
All of this shows that elephant memory
goes beyond responses to stimuli.

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:31.316
Looking inside their heads,
we can see why.
