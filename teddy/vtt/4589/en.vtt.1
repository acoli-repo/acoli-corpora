00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:30.498
Unlike many proverbs,
the one about elephant memory

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:32.567
is scientifically accurate.

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.091
Elephants know every member
in their herd,

00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:39.836
able to recognize as many as 30
companions by sight or smell.

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:41.689
This is a great help when migrating

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:45.318
or encountering
other potentially hostile elephants.

00:00:45.318 --> 00:00:49.688
They also remember and distinguish
particular cues that signal danger

00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:53.820
and can recall important locations long
after their last visit.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.402
But it's the memories unrelated
to survival that are the most fascinating.

00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:01.875
Elephants remember
not only their herd companions
