Unfortunately, it's also what makes
elephants one of the few non-human animals

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:34.863
to suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:38.437
The cerebral cortex, on the other hand,
enables problem solving,

00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:42.003
which elephants display
in many creative ways.

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:44.464
They also tackle problems cooperatively,

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:49.079
sometimes even outwitting the researchers
and manipulating their partners.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.086
And they've grasped basic arithmetic,
keeping track of the relative amounts

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:56.722
of fruit in two baskets
after multiple changes.

00:02:56.722 --> 00:02:59.625
The rare combination of memory
and problem solving

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:03.061
can explain some of elephants'
most clever behaviors,
