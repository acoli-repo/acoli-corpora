00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:03.061
can explain some of elephants'
most clever behaviors,

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:06.068
but it doesn't explain some of the things
we're just beginning to learn

00:03:06.068 --> 00:03:07.983
about their mental lives.

00:03:07.983 --> 00:03:12.078
Elephants communicate using everything
from body signals and vocalizations,

00:03:12.078 --> 00:03:15.809
to infrasound rumbles that can be heard
kilometers away.

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:21.348
And their understanding of syntax suggests that
they have their own language and grammar.

00:03:21.348 --> 00:03:25.982
This sense of language may even go beyond
simple communication.

00:03:25.982 --> 00:03:29.033
Elephants create art by carefully
choosing and combining

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:31.648
different colors and elements.
