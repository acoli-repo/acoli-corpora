00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:39.205
And yes, there is an elephant band.

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:42.103
But perhaps the most amazing thing
about elephants

00:03:42.103 --> 00:03:45.507
is a capacity even more important
than cleverness:

00:03:45.507 --> 00:03:50.582
their sense of empathy,
altruism, and justice.

00:03:50.582 --> 00:03:54.457
Elephants are the only non-human animals

They have shown concern
for other species, as well.
