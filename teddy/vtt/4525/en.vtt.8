00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:02.439
and how long they spend
inside of each of the stores.

00:04:02.463 --> 00:04:05.541
And if I was sitting down
at a coffee shop just people-watching,

00:04:05.565 --> 00:04:07.897
many wouldn't even notice
that I'm watching them.

00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:09.297
Now, what if all of a sudden

00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:11.441
I was shining the equivalent
of what is, say,

00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:16.690
the light or the sunlight from about five
or, say, 10 different suns?

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:19.027
Would they still behave
as they normally did?

00:04:20.277 --> 00:04:23.329
Would they still linger outside
for just as long?

00:04:23.353 --> 00:04:26.227
Can I really believe
that their behavior hasn't been altered

00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:29.500
as a consequence of being exposed
to this much sunlight?

00:04:29.524 --> 00:04:30.675
No.
