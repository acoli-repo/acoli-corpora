00:04:29.524 --> 00:04:30.675
No.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.906
Most microscopes these days,

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.529
and conventional microscopes,

00:04:34.553 --> 00:04:39.155
have been able to dump between
10 to 10,000 times the sunlight

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:42.420
that we're exposed to on this planet,
where life actually evolved.

00:04:43.431 --> 00:04:45.229
And because of this,

00:04:45.253 --> 00:04:47.921
well, turns out I'm part
of the cell paparazzi,

00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:50.958
so we need to be very careful
in terms of how much light

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:52.477
we actually put into the cell.

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:55.211
Otherwise, we might end up
with a deep-fried cell.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.950
And, turns out,

00:04:56.974 --> 00:05:01.296
there's really nothing natural
about trying to watch a damaged cell
