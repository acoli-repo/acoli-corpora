00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:00.259
with one clear goal.

00:02:00.283 --> 00:02:03.654
And the idea is to be able to advance
innovation and discovery

00:02:03.678 --> 00:02:07.141
by bringing together experts
from these different disciplines

00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:10.548
to be able to work together
and solve problems that each of us can't.

00:02:11.814 --> 00:02:15.020
Now, we're interested
in understanding the cell.

00:02:15.044 --> 00:02:16.233
The cell ... what is it?

00:02:16.257 --> 00:02:18.185
Well, it's the fundamental unit of life.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.554
Simply put, it's just a bag.

00:02:20.578 --> 00:02:23.617
It's a bag that has trillions
of inanimate molecules,

00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:26.562
whether it's proteins,
carbohydrates, lipids or fat.

00:02:26.586 --> 00:02:29.095
And it turns out,
over the past half a century,

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.930
molecular biologists and biochemists
have figured out ways
