00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.930
molecular biologists and biochemists
have figured out ways

00:02:31.954 --> 00:02:34.024
to make these proteins glow.

00:02:34.536 --> 00:02:36.565
They light up just like fireflies.

00:02:37.518 --> 00:02:39.849
Now, microscope developers
have been able to make

00:02:39.873 --> 00:02:41.297
better and better instruments

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:44.301
to be able to capture this light
emitted from these molecules,

00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:48.421
and computer scientists and mathematicians
have been able to understand

00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:51.467
the signals that are being recorded
from the cameras.

00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:53.610
And by bringing these tools together,

00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:57.870
we're actually being able to understand
the organization of these molecules

00:02:57.894 --> 00:02:59.330
inside of these cells,

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:02.184
understand how that changes over time,
