00:07:28.555 --> 00:07:30.470
but for them, the problem comes

00:07:30.494 --> 00:07:33.521
when they're trying to record
the light from distant stars

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:35.986
on telescopes that are ground-based.

00:07:36.597 --> 00:07:39.760
The problem is, when the light travels
thousands of light years

00:07:39.784 --> 00:07:42.519
and it hits our turbulent
atmosphere all of a sudden,

00:07:42.543 --> 00:07:44.072
the light gets scrambled.

00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:47.155
They've also, luckily, figured out
a solution to this

00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:49.127
for over half a century.

00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:51.624
What they do is they generate
an artificial star

00:07:51.648 --> 00:07:54.127
at about 90 kilometers
above the Earth's surface,

00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:55.714
and they use that light,

00:07:55.738 --> 00:07:59.811
which passes through the same turbulent
atmosphere as the distant star's light,

00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:02.993
and they're able to understand
how the light is getting scrambled,
