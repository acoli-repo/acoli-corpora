00:00:01.396 --> 00:00:04.929
Trying to understand life
without clearly watching it in action

00:00:04.953 --> 00:00:08.466
is like an alien species trying
to understand the rules of a football game

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.965
from just a few snapshots.

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.029
We can learn a lot from these images.

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:14.506
For example, there's players
on and off the field.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.743
There's a band.

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:19.789
There's even cheerleaders
having a great time watching the game.

00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:23.383
And of course, despite learning
all of this information

00:00:23.407 --> 00:00:25.540
from watching these pictures,

00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:28.089
we still cannot piece together
the rules of the game.

00:00:28.113 --> 00:00:29.895
In order to be able to do that,

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.057
we need to actually
watch the game in action.
