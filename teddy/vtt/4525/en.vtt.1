00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.057
we need to actually
watch the game in action.

00:00:33.013 --> 00:00:35.568
Much of what we know about how life works

00:00:35.592 --> 00:00:37.946
comes from watching these snapshots.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.460
Scientists have been able to figure out
a lot by looking at similar snapshots,

00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:45.522
but ultimately, for them
to understand how life works,

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:47.688
they need to actually watch it in action.

00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:50.702
And this is essentially
where life happens,

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:55.032
is trying to understand
how the fundamental unit of life works.

00:00:55.056 --> 00:00:57.019
And to be able to watch this,

00:00:57.043 --> 00:01:00.102
we need to be able
to understand how life is.
