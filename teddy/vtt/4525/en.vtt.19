This technology really enables us
to watch deeper and more clearly,

00:09:31.743 --> 00:09:34.884
almost as if we're watching
single cells on a piece of glass

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.914
where they've been held prisoner.

00:09:36.938 --> 00:09:39.675
And to demonstrate the promise
that this technology holds,

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:43.101
we've partnered with some of the best
scientists from around the world.

00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:45.820
And we've started to ask
a range of fundamental questions

00:09:45.844 --> 00:09:48.208
that we're starting to work on
right now together.

00:09:48.232 --> 00:09:51.114
For example, how does cancer
spread through the body?

00:09:51.138 --> 00:09:54.359
In this example, you're looking
at human breast cancer cells

00:09:54.383 --> 00:09:56.191
that are basically kind of migrating,

00:09:56.215 --> 00:09:59.292
where they're using the blood vessels
that are shown in magenta.

00:09:59.316 --> 00:10:01.914
They're basically using
these blood vessels as highways
