00:11:31.199 --> 00:11:32.629
We have a ton of data.

00:11:32.653 --> 00:11:35.205
We need to find new ways
to be able to visualize this.

00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:36.927
We need to be able to find new ways

00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:39.636
to be able to extract
biologically meaningful information

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.811
from these data sets.

00:11:40.835 --> 00:11:41.986
And more importantly,

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.003
we want to make sure that we can put
these advanced microscopes

00:11:45.027 --> 00:11:47.652
into the hands of scientists
from all around the world.

00:11:47.676 --> 00:11:51.930
And we're giving the designs
of these microscopes for free.

00:11:51.954 --> 00:11:53.498
But the key important part is,

00:11:53.522 --> 00:11:56.300
we need to collaborate even more
to make an impact.

00:11:56.324 --> 00:11:58.190
We're bringing together scientists

00:11:58.214 --> 00:12:01.213
who can develop new
biological and chemical tools.
