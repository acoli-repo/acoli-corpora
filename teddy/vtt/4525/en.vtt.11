00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:32.319
or not to put too much light
into the system.

00:05:32.343 --> 00:05:33.512
And when we do this,

00:05:33.536 --> 00:05:37.729
we're able to watch the dynamics
of that process for much longer

00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:39.983
without really stressing out these cells.

00:05:40.612 --> 00:05:43.302
We've used this microscopy
technique and tools

00:05:43.326 --> 00:05:45.870
to be able to understand
how viruses infect cells.

00:05:45.894 --> 00:05:49.011
In this example, we've exposed
the cell to rotavirus.

00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:53.944
It's an extremely contagious pathogen
that kills over 200,000 people every year.

00:05:53.968 --> 00:05:56.573
And by watching these molecules,
these virus particles,

00:05:56.597 --> 00:05:59.078
how they diffuse
on the surface of the cells,

00:05:59.102 --> 00:06:02.008
we can actually understand
the rules that they're playing by.
