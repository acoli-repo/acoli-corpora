These immune cells are basically
on patrol all the time.

00:10:32.809 --> 00:10:34.684
Basically, they don't get any time off.

00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:38.198
They're working constantly to understand
whether there's stranger danger,

00:10:38.222 --> 00:10:40.838
trying to understand
whether there's an infection.

00:10:40.862 --> 00:10:44.345
They're sensing the environment,
constantly moving around.

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:48.598
Now, we can watch these images
and these movies

00:10:48.622 --> 00:10:52.600
in greater detail than has ever
been possible before in our time

00:10:52.624 --> 00:10:54.078
up until now.

00:10:54.102 --> 00:10:56.821
Now, as with all new technologies,

00:10:56.845 --> 00:10:59.013
new capabilities come with new challenges,

00:10:59.037 --> 00:11:02.542
and for us, the big one
is how we handle the data.
