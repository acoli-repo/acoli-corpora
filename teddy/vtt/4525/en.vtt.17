Unlike us, they're mostly transparent.

00:08:30.457 --> 00:08:32.906
That means that when
we shine light on them,

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.544
we can watch the cellular
and the subcellular dynamics

00:08:35.568 --> 00:08:36.919
with exquisite detail.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.992
Let me show you an example.

00:08:39.817 --> 00:08:44.328
In this video, you're watching the spine
and the muscle of a zebra fish.

00:08:44.352 --> 00:08:48.393
We can look at
the organization of the cells --

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:51.303
hundreds of cells
in this particular volume --

00:08:51.327 --> 00:08:53.871
in the presence and absence
of adaptive optics.

00:08:53.895 --> 00:08:55.257
Now, with these tools,

00:08:55.281 --> 00:08:59.260
we can watch more clearly
than we've ever been able to before.
