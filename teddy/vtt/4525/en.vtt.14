00:06:56.901 --> 00:07:00.192
And when we watch the movie again,
you'll see that at about 20 hours,

00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:02.951
you start to form the eye
and the tail of the zebra fish.

00:07:02.975 --> 00:07:05.368
Now, we can watch this,
not in this low resolution,

00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:07.845
we can watch this in exquisite detail,

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:10.532
and we want to be able
to watch this in three dimensions

00:07:10.556 --> 00:07:13.491
over the course of minutes, seconds,
hours or even days.

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:17.322
So the problem with these complex systems

00:07:17.346 --> 00:07:19.199
is that we scramble the light,

00:07:19.223 --> 00:07:22.060
or they scramble the light
that we actually shine onto them,

00:07:22.084 --> 00:07:25.158
which causes us to record
very blurry images.

00:07:25.182 --> 00:07:28.531
And it turns out that astronomers
have had a similar problem,

00:07:28.555 --> 00:07:30.470
but for them, the problem comes
