00:00:57.043 --> 00:01:00.102
we need to be able
to understand how life is.

00:01:01.278 --> 00:01:03.325
Compared to this ant,

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:07.124
a human cell is about a hundred million
times smaller in volume.

00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:09.519
Do you see the cell
that's right next to this ant?

00:01:09.543 --> 00:01:10.712
It's right there.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.305
To be able to watch this cell,

00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:15.521
we need to make the invisible visible,

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:17.870
and we do this by building microscopes.

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:19.314
Not these microscopes;

00:01:19.338 --> 00:01:21.664
the ones that we build
look something like this.

00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:25.120
It helps that I'm part
of a paparazzi -- well, of sorts.

00:01:25.144 --> 00:01:26.963
Instead of taking pictures of people,

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:29.928
I'm more interested
in taking pictures of famous cells.

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:34.031
Well, my own career path
up until this moment in time
