00:09:00.605 --> 00:09:02.167
And in a very specific example,

00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:04.585
looking at how the eye develops
in the zebra fish,

00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:09.181
you can really see the commotion inside
of this developing zebra fish embryo.

00:09:09.205 --> 00:09:11.563
So you can see the cells
that are dancing around.

00:09:11.587 --> 00:09:14.638
In one example, you see
how the cell is dividing.

00:09:14.662 --> 00:09:15.841
In another example,

00:09:15.865 --> 00:09:19.311
you see cells trying to get places
and squeezing past another cell.

00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:23.601
And in the last example, you see a cell
being completely rowdy to its neighbors

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:25.241
by just punching its neighbors.

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.426
Right?

00:09:27.295 --> 00:09:31.719
This technology really enables us
to watch deeper and more clearly,
