00:10:59.037 --> 00:11:02.542
and for us, the big one
is how we handle the data.

00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:06.284
These microscopes generate a ton of data.

00:11:06.308 --> 00:11:10.314
We generate anywhere from
one to three terabytes of data per hour.

00:11:10.338 --> 00:11:15.101
To put that into context: we're filling up
two million floppy disks every hour,

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:17.445
for our more experienced audience members.

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.189
(Laughter)

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.362
Roughly equal, then, to about 500 DVDs,

00:11:22.386 --> 00:11:24.870
or to put things into
better context for the Gen Z,

00:11:24.894 --> 00:11:28.881
that's about a dozen iPhone 11s
that I'm filling up every hour.
