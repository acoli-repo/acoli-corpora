The problem with this approach
is that traditional microscopes,

00:03:32.743 --> 00:03:35.064
they dump way too much energy
into the system.

00:03:35.088 --> 00:03:37.697
That means that this cell
that you see over here,

00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:40.686
it's experiencing a lot of light toxicity,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.118
and that's a problem.

00:03:43.388 --> 00:03:45.322
Let me explain that a little bit better.

00:03:45.346 --> 00:03:46.525
For example,

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.021
let's say that on this planet,
life evolved under just one sun, yes?

00:03:50.854 --> 00:03:53.911
Now, let's say I wanted to watch
the shoppers on this street

00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:55.795
to understand their shopping habits:

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.454
how long they linger
in front of stores window shopping,

00:03:58.478 --> 00:03:59.892
how many stores they go into

00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:02.439
and how long they spend
inside of each of the stores.
