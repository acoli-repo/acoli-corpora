00:05:59.102 --> 00:06:02.008
we can actually understand
the rules that they're playing by.

00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:03.717
And when we understand these rules,

00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:05.175
we can start to outsmart them,

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.470
whether through
intelligent drug therapies,

00:06:07.494 --> 00:06:10.665
to be able to mitigate, manage
or even prevent the virus

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.881
from binding into the cell
in the first place.

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:16.735
Now, we've made the invisible visible,

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:17.973
but the question remains:

00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:20.418
When can we believe what we actually see?

00:06:20.442 --> 00:06:22.576
Everything I've shown you
up until this point

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.900
has been a cell that's been held prisoner
on a piece of glass or in a petri dish.

00:06:26.924 --> 00:06:30.935
Well, it turns out that cells didn't
really evolve on a piece of glass. Right?
