00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:34.031
Well, my own career path
up until this moment in time

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:35.461
has been pretty windy,

00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:39.771
starting with my first childhood obsession
and continued passion in computer science,

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:43.511
which took a sharp transition
to looking at engineering,

00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:46.393
and more recently,

00:01:46.417 --> 00:01:50.402
a very sharp transition
to trying to understand cell biology.

00:01:51.134 --> 00:01:53.764
Now, it's this combination of disciplines

00:01:53.788 --> 00:01:55.838
that has led me to where I am today.

00:01:55.862 --> 00:01:58.860
I'm able to carry out
interdisciplinary research

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:00.259
with one clear goal.
