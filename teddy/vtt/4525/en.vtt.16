00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:02.993
and they're able to understand
how the light is getting scrambled,

00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:05.289
and they take a mirror
that can change its shape

00:08:05.313 --> 00:08:07.729
in order to compensate
or undo that scrambling.

00:08:08.215 --> 00:08:10.497
So what we've done is
we've taken those ideas

00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:13.317
and we've implemented that
with our microscope system.

00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:14.492
And when you do that,

00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:17.788
you can more or less unscramble
the complexity of the scrambling

00:08:17.812 --> 00:08:19.517
and the fuzziness that's happening

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:21.699
as a consequence of complex systems.

00:08:22.475 --> 00:08:24.283
And we do this in zebra fish.

00:08:24.307 --> 00:08:27.955
We like zebra fish because,
like us, they're vertebrates.

00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:30.433
Unlike us, they're mostly transparent.
