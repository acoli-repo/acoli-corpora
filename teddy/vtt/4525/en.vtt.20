00:09:59.316 --> 00:10:01.914
They're basically using
these blood vessels as highways

00:10:01.938 --> 00:10:03.109
to move about the cabin.

00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:06.098
You can basically see them
squeezing through the blood vessels.

00:10:06.122 --> 00:10:08.606
You can see them rolling
where there's enough space.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.040
And in one example, well, you see
what looks like Ridley Scott's trailer

00:10:12.064 --> 00:10:13.487
for the next "Alien" movie.

00:10:13.511 --> 00:10:17.162
This cancer cell is literally trying
to claw its way out of the blood vessel

00:10:17.186 --> 00:10:19.437
in order to invade
another part of the body.

00:10:21.685 --> 00:10:23.749
In the last example I'm going to show you,

00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:26.038
we're trying to understand
how the ear develops.

00:10:26.062 --> 00:10:29.643
In this case, we were completely
upstaged by crawling neutrophils.

00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:32.785
These immune cells are basically
on patrol all the time.
