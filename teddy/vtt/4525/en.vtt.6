00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:02.184
understand how that changes over time,

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:04.916
and that's essentially
what we're interested in,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.176
trying to understand life at its essence.

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.445
So we want to go from imaging life,

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.144
which has traditionally
been confined to two dimensions,

00:03:13.168 --> 00:03:15.503
to being able to image life
in three dimensions.

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:19.073
So how do you make a two-dimensional image
into a three-dimensional image?

00:03:19.097 --> 00:03:21.176
Well, turns out
it's pretty straightforward.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.547
We just collect a series
of two-dimensional images

00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:25.468
as we're moving the sample up and down,

00:03:25.492 --> 00:03:27.835
and then we stack the images
on top of each other

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.687
and create a three-dimensional volume.

00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.719
The problem with this approach
is that traditional microscopes,
