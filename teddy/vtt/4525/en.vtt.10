00:04:56.974 --> 00:05:01.296
there's really nothing natural
about trying to watch a damaged cell

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.054
whose behavior has been
significantly altered.

00:05:05.323 --> 00:05:08.782
Well, let's take this cell for example.

00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:10.620
It's sitting on a piece of glass.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:12.448
You see the spots everywhere?

00:05:12.472 --> 00:05:14.997
Those spots represent molecular machines

00:05:15.021 --> 00:05:17.330
that are assembling
on the surface of the cell

00:05:17.354 --> 00:05:21.813
in order to be able to shuttle food
from outside the cell into the cell.

00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:25.002
Our lab uses something called
the lattice light sheet microscopy,

00:05:25.026 --> 00:05:27.635
which generates a very,
very thin sheet of light,

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:29.642
paying attention not to damage the cells

00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:32.319
or not to put too much light
into the system.
