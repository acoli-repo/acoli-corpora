00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Back in 1992, I started working for a company

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
called Interval Research,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which was just then being founded

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
by David Lidell and Paul Allen

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
as a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I met with David

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to talk about what I might do in his company.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and writing books --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
after twenty years or so in the computer game industry

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
having ideas that people didn't think they could sell.
