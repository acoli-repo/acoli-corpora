It's where a creative team
of writers, producers,

00:02:31.108 --> 00:02:33.640
and on-camera talent come together.

00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:37.403
Being in a writers' room is sort of
an organizational psychologist's dream,

00:02:37.427 --> 00:02:39.212
at least it's one of mine,

00:02:39.236 --> 00:02:41.547
and The Daily Show is giving me
backstage access

00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:44.140
to see how they start the day
with a blank page

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.775
and end up with 22 minutes
of great comedy.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.204

00:02:48.228 --> 00:02:50.611
The room is packed with about 30 people.

00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:52.467
Some of them are sitting on couches,

00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:54.394
lots of them are sitting on the floor,

00:02:54.418 --> 00:02:56.346
and some of them even have their dogs.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.234
They're starting to kick around ideas
before Trevor arrives.
