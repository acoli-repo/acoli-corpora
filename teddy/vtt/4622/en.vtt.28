00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:01.474
and they also have the same job.

00:14:01.498 --> 00:14:04.327
Neil and Dave are the co-CEOs
of Warby Parker,

00:14:04.351 --> 00:14:07.447
a billion-dollar company
that's made buying eyeglasses cool again.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.445
I've always been fascinated
with dynamic duos like Neil and Dave.

00:14:11.469 --> 00:14:13.470
Not only do they run the company together,

00:14:13.494 --> 00:14:16.599
but their collaborative leadership
spreads throughout the culture.

00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:18.378
The ability to work across teams,

00:14:18.402 --> 00:14:20.998
from product to customer
service to retail,

00:14:21.022 --> 00:14:23.622
has been key to Warby Parker's success.

00:14:23.646 --> 00:14:25.885
I sat down with them
at headquarters in New York

00:14:25.909 --> 00:14:28.678
to talk about what it's like
being the boss together.

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:30.464
