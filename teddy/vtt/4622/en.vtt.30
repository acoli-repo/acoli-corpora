00:14:55.184 --> 00:15:00.549
in being able to blunt some
of the frustrating parts that come up.

00:15:00.573 --> 00:15:03.929
NB: We also at times
will play different roles,

00:15:03.953 --> 00:15:06.879
just like in a negotiation,
there might be good cop, bad cop.

00:15:06.903 --> 00:15:09.752
Having a two-year-old
and six-year-old, I know that.

00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:12.169
Rachel and I often do that as well.

00:15:12.193 --> 00:15:14.813
AG: What's it like to lead
a company with an old friend?

00:15:14.837 --> 00:15:19.001
NB: You know, often I'm talking
to other founders and CEOs,

00:15:19.025 --> 00:15:22.897
and they'll often speak
to a loneliness of the role,

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.857
and I've never felt that way,

00:15:24.881 --> 00:15:27.968
and one of the best things
about having a partner

00:15:27.992 --> 00:15:32.691
is that you can just look at each other
and laugh and crack up.
