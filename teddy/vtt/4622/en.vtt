Trevor Noah: Got a call from my manager,
and I was in the back of a taxi,

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:07.296
and he said, "Hey, how would you like
to host The Daily Show?"

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.015
Adam Grant: That's Trevor Noah.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.284
TN: My mind was blown.

00:00:10.308 --> 00:00:13.732
And I still don't think I understood
the gravity of the entire show.

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:16.629
And I remember I got out of the taxi
and my knees were weak,

00:00:16.653 --> 00:00:19.390
and I probably would have fainted
if I was just walking.

00:00:19.414 --> 00:00:21.668
I'm glad I was sitting down
when I got the news.

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:24.604
And yeah, and that's when it happened.

00:00:24.628 --> 00:00:28.009
AG: When Trevor got that call,
his worklife changed.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:31.247
He'd spent a lot of his career
working solo as a stand-up comedian
