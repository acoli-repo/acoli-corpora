00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:04.355
but I believe that laughter is absorbed

00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:06.767
just like secondhand cigarette smoke

00:10:06.791 --> 00:10:09.893
into the very fabric
of who we are as human beings.

00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:13.464
AG: Watching you in the room this morning,
I was intrigued by a few things.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:16.019
One, I expected a big change
when you walked in,

00:10:16.043 --> 00:10:18.112
and there wasn't a lot that was different,

00:10:18.136 --> 00:10:21.675
which is a sign to me that you've made it
incredibly psychologically safe.

00:10:21.699 --> 00:10:23.421
AG: People are not afraid of you.

00:10:23.445 --> 00:10:25.541
TN: Oh, in the room. Oh, that's funny.

00:10:25.565 --> 00:10:27.818
AG: They're not freaked out
that you walked in,

00:10:27.842 --> 00:10:30.913
and they're still pitching
some pretty half-baked jokes.
