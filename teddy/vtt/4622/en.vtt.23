00:11:25.313 --> 00:11:30.495
TN: I'm saying that joke you pitched,
it was so good, like, even in the room.

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:32.288
ZP: That was great, that went well.

00:11:32.312 --> 00:11:33.550
AG: Did you catch that?

00:11:33.574 --> 00:11:37.153
Trevor just said that his head writer
Zhubin pitched a good joke.

00:11:37.177 --> 00:11:39.584
ZP: I'm a funny guy. I write good jokes.

00:11:39.608 --> 00:11:43.518
AG: The whole idea of burstiness
is that when the group has momentum,

00:11:43.542 --> 00:11:45.535
you want it to keep going.

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:47.790
So I wonder why Trevor interrupted it.

00:11:47.814 --> 00:11:49.915
AG: Is that a conscious
effort on your part

00:11:49.939 --> 00:11:51.945
to praise somebody in front of the group?

00:11:51.969 --> 00:11:53.724
Or does that happen spontaneously?

00:11:53.748 --> 00:11:55.700
TN: I think that's a subconscious thing,

00:11:55.724 --> 00:12:00.624
but I've always believed
in crediting people where credit is due.
