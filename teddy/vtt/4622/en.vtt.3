Workplaces have relied
on brainstorming for years.

00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:33.406
There's just one small problem:

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.659
it doesn't work.

00:01:35.674 --> 00:01:39.358
We actually have decades of evidence
that brainstorming backfires.

00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:42.477
Groups produce fewer ideas and worse ideas

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.485
than the same people working alone.

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.048

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:49.436
So what is it about group brainstorming
that stifles creativity?

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.500
First, people silence themselves
because they're afraid of looking stupid.

00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:57.531
Second, some people silence others
by dominating the conversation.

00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:00.738
And third, everyone just supports
the boss's favorite idea.
