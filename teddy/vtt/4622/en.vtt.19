In the writers' room, the burstiness
doesn't just happen by accident.

00:09:33.745 --> 00:09:35.157
I asked Trevor Noah about it.

TN: So, when I'm in a writers' room,

00:09:38.141 --> 00:09:40.640
there are two things
that are happening in my head.

00:09:40.664 --> 00:09:44.037
One, I'm looking at what we're going
to be doing on the show that day,

00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:48.648
and two, I'm thinking
about the room as a comedy room

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:53.417
and how much laughter
it is imbued with in that moment.

00:09:53.441 --> 00:09:56.645
And I know it's extremely superstitious

00:09:56.669 --> 00:09:59.895
and no one can ever prove it
or not disprove it,

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:04.355
but I believe that laughter is absorbed
