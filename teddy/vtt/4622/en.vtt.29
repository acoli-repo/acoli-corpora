(Music)

AG: The obvious metaphor
for a co-CEO relationship

00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:35.504
is a married couple,

00:14:35.528 --> 00:14:39.830
but you both talk about it
a little bit more in terms of parenting.

00:14:39.854 --> 00:14:41.663
NB: You know, I think that's right.

00:14:41.687 --> 00:14:45.252
With parenting,
you need a philosophy, right?

00:14:45.276 --> 00:14:50.521
You need a vision for what you want
your children to grow up to be.

00:14:50.545 --> 00:14:53.711
DG: It also makes the highs higher,
being able to celebrate wins,

00:14:53.735 --> 00:14:55.160
and it makes the lows higher,

00:14:55.184 --> 00:15:00.549
in being able to blunt some
of the frustrating parts that come up.
