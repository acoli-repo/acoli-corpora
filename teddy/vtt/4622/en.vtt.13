00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:31.424
ZP: So, I need a couple of writers
to just a round of the Asia wrap

00:06:31.448 --> 00:06:36.804
and two writers who want
to do the Don-Jr-is-an-idiot thing.

00:06:36.828 --> 00:06:39.327
AG: They go off in pairs to write.

00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:43.193
I want to dig in further to find out
how they create the ideal conditions

00:06:43.217 --> 00:06:44.612
for burstiness,

00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:47.421
so I tracked down
the head writer, Zhubin Parang,

00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:49.683
and senior writer Daniel Radosh.

00:06:49.707 --> 00:06:52.690
AG: Psychologists talk about
this pattern they call burstiness,

00:06:52.714 --> 00:06:55.443
which is, how rapidly
we're taking turns in conversation

00:06:55.467 --> 00:06:56.887
and interrupting each other.

00:06:56.911 --> 00:06:59.506
There were moments
when somebody had a pretty good joke

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.371
and then like four people built on it.
