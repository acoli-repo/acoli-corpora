00:13:29.594 --> 00:13:31.737
This is going to be
a different kind of ad.

00:13:31.761 --> 00:13:34.284
In the spirit of exploring
creative ideas at work,

00:13:34.308 --> 00:13:37.323
we're going to take you inside
Warby Parker, our sponsor.

00:13:38.395 --> 00:13:40.672
(Music)

00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:44.665
AG: Warby Parker's Neil Blumenthal
and Dave Gilboa have a lot in common.

00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:48.070
Neil Blumenthal: You might not
be able to tell us apart by our voices,

00:13:48.094 --> 00:13:50.220
... but I'm Neil.
Dave Gilboa: And I'm Dave.

00:13:50.244 --> 00:13:52.998
AG: That didn't help at all.
But I appreciate your trying.

00:13:53.022 --> 00:13:54.497
(Laughter)

00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:57.799
AG: Yep, they sound alike,
they went to the same school,

00:13:57.823 --> 00:13:59.377
they have the same friends,

00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:01.474
and they also have the same job.
