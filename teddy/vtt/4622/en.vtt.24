00:11:55.724 --> 00:12:00.624
but I've always believed
in crediting people where credit is due.

00:12:00.648 --> 00:12:02.957
Especially when you're working
in an environment

00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:06.327
where all of the praise is bound
to be aimed towards myself.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:09.590
So if something's amazing on the show,
Trevor gets the credit.

00:12:09.614 --> 00:12:11.391
If something's horrible on the show,

00:12:11.415 --> 00:12:13.757
Trevor gets the credit
as well, or the blame.

00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:17.312
And, so I think it just moves people
forward as human beings

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:21.097
to know that we are acknowledged
in whatever we're doing.

00:12:21.121 --> 00:12:23.589
AG: When you're in a creative
group that's bursting,

00:12:23.613 --> 00:12:25.906
it's easy to lose track of who said what

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.291
and whether your input even matters.

00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:29.469
Here's Daniel.

00:12:29.493 --> 00:12:33.636
DR: It's such a blender,
like, all this material gets put in
