I study how to make work not suck.

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:06.658
In this show, I'm inviting myself in
to some truly unusual places

00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:10.205
where they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work.

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.189
Today, creativity under the gun,

00:01:13.213 --> 00:01:16.698
and how you can be more creative
in whatever you do.

When you have a creative challenge,

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:28.094
the natural starting point is to bring
a group of people together to brainstorm.

00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:31.207
Workplaces have relied
on brainstorming for years.
