At The Daily Show, the room just literally
sounds like it's bursting with ideas.

00:05:01.582 --> 00:05:04.141
You can hear it in the Roy Moore joke.

00:05:04.165 --> 00:05:07.173
ZP: I think ... Oh, here we go.
What's up, man?

00:05:07.197 --> 00:05:09.150
AG: Trevor Noah just walked in the room.

00:05:09.174 --> 00:05:11.515
ZP: We're just watching
and laughing at Roy Moore,

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.908
going to the mall,
hanging around until ...

00:05:13.932 --> 00:05:16.509
TN: Getting banned from the mall?

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:19.277
TN: That's a pretty extreme
detail that they left out.

00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:20.618
ZP: While you're the DA.

00:05:20.642 --> 00:05:24.320
TN: Even the mall cop
is like, "Look, Mr. DA, I know."

00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:26.709
MB: It's really hard
to get banned by the mall.

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:29.439
Like, if you are a bad teenager,
you don't get banned.

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:32.065
