00:12:59.062 --> 00:13:01.340
and so there was a line
I thought of yesterday

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.968
with the Roy Moore accusations,

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.102
and Sean Hannity came out to defend him.

00:13:06.126 --> 00:13:10.879
And I said, "Sean Hannity has a season
ticket to the wrong side of history."

00:13:10.903 --> 00:13:13.879
And it just made me giggle.
Like, you know?

00:13:13.903 --> 00:13:16.799
And then I was just like,
"Yeah, I'm going to say that."

00:13:16.823 --> 00:13:20.267
And so if your day is punctuated with joy,

00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:23.862
that joy will manifest itself
in the final product that is the show.

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:28.344
AG: We'll be back with more
from Trevor and The Daily Show

00:13:28.368 --> 00:13:29.570
after the break.

00:13:29.594 --> 00:13:31.737
This is going to be
a different kind of ad.
