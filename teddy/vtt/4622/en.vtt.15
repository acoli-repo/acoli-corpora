Anita Williams Woolley:
I'm Anita Williams Woolley.

00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:35.228
I'm an associate professor
at Carnegie Mellon University.

00:07:35.252 --> 00:07:40.601
Burstiness is when everybody
is speaking and responding to each other

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:42.419
in a short amount of time

00:07:42.443 --> 00:07:46.815
instead of having it drawn out
over a long period of time.

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:49.868
AG: Anita sees burstiness
in all kinds of groups,

00:07:49.892 --> 00:07:51.251
not just at work.

00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:54.425
AWW: I have four older brothers
and three kids who are all boys,

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:56.735
and I joke how this explains my whole life

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:59.496
because pretty much
any dinnertime conversation,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.083
you can hear me say,
"Wait a minute, let me finish."
