Dan McCoy, writer: I like the way
he was making excuses

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.249
now about these bans.
"No, I was stealing lipstick."

00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:37.274
(Laughter)

00:05:37.298 --> 00:05:39.828
AG: So right there, my ears perk up.

00:05:39.852 --> 00:05:43.843
The burstiness is back,
even with Trevor in the room.

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:46.573
Everyone's throwing out
half-baked ideas to their boss.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.469
How comfortable are you
just brainstorming on the fly

00:05:50.493 --> 00:05:54.095
in front of the most powerful
person in your workplace?

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:56.539
If you have a boss
who is constantly judging you,

00:05:56.563 --> 00:05:58.761
that would be a nightmare.

00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:01.499
You'd be afraid of getting
it wrong or looking dumb.
