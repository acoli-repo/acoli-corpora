00:08:57.385 --> 00:09:01.210
because everyone is participating freely
and contributing ideas.

00:09:01.234 --> 00:09:05.075
AWW: I don't think that burstiness
is unique to creative fields.

00:09:05.099 --> 00:09:09.606
However, I think probably creative fields
do really benefit from burstiness.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.217
The people who are
in the conversation are energized

00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:15.574
because when you speak, somebody's
going to respond to you right away,

00:09:15.598 --> 00:09:18.472
you know they're listening
and then you're listening to them,

00:09:18.496 --> 00:09:23.313
and so it's much easier
to exchange ideas and maybe build ideas.

00:09:23.861 --> 00:09:25.987
AG: But of course,
burstiness looks different

00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:28.101
when your raw materials
aren't bits of code

00:09:28.125 --> 00:09:29.878
but bits of comedy.

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:33.721
In the writers' room, the burstiness
doesn't just happen by accident.
