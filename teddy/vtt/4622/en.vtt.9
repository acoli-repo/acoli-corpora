AG: The first thing I noticed

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.305
is that the room
is full of creative bursts.

00:04:33.329 --> 00:04:37.052
Believe it or not, there's a name for that
in the psychology of creativity:

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.416
it's called burstiness.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.789
(Music)

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:43.865
Burstiness is like
the best moments in improv jazz.

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.662
Someone plays a note,
someone else jumps in with a harmony,

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:51.933
and pretty soon, you have
a collective sound that no one planned.

00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:54.600
Most groups never get to that point,

00:04:54.624 --> 00:04:57.156
but you know burstiness when you see it.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.558
At The Daily Show, the room just literally
sounds like it's bursting with ideas.
