00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to make an argument today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that may seem a little bit crazy:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
social media and the end of gender.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let me connect the dots.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm going to argue today

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that the social media applications

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that we all know and love, or love to hate,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
are actually going to help free us

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
from some of the absurd assumptions

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that we have as a society about gender.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I think that social media

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is actually going to help us dismantle

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes
