00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
A few years ago, my eyes were opened

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to the dark side of the construction industry.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In 2006, young Qatari students

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
took me to go and see the migrant worker camps.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
1.1 million of them.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan
