00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.376
there's a large fissure
that goes deep into the brain.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.256
And in that fissure,
what you can't see in this image,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.496
you'll have to trust me,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.216
there is a fibrous sheet of tissue.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.456
It's called the falx,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.136
and it runs from the front of your head
all the way to the back of your head,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.376
and it's quite stiff.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.856
And so what that allows for
is when you're struck

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.936
and your head rotates
in this left-right direction,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.736
forces can rapidly transmit
right down to the center of your brain.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.000
Now, what's there
at the bottom of this fissure?

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.616
It's the wiring of your brain,

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.256
and in fact this red bundle
here at the bottom of that fissure
