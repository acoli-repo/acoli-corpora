00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.536
but what we really want to know
is what's happening inside of the brain.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.056
So we collaborate with
Svein Kleiven's group in Sweden.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.656
They've developed a finite element
model of the brain.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.776
And so this is a simulation

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.136
using the data from our mouthguard
from the injury I just showed you,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.176
and what you see is the brain --

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.616
this is a cross-section right in the front

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.416
of the brain twisting
and contorting as I mentioned.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.336
So you can see this doesn't
look a lot like the CDC video.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.216
Now, the colors that you're looking at

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.376
are how much the brain tissue
is being stretched.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.096
And so the red is 50 percent.
