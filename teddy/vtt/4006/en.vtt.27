00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.856
at the right time and place,
and not trigger when it doesn't need to?

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.936
Similarly, it's not going to tell you

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.336
is this helmet likely
to prevent concussion or not?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.096
And if you look at football helmets,
which aren't regulated,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.496
they still have a very similar test.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.776
They're not regulated
by the government, anyway.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.936
They have an industry body,
which is the way most industries work.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.976
But this industry body, I can tell you,
has been quite resistant

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.376
to updating their standards.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.656
So in my lab, we are working on not only
the mechanism of concussion,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.136
but we want to understand
how can we have better test standards?
