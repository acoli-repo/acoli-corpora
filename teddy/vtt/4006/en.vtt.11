00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.096
So where can we find
a group of willing volunteers

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.376
to go out and smash their heads
into each other on a regular basis

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.616
and sustain concussion?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.536
Well, I was one of them,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.360
and it's your local friendly
Stanford football team.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.256
So this is our laboratory,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.976
and I want to show you

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.176
the first concussion
we measured with this device.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.456
One of the things that I should point out
is the device has this gyroscope in it,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.216
and that allows you
to measure the rotation of the head.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.616
Most experts think
that that's the critical factor

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.496
that might start to tell us
what is happening in concussion.
