And what we think is that if we can
slow the head down just enough

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.056
so that the brain
does not lag behind the skull

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.656
but instead it moves
in synchrony with the skull,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.936
then we might be able to prevent
this mechanism of concussion.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.640
So how can we slow the head down?

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.376
(Laughter)

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.360
A gigantic helmet.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.296
So with more space, you have more time,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.416
and this is a bit of a joke,
but some of you may have seen this.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.736
This is bubble soccer,
and it's a real sport.
