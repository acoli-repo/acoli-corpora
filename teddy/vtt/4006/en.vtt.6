00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.656
And what I'd like to do with this video

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.376
is to tell you that there are
some aspects that are probably right,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.416
indicative of what the scientists
think happens with concussion,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.056
but there's probably more
that's wrong with this video.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.336
So one thing that I do agree with,
and I think most experts would,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.376
is that the brain
does have these dynamics.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.776
It does lag behind the skull

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.456
and then catch up and move
back and forth and oscillate.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.720
That we think is true.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.056
However, the amount of motion
you see in the brain in this video

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.656
is probably not right at all.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.096
There's very little room
in the cranial vault,
