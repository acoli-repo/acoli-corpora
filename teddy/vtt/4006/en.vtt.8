00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.336
So as your head is moving back and forth,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.216
your brain is twisting
and turning and contorting,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.456
and the tissue is getting stretched.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.496
And so most experts, I think, would agree

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.656
that concussion is not likely
to be something that's happening

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.496
on this outer surface of the brain,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.616
but rather it's something
that's much deeper

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.200
towards the center of the brain.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.856
Now, the way that we're
approaching this problem

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.216
to try to understand
the mechanisms of concussion

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.096
and to figure out if we can prevent it

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.936
is we are using a device like this.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.160
It's a mouthguard.
