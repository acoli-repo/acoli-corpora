This is bubble soccer,
and it's a real sport.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.416
In fact, I saw some young adults

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.416
playing this sport down the street
from my house the other day,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.336
and as far as I know
there have been no reported concussions.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.376
(Laughter)

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.816
But in all seriousness,
this principle does work,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.216
but this has gone too far.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.496
This isn't something that's practical
for bike riding or playing football.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.896
And so we are collaborating
with a company in Sweden called Hövding.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.256
Some of you may have seen their work,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.656
and they're using the same principle
of air to give you some extra space
