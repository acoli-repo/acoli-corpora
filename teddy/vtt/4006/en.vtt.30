WEBVTT

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.856
have something available

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.216
that can in fact really reduce
the risk of concussion

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.376
and comply with regulatory bodies.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.016
And so what I'd like to do --

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.416
and I know that this is for some of you
of more immediate nature,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.096
I've got a couple years here --

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.256
is to be able to tell parents
and grandparents when I'm asked,

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.696
it is safe and healthy for your children
to engage in these activities.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.536
And I'm very fortunate
to have a wonderful team at Stanford

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.456
that's working hard on this.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.576
So I hope to come back in a few years
with the final story,
