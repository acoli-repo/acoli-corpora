00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.296
of how the skull moves.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.856
People have tried
other approaches, with helmets.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.256
We've looked at other sensors
that go on your skin,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.896
and they all simply move around too much,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.616
and so we found that this
is the only reliable way

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.000
to take a good measurement.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.696
So now that we've got this device,
we can go beyond studying cadavers,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.136
because you can only
learn so much about concussion

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.376
from studying a cadaver,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.176
and we want to learn
and study live humans.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.096
So where can we find
a group of willing volunteers
