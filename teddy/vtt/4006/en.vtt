The word concussion evokes a fear
these days more so than it ever has,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.496
and I know this personally.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.176
I played 10 years of football,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.616
was struck in the head thousands of times.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.296
And I have to tell you, though,
what was much worse than that

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.096
was a pair of bike accidents I had
where I suffered concussions,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.056
and I'm still dealing with the effects
of the most recent one

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.840

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.096
