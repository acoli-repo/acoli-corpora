00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.616
And so another thing
that I should tell you

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.856
that you may not know

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.816
is that the helmets that are worn
in bicycling and football

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.496
and many activities,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.096
they're not designed or tested

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.600
for how well they can protect
your children against concussion.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.936
They're in fact designed and tested

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.640
for their ability to protect
against skull fracture.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.456
And so I get this question
all the time from parents,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.056
and they ask me,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.376
"Would you let your own child
play football?"

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.576
Or, "Should I let my child play soccer?"
