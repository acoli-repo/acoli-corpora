00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.096
There is a fear around concussion

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.080
that does have some evidence behind it.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.936
There is information
that a repeated history of concussion

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.256
can lead to early dementia,
such as Alzheimer's,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.336
and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.400
That was the subject
of the Will Smith movie "Concussion."

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.136
And so everybody is caught up in football
and what they see in the military,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.496
but you may not know

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.816
that bike riding is the leading cause
of concussion for kids,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.507
sports-related concussion, that is.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.616
And so another thing
that I should tell you
