WEBVTT

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.136
is starting to reveal more
of the details around concussion

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.936
so that we can have
a better understanding.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.816

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.295
is because it's pretty simple.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.040

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.736
that you see when you type into Google,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.856
The CDC website comes up,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.336
and this video essentially
tells the whole story.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.776
What you see is the head moves forward,
