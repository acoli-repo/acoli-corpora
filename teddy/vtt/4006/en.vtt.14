00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.096
is that he was struck
in the lower left side of his face mask.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.296
And so that did something first
that was a little counterintuitive.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.016
His head did not move to the right.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.976
In fact, it rotated first to the left.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.856
Then as the neck began to compress,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.976
the force of the blow caused it
to whip back to the right.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.856
So this left-right motion
was sort of a whiplash-type phenomenon,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.296
and we think that is probably
what led to the brain injury.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.096
Now, this device is only limited in such
that it can measure the skull motion,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.536
but what we really want to know
is what's happening inside of the brain.
