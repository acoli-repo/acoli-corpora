There's very little room
in the cranial vault,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.816
only a few millimeters,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.016
and it's filled entirely
with cerebral spinal fluid,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.216
which acts as a protective layer.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.400
And so the brain as a whole probably
moves very little inside the skull.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.576
The other problem with this video

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.336
is that the brain is shown

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.456
as a kind of rigid whole
as it moves around,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.880
and that's not true either.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.136
Your brain is one of the softest
substances in your body,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.176
and you can think of it
kind of like jello.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.336
So as your head is moving back and forth,
