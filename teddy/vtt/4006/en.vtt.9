00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.160
It's a mouthguard.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.856
It has sensors in it
that are essentially the same

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.216
that are in your cell phone:

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.576
accelerometers, gyroscopes,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.496
and when someone is struck in the head,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.056
it can tell you how their head moved

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.200
at a thousand samples per second.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.456
The principle behind
the mouthguard is this:

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.736
it fits onto your teeth.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.816
Your teeth are one of the hardest
substances in your body.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.896
So it rigidly couples to your skull

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.336
and gives you the most precise
possible measurement

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.296
of how the skull moves.
