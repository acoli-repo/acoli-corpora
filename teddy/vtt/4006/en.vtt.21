00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.416
And the same goes
for all of the space in the ventricles.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.216
These ventricles are much larger.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.776
And so all of this tissue
near the center of the brain

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.016
has died off over time.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.600
So what we're learning
is indeed consistent.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.176
Now, there is some good news here,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.656
and I hope to give you a sense
of hope by the end of this talk.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.776
One of the things that we've noticed,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.056
specifically about
this mechanism of injury,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.136
is although there's a rapid transmission
of the forces down this fissure,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.456
it still takes a defined amount of time.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.816
And what we think is that if we can
slow the head down just enough
