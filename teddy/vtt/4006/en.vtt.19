00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.256
and in fact this red bundle
here at the bottom of that fissure

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.256
is the single largest fiber bundle

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.256
that is the wiring that connects
the right and left sides of your brain.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.804
It's called the corpus callosum.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.416
And we think that this might be

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.256
one of the most common
mechanisms of concussion,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.976
and as the forces move down,
they strike the corpus callosum,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.976
it causes a dissociation
between your right and your left brain

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.480
and could explain some
of the symptoms of concussion.
