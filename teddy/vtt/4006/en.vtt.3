Or, "Should I let my child play soccer?"

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.496
And I think that as a field,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.920
we're a long way from giving an answer
with any kind of confidence there.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.016
So I look at that question
from a bit of a different lens,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.776
and I want to know,
how can we prevent concussion?

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.456
Is that even possible?

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.040
And most experts think that it's not,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.736
but the work that we're doing in my lab

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.136
is starting to reveal more
of the details around concussion
