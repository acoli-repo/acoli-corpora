00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.800
Here it comes at you in real speed.
You'll hear this.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.520
The hit delivered by --

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.176
David Camarillo: Sorry, three times
is probably a little excessive there.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.456
But you get the idea.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.296
So when you look at just the film here,

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.136
pretty much the only thing you can see
is he got hit really hard and he was hurt.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.816
But when we extract the data

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.840
out of the mouthguard that he was wearing,

00:06:50.864 --> 00:06:53.576
we can see much more detail,
much richer information.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.016
And one of the things that we noticed here

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.096
is that he was struck
in the lower left side of his face mask.
