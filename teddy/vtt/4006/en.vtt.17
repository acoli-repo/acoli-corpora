00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.895
is that we and others have observed
that a concussion is more likely

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.895
when you're struck and your head
rotates in this direction.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.176
This is more common
in sports like football,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.535
but this seems to be more dangerous.
So what might be happening there?

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.576
Well, one thing that you'll notice
in the human brain

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.336
that is different than other animals

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.816
is we have these two very large lobes.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.056
We have the right brain
and the left brain.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.136
And the key thing
to notice in this figure here

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.416
is that right down the center
of the right brain and the left brain

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.376
there's a large fissure
that goes deep into the brain.
