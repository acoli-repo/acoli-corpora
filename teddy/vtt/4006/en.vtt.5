00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.776
What you see is the head moves forward,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.856
the brain lags behind,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.296
then the brain catches up

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.576
and smashes into the skull.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.776
It rebounds off the skull

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.560
and then proceeds to run
into the other side of the skull.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.936
And what you'll notice is highlighted
in this video from the CDC,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.416
which I'll note was funded by the NFL,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.376
is that the outer surface of the brain,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.696
where it was to have
smashed into the skull,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.656
looks like it's been damaged or injured,
so it's on the outer surface of the brain.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.656
And what I'd like to do with this video
