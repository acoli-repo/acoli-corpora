I learned that a Décima is a type of verse

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.074
that only exists in Spanish,

00:01:33.098 --> 00:01:34.362
and that it has 10 lines.

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:36.387
It's very, very complex --

00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:39.581
perhaps the most complex style of stanza
that we have in Spanish.

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:42.064
It also has a very concrete
date of origin,

00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:44.422
which is very rare for a style of stanza.

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:48.101
The Décima was invented in Spain in 1591,

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:54.016
by a guy named Vicente Espinel,
a musician and poet from Málaga.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:58.067
And listen to this coincidence:
he was the same guy

00:01:58.922 --> 00:02:00.614
who added the sixth string
