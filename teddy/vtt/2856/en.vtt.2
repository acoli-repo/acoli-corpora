00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.696
I was getting up to leave
and go home to write,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.210
when Joaquín stopped me
and said, "Hang on, hang on,"

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:05.144
and presented me with this challenge:

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:08.977
"Write the stanzas for this song

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.216
in Décimas."

00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:13.577
Now, at this point in my life,

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:16.349
I still wasn't completely
sure what Décimas were,

00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:21.659
but I was too embarrassed
to tell my teacher I didn't know.

00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:25.368
So I put on my best
"Yeah, I totally understand" face,

00:01:25.392 --> 00:01:28.131
and went home to look up
what Décimas were.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:31.635
I learned that a Décima is a type of verse
