00:03:57.321 --> 00:04:00.108
It's a bit complicated, to be honest.

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:03.151
And me -- imagine me,
trying to write in Décimas.

00:04:04.207 --> 00:04:06.150
But it's not as complicated as it seems.

00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:10.224
Plus, it's amazing that it's survived
with the same structure

00:04:10.248 --> 00:04:11.839
for more than four centuries.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.332
It's not that complicated, because it has
an impressive musicality to it,

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:17.762
a type of musicality

00:04:18.796 --> 00:04:21.602
that's very hard to describe technically.

00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:23.689
I prefer that you listen to it.

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:26.539
So I'm going to recite a Décima,

00:04:27.282 --> 00:04:31.124
one of the Décimas
that I wrote for this song.
