WEBVTT

00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:30.956
created for churches
that couldn't afford to buy organs,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.347
and that ends up, incredibly,
in Río de la Plata,

00:09:33.371 --> 00:09:37.458
forming the very essence
of the tango and the milonga,

00:09:37.482 --> 00:09:41.448
in the very same way another instrument
just as important as the bandoneon did:

00:09:42.525 --> 00:09:44.076
the Spanish guitar.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.212
(Applause)

00:09:56.457 --> 00:09:59.281
To which, by the way,
Vicente Espinel, in the 16th century,

00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:00.557
added a sixth string.
