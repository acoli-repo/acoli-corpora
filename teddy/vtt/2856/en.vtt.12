00:05:59.103 --> 00:06:01.268
so it's not presentable
in its current state.

00:06:01.292 --> 00:06:03.911
But the one I sang was good, more or less.

00:06:03.935 --> 00:06:06.863
So: What was it about?

00:06:07.472 --> 00:06:09.690
What was the meaning behind those lines?

00:06:09.714 --> 00:06:13.237
I had just returned from doing
a concert in Israel,

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:17.890
and I was very emotional over a problem
that hits really close to home,

00:06:17.914 --> 00:06:19.981
which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.128
I'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish,

00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:25.025
and my mom's family
are non-practicing Christians.

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:29.608
I was raised in a home
where the two traditions lived together

00:06:29.632 --> 00:06:31.344
more or less in harmony.
