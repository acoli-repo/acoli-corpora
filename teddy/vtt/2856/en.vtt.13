00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:43.276
at family celebrations, wearing the same
expression that I probably had

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.663
when Sabina told me --

00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:45.727

in that kind of environment,

00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:59.032
it's especially painful to see
the difficulty the opposing parties have

00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:02.243
in putting themselves in the other
side's shoes even for a moment.
