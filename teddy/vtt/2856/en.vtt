I'm going to tell you the story of a song.

00:00:03.864 --> 00:00:08.258
I was in Madrid one night in 2002

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:10.585
with my teacher and friend JoaquÃ­n Sabina,

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.686
when he said he had something to give me.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:14.941
He said,

00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:18.322
"Jorge, I have some lines
that you need to put into a song.

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:20.005
Take these down, take these down."

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.033
I looked on the table but all I found
was a circular coaster,

00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:25.409
on which I wrote the lines
my teacher dictated.

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.906
They were four lines that went like this:

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.267
"I am a Jewish Moor
living among Christians
