00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:34.474
the very ground I tread
will live on, once I am gone

00:15:35.912 --> 00:15:41.641
on my way to oblivion, and all doctrines
will suffer the same fate,

00:15:42.126 --> 00:15:47.123
and there is not one nation
that has not proclaimed itself

00:15:47.147 --> 00:15:50.118
the chosen people.

00:15:51.807 --> 00:15:58.782
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:15:58.806 --> 00:16:05.767
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.
