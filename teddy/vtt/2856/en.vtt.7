00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:32.249
exactly the same rhyme,
syllable and line structure --

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:36.703
the same structure Vicente Espinel gave it
during the Spanish Baroque period.

00:03:36.727 --> 00:03:37.908
Here's the structure --

00:03:37.932 --> 00:03:40.958
I'll give you the basic idea
and then later you can look online

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:43.102
and learn more about it.

00:03:43.126 --> 00:03:46.191
The Décima is ten lines long;
each line has eight syllables.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.436
The first line rhymes
with the fourth and the fifth;

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.008
the second line, with the third;

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:54.839
the sixth line,
with the seventh and the tenth;

00:03:54.863 --> 00:03:57.297
and the eighth line rhymes with the ninth.

00:03:57.321 --> 00:04:00.108
It's a bit complicated, to be honest.
