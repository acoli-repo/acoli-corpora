WEBVTT

00:04:27.282 --> 00:04:31.124
one of the Décimas
that I wrote for this song.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.096
I'm going to ask that you concentrate
just on the musicality of the rhymes.

00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:40.029
For those of you with headphones on --

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:44.816
I see that some of you are listening
to the translation --

00:04:45.692 --> 00:04:47.757
please take them off for a minute.

00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:50.363
(English) Take your headphones off,
it you have them.

00:04:51.408 --> 00:04:57.425
(English) Forget about the meaning
of the words for a few seconds,

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.420
(English) and then you'll put them back.

00:04:59.444 --> 00:05:01.250
(English) Forget about the structure.
