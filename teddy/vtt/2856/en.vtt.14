in putting themselves in the other
side's shoes even for a moment.

00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:03.817
So that's what I wrote about.

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:05.653
I already had the lyrics,

00:07:05.677 --> 00:07:08.126
I had the form -- the Décima --
and the content.

00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:10.986
I needed to write the music.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.570
I'll give you some context.

00:07:13.594 --> 00:07:17.413
I had only recently moved from Uruguay,
where I'm from, to Spain.

00:07:18.293 --> 00:07:21.115
And I was feeling very raw with nostalgia,

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:23.919
like many of you here,
who are away from home.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.540
And I wanted my song
to be very, very Uruguayan,

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:31.353
the most Uruguayan type of song
there is -- the milonga.
