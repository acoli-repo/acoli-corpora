00:01:58.922 --> 00:02:00.614
who added the sixth string

00:02:00.638 --> 00:02:02.941
to what would later be called
the Spanish guitar.

00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:04.331
This string right here --

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:05.648

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:10.048
From Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines,

on both sides of the Atlantic.

00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:23.735
But the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace,

disappeared; it died out.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.532
It died out about 200 years ago,

00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:33.220
and yet in Latin America,
from Mexico to Chile,
