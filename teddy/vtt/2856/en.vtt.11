any daydream is worth more
than a sad piece of cloth."

00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:35.616
That's a Décima.

00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:38.458
(English) You can put
your headphones back on.

00:05:38.482 --> 00:05:39.560
(Applause)

00:05:39.584 --> 00:05:40.737
(English) Thank you.

00:05:40.761 --> 00:05:43.863
(Applause)

00:05:45.356 --> 00:05:48.655
I also applaud Vicente Espinel,
because here it is 426 years later,

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:50.406
and the Décima lives on everywhere

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.628
in its original state.

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:54.252
I wrote three like that one;
you just heard the second.

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:56.950
I wrote the first one having only
recently learned how,

00:05:56.974 --> 00:05:59.079
and it has some errors in terms of meter,

00:05:59.103 --> 00:06:01.268
so it's not presentable
in its current state.
