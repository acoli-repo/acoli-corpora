00:13:02.636 --> 00:13:04.637
(Sings)

00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:09.848
For every wall a lament
in Jerusalem the golden

00:13:12.236 --> 00:13:18.063
and 1000 wasted lives
for every commandment.

00:13:19.536 --> 00:13:25.246
I am dust in your wind
and although I bleed through your wound,

00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:32.713
and every beloved stone
has my deepest affection,
