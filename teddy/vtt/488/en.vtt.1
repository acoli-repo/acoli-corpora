00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:33.871
That's why I spend my time teaching,
preaching and practicing democracy.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.602
I have no illusions.

00:00:36.626 --> 00:00:37.888
All around the world now,

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.538
people are doubting
whether democracy can deliver.

00:00:41.276 --> 00:00:43.714
Autocrats and demagogues seem emboldened,

00:00:43.738 --> 00:00:45.237
even cocky.

00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:47.189
The free world feels leaderless.

00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:50.435
And yet, I remain hopeful.

00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:53.369
I don't mean optimistic.

00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:55.491
Optimism is for spectators.

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:57.952
Hope implies agency.

00:00:57.976 --> 00:01:00.277
It says I have a hand in the outcome.
