Won't that just make our politics
even more dogmatic and self-righteous?"

00:08:00.382 --> 00:08:04.278
But this view assumes that all religion
is fanatical fundamentalism.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.140
It is not.

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:10.601
Religion is also moral discernment,

00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:12.557
an embrace of doubt,

00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:16.094
a commitment to detach from self
and serve others,

00:08:16.118 --> 00:08:18.283
a challenge to repair the world.

00:08:19.057 --> 00:08:23.358
In this sense, politics could stand
to be a little more like religion,

00:08:23.382 --> 00:08:24.557
not less.

00:08:25.747 --> 00:08:28.296
Thus, my final topic today:

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.359
why civic religion matters now.
