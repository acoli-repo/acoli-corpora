00:00:00.736 --> 00:00:02.270
I bring you greetings

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:04.626
from the 52nd-freest nation on earth.

00:00:06.084 --> 00:00:10.769
As an American, it irritates me
that my nation keeps sinking

00:00:10.793 --> 00:00:13.643
in the annual rankings
published by Freedom House.

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:15.399
I'm the son of immigrants.

00:00:15.423 --> 00:00:18.762
My parents were born in China
during war and revolution,

00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:21.762
went to Taiwan and then came
to the United States,

00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:23.336
which means all my life,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.286
I've been acutely aware just how fragile
an inheritance freedom truly is.

00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:33.871
That's why I spend my time teaching,
preaching and practicing democracy.
