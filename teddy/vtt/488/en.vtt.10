00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.381
but the song and scripture and the sermon

00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:06.058
are not from church
or synagogue or mosque.

00:05:06.082 --> 00:05:07.454
They are civic,

00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:09.632
drawn from our shared civic ideals

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:14.145
and a shared history of claiming
and contesting those ideals.

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:20.533
Afterwards, we form up in circles
to organize rallies, register voters,

00:05:20.557 --> 00:05:22.619
join new clubs, make new friends.

00:05:24.243 --> 00:05:27.077
My colleagues and I
started organizing Civic Saturdays

00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:29.401
in Seattle in 2016.

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:32.291
Since then, they have spread
across the continent.
