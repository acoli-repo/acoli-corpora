Ben Franklin Circles in the United States,

00:12:30.438 --> 00:12:32.404
where friends meet monthly

00:12:32.428 --> 00:12:35.993
to discuss and reflect upon the virtues
that Franklin codified

00:12:36.017 --> 00:12:37.927
in his autobiography,

00:12:37.951 --> 00:12:41.549
like justice and gratitude
and forgiveness.

00:12:43.394 --> 00:12:45.879
I know civic religion is not enough

00:12:45.903 --> 00:12:48.529
to remedy the radical
inequities of our age.

00:12:49.022 --> 00:12:50.827
We need power for that.

00:12:51.323 --> 00:12:55.108
But power without character
is a cure worse than the disease.

00:12:56.393 --> 00:12:59.616
I know civic religion alone
can't fix corrupt institutions,
