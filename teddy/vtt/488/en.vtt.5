00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:30.006
Civic religion, like any religion,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.153
contains a sacred creed,
sacred deeds and sacred rituals.

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:39.804
My creed includes words like
"equal protection of the laws"

00:02:39.828 --> 00:02:41.689
and "we the people."

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:46.246
My roll call of hallowed deeds
includes abolition, women's suffrage,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.870
the civil rights movement,

00:02:47.894 --> 00:02:50.208
the Allied landing at Normandy,

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:51.585
the fall of the Berlin Wall.

00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:56.043
And I have a new civic ritual
that I'll tell you about in a moment.

00:02:57.337 --> 00:02:59.201
Wherever on earth you're from,

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:03.709
you can find or make
your own set of creed, deed and ritual.
