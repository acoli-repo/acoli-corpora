00:13:01.243 --> 00:13:05.543
but institutional reforms
without new norms will not last.

00:13:06.375 --> 00:13:08.495
Culture is upstream of law.

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:10.977
Spirit is upstream of policy.

00:13:11.001 --> 00:13:13.947
The soul is upstream of the state.

00:13:13.971 --> 00:13:18.567
We cannot unpollute our politics
if we clean only downstream.

00:13:18.591 --> 00:13:20.091
We must get to the source.

00:13:20.846 --> 00:13:22.607
The source is our values,

00:13:23.752 --> 00:13:28.085
and on the topic of values,
my advice is simple: have some.

00:13:28.556 --> 00:13:30.975
