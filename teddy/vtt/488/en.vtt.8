If you are a devout person, you know this.

00:04:03.294 --> 00:04:04.926
If you are not,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.792
if you no longer go to prayer services

00:04:06.816 --> 00:04:08.480
or never did,

00:04:08.504 --> 00:04:12.279
then perhaps you'll say
that yoga is your religion,

00:04:12.303 --> 00:04:14.839
or Premier League football,

00:04:14.863 --> 00:04:17.696
or knitting, or coding or TED Talks.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.439
But whether you believe in a God
or in the absence of gods,

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:27.241
civic religion does not require you
to renounce your beliefs.

00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:30.184
It requires you only
to show up as a citizen.
