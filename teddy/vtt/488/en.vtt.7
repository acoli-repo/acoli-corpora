00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:31.329
Perhaps now you're getting
a little worried

00:03:31.353 --> 00:03:33.479
that I'm trying to sell you on a cult.

00:03:33.503 --> 00:03:35.048
Relax, I'm not.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.148
I don't need to sell you.

00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:40.864
As a human, you are always
in the market for a cult,

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:43.711
for some variety of religious experience.

00:03:43.735 --> 00:03:47.072
We are wired to seek
cosmological explanations,

00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:50.738
to sacralize beliefs
that unite us in transcendent purpose.

00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:54.563
Humans make religion
because humans make groups.

00:03:55.262 --> 00:03:59.036
The only choice we have is whether
to activate that groupness for good.
