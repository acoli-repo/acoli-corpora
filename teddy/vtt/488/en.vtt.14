00:07:01.014 --> 00:07:03.310
We've since created a civic seminary

00:07:03.334 --> 00:07:07.103
to start training people from all over
to lead Civic Saturday gatherings

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:08.881
on their own, in their own towns.

00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:12.227
In the community of Athens, Tennessee,

00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:14.832
a feisty leader named Whitney Kimball Coe

00:07:14.856 --> 00:07:17.309
leads hers in an art and framing shop

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:19.794
with a youth choir
and lots of little flags.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:22.415
A young activist named Berto Aguayo

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:24.884
led his Civic Saturday on a street corner

00:07:24.908 --> 00:07:27.871
in the Back of the Yards
neighborhood of Chicago.

00:07:27.895 --> 00:07:30.162
Berto was once involved with gangs.
