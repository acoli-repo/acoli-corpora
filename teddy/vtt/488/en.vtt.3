00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.325
And today, I want to talk about
what civic religion is,

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:31.952
how we practice it,

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:34.436
and why it matters now more than ever.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.983
Let me start with the what.

00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:42.101
I define civic religion as a system
of shared beliefs and collective practices

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:45.812
by which the members
of a self-governing community

00:01:45.836 --> 00:01:47.693
choose to live like citizens.

00:01:48.643 --> 00:01:52.263
Now, when I say "citizen" here,
I'm not referring to papers or passports.

00:01:52.287 --> 00:01:55.504
I'm talking about a deeper,
broader, ethical conception

00:01:55.528 --> 00:01:58.670
of being a contributor to community,
a member of the body.
