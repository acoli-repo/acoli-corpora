terrible traffic, mistrust
of newcomers, fake news --

00:06:31.617 --> 00:06:34.024
these things
aren't someone else's problem,

00:06:34.048 --> 00:06:37.571
they are the aggregation
of your own habits and omissions.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.603
Society becomes how you behave.

00:06:43.484 --> 00:06:48.086
We are never asked to reflect
on the content of our citizenship.

00:06:49.244 --> 00:06:54.944
Most of us are never invited
to do more or to be more,

00:06:54.968 --> 00:06:59.094
and most of us have no idea
how much we crave that invitation.
