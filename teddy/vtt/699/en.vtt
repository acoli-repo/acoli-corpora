So how would you run a whole country without oil?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
That's the question that sort of hit me

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It never left my brain.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I started playing with it more like a puzzle.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The original thought I had: this must be ethanol.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So I went out and researched ethanol,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which is, you actually use more

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
clean electrons than the ones you get
