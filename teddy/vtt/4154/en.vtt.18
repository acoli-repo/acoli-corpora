00:08:57.973 --> 00:09:00.874
showing that there's a pandemic
that we also need to address,

00:09:00.898 --> 00:09:05.295
which is the crisis on air pollution
that suffocates many cities in the world.

00:09:06.849 --> 00:09:10.031
WPR: And it seems like that's probably
something that we're seeing

00:09:10.055 --> 00:09:11.597
in other areas around the world.

00:09:11.621 --> 00:09:15.325
As you're suggesting,
air pollution is a problem everywhere.

00:09:15.349 --> 00:09:17.652
And I'm curious also

00:09:17.676 --> 00:09:22.442

00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:24.928
might hinder or help

00:09:24.952 --> 00:09:27.325
some of this progress
that you're hoping to make

00:09:27.349 --> 00:09:28.926
towards climate action.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.647
How do you see this factoring in
to some of the decisions
