news of what's going in Chile
are familiar with recent social protests,

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:07.390
and I think I'm curious about
how you see that factoring in

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.088
to climate action moving forward.

00:04:09.112 --> 00:04:11.539
How might these social protests

play a role in what
climate action you see?

00:04:13.963 --> 00:04:18.718
And, really, how is it possible for Chile
to be a leader in climate action

00:04:18.742 --> 00:04:22.547
while also struggling
with some of these social issues?

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:25.282
MM: Well, the social issues,

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:28.406
which are very profound
and important to address,

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.987
caused, for example, COP25
to not be able to be held in Santiago
