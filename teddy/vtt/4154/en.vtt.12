00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:11.358
MM: No, definitely, and we will continue.
Yes, go ahead. Sorry.

00:06:11.382 --> 00:06:15.007
WPR: Go ahead. Please go ahead.
We have a little bit of a delay.

00:06:15.031 --> 00:06:20.096

Starting out, we are doing well,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.717

we have ministries involved,

00:06:24.804 --> 00:06:27.115

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.197
we need to bring in
