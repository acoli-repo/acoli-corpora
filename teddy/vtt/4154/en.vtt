Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
Marcelo Mena is an environmentalist

00:00:03.501 --> 00:00:04.652
and a scholar,

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:07.482
and he is the former
Minister of Environment for Chile.

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:08.738
Welcome, Marcelo.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.812
Marcelo Mena: How are you doing, Whitney?
Thanks for the invitation.

00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:13.988
WPR: Perfect. Great.

00:00:14.012 --> 00:00:16.769
Of course, thank you so much
for being with us here today.

00:00:16.793 --> 00:00:20.049
And you know, before we dive
into the future of climate action

00:00:20.073 --> 00:00:21.715
in Chile and beyond,

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.574
I think it would be great for us
to talk about the present

00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:29.942
and why Chile really represents
a country that is worth thinking about

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.985
when we talk about climate.
