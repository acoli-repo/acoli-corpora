00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:30.704
but therefore to get rid
of that commitment,

00:01:30.728 --> 00:01:32.456
you need to have another consensus.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.645
This hasn't happened,

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:39.098
so the thing is, the reason why Chile
has a sort of vision towards mitigation

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:40.431
that's ambitious

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:43.042
is that we see that there's
a big economic benefit.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.822
We have seen, we've witnessed,

00:01:44.846 --> 00:01:48.133
what the renewable energy sector
has been able to do for investment,

00:01:48.157 --> 00:01:50.329
for lowering energy costs.

00:01:50.353 --> 00:01:52.802
And so therefore to reach this goal,

00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:56.539
we will inevitably expand
to 100 percent renewable,

00:01:56.563 --> 00:02:00.196
but we'll also transform our industry,
which is heavy on fossil fuels,
