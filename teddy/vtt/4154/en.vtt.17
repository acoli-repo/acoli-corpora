00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:30.725
Had we not taken
measures to clean the air,

00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:34.047
as we've done in Chile
these last 20 years,

00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:37.768
we would be talking about five times
more people would have died from COVID.

00:08:37.792 --> 00:08:42.171
We have around 800 people
that have died due to COVID directly,

00:08:42.195 --> 00:08:46.495
but this would have been much higher
had we not taken action.

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:48.861
And in fact, due to the lower pollution,

00:08:48.885 --> 00:08:52.976
if we estimate and predict this
to the rest of the year,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.222
we will have saved as many lives
reducing the pollution

00:08:56.246 --> 00:08:57.949
as we have lost in COVID,

00:08:57.973 --> 00:09:00.874
showing that there's a pandemic
that we also need to address,
