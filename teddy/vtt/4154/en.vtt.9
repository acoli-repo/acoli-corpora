caused, for example, COP25
to not be able to be held in Santiago

00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:33.788
and to go to Madrid.

00:04:33.812 --> 00:04:37.250
And this also shifted a whole bunch
of the discussions and announcements

00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:38.429
that weren't done

00:04:38.453 --> 00:04:39.933
and we were expecting to have.

00:04:39.957 --> 00:04:41.349
But regardless of this,

00:04:41.373 --> 00:04:45.456

from the government today

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.137

00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:59.198
because the environmental issues,
for example, are quite widespread,

00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:02.932
and many times you have
large coal-fired power plants
