Somebody who lives
where a power plant is installed

00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:13.872
has twice the rate of death

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:16.048
in comparison to other people in Chile.

00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:21.637
So the model of having many people
be impacted for the benefit of few

00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:25.218

00:05:27.713 --> 00:05:31.250
of extracting, polluting,
impacting communities
