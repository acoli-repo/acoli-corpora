00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:02.141
which is one of the most polluted capitals
historically in Latin America,

00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:03.423
has dropped substantially.

00:08:03.447 --> 00:08:06.349
The car-related emissions
are down almost 80 to 90 percent,

00:08:06.373 --> 00:08:08.195
which is pretty substantive.

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:11.823
And we look at the example
of what's going on.

00:08:11.847 --> 00:08:13.788
Harvard University showed a study

00:08:13.812 --> 00:08:17.290
in which they showed higher
mortality rates for more polluted cities.

00:08:17.314 --> 00:08:19.005
And this is also the case in Chile.

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:23.896
For every microgram of pollution, PM2.5,
there is an increase of the fatality rate

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.075
of nine percent.

00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:28.654
But the thing is, we could also look back
at what we've achieved up to now.

00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:30.725
Had we not taken
measures to clean the air,
