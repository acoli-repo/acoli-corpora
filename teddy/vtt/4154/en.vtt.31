00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.679
And it was shown that Chile
will grow 4.4 percent more.

00:15:31.703 --> 00:15:34.574
So we turned the risk of climate change,

00:15:34.598 --> 00:15:37.466
and we turned it into an opportunity
of expanded growth.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.669
This manifests in lower
transportation costs,

00:15:40.693 --> 00:15:42.553
lower energy costs,

00:15:42.577 --> 00:15:45.299
and this makes the economy
more competitive.

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:48.916
The costs of reaching the net-zero target

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:54.869
are much lower than the benefits
that we will have to reap.

00:15:54.893 --> 00:15:57.472
And we're not even talking
about cleaner air benefits,

00:15:57.496 --> 00:15:59.577
we're talking about
direct economic benefits

00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:01.147
of having increased investments,
