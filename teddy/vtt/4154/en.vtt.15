00:07:29.576 --> 00:07:32.906
and this has brought us to have
the highest infection rates per capita

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.500
in the world these days.

00:07:34.524 --> 00:07:38.009
So this goes to show that --
the same parallels with climate change.

00:07:38.033 --> 00:07:41.261
We need to take action now
to prevent deeper impact later.

00:07:41.285 --> 00:07:43.928
And I think we need
to take the lesson of this

00:07:43.952 --> 00:07:46.714
to continue with an effort,

00:07:46.738 --> 00:07:50.230
because one thing is to announce
an ambitious NDC.

00:07:50.254 --> 00:07:53.752
Another thing is to invest and do
the regulations that you require

00:07:53.776 --> 00:07:55.125
to turn this into reality.

00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:57.362
But there are some things
that are interesting.

00:07:57.386 --> 00:07:58.647
The pollution in Santiago,

00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:02.141
which is one of the most polluted capitals
historically in Latin America,
