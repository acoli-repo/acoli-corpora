00:09:57.273 --> 00:10:00.402
So therefore, our green
recovery efforts need to be done,

00:10:00.426 --> 00:10:03.006
as Kristalina [Georgieva] spoke last week,

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:07.202
has to be related to a green recovery
that creates jobs immediately,

00:10:07.226 --> 00:10:11.023
that addresses the poverty issues
that we have on energy

00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:12.356
today in southern Chile,

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.298
and we need to use this
for expanding renewable energy

00:10:15.322 --> 00:10:18.827
and expanding the successful efforts
that we've done on electromobility.

00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:23.774
Today, we have the largest fleet
of electric buses outside of China,

00:10:23.798 --> 00:10:26.764
but we could actually
make this go even bigger,

00:10:26.788 --> 00:10:31.668
because we've seen that the reductions
in cost have been almost 70 percent
