00:01:56.563 --> 00:02:00.196
but we'll also transform our industry,
which is heavy on fossil fuels,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.569
towards low emissions,

00:02:01.593 --> 00:02:03.521
with the hydrogen economy kicking in,

00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:06.115
with a recently launched
committee that I formed,

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:09.453
that Minister Jobet,
the Minister of Energy, set up.

00:02:09.477 --> 00:02:13.753
And also energy efficiency
and a lot of capture, carbon capture.

00:02:13.777 --> 00:02:17.015
We are endowed with
a lot of natural capital.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.015
Taking care of that natural capital
and expanding plantations

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.787
will allow us to reach net-zero by 2050.

00:02:24.358 --> 00:02:25.541
WPR: That's great.

00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:28.572
And now it seems like Chile
has such a huge focus, then,

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:32.024
in thinking about renewable energy
and thinking about climate.
