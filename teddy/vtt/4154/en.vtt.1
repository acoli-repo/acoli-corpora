00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.985
when we talk about climate.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.618
You know, recently there have been
lots of commendable actions

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:40.366
taken by your country
when we think about climate.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.931
Chile recently committed
to net-zero emissions by 2050,

00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:47.012
the first in the Americas to do this,

00:00:47.036 --> 00:00:49.928
and that's especially notable
when you think about

00:00:49.952 --> 00:00:54.116
how much of Chile's economy
really depends on carbon emissions:

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.847
mining and agriculture
and spaces like that.

00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:59.374
So could you start a little bit
by just talking about

00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:03.300
how would this even be possible
to get to net-zero emissions in 30 years,
