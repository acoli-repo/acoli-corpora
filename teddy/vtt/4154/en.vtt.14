What have been some of the unique
challenges that Chile has faced

00:07:03.718 --> 00:07:05.120
during this pandemic?

00:07:06.303 --> 00:07:08.003
MM: Well, definitely, as anybody,

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:10.887
we are always struggling within

00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:15.269
taking actions today to prevent
a deeper impact in the future.

00:07:15.293 --> 00:07:17.871
And we started off pretty well.

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:19.415
We shut off schools.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.689
We shut off different cities
and had a quarantine.

00:07:23.713 --> 00:07:27.555
But we gave the wrong signals to people

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:29.552
and we didn't have a consistent effort,

00:07:29.576 --> 00:07:32.906
and this has brought us to have
the highest infection rates per capita
