WEBVTT

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:00.782
that triggered a lot of social movements,

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:02.221
and we started discussing

00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:05.994
how we should be able
to do our energy going forward.

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:10.756
The population, public unrest,
set up almost 6,000 megawatts

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.344
of coal-fired power plants
to never be built.

00:03:13.368 --> 00:03:17.016
And when the government,
Michelle Bachelet's government came in,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.220

on the HidroAysén project,

00:03:19.244 --> 00:03:22.156
which is a big hydro project
in the Patagonia.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.836
And both of these conditions
enabled an opportunity

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.725
for renewable energy to set in.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.301
We put in carbon taxes,

00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:31.825
we put in environmental regulations,
