WPR: And we have Bruno here -- hi, Bruno
-- with a question from the community.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:02.466
Bruno Giussani: Hi.
Absolutely. Hello, Marcelo.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.015
This is a question from Melissa Mahoney.

00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:09.092
She asks if you can expand on
what economic benefits

00:15:09.116 --> 00:15:11.996
of net-zero emissions are.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.619
And especially, could those benefits
be the same for Chile

00:15:15.643 --> 00:15:17.390
and for other countries?

00:15:19.363 --> 00:15:20.514
MM: Good.

00:15:20.538 --> 00:15:22.678
For example, when I worked
in the World Bank,

00:15:22.702 --> 00:15:25.370
we supported Chile to look into
the macroeconomic impacts

00:15:25.394 --> 00:15:27.006
of the net-zero target.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.679
And it was shown that Chile
will grow 4.4 percent more.
