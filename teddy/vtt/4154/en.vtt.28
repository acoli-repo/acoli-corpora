00:13:56.947 --> 00:14:01.413
And this is because we want
this population also to recover.

00:14:01.437 --> 00:14:06.935
You know, when you
let the park stop fishing,

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:09.229
the overflow from the fishing

00:14:09.253 --> 00:14:12.061
will actually increase
the biomass sixfold.

00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:15.153
So I think one of the efforts
that we need to do

00:14:15.177 --> 00:14:17.708
as we talk about
the biodiversity convention

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:19.527
that's going to happen this next year

00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:22.606
is that we need to change
our relationship to the environment.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.596
We need to protect
and conserve our ecosystems,

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.917
so they provide the services
that they do today.

00:14:28.941 --> 00:14:32.679
Today, 96 percent of all mammals,
land mammals,
