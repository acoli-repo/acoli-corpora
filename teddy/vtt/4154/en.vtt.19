How do you see this factoring in
to some of the decisions

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:34.681
that might be made going forward
in Chile and beyond?

00:09:35.972 --> 00:09:39.212
MM: OK, so we have a higher fatality rate
and more polluted cities,

00:09:39.236 --> 00:09:41.716
and we have a climate action to carry out.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.748
This is going to be a decisive decade,

00:09:43.772 --> 00:09:48.467
in which we need to lay the groundwork
for our lower-emissions strategies.

00:09:48.491 --> 00:09:53.302
So whatever we do today cannot lock us in
to an incompatible climate future.

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:57.249
We need to lay the groundwork
for this low-emissions transition.

00:09:57.273 --> 00:10:00.402
So therefore, our green
recovery efforts need to be done,
