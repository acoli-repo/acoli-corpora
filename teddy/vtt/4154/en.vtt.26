00:12:56.309 --> 00:13:00.847
So I think going forward these
cultural challenges that we need to do,

00:13:00.871 --> 00:13:02.367
we need to tackle them head-on.

00:13:02.391 --> 00:13:04.153
We should need to show the evidence.

00:13:04.177 --> 00:13:06.667
Otherwise, we're just going
to be ignoring problems

00:13:06.691 --> 00:13:08.747
and letting them
perpetuate for the future.

00:13:10.967 --> 00:13:14.382
WPR: And, you know, for nations
who have not really prioritized climate

00:13:14.406 --> 00:13:16.588
in the same way that Chile has,

00:13:16.612 --> 00:13:19.506
are there lessons that
you think can be learned

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.433
from some of the choices
that Chile has made in recent years

00:13:22.457 --> 00:13:24.123
that other nations can apply,

00:13:24.147 --> 00:13:28.238
and how could folks in other countries
implement some of these strategies

00:13:28.262 --> 00:13:30.257
that you implemented in Chile?
