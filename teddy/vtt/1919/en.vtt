Intelligence -- what is it?

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.857
If we take a look back at the history

00:00:06.857 --> 00:00:09.481
of how intelligence has been viewed,

00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:13.099
one seminal example has been

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.576
Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:19.687
"the question of whether a machine can think

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:20.997
is about as interesting

00:00:20.997 --> 00:00:23.968

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:29.602
Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:31.656
intended it as a criticism
