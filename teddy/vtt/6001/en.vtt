00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:12.371
Every 24 hours, wind generates 
enough kinetic energy

00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:18.204
to produce roughly 35 times more 
electricity than humanity uses each day.

00:00:18.788 --> 00:00:23.746
And unlike coal or oil, this resource
is totally renewed each day.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.454
So how can we harness this incredible
amount of energy,

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:31.329
and is it possible to create a world
powered entirely by wind?
