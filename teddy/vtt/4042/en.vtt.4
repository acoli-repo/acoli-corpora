00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.096
live in conditions
of fragility, conflict, violence,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.576
and by 2030, more than 60 percent
of the world's poor

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.000
will live in these situations
of fragility, conflict and violence.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.496
And so what do we do
about meeting these aspirations?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.216
Are there new ways of thinking

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.256
about how we can rise
to meet these aspirations?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.296
Because if we don't,
I'm extremely worried.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.656
Aspirations are rising as never before
because of access to the internet.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.176
Everyone knows how everyone else lives.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.096
Has our ability to meet those aspirations
