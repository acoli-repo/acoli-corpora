00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.496
Nobody laughs. They just shake their head.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.736
Of course.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.616
(Laughter)

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.176
(Applause)

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.216
So, tragically,
my father died at a young age,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.696
30 years ago at the age of 57,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.216
what happens to be how old I am right now,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.456
and when he died in the middle
of my medical and graduate studies --

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.896
You see, I actually got around it
by doing medicine and anthropology.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.760
I studied both of them in graduate school.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.816
But then right about that time,
I met these two people,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.440
Ophelia Dahl and Paul Farmer.
