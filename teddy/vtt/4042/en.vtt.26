00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.336
and so I want to share
with you some concerns,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.520
and then make a proposal.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.656
The Fourth Industrial Revolution,

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.776
now, you guys know
so much better than I do,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.656
but here's the thing that concerns me.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.216
What we hear about is job loss.
You've all heard that.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.856
Our own data suggest to us
that two thirds of all jobs,

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.119
currently existing jobs
in developing countries,

00:13:18.143 --> 00:13:19.856
will be lost because of automation.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.016
Now, you've got to make up for those jobs.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.216
Now, one of the ways
to make up for those jobs

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.896
is to turn community health workers
into a formal labor force.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.176
That's what we want to do.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.456
(Applause)
