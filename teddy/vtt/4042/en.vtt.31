00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.696
and just to get nerdy for a second,

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.216
we're talking about
first-loss risk debt instruments,

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.816
we're talking about derisking,
blended finance,

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.336
we're talking about
political risk insurance,

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.576
credit enhancement --

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.536
all these things that I've now learned
at the World Bank Group

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.696
that rich people use every single day
to make themselves richer,

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.456
but we haven't used aggressively enough
on behalf of the poor

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.096
to bring this capital in.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.960
