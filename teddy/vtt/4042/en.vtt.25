00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.456
And I was nominated,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.096
and I walked through the door
of the World Bank Group in July of 2012,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.496
and that statement on the wall,
"Our dream is a world free of poverty."

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.496
A few months after that,
we actually turned it into a goal:

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.136
end extreme poverty by 2030,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.416
boost shared prosperity.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.616
That's what we do now
at the World Bank Group.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.616
I feel like I have brought
the preferential option for the poor

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.016
to the World Bank Group.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.520
(Applause)

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.736
But this is TED,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.336
and so I want to share
with you some concerns,
