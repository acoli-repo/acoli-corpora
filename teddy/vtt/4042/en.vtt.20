00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.936
"Hey, you know, Melquiades
is just not cost-effective.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.096
Why don't you go on
and treat somebody else?"

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.416
(Laughter)

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.696
I hadn't seen Melquiades
for about 10 years

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.816
and when we had
our annual meetings in Lima, Peru

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.376
a couple of years ago,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.616
the filmmakers found him

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.576
and here is us getting together.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.320
(Applause)

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.056
He has become a bit of a media star
because he goes to the film openings,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.376
and he knows how to work an audience now.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.256
(Laughter)
