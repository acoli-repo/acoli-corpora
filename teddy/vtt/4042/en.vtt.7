Well, my brother was born
and they came back to Korea,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.856
and we had what I remember
as kind of an idyllic life,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.336
but what was happening
in Korea at that time

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.536
was the country was one
of the poorest in the world

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.176
and there was political upheaval.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.736
There were demonstrations just down
the street from our house all the time,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.800
students protesting
against the military government.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.840
And at the time,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.136
the aspirations of the World Bank Group,
the organization I lead now,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.600
were extremely low for Korea.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.056
Their idea was that Korea would
find it difficult without foreign aid
