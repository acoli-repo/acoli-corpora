00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.536
And the hardest of all,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.400
it's not a preferential option
for your poor.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.920
It's a preferential option for the poor.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.856
So what do you do?

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.736
Well, Haiti, we started building --

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.016
Everyone told us, the cost-effective thing

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.720
is just focus on vaccination
and maybe a feeding program.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.680
But what the Haitians wanted
was a hospital.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.256
They wanted schools.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.136
They wanted to provide their children
with the opportunities

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.176
that they'd been hearing about
from others, relatives, for example,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.096
who had gone to the United States.
