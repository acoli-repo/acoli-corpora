And we began to think
about what it would take for us

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.496
to actually have our aspirations
reach the level

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.776
of some of the poorest
communities in the world.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.976
This is my very first visit
to Haiti in 1988,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.336
and in 1988, we elaborated
a sort of mission statement,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.216
which is we are going to make
a preferential option for the poor

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.456
in health.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.016
Now, it took us a long time, and we
were graduate students in anthropology.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.656
We were reading up one side of Marx
and down the other.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.136
