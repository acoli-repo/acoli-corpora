Ophelia Dahl and Paul Farmer.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.976
And Paul and I were in the same program.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.576
We were studying medicine

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.336
and at the same time
getting our PhD's in anthropology.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.176
And we began to ask
some pretty fundamental questions.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.096
For people who have the great privilege
of studying medicine and anthropology --

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.256
I had come from parents who were refugees.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.736
Paul grew up literally
in a bus in a swamp in Florida.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.336
He liked to call himself "white trash."

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.256
And so we had this opportunity

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.496
and we said,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.976
what is it that we need to do?
