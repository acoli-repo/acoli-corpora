00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.176
and by just doing simple things,
doing the auction,

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.696
changing some policies,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.696
we were able to bring the cost down.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.936
Lowest bid,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.416
25 cents a kilowatt-hour for Zambia?

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.616
The lowest bid was 4.7 cents
a kilowatt-hour. It's possible.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.776
(Applause)

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.736
But here's my proposal for you.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.656
This is from a group called Zipline,

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.536
a cool company, and they
literally are rocket scientists.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.976
They figured out
how to use drones in Rwanda.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.216
This is me launching a drone in Rwanda

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.176
that delivers blood
anywhere in the country

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.736
in less than an hour.
