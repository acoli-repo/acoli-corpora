00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.416
preferential option for the poor
requires us to raise our aspirations

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.393
to meet those of the poor for themselves.

00:11:32.417 --> 00:11:36.056
And they said, well, that's a nice thought
but it's just not cost-effective.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:42.616
So in the nerdy way
that we have operated Partners in Health,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.336
we wrote a book against,
basically, the World Bank.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.976
It says that because the World Bank

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.856
has focused so much
on just economic growth

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.656
and said that governments
have to shrink their budgets

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.736
and reduce expenditures
in health, education and social welfare --

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.736
we thought that was fundamentally wrong.
