00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.696
Now, if the reference income
of a nation, for example,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.096
goes up 10 percent

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.336
by comparing themselves to the outside,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.616
then on average,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.696
people's own incomes
have to go up at least five percent

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.256
to maintain the same
level of satisfaction.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.256
But when you get down
into the lower percentiles of income,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.496
your income has to go up much more

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.576
if the reference income
goes up 10 percent,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.176
something like 20 percent.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.696
And so with this rise of aspirations,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.536
the fundamental question is:

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.136
Are we going to have a situation

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.336
where aspirations
are linked to opportunity
