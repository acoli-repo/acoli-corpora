00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.096
Has our ability to meet those aspirations

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.536
risen as well?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.496
And just to get at the details of this,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.936
I want to share with you
my own personal story.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.976
This is not my mother,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.696
but during the Korean War,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.176
my mother literally took her own sister,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.096
her younger sister, on her back,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.536
and walked at least part of the way

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.440
to escape Seoul during the Korean War.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.176
Now, through a series of miracles,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.296
my mother and father both got
scholarships to go to New York City.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.936
They actually met in New York City
and got married in New York City.
