(Applause)

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.816
We think the numbers will work out,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.616
that as health outcomes get better
and as people have formal work,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.376
we're going to be able to train them

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.656
with the soft-skills training
that you add to it

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.216
to become workers
that will have a huge impact,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.616
and that may be the one area
that grows the most.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.216
But here's the other thing
that bothers me:

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.136
right now it seems pretty clear to me
that the jobs of the future

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.016
will be more digitally demanding,

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.976
and there is a crisis
in childhood stunting.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.576
