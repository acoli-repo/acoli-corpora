00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.336
I just want to share with you

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.936
what I have been experiencing
over the last five years

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.256
in having the great privilege of traveling

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.496
to many of the poorest
countries in the world.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.416
This scene is one
I see all the time everywhere,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.576
and these young children
are looking at a smartphone,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.440
and the smartphone is having a huge impact
in even the poorest countries.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.736
I said to my team, you know,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.496
what I see is a rise in aspirations
all over the world.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.200
In fact, it seems to me
that there's a convergence of aspirations.
