In fact, it seems to me
that there's a convergence of aspirations.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.336
And I asked a team of economists
to actually look into this.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.576
Is this true?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.416
Are aspirations converging
all around the world?

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.696
So they looked at things like Gallup polls
about satisfaction in life

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.176
and what they learned was
that if you have access to the internet,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.296
your satisfaction goes up.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.720
But another thing happens
that's very important:

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.096
your reference income,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.776
the income to which you compare your own,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.256
also goes up.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.696
Now, if the reference income
of a nation, for example,
