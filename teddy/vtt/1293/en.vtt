00:00:00.822 --> 00:00:04.257
So over the long course of human history,

00:00:04.257 --> 00:00:06.749
the infectious disease that's killed more humans

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:09.235
than any other is malaria.

00:00:09.235 --> 00:00:12.096
It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos,

00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:14.305
and it's probably our oldest scourge.

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:18.192
We may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes.

00:00:18.192 --> 00:00:21.794
And to this day, malaria takes a huge toll on our species.

00:00:21.794 --> 00:00:24.245
We've got 300 million cases a year

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:27.237
and over half a million deaths.

00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:30.202
Now this really makes no sense.
