00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.336
is that you're pretty regularly
kicking off work

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.056
with a new set of people
you've never worked with before,

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.376
and so figuring out how
to understand them is really important

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.216
and you have to do it pretty quickly.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.376
One of them is an immensely popular survey
called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.240

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.216
Conley Zani: It is a tool
that gives you insight

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.896

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.616
AG: This is Conley Zani.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.416
