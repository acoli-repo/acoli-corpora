at some point in your life,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.120
you probably fired yourself
for having the wrong personality.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.856
What I mean is, we opt
out of entire career paths,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.136
saying things like,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.376
"I'm not outgoing enough to be in sales"

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.829
and "I just don't have the patience
to study to be a lawyer or a doctor."

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.496
We decide not to pursue jobs that feel
like a stretch for our personalities.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.616
We close the door on opportunities

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.840
and on ourselves.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.656
Personality is the set
of tendencies you carry with you,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.416
how friendly, assertive, hardworking,
curious and anxious you might be
