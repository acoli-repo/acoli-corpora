00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.216
it's critical to understand that
you might be looking at the same thing

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.136
but seeing it completely differently.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.376
That's an upside of personality tests.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.696
They can help you see your blind spots.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.736
But they have a downside too.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.096
Merve Emre: There's something
very comforting, I think, about saying,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.136
"I am an extravert, I am a thinker."

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.656
I think it's tremendously seductive

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.216
because it gives you
such an easy language for self-definition

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.256
and by extension for self-cultivation.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.016

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.016
an English professor
at McGill University in Montreal.
