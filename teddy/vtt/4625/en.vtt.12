00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.336
sitting in my office drafting documents,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.776
which is actually a pretty
intense intellectual exercise,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.976
and I really liked doing it.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.216
And then I was spending the other half
sitting at boardroom tables,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.376
often with 10, 15 people
assembled around the table,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.176
and they were often
kind of intimidating types,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.616
feeling the sense of having
to overcome an innate discomfort.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.976
And I hadn't ever been able
to put my finger on what explained that

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.640
until I came across this language.
