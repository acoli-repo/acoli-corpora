that Susan finally
took a personality test.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.976
SC: I took the test, and I felt
like the scales had fallen from my eyes.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.696
It was such a moment of epiphany!

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.056
But after that, every time
a friend would come over to my house,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.416
the first thing they had to do
was take the test

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.536
and then we would sit around
and talk about it.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.616
AG: Wait, back up.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.576
You invited friends over
to take personality tests

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.336
and then talk about your results?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.856
SC: (Laughs)

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.976
Well, I don't know,
I mean they were good friends.
