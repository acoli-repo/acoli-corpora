00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.536
that reacts more
to all the inputs coming in --

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.616
those same babies
are somewhat more likely,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.296
as they grow older,
to be more introverted.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.536
So those same babies
when they're two years old

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.896
and you put them in a playgroup
of kids who they've never seen before,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.176
they're more likely to react
to that scenario by freezing up

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.416
and letting their
nervous systems settle down

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.656
as they take in all
the new inputs coming at them.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.176
And it continues this way
throughout their lives.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.856
AG: It wasn't until her early 30s

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.456
that Susan finally
took a personality test.
