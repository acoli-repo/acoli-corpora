There was a big executive retreat
to figure it out.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.136
Right before the retreat,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.776
everyone on Marie-Louise's team
was asked to take a personality test.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.736
She showed up for the meeting
and the new bosses ...

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.616
ML: They wanted to broadcast who was who.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.176
And they'd made T-shirts
with our personality types,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.400
and we had to wear them.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.694
AG: Sounds like summer camp.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.776
Summer camp from hell,
because one of the senior execs

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.696
told everyone who didn't match
his personality type --

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.960
ML: "Don't worry, you won't be fired,
but you'll slowly be weeded out."
