Adam Grant: A few months ago,
I heard a story so crazy

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.576
that I had to call the source directly
to hear it for myself.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.176
Marie-Louise: Yeah, absolutely,
I'm happy to tell you,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.976
and I'll just sort of talk
and make a synopsis of what happened.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.335
AG: Her name is Marie-Louise.
She's a lawyer.

for a multinational company,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.816
and we had just been acquired.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.296
AG: They were merging with another firm,
so she was already nervous.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.960
Who were they going to keep?
Who would get fired?
