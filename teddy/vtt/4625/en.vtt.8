introversion-extraversion
has roots in your physiology,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.016
your brain chemistry.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.176
SC: Scientists have done
longitudinal studies

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.456
where they follow people
throughout their lives,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.216
and they've started with babies
as young as four days old.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.096
And they give sugar water
to these babies to suck on.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.616
And the thing is that sugar water
is a form of stimulation,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.736
just the way going
to a noisy party would be.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.976
And so what you find
is that the babies who salivate more

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.696
in response to the sugar water --

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.936
suggesting they have a more
activating kind of nervous system

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.536
that reacts more
to all the inputs coming in --
