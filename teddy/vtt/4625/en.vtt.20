I have a team of six students here with me
that are from all around the world

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.776
and they met a couple of days ago,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.976
and so it's pretty easy for any
little mismatch in personality type

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.536
to bubble to the surface pretty quickly.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.896
AG: Mismatch in personality

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.456
is exactly what Bain is trying
to help people plan for and deal with

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.296
so they can work effectively together

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.976
instead of spiraling
into personal conflicts.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.696
SS: The way we staff teams at Bain,

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.176
we typically have anywhere
from maybe five to seven people on a team,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.856
and so the impact of that on us

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.336
is that you're pretty regularly
kicking off work
