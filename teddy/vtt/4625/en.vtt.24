00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.816
AG: That's what the Bain recruits
are looking at right now,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.816
a can of Coca-Cola.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.256
Conley has asked them
to write down what they see.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.016
CZ: Some of you in the room
probably have a list

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.176
that looks a little like,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.560
"It's a Coke can.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.800
It's red.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.856
It's aluminum.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.096
Cylindrical.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.736
12 fluid ounces.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.176
White script letters."

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.936
AG: So far, so good.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.456
But not everyone stops at red aluminum.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.696
CZ: But you guys have things
like "diabetes" on your list.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.576
(Laughter)
