ME: Right, right, I mean,
yes, everything but the orb.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.216
AG: A personality test doesn't explain
why you are the way you are.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.816
It just describes what your traits are.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.896
You want to know your traits
so you can work better with others,

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.856
but there are times when your success
and your happiness

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.576
depends on stretching beyond your traits.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.496
More on that after the break.
