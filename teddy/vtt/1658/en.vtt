One thing I wanted to say about film making is -- about this film --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Michael Moschen, and some of the talks about music,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
this idea that there is a narrative line,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and that music exists in time.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A film also exists in time; it's an experience

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that you should go through emotionally.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
were all about learning something,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions,
