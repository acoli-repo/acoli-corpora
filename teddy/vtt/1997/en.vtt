00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And I like to immerse myself in my topics.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I see my life as a series of experiments.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life,"

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to live my life for me.
