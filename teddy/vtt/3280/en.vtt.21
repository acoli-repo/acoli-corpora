00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.136
with integrated cartridges like this
that are delivered by drone.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.216
Could print your personalized polypill,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.536
each morning on your kitchen
or your bathroom cabinet.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.376
And this could evolve, I think,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.216
into an incredible way to improve
adherence in medications across the globe.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.256
So, I hope we can reimagine
the future of medicine in new ways,

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.816
moving from polypharmacy,

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.296
one-size-fits-all,
low adherence, complications

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.376
to an era of personalized,
precise, on-demand medications

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.776
that can take us
and individualize our own health

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.496
and health and medicine around the planet.
