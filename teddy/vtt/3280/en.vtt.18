00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.936
So, this is actually a look at our
prototype IntelliMedicine printer.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.936
See, I'll unveil it here.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.896
It has about 16 different silos,

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.520
each containing individual micromeds.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.896
And I can now adjust on the software
individual dosings.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.376
And when I do that,
the robotic arm will adjust

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.496
the height of these spansules
and the micromeds will release.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.056
I can now --

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.576
The automated process
would rotate and cycle through,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.456
to make sure the micromeds are loaded.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.256
And when I hit print,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.696
these will all fall through the device,
