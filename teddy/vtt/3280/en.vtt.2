00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.056
And what's worse, drugs,
when they sometimes don't work,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.496
can still cause side effects.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.416
Take aspirin -- about one in four of us

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.376
who take aspirin to reduce
our risk of cardiovascular disease

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.376
are unknowingly aspirin-resistant

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.376
and still have the same risks
of gastrointestinal bleeds

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.160
that kill thousands every year.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.016
It's adverse drug reactions like these

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.216
that are, by some estimates,
the number four leading cause of death

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.456
in the United States.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.936
My own grandfather passed away

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.976
after a single dose of antibiotic
caused his kidneys to fail.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.976
Now, adverse drug reactions
and side effects
