00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.616
And part of that starts with
the emerging world of quantified self.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.896
We can measure so much
of our physiology and behaviors today,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.136
and often it's siloed
on our phones and scales,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.136
but it's starting to connect
to our clinicians, our caregivers,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.360
so they can better optimize prevention,
diagnostics and therapy.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.736
And when we can do that,
we can do some interesting things.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.816
Take, for example, hypertension.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.656
It's the number one risk factor
for early death and morbidity worldwide.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.976
Half of adult Americans,
on approximation, have hypertension.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.016
Less than half have it well-controlled.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.517
It's often because it takes two
or three different classes of medications.
