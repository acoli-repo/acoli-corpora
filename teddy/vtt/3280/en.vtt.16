00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.136
So with some help --
I call these "IntelliMeds" --

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.856
and with the help of my
IntelliMedicine engineering team,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.896
we built the first
IntelliMedicine prototype printer.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.136
And here's how it works:

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.536
instead of full tablets,
we have small micromeds,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.016
one or two milligrams each,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.056
which are sorted and selected
based on the dose and combination

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.696
needed for an individual.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.176
And of course, these would be
doses and combinations

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.656
you could already take together,
FDA-approved drugs.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.496
We could change the pharmacokinetics

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.480
by professionally layering on different
elements to the individual micromeds.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.216
And when we hit print,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.496
you print your combination of medications
that might be needed by you
