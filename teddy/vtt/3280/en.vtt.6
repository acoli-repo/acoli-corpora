00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.856
What if we could move beyond
today's literal cutting edge

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.656
of pill cutters and fax machines,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.496
to an era where we could have
better outcomes, lower costs,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.520
saving lives and space
in your medicine cabinet?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.256
Well, I think part of the solution
is all the emerging ways

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.776
that we can measure and connect
our health care information.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.856
Today, we pretty much live
in a reactive, sick-care world,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.136
siloed information that doesn't flow.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.136
We have the potential to move
into a more continuous, real-time

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.416
proactive world of true health care.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.616
And part of that starts with
the emerging world of quantified self.
