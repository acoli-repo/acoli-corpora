00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.336
Now, it's not just my real-time vitals

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.536
that can be seen
by my medical team or myself,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.256
it could be my retrospective data,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.256
and again, that'd be used to modify
dosing and medication going forward.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.696
Even my weight can be super-quantified;

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.616
my weight, now my shape,
how much body mass, fat,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.896
muscle mass I might have,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.880
and use that to optimize
my prevention or therapy.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.616
And it's not just for the tech-savvy.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.776
Now, MIT engineers have modified wifi

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.256
so we can seamlessly
connect and collect our vital signs

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.536
from our connected rings
and smart mattresses.
