00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.800
we tend to ignore differences
in sex and race in dosing.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.856
Now, beyond this, we know

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.096
with noncompliance or low adherence.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.216
Many of us who need

Sometimes 15 or more.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.120
And even small improvements in adherence
can dramatically save dollars and lives.
