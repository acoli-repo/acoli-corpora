00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.120
And even small improvements in adherence
can dramatically save dollars and lives.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.496
So, as we think into the future,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.296

personalized, targeted drugs,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.216

What if we could reimagine ways
to help make your medicine-taking easier?

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.136
To get the right doses
and combinations to match you?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.856
What if we could move beyond
today's literal cutting edge
