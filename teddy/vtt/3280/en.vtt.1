00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.576
And in our now exponential,
connected, data-driven age,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.080
I think we can and we must do better.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.016
So let's take a dive
at some of the challenges we have

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.096
and some potential solutions.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.376
Let's start with the fact

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.656
that many drugs don't work
for those who are prescribed them.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.296
The top 10 grossing drugs
in the United States this year,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.936
they only benefit one in four
to one in 23 of who take them.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.976
That's great if you're number one,
but what about everybody else?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.056
And what's worse, drugs,
when they sometimes don't work,
