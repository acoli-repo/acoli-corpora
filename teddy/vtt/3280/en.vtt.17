00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.496
you print your combination of medications
that might be needed by you

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.256
on any individual day.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.176
And we'd start with, again, generic drugs
for the most common problems.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.856
About 90 percent of prescribed drugs today
are low-cost generics.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.216
And once we've printed the pill,
we can do some fun bells and whistles.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.496
We could print the name of the patient,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.056
the date, the day of the week, a QR code.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.096
We could print different meds for tapering
for a patient on a steroid taper,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.936
or tapering from pain medications.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.936
So, this is actually a look at our
prototype IntelliMedicine printer.
