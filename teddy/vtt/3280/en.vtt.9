my doctor could see
my real-time numbers and my trends,

00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:32.696

Now, technology today can do even more.

my vital signs right now.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.136
Let's take a look.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.576
They're actually a little
concerning at the moment.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.896
(Laughter)

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.336
Now, it's not just my real-time vitals
