I think one of the solutions
is to make better use of the polypill.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.096
A polypill is the integration of multiple
medications into a single pill.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.616
And we have these today in common
over-the-counter cold and flu remedies.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.136
And there have been
prevention polypill studies done,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.816
giving combinations
of statins, blood pressure, aspirin,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.896
which in randomized studies
have been shown

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.256
to dramatically reduce risk,
compared to placebo.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.216
But these polypills weren't personalized,
they weren't optimized to the individual.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.736
What if we could optimize
your personalized polypill?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.096
So it would be built for you,
based on you, it could adapt to you,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.896
even every single day.
