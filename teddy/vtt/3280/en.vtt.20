00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.376
My smartwatch is looking
at my blood pressure:

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.976
I needed an adjustment
in my blood pressure medicines,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.696
my coumadin level.
My blood is too thin,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.296
so I lower my micromed
dose of coumadin, a blood thinner.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.496
So, this could be
smartly adapted, day to day,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.176
programmed by my physician
or cardiologist.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.776
And you can imagine that larger printers,
fast printers like this,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.536
could be in your corner pharmacy,

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.776
in your doctor's office,
in a rural clinic.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.736
But it could eventually merge and shrink
to small ones that could be in your home

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.136
with integrated cartridges like this
that are delivered by drone.
