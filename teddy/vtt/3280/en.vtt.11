00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.536
from our connected rings
and smart mattresses.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.256
We can start to share
this digital exhaust, our digitome,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.496
and even potentially crowdsource it,
sharing our health information

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.976
just like we share
with our Google Maps and driving,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.720
to improve our -- not our driving,
but our health experience globally.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.296
So, that's great.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.616
We can potentially now
collect this information.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.416
What if your labs
can go from the central lab

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.976
to your home, to your phone,
to even inside our bodies

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.016
to measure drug levels or other varieties?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.136
And of course,
we're in the age of genomics.
