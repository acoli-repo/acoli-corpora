even every single day.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.856
Well, we're now in the era of 3D printing.
You can print personalized braces,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.496
hearing aids, orthopedic devices,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.976
even I've been scanned
and had my jeans tailored to fit to me.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.296
So this got me thinking,

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.816
what if we could 3D-print
your personalized polypill?

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.216
So instead of taking
six medications, for example,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.936
I could integrate them into one.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.296
So it would be easier to take,
improve adherence

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.940
and potentially, it could even
integrate in supplements,

00:07:53.964 --> 00:07:57.136
like vitamin D or CoQ10.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.136
So with some help --
I call these "IntelliMeds" --
