00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.976
Now, adverse drug reactions
and side effects

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.016
are often tied to challenges in dosing.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.776
I trained in pediatrics (little people)
and internal medicine (big people).

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.216
So one night I might have been
on call in the NICU,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.496
carefully dosing
to the fraction of a milligram

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.936
a medication for a NICU baby.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.216
The next night --
on call in the emergency room,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.776
treating a 400-pound lineman
or a frail nursing-home patient

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.696
who, by most accounts, usually
would get the same dose of medications

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.016
from the formulary.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.376
Which would mean, most of the time
I would be underdosing the lineman

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.416
and overdosing the nursing-home patient.
