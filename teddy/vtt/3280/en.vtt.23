and they're often mixed up,

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.370
so it would be a perfect place
to start with these technologies.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.030
These aren't going to evolve and start
with printers on your bathroom counter.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.380
We need to be intelligent and smart
about how we roll these things out,

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.040
but realizing there's so many challenges
with dosing, adherence and precision,

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.610
and now that we have
all these amazing new technologies

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.700
that can integrate and be leveraged,
I think we need approaches like this

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.180
to really catalyze and foster

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.020
a true future of health and medicine.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.336
Host: Great, thank you.
DK: Thanks.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.840
