00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:02.260
In that sense, I agree
with the principle of objectivity:

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:04.742
if a house is blue, I say that it's blue.

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.994
If there are a million unemployed people,
I say there are a million.

00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:09.298
But neutrality

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:12.584
won't necessarily lead me to the truth.

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:16.740
Even if I'm unequivocally scrupulous,

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:20.433
and I present both sides of a news item --

00:01:21.108 --> 00:01:23.219
the Democratic and the Republican,

00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:24.880
the liberal and the conservative,

00:01:24.904 --> 00:01:26.853
the government's and the opposition's --

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:29.336
in the end, I have no guarantee,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.551
nor are any of us guaranteed
that we'll know what's true
