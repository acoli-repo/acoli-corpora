If you notice, after the candidate says,
"Go back to Univision" -- that's code;

00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:03.926
what he's telling me
is, "Get out of here."

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.787
One member of his entourage,
as if he had been given permission, said,

00:11:07.811 --> 00:11:10.206
"Get out of my country,"

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.034

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:17.596

one has to lose their fear,

00:11:24.407 --> 00:11:26.612
and then learn how to say, "No;

00:11:26.636 --> 00:11:28.125
I'm not going to be quiet.

00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:30.282
I'm not going to sit down.
