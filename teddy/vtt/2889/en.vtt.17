I would confront the candidate

00:08:32.323 --> 00:08:33.972
and show that he was wrong,

00:08:33.996 --> 00:08:37.346
that what he said about immigrants
in the US was not true.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.788
Let me give you some figures.

00:08:38.812 --> 00:08:42.982
Ninety-seven percent of all undocumented
people in the United States

00:08:43.006 --> 00:08:44.314
are good people.

00:08:44.338 --> 00:08:47.191
Less than three percent
have committed a serious crime,

00:08:47.215 --> 00:08:48.947
or "felony," as they say in English.

00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:53.541
In comparison, six percent of US citizens
have committed a serious crime.

00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:59.403
The conclusion is that undocumented
immigrants behave much better

00:08:59.427 --> 00:09:00.940
than US citizens.
