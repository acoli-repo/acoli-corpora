00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.134
not in journalism, nor in life.

00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:32.337
Neutrality

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:36.432
is often an excuse that we journalists use

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:39.765
to hide from our true responsibility.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.603
What is that responsibility?

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:58.780
not how we would like it to be.

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:02.260
In that sense, I agree
with the principle of objectivity:
