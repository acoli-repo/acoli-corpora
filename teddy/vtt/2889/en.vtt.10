00:04:56.152 --> 00:05:00.458
And so at 24 years of age -- just 24 --

00:05:00.482 --> 00:05:03.854
I made the most difficult and most
transcendental decision of my life.

00:05:03.878 --> 00:05:06.031
Not only did I resign from television,

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:08.934
but I had also decided
to leave my country.

00:05:09.508 --> 00:05:13.225
I sold my car, a beat-up
little red Volkswagen,

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:15.040
came up with some money

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:16.838
and said goodbye to my family,

00:05:16.862 --> 00:05:18.061
to my friends,

00:05:18.085 --> 00:05:19.441
to my streets,

00:05:19.465 --> 00:05:21.554
to my favorite haunts -- to my tacos --

00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:22.855
(Laughter)

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.076
and I bought a one-way ticket

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.622
to Los Angeles, California.

00:05:27.303 --> 00:05:28.530
And so I became

00:05:29.232 --> 00:05:34.058
one of the 250 million immigrants
that exist in the world.
