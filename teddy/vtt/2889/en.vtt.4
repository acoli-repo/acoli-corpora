00:01:59.823 --> 00:02:02.453
and point it in front of me
as if I were at a concert,

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:03.952
like a fan at a concert.

00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:07.096
That is not true journalism.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.500
Contrary to what many people think,

00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:14.073
journalists are making
value judgments all the time,

00:02:14.097 --> 00:02:15.946
ethical and moral judgments.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.124
And we're always making decisions
that are exceedingly personal

00:02:21.822 --> 00:02:23.987
and extraordinarily subjective.

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:25.215
For example:

00:02:25.977 --> 00:02:28.556
What happens if you're called
to cover a dictatorship,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.645
like Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile
