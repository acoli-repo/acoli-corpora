In Mexico, from 1929 to 2000,
elections were always rigged;

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.373
the incumbent president
would hand-pick his successor.

00:04:08.397 --> 00:04:11.759
That's not true democracy.

00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:14.788
To me it seemed like a brilliant idea
to expose the president,

00:04:14.812 --> 00:04:16.039
but to my boss --

00:04:16.063 --> 00:04:17.896
(Laughter)

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.126
My boss didn't think
it was such a great idea.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.877
At that time, the presidential office,
Los Pinos, had issued a direct censor

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:25.375
against the media.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:29.161
My boss, who, aside from being in charge
of the show I worked for,

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:33.040
was also in charge of a soccer team.
