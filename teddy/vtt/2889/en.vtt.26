no one else is going to;

00:13:01.898 --> 00:13:04.841
and that I'm never going to see
this person again.

00:13:04.865 --> 00:13:08.005
So I'm not looking to make
a good impression

00:13:08.952 --> 00:13:10.256
or to forge a connection.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.523
In the end, if I have to choose
between being the president's friend

00:13:13.547 --> 00:13:14.705
or enemy,

00:13:14.729 --> 00:13:17.553
I always prefer to be their enemy.

00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:20.347
In closing:

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:26.234
I know this is a difficult time
to be an immigrant and a journalist,

00:13:26.258 --> 00:13:28.136
but now more than ever,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.321
we need journalists who are prepared,
