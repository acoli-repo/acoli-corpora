(Video) Jorge Ramos: Mr. Trump,
I have a question about immigration.

00:09:34.113 --> 00:09:35.979
Donald Trump: Who's next? Yes, please.

00:09:36.003 --> 00:09:38.440
JR: Your immigration plan
is full of empty promises.

00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:40.997
DT: Excuse me, you weren't called.

00:09:41.021 --> 00:09:43.699

00:09:45.422 --> 00:09:47.705

00:09:53.008 --> 00:09:56.171
You cannot build a 1900-mile wall.

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:59.880
You cannot deny citizenship
to children in this country.

00:09:59.904 --> 00:10:01.845
DT: Sit down.
JR: And with those ideas --
