00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:00.727
Or what happens

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:02.950
if you're assigned to cover

00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:08.969
the presidential elections
of the primary superpower,

00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:13.376
and one of the candidates makes
comments that are racist,

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:15.752
sexist

00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:17.495
and xenophobic?

00:03:19.184 --> 00:03:20.421
That happened to me.

00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:23.154
And I want to tell you what I did,

00:03:23.178 --> 00:03:25.746
but first, let me explain
where I'm coming from,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.916
so you can understand my reaction.
