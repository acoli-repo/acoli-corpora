00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:30.282
I'm not going to sit down.

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:32.428
And I'm not going to leave."

00:11:32.975 --> 00:11:34.460
The word "no" --

00:11:34.484 --> 00:11:39.089
(Applause)

00:11:39.113 --> 00:11:42.985
"no" is the most powerful word
that exists in any language,

00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:46.281
and it always precedes
any important change in our lives.

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:48.498
And I think there's enormous dignity

00:11:48.522 --> 00:11:50.452
and it generates a great deal of respect

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:52.005
to be able to step back

00:11:52.029 --> 00:11:53.640
and to push back and say,

00:11:54.189 --> 00:11:55.355
"No."

00:11:55.379 --> 00:11:57.961
Elie Wiesel -- Holocaust survivor,

00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:59.319
Nobel Peace Prize recipient

00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:02.157
and who, unfortunately,
we lost very recently --
