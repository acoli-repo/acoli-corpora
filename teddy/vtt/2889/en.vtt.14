00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:04.421
a candidate who would eventually become
the president of the United States

00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:07.431
said that Mexican immigrants

00:07:08.448 --> 00:07:10.046
were criminals,

00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:13.084
drug traffickers

00:07:13.108 --> 00:07:14.268
and rapists.

00:07:14.292 --> 00:07:15.476
And I knew

00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:17.457
that he was lying.

00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:20.322
I knew he was wrong
for one very simple reason:

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:21.858
I'm a Mexican immigrant.

00:07:22.457 --> 00:07:23.816
And we're not like that.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.198

would have done:

00:07:28.113 --> 00:07:29.998
I wrote him a letter by hand
