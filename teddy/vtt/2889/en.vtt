00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.047
I'm a journalist,

00:00:03.071 --> 00:00:05.010
and I'm an immigrant.

00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:08.264
And these two conditions define me.

00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:09.706
I was born in Mexico,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.456
but I've spent more than half my life
reporting in the United States,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.464
a country which was itself
created by immigrants.

00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:19.398
As a reporter

00:00:19.422 --> 00:00:21.124
and as a foreigner,

00:00:21.148 --> 00:00:23.487
I've learned that neutrality,

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:25.516
silence

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:28.906
and fear aren't the best options --

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.134
not in journalism, nor in life.
