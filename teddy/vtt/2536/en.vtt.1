00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.265
and learn about the way
our species exchanged ideas,

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.323
maybe how we ate our spaghetti.

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:36.679
I really didn't know.

00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:38.838
Anyway, this is kind of funny,

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:43.209
because here I am, 30 years later,
and I'm still making boxes.

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.272
Now, at some point I was in Hawaii --

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:49.798
I like to hike and surf
and do all that weird stuff,

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:51.914
and I was making a collage for my ma.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.438
And I took a dictionary
and I ripped it up,

00:00:54.462 --> 00:00:57.197
and I made it into a sort
of Agnes Martin grid,

00:00:57.221 --> 00:00:59.792
and I poured resin all over it
and a bee got stuck.

00:00:59.816 --> 00:01:02.534
Now, she's afraid of bees
and she's allergic to them,
