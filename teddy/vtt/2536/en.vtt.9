00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:30.836
(Laughter)

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.548
I don't know why that happened.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.130
(Laughter)

00:04:34.154 --> 00:04:35.629
That happens, you know.

00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:39.945
Her tail terminates
in a cycloptic eyeball,

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:42.500
made out of 1986 terrorist cards.

00:04:42.524 --> 00:04:43.729
Have you guys seen those?

00:04:43.753 --> 00:04:47.151
They were made in the 1980's,
they're like baseball cards of terrorists.

00:04:47.175 --> 00:04:48.334
Way ahead of their time.

00:04:48.358 --> 00:04:50.691
(Laughter)

00:04:50.715 --> 00:04:52.712
That will bring you to my latest project.

00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:54.389
I'm in the middle of two projects:

00:04:54.413 --> 00:04:56.033
One's called "Psychogeographies."

00:04:56.057 --> 00:04:59.137
It's about a six-year project
to make 100 of these humans.

00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:01.531
Each one is an archive of our culture,
