00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:00.695
It's kind of ahead of its time, they say.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.210
So, "The Triptych."
I'll walk you through this piece.

00:03:03.234 --> 00:03:05.532
It weighs 24,000 pounds.

00:03:06.905 --> 00:03:08.882
It's 18 feet long.

00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:11.657
It's double-sided,
so it's 36 feet of composition.

00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:12.839
It's kind of weird.

00:03:14.648 --> 00:03:17.060
Well, that's the blood fountain.

00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:19.297
(Laughter)

00:03:19.321 --> 00:03:21.540
To the left, you have
Jesus and the locusts.

00:03:22.472 --> 00:03:23.679
There's a cave

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.950
where all these animal-headed creatures
travel between two worlds.

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:28.896
They go from the representational world,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.804
to this analog-mesh underworld,
where they're hiding.
