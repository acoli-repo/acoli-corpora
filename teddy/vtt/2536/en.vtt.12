You can see the pills coming out,

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:02.460
going into one head
from this weird statue.

00:06:02.484 --> 00:06:05.315
There's a little forest scene
inside the chest cavity.

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:06.497
Can you see that?

00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:08.608
Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes,

00:06:08.632 --> 00:06:10.150
like the boxes we're in.

00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:13.329
This box we're in,
the solar system is a box.

00:06:13.815 --> 00:06:15.742
This brings you to my latest box.

00:06:16.382 --> 00:06:18.833
It's a brick box.
It's called Pioneer Works.

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:20.170
(Cheers)

00:06:20.194 --> 00:06:24.706
Inside of this box is a physicist,

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.856
a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.207
a writer, a radio station,
a museum, a school,
