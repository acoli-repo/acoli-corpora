00:02:28.476 --> 00:02:30.465
I started drawing on the layers of glass,

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.561
almost like if you drew on a window,
then you put another window,

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:36.328
and another window, and you had
all these windows together

00:02:36.352 --> 00:02:38.487
that made a three-dimensional composition.

00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.444
And this really worked,
because I could stop using the resin.

00:02:41.937 --> 00:02:43.318
So I did this for years,

00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:47.777
which culminated in a very large work,
which I call "The Triptych."

00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:50.048
"The Triptych" was largely inspired

00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:53.009
by Hieronymus Bosch's
"[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,"

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:55.657
which is a painting
in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.

00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:57.380
Do you guys know this painting?

00:02:57.404 --> 00:02:58.697
Good, it's a cool painting.

00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:00.695
It's kind of ahead of its time, they say.
