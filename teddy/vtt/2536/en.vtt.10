00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:01.531
Each one is an archive of our culture,

00:05:01.555 --> 00:05:03.554
through our ripped-up media and matter,

00:05:03.578 --> 00:05:06.862
whether it's encyclopedias
or dictionaries or magazines.

00:05:06.886 --> 00:05:10.059
But each one acts as a sort of an archive
in the shape of a human,

00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:13.492
and they travel in groups
of 20, 4, or 12 at a time.

00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:16.457
They're like cells --
they come together, they divide.

00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:19.462
And you kind of walk through them.
It's taking me years.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:23.471
Each one is basically
a 3,000-pound microscope slide

00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:25.432
with a human stuck inside.

00:05:26.208 --> 00:05:28.243
This one has a little cave in his chest.

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:31.974
That's his head; there's the chest,
you can kind of see the beginning.
