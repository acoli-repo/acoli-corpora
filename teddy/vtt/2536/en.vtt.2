Now, she's afraid of bees
and she's allergic to them,

00:01:02.558 --> 00:01:06.793
so I poured more resin on the canvas,
thinking I could hide it or something.

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:08.357
Instead, the opposite happened:

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:10.063
It sort of created a magnification,

00:01:10.087 --> 00:01:12.475
like a magnifying glass,
on the dictionary text.

00:01:13.278 --> 00:01:15.500
So what did I do? I built more boxes.

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:19.862
This time, I started putting
electronics, frogs,

00:01:19.886 --> 00:01:23.433
strange bottles I'd find in the street --
anything I could find --

00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:25.806
because I was always
finding things my whole life,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.468
and trying to make relationships
and tell stories between these objects.

00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:32.277
So I started drawing around the objects,
