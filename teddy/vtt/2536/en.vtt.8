00:03:57.184 --> 00:04:00.634
She's coming out of the ocean,
and she's spitting oil into one hand

00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:03.175
and she has clouds
coming out of her other hand.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.806
Her hands are like scales,

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.468
and she has the mythological reference
of the Earth and cosmos in balance.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.881
So that's one side of "The Triptych."

00:04:11.905 --> 00:04:13.365
It's a little narrative thing.

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.469
That's her hand that she's spitting into.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.106
And then, when you go to the other side,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.239
she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak,

00:04:20.263 --> 00:04:22.297
and she's spitting clouds
out of her trunk.

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:26.357
Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's
tail that connects "The Triptych."

00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:29.735
Anyway, her tail catches on fire
from the back of the volcano.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:30.836
(Laughter)
