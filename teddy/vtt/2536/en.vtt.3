00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:32.277
So I started drawing around the objects,

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:35.613
and I realized: Holy moly,
I can draw in space!

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.636
I can make free-floating lines,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.683
like the way you would draw
around a dead body at a crime scene.

00:01:40.707 --> 00:01:41.983
So I took the objects out,

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:44.972
and I created my own taxonomy
of invented specimens.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.774
First, botanical --
which you can kind of get a sense of.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.660
Then I made some
weird insects and creatures.

00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:56.866
It was really fun; I was just
drawing on the layers of resin.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.348
And it was cool, because I was actually
starting to have shows and stuff,
