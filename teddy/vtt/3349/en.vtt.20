But by trusting the data that's actually
picking up on past practices

00:10:04.718 --> 00:10:06.732
and by choosing the definition of success,

00:10:06.756 --> 00:10:10.739
how can we expect the algorithms
to emerge unscathed?

00:10:10.763 --> 00:10:13.119
We can't. We have to check them.

00:10:14.165 --> 00:10:15.874
We have to check them for fairness.

00:10:15.898 --> 00:10:18.609
The good news is,
we can check them for fairness.

00:10:18.633 --> 00:10:21.985
Algorithms can be interrogated,

00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:24.043
and they will tell us
the truth every time.

00:10:24.067 --> 00:10:26.560
And we can fix them.
We can make them better.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.959
I call this an algorithmic audit,

00:10:28.983 --> 00:10:30.662
and I'll walk you through it.
