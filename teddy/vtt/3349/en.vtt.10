00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:01.245
Reasonable choice would be,

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:03.047
well, who is successful at Fox News?

00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:06.651
I guess someone who, say,
stayed there for four years

00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:08.329
and was promoted at least once.

00:05:08.816 --> 00:05:10.377
Sounds reasonable.

00:05:10.401 --> 00:05:12.755
And then the algorithm would be trained.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.656
It would be trained to look for people
to learn what led to success,

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:21.537
what kind of applications
historically led to success

00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:22.855
by that definition.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.975
Now think about what would happen

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:28.554
if we applied that
to a current pool of applicants.

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:30.748
It would filter out women
