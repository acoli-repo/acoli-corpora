00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:32.123
but my Department of Education contact
told me it was math

00:02:32.147 --> 00:02:33.693
and I wouldn't understand it."

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:36.604
It gets worse.

00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:40.158
The New York Post filed
a Freedom of Information Act request,

00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:43.141
got all the teachers' names
and all their scores

00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:45.947
and they published them
as an act of teacher-shaming.

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:50.944
When I tried to get the formulas,
the source code, through the same means,

00:02:50.968 --> 00:02:53.117
I was told I couldn't.

00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:54.377
I was denied.

00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:55.575
I later found out

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.465
that nobody in New York City
had access to that formula.

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.794
No one understood it.
