I am in charge. My opinion matters.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.835
That's the first rule of algorithms.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.039
Algorithms are opinions embedded in code.

00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:45.225
It's really different from what you think
most people think of algorithms.

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.753
They think algorithms are objective
and true and scientific.

00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:52.086
That's a marketing trick.

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:55.394
It's also a marketing trick

00:01:55.418 --> 00:01:58.572
to intimidate you with algorithms,

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:02.257
to make you trust and fear algorithms
