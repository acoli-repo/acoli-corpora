00:07:57.818 --> 00:08:00.884
This matters, because
the higher score you are,

00:08:00.908 --> 00:08:04.381
the more likely you're being given
a longer sentence.

00:08:06.294 --> 00:08:07.588
What's going on?

00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:09.858
Data laundering.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.357
It's a process by which
technologists hide ugly truths

00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:17.202
inside black box algorithms

00:08:17.226 --> 00:08:18.516
and call them objective;

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.888
call them meritocratic.

00:08:23.118 --> 00:08:25.503
When they're secret,
important and destructive,

00:08:25.527 --> 00:08:28.014
I've coined a term for these algorithms:

00:08:28.038 --> 00:08:30.037
"weapons of math destruction."
