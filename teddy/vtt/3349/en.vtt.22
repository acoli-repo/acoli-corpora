00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:00.606
audit that.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.382
Remember -- with the hiring

What I want to think about there

00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:28.318
is the people who are listening
have decided what's important

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:30.371
and they've decided what's not important,
