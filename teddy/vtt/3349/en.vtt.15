The news organization ProPublica
recently looked into

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:32.983
one of those "recidivism risk" algorithms,

00:07:33.007 --> 00:07:34.170
as they're called,

00:07:34.194 --> 00:07:37.388
being used in Florida
during sentencing by judges.

00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:41.996
Bernard, on the left, the black man,
was scored a 10 out of 10.

00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:45.186
Dylan, on the right, 3 out of 10.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.711
10 out of 10, high risk.

They were both brought in
for drug possession.

00:07:51.007 --> 00:07:52.161
They both had records,

00:07:52.185 --> 00:07:54.991
but Dylan had a felony

00:07:55.015 --> 00:07:56.191
but Bernard didn't.

00:07:57.818 --> 00:08:00.884

the higher score you are,
