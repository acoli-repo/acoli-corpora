00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.303
We should be translators
of ethical discussions that happen

00:12:33.327 --> 00:12:34.621
in larger society.

00:12:35.579 --> 00:12:37.712
(Applause)

00:12:37.736 --> 00:12:39.292
And the rest of you,

00:12:40.011 --> 00:12:41.407
the non-data scientists:

00:12:41.431 --> 00:12:42.929
this is not a math test.

00:12:43.632 --> 00:12:44.980
This is a political fight.

00:12:46.587 --> 00:12:50.494
We need to demand accountability
for our algorithmic overlords.

00:12:52.118 --> 00:12:53.617
(Applause)

00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:57.866
The era of blind faith
in big data must end.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.057
Thank you very much.

00:12:59.081 --> 00:13:04.384
(Applause)
