00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.153
Then someone really smart
got involved, Gary Rubinstein.

00:03:05.177 --> 00:03:08.798
He found 665 teachers
from that New York Post data

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:10.688
that actually had two scores.

00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:12.593
That could happen if they were teaching

00:03:12.617 --> 00:03:15.056
seventh grade math and eighth grade math.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.618
He decided to plot them.

00:03:16.642 --> 00:03:18.635
Each dot represents a teacher.

00:03:19.104 --> 00:03:21.483
(Laughter)

00:03:21.507 --> 00:03:23.028
What is that?

00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:24.329
(Laughter)

00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:27.799
That should never have been used
for individual assessment.

00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:29.749
It's almost a random number generator.

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:32.719
(Applause)
