00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:02.097
I use an algorithm every day
to make a meal for my family.

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:03.597
The data I use

00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:06.053
is the ingredients in my kitchen,

00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:07.604
the time I have,

00:01:07.628 --> 00:01:08.861
the ambition I have,

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:10.594
and I curate that data.

00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:14.869
I don't count those little packages
of ramen noodles as food.

00:01:14.893 --> 00:01:16.762
(Laughter)

00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:18.631
My definition of success is:

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:21.314
a meal is successful
if my kids eat vegetables.

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:25.035
It's very different
from if my youngest son were in charge.

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:27.847
He'd say success is if
he gets to eat lots of Nutella.

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.405
But I get to choose success.
