00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:32.719
(Applause)

00:03:32.743 --> 00:03:33.905
But it was.

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:35.105
This is Sarah Wysocki.

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.304
She got fired, along
with 205 other teachers,

00:03:37.328 --> 00:03:39.990
from the Washington, DC school district,

00:03:40.014 --> 00:03:42.923
even though she had great
recommendations from her principal

00:03:42.947 --> 00:03:44.375
and the parents of her kids.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.422
I know what a lot
of you guys are thinking,

00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:49.933
especially the data scientists,
the AI experts here.

00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:54.183
You're thinking, "Well, I would never make
an algorithm that inconsistent."

00:03:54.853 --> 00:03:56.536
But algorithms can go wrong,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.158
even have deeply destructive effects
with good intentions.
