00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:30.371
and they've decided what's not important,

00:11:30.395 --> 00:11:32.454
and they're not getting
distracted by that.

00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:35.710
When the blind orchestra
auditions started,

00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:39.178
the number of women in orchestras
went up by a factor of five.

00:11:40.253 --> 00:11:42.268
Next, we have to consider accuracy.

00:11:43.233 --> 00:11:46.967
This is where the value-added model
for teachers would fail immediately.

00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:49.740
No algorithm is perfect, of course,

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.225
so we have to consider
the errors of every algorithm.

00:11:54.836 --> 00:11:59.195
How often are there errors,
and for whom does this model fail?

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.568
What is the cost of that failure?
