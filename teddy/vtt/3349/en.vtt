00:00:00.975 --> 00:00:02.571
Algorithms are everywhere.

00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:07.236
They sort and separate
the winners from the losers.

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.283
The winners get the job

00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:12.050
or a good credit card offer.

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:14.725
The losers don't even get an interview

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.367
or they pay more for insurance.

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:21.746
We're being scored with secret formulas
that we don't understand

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:25.892
that often don't have systems of appeal.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.536
That begs the question:

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.473
What if the algorithms are wrong?
