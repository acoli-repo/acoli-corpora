00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.473
What if the algorithms are wrong?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.140
To build an algorithm you need two things:

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:37.145
you need data, what happened in the past,

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:38.730
and a definition of success,

00:00:38.754 --> 00:00:41.211
the thing you're looking for
and often hoping for.

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:46.272
You train an algorithm
by looking, figuring out.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:49.715
The algorithm figures out
what is associated with success.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.202
What situation leads to success?

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:54.643
Actually, everyone uses algorithms.

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:57.385
They just don't formalize them
in written code.

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:58.757
Let me give you an example.

00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:02.097
I use an algorithm every day
to make a meal for my family.
