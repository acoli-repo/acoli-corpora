00:09:29.352 --> 00:09:32.433
We know this, though, in aggregate,

00:09:32.457 --> 00:09:35.677
because sociologists
have consistently demonstrated this

00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:37.366
with these experiments they build,

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.958
where they send a bunch
of applications to jobs out,

00:09:39.982 --> 00:09:42.483
equally qualified but some
have white-sounding names

00:09:42.507 --> 00:09:44.213
and some have black-sounding names,

00:09:44.237 --> 00:09:46.931
and it's always disappointing,
the results -- always.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.281
So we are the ones that are biased,

00:09:49.305 --> 00:09:52.734
and we are injecting those biases
into the algorithms

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.570
by choosing what data to collect,

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.337
like I chose not to think
about ramen noodles --

00:09:57.361 --> 00:09:58.986
I decided it was irrelevant.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:04.694
But by trusting the data that's actually
picking up on past practices
