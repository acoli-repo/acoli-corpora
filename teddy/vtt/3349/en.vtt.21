00:10:28.983 --> 00:10:30.662
and I'll walk you through it.

00:10:30.686 --> 00:10:32.882
First, data integrity check.

00:10:34.132 --> 00:10:36.789
For the recidivism risk
algorithm I talked about,

00:10:37.582 --> 00:10:41.155
a data integrity check would mean
we'd have to come to terms with the fact

00:10:41.179 --> 00:10:44.705
that in the US, whites and blacks
smoke pot at the same rate

00:10:44.729 --> 00:10:47.214
but blacks are far more likely
to be arrested --

00:10:47.238 --> 00:10:50.422
four or five times more likely,
depending on the area.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.143
What is that bias looking like
in other crime categories,

00:10:54.167 --> 00:10:55.618
and how do we account for it?

00:10:56.162 --> 00:10:59.201
Second, we should think about
the definition of success,

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:00.606
audit that.
