00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:32.857
He was yet another
brilliant design visionary

00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:34.298
and design activist,

00:06:34.322 --> 00:06:38.886
who was completely committed
to designing a sustainable society

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.790
in such a forward-thinking way

00:06:40.814 --> 00:06:44.154
that he started talking about
the importance of environmentalism

00:06:44.178 --> 00:06:46.931
in design in the 1920s.

00:06:47.632 --> 00:06:50.085
Now he, despite his efforts,

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:54.842
was routinely mocked as a crank
by many in the design establishment,

00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:56.034
and admittedly,

00:06:56.058 --> 00:06:57.851
some of his experiments failed,

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.869
like the flying car
that never got off the ground.
