00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:30.484
Now, it was the courage
and verve of radical designers

00:07:30.508 --> 00:07:32.360
like Bucky and Moholy

00:07:32.384 --> 00:07:34.657
that drew me to design.

00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:38.717
I began my career as a news journalist
and foreign correspondent.

00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:42.159
I wrote about politics, economics
and corporate affairs,

00:07:42.183 --> 00:07:46.009
and I could have chosen
to specialize in any of those fields.

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:47.777
But I picked design,

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:51.509
because I believe it's one of the most
powerful tools at our disposal

00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:53.952
to improve our quality of life.

00:07:55.755 --> 00:07:58.333
Thank you, fellow TED design buffs.

00:07:58.357 --> 00:08:00.021
