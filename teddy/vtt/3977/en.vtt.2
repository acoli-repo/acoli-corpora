So if an archer ran out
of arrows during a battle,

00:01:01.543 --> 00:01:05.466
they wouldn't necessarily be able
to fire another archer's arrows

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.338
from their bow.

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:10.923
This of course meant that they would
be less effective in combat

and very vulnerable, too.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.941

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:19.056
by insisting that all bows and arrows
were designed identically,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.811
so they were interchangeable.

00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:24.837

00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:27.346
and every other form of weaponry.

His formidably equipped army
won batter after battle,
