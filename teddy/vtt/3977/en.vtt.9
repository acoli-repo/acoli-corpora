So she campaigned
for cleaner, lighter, airier clinics

00:04:40.032 --> 00:04:41.788
to be designed and built.

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.574
Back in Britain,

00:04:43.598 --> 00:04:45.088
she mounted another campaign,

00:04:45.112 --> 00:04:47.170
this time for civilian hospitals,

00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:51.067
and insisted that the same design
principles were applied to them.

00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:54.248
The Nightingale ward, as it is called,

00:04:54.272 --> 00:04:57.952
dominated hospital design
for decades to come,

00:04:57.976 --> 00:05:01.018
and elements of it are still used today.
