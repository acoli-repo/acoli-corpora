00:09:59.924 --> 00:10:02.203
and makes it much, much likelier

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.828
that their hearts
will actually be checked.

00:10:05.298 --> 00:10:08.620
Arthur Zang started working
on the Cardiopad eight years ago,

00:10:08.644 --> 00:10:11.367
in his final year at university.

00:10:11.391 --> 00:10:14.806
But he failed to persuade
any conventional sources

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.257
to give him investment to get
the project off the ground.

00:10:18.281 --> 00:10:20.154
He posted the idea on Facebook,

00:10:20.178 --> 00:10:22.834
where a Cameroonian
government official saw it

00:10:22.858 --> 00:10:25.811
and managed to secure
a government grant for him.

00:10:26.119 --> 00:10:29.155
He's now developing
not only the Cardiopad,

00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:33.807
but other mobile medical devices
to treat different conditions.
