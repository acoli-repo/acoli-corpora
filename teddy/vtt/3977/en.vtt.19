00:09:26.536 --> 00:09:30.681
who has a adapted a tablet
computer into the Cardiopad,

00:09:30.705 --> 00:09:33.128
a mobile heart-monitoring device.

00:09:33.152 --> 00:09:37.493
It can be used to monitor the hearts
of patients in remote, rural areas.

00:09:37.517 --> 00:09:40.163
The data is then sent
on a cellular network

00:09:40.187 --> 00:09:43.217
to well-equipped hospitals
hundreds of miles away

00:09:43.241 --> 00:09:44.417
for analysis.

00:09:44.441 --> 00:09:47.746
And if any problems are spotted
by the specialists there,

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.994
a suitable course of treatment
is recommended.

00:09:51.018 --> 00:09:53.329
And this of course saves many patients

00:09:53.353 --> 00:09:58.558
from making long, arduous, expensive
and often pointless journeys

00:09:58.582 --> 00:09:59.900
to those hospitals,

00:09:59.924 --> 00:10:02.203
and makes it much, much likelier
