00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:01.561
Then there's Gabriel Maher,

00:11:01.585 --> 00:11:03.659
who is developing a new design language

00:11:03.683 --> 00:11:08.803
to enable us to articulate the subtleties
of our changing gender identities,

00:11:08.827 --> 00:11:11.712
without recourse
to traditional stereotypes.

00:11:11.736 --> 00:11:16.003
All of these designers and many more
are pursuing their dreams,

00:11:16.027 --> 00:11:18.653
by the making the most
of their newfound freedom,

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.575
with the discipline
of professional designers

00:11:21.599 --> 00:11:24.501
and the resourcefulness
of rebels and renegades.

00:11:24.525 --> 00:11:26.587
And we all stand to benefit.

00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:27.774
Thank you.

00:11:27.798 --> 00:11:31.317
(Applause)
