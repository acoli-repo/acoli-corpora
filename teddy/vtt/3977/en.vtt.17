00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:30.772
Because even very basic advances
in digital technology

00:08:30.796 --> 00:08:35.080
have enabled them to operate
increasingly independently,

00:08:35.104 --> 00:08:37.518
in or out of a commercial context,

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:42.591
to pursue ever more ambitious
and eclectic objectives.

00:08:42.615 --> 00:08:44.261
So in theory,

00:08:44.285 --> 00:08:49.572
basic platforms like crowdfunding,
cloud computing, social media

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:53.040
are giving greater freedom
to professional designers

00:08:53.064 --> 00:08:56.549
and giving more resources
for the improvisational ones,

00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:57.730
and hopefully,

00:08:57.754 --> 00:09:00.259
a more receptive response to their ideas.
