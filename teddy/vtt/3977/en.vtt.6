He even attached matches to the brim
of his hat and set them alight,

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:04.985
so they sizzled menacingly
whenever his ship was poised to attack.

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.581
And like many pirates of that era,

00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:10.494
he flew a flag that bore
the macabre symbols

00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:13.978
of a human skull
and a pair of crossed bones,

00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:19.693
because those motifs had signified death
in so many cultures for centuries,

00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:22.579
that their meaning
was instantly recognizable,

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:26.143
even in the lawless, illiterate
world of the high seas:

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:28.643
surrender or you'll suffer.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.922
So of course, all his sensible
victims surrendered on sight.
