00:04:57.976 --> 00:05:01.018
and elements of it are still used today.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.089
But by then,

00:05:03.113 --> 00:05:06.141
design was seen as a tool
of the Industrial Age.

00:05:06.165 --> 00:05:08.891
It was formalized and professionalized,

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:11.408
but it was restricted to specific roles

00:05:11.432 --> 00:05:14.510
and generally applied in pursuit
of commercial goals

00:05:14.534 --> 00:05:16.809
rather than being used intuitively,

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:21.059
as Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard
and Ying Zheng had done.

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:22.882
By the 20th century,

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.919
this commercial ethos was so powerful,

00:05:25.943 --> 00:05:28.467
that any designers who deviated from it

00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:32.098
risked being seen as cranks
or subversives.
