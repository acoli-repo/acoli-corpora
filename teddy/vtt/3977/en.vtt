00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:03.897
Design is a slippery
and elusive phenomenon,

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:07.182
which has meant different
things at different times.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:11.474
But all truly inspiring design projects
have one thing in common:

00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:13.324
they began with a dream.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.117
And the bolder the dream,

00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:18.782
the greater the design feat
that will be required to achieve it.

00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:22.700
And this is why the greatest
designers are almost always

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:26.412
the biggest dreamers
and rebels and renegades.

00:00:26.787 --> 00:00:29.570
This has been the case throughout history,

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:33.515
all the way back to the year 300 BC,
