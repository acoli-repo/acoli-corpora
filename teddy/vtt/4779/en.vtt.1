00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.795
A healthy balance occurs when we put in
about as much energy as we lose.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:34.703
If we consistently put more energy
into our bodies than we burn,

00:00:34.703 --> 00:00:38.854
the excess will gradually 
be stored as fat in our cells,

00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:40.419
and we'll gain weight.

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:44.377
If we burn off more energy 
than we replenish, we'll lose weight.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:48.198
So we have to be able 
to measure the energy we consume and use,

00:00:48.198 --> 00:00:51.513
and we do so with a unit 
called the calorie.

00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:56.286
One calorie, the kind we measure in food,
also called a large calorie,

00:00:56.286 --> 00:00:58.605
is defined as the amount of energy

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:02.654
it would take to raise the temperature
of one kilogram of water
