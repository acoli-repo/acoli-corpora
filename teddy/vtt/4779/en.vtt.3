00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.974
about 20% fuels physical activity,

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:42.506
and the biggest chunk, around 70%,

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:46.845
supports the basic functions 
of our organs and tissues.

00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:51.757
That third usage corresponds to

you would need to survive

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:57.259
if you weren't eating or moving around.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.492

and you arrive at the official guidelines
