00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:02.654
it would take to raise the temperature
of one kilogram of water

00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:05.830
by one degree Celsius.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.724
Everything we consume has a calorie count,

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:13.505
a measure of how much energy 
the item stores in its chemical bonds.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:17.745
The average pizza slice has 272 calories,

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:20.634
there are about 78 in a piece of bread,

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:23.720
and an apple has about 52.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.320
That energy is released during digestion,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.536
and stored in other molecules

00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:32.529
that can be broken down to provide energy
when the body needs it.
