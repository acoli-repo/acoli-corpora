00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.779
your body could use 
up to 9000 calories per day.

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:33.997
Pregnancy requires 
slightly more calories than usual,

00:02:33.997 --> 00:02:37.523
and elderly people typically 
have a slower metabolic rate,

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:41.437
energy is burned more gradually,
so less is needed.

00:02:41.437 --> 00:02:45.005
Here's something else you should know
before you start counting calories.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:50.456
The calorie counts on nutrition labels
measure how much energy the food contains,

00:02:50.456 --> 00:02:54.379
not how much energy 
you can actually get out of it.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.194
Fibrous foods like celery and whole wheat
take more energy to digest,

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:04.072
so you'd actually wind up with less energy
from a 100 calorie serving of celery
