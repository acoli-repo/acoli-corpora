00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:09.368
We hear about calories all the time.

00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:11.264
How many calories are in this cookie?

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:13.862
How many are burned by 100 jumping jacks,

00:00:13.862 --> 00:00:15.305
or long distance running,

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:16.497
or fidgeting?

00:00:16.497 --> 00:00:21.408
But what is a calorie, really,
and how many of them do we actually need?

00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:25.460
Calories are a way of keeping track
of the body's energy budget.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.795
A healthy balance occurs when we put in
about as much energy as we lose.
