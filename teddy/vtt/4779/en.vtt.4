00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:01.812
and you arrive at the official guidelines

00:02:01.812 --> 00:02:06.688
for how many calories 
the average person requires each day:

00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:10.103
2000 for women and 2500 for men.

00:02:10.103 --> 00:02:11.957
Those estimates are based on factors

00:02:11.957 --> 00:02:16.527
like average weight, physical activity 
and muscle mass.

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:20.567
So does that mean everyone
should shoot for around 2000 calories?

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:22.396
Not necessarily.

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:24.554
If you're doing 
an energy guzzling activity,

00:02:24.554 --> 00:02:26.380
like cycling the Tour de France,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.779
your body could use 
up to 9000 calories per day.
