gut bacteria,

00:03:30.981 --> 00:03:33.104
and even intestine length,

00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:37.479
means that every individual's ability
to extract energy from food

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.338
is a little different.

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:41.846
So a calorie is a useful energy measure,

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:45.605
but to work out exactly 
how many of them each of us requires

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:48.260
we need to factor in things like exercise,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.514
food type,

00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:52.022
and our body's ability to process energy.

00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:54.976
Good luck finding all of that
on a nutrition label.
