00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.339
because if you're driving around town,
and the car starts stopping randomly,

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.040
you're never going to buy that car.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.415
And the vertical axis is how often
the car is going to apply the brakes

00:05:08.415 --> 00:05:11.464
when it's supposed to
to help you avoid an accident.

00:05:11.464 --> 00:05:13.685
Now, if we look at
the bottom left corner here,

00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:15.530
this is your classic car.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.663
It doesn't apply the brakes for you,
it doesn't do anything goofy,

00:05:18.663 --> 00:05:21.442
but it also doesn't get you
out of an accident.

00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:24.460
Now, if we want to bring
a driver assistance system into a car,

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.288
say with collision mitigation braking,

00:05:26.288 --> 00:05:28.900
we're going to put some package
of technology on there,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.318
and that's this curve, and it's going
to have some operating properties,
