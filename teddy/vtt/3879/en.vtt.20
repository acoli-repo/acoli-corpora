00:09:57.449 --> 00:10:01.210
Now, the way we accomplish this
is by sharing data between the vehicles.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.906
The first, most crude model of this

00:10:02.906 --> 00:10:05.019
is when one vehicle
sees a construction zone,

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:08.081
having another know about it
so it can be in the correct lane

00:10:08.081 --> 00:10:09.651
to avoid some of the difficulty.

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.315
But we actually have a much
deeper understanding of this.

00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:15.324
We could take all of the data
that the cars have seen over time,

00:10:15.324 --> 00:10:17.700
the hundreds of thousands
of pedestrians, cyclists,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.487
and vehicles that have been out there

00:10:19.487 --> 00:10:21.182
and understand what they look like

00:10:21.182 --> 00:10:24.013
and use that to infer
what other vehicles should look like

00:10:24.013 --> 00:10:25.939
and other pedestrians should look like.

00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:28.960
And then, even more importantly,
we could take from that a model

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.290
of how we expect them
to move through the world.
