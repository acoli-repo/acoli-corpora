00:00:56.388 --> 00:01:00.172
In America alone, 33,000 people
are killed each year.

00:01:00.172 --> 00:01:02.200
To put that in perspective,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.997
that's the same as a 737
falling out of the sky every working day.

00:01:07.342 --> 00:01:09.128
It's kind of unbelievable.

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:11.846
Cars are sold to us like this,

00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:14.563
but really, this is what driving's like.

00:01:14.563 --> 00:01:16.722
Right? It's not sunny, it's rainy,

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:19.210
and you want to do anything
other than drive.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.832
And the reason why is this:

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:22.690
Traffic is getting worse.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.196
In America, between 1990 and 2010,

00:01:26.196 --> 00:01:29.700
the vehicle miles traveled
increased by 38 percent.
