00:08:58.485 --> 00:09:01.979
You see pedestrians crossing in front
of us, cars crossing in front of us,

00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:03.790
going every which way,

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.317
the traffic lights, crosswalks.

00:09:05.317 --> 00:09:08.114
It's an incredibly complicated
problem by comparison.

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:10.217
And then once you have
that problem solved,

00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:12.729
the vehicle has to be able
to deal with construction.

00:09:12.729 --> 00:09:15.880
So here are the cones on the left
forcing it to drive to the right,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.282
but not just construction
in isolation, of course.

00:09:18.282 --> 00:09:22.005
It has to deal with other people moving
through that construction zone as well.

00:09:22.005 --> 00:09:25.268
And of course, if anyone's
breaking the rules, the police are there

00:09:25.268 --> 00:09:28.890
and the car has to understand that
that flashing light on the top of the car

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.995
means that it's not just a car,
it's actually a police officer.
