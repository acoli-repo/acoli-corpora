00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:31.085
that you would never expect to see
anywhere other than Mountain View.

00:11:31.085 --> 00:11:33.153
And of course, we have
to deal with drivers,

00:11:33.153 --> 00:11:36.868
even the very small ones.

00:11:36.868 --> 00:11:40.999
Watch to the right as someone
jumps out of this truck at us.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.389
And now, watch the left as the car
with the green box decides

00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:48.714
he needs to make a right turn
at the last possible moment.

00:11:48.714 --> 00:11:51.565
Here, as we make a lane change,
the car to our left decides

00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:55.118
it wants to as well.

00:11:55.118 --> 00:11:57.811
And here, we watch a car
blow through a red light

00:11:57.811 --> 00:11:59.901
and yield to it.

00:11:59.901 --> 00:12:03.755
And similarly, here, a cyclist
blowing through that light as well.
