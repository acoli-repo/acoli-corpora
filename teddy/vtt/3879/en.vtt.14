00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:03.581
And then finally, there's how
the system can handle uncertainty.

00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:06.904
So this pedestrian here might be
stepping into the road, might not be.

00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:10.299
I can't tell,
nor can any of our algorithms,

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.594
but in the case of
a driver assistance system,

00:07:12.594 --> 00:07:15.400
that means it can't take action,
because again,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.739
if it presses the brakes unexpectedly,
that's completely unacceptable.

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:21.872
Whereas a self-driving system
can look at that pedestrian and say,

00:07:21.872 --> 00:07:23.762
I don't know what they're about to do,

00:07:23.762 --> 00:07:27.524
slow down, take a better look,
and then react appropriately after that.

00:07:27.524 --> 00:07:31.226
So it can be much safer than
a driver assistance system can ever be.
