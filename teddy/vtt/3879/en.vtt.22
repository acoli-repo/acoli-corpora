00:10:59.127 --> 00:11:00.358
seen in the world before.

00:11:00.358 --> 00:11:02.099
And so just a couple of months ago,

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:04.334
our vehicles were driving
through Mountain View,

00:11:04.334 --> 00:11:05.978
and this is what we encountered.

00:11:05.978 --> 00:11:08.060
This is a woman in an electric wheelchair

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.677
chasing a duck in circles on the road.
(Laughter)

00:11:10.677 --> 00:11:13.788
Now it turns out, there is nowhere
in the DMV handbook

00:11:13.788 --> 00:11:16.033
that tells you how to deal with that,

00:11:16.033 --> 00:11:18.176
but our vehicles were able
to encounter that,

00:11:18.176 --> 00:11:20.431
slow down, and drive safely.

00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:22.472
Now, we don't have to deal
with just ducks.

00:11:22.472 --> 00:11:26.180
Watch this bird fly across in front of us.
The car reacts to that.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.795
Here we're dealing with a cyclist

00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:31.085
that you would never expect to see
anywhere other than Mountain View.
