00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.673
but then we started to look at what
the people inside the car were doing,

00:04:02.673 --> 00:04:04.252
and this was eye-opening.

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:06.690
Now, my favorite story is this gentleman

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.519
who looks down at his phone
and realizes the battery is low,

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.067
so he turns around like this in the car
and digs around in his backpack,

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:17.220
pulls out his laptop,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.787
puts it on the seat,

00:04:18.787 --> 00:04:20.551
goes in the back again,

00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:23.918
digs around, pulls out
the charging cable for his phone,

00:04:23.918 --> 00:04:27.285
futzes around, puts it into the laptop,
puts it on the phone.

00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:29.328
Sure enough, the phone is charging.

00:04:29.328 --> 00:04:33.322
All the time he's been doing
65 miles per hour down the freeway.
