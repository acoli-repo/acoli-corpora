00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:32.962
We grew by six percent of roads,

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:34.564
so it's not in your brains.

00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:38.840
Traffic really is substantially worse
than it was not very long ago.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.249
And all of this has a very human cost.

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:45.477
So if you take the average commute time
in America, which is about 50 minutes,

00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:49.126
you multiply that by the 120 million
workers we have,

00:01:49.126 --> 00:01:51.351
that turns out to be
about six billion minutes

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:53.377
wasted in commuting every day.

00:01:53.377 --> 00:01:56.204
Now, that's a big number,
so let's put it in perspective.

00:01:56.204 --> 00:01:57.978
You take that six billion minutes

00:01:57.978 --> 00:02:01.762
and you divide it by the average
life expectancy of a person,
