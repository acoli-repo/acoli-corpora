00:12:56.718 --> 00:13:01.010
and we now anticipate that this bike
is going to come all the way across.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.752
Unfortunately the other drivers next to us
were not paying as much attention.

00:13:04.752 --> 00:13:07.909
They started to pull forward,
and fortunately for everyone,

00:13:07.909 --> 00:13:10.920
this cyclists reacts, avoids,

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.111
and makes it through the intersection.

00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:14.679
And off we go.

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:17.627
Now, as you can see, we've made
some pretty exciting progress,

00:13:17.627 --> 00:13:19.529
and at this point we're pretty convinced

00:13:19.529 --> 00:13:21.539
this technology is going
to come to market.

00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:26.322
We do three million miles of testing
in our simulators every single day,

00:13:26.322 --> 00:13:29.011
so you can imagine the experience
that our vehicles have.

00:13:29.011 --> 00:13:31.875
We are looking forward to having
this technology on the road,
