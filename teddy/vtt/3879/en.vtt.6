00:02:57.626 --> 00:03:00.337
And so I'm going to talk to you
about three different ways

00:03:00.337 --> 00:03:03.683
that self-driving systems are different
than driver assistance systems.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.334
And I'm going to start
with some of our own experience.

00:03:06.334 --> 00:03:08.587
So back in 2013,

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:11.250
we had the first test
of a self-driving car

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.277
where we let regular people use it.

00:03:13.277 --> 00:03:15.479
Well, almost regular --
they were 100 Googlers,

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.482
but they weren't working on the project.

00:03:17.482 --> 00:03:21.103
And we gave them the car and we allowed
them to use it in their daily lives.

00:03:21.103 --> 00:03:24.822
But unlike a real self-driving car,
this one had a big asterisk with it:

00:03:24.822 --> 00:03:26.326
They had to pay attention,

00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:28.959
because this was an experimental vehicle.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.484
We tested it a lot,
but it could still fail.
