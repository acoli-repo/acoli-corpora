00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.484
We tested it a lot,
but it could still fail.

00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:34.543
And so we gave them two hours of training,

00:03:34.543 --> 00:03:36.635
we put them in the car,
we let them use it,

00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:38.762
and what we heard back
was something awesome,

00:03:38.762 --> 00:03:41.286

00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:43.211
Every one of them told us they loved it.

What are we thinking?"

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.690
But at the end of it, he said,
"Not only should I have it,

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.865
everyone else should have it,
because people are terrible drivers."

00:03:57.135 --> 00:03:58.870
So this was music to our ears,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.673
but then we started to look at what
the people inside the car were doing,
