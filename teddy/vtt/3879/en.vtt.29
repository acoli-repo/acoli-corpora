00:14:28.744 --> 00:14:30.903
are going the driver-assisted route.

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:36.151
What you're saying is that
that's kind of going to be a dead end

00:14:36.151 --> 00:14:41.607
because you can't just keep improving
that route and get to fully driverless

00:14:41.607 --> 00:14:45.137
at some point, and then a driver
is going to say, "This feels safe,"

00:14:45.137 --> 00:14:47.784
and climb into the back,
and something ugly will happen.

00:14:47.784 --> 00:14:50.460
CU: Right. No, that's exactly right,
and it's not to say

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.997
that the driver assistance systems
aren't going to be incredibly valuable.

00:14:53.997 --> 00:14:56.055
They can save a lot of lives
in the interim,

00:14:56.055 --> 00:14:59.888
but to see the transformative opportunity
to help someone like Steve get around,

00:14:59.888 --> 00:15:01.857
to really get to the end case in safety,
