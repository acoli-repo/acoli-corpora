We are looking forward to having
this technology on the road,

00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:34.765
and we think the right path
is to go through the self-driving

00:13:34.765 --> 00:13:36.609
rather than driver assistance approach

00:13:36.609 --> 00:13:39.230
because the urgency is so large.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.623
In the time I have given this talk today,

00:13:41.623 --> 00:13:44.758
34 people have died on America's roads.

00:13:44.758 --> 00:13:47.126
How soon can we bring it out?

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:50.958
Well, it's hard to say because
it's a really complicated problem,

00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.172
but these are my two boys.

00:13:53.172 --> 00:13:56.795
My oldest son is 11, and that means
in four and a half years,

00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:59.372
he's going to be able
to get his driver's license.

00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:02.576
My team and I are committed
to making sure that doesn't happen.
