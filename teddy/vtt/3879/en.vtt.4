00:01:57.978 --> 00:02:01.762
and you divide it by the average
life expectancy of a person,

00:02:01.762 --> 00:02:04.897
that turns out to be 162 lifetimes

00:02:04.897 --> 00:02:07.822
spent every day, wasted,

00:02:07.822 --> 00:02:09.866
just getting from A to B.

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:11.596
It's unbelievable.

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:14.440
And then, there are those of us
who don't have the privilege

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.112
of sitting in traffic.

00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:17.690
So this is Steve.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.455
He's an incredibly capable guy,

00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:21.971
but he just happens to be blind,

00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:25.188
and that means instead of a 30-minute
drive to work in the morning,

00:02:25.188 --> 00:02:29.167
it's a two-hour ordeal
of piecing together bits of public transit

00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:31.552
or asking friends and family for a ride.
