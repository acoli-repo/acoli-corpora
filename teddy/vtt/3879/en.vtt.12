00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:01.347
where it basically never
gets into a crash.

00:06:01.347 --> 00:06:03.790
They'll happen, but very low frequency.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.251
Now you and I could look at this
and we could argue

00:06:06.251 --> 00:06:09.856
about whether it's incremental, and
I could say something like "80-20 rule,"

00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:12.424
and it's really hard to move up
to that new curve.

00:06:12.424 --> 00:06:15.358
But let's look at it
from a different direction for a moment.

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:18.870
So let's look at how often
the technology has to do the right thing.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.376
And so this green dot up here
is a driver assistance system.

00:06:22.376 --> 00:06:24.861
It turns out that human drivers

00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:27.508
make mistakes that lead
to traffic accidents

00:06:27.508 --> 00:06:30.680
about once every 100,000 miles in America.
