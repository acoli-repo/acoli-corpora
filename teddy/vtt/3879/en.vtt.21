00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.290
of how we expect them
to move through the world.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.253
So here the yellow box is a pedestrian
crossing in front of us.

00:10:34.253 --> 00:10:36.503
Here the blue box is a cyclist
and we anticipate

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:39.815
that they're going to nudge out
and around the car to the right.

00:10:40.115 --> 00:10:42.207
Here there's a cyclist
coming down the road

00:10:42.207 --> 00:10:45.693
and we know they're going to continue
to drive down the shape of the road.

00:10:45.693 --> 00:10:47.560
Here somebody makes a right turn,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.920
and in a moment here, somebody's
going to make a U-turn in front of us,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.534
and we can anticipate that behavior
and respond safely.

00:10:53.534 --> 00:10:56.262
Now, that's all well and good
for things that we've seen,

00:10:56.262 --> 00:10:59.127
but of course, you encounter
lots of things that you haven't

00:10:59.127 --> 00:11:00.358
seen in the world before.
