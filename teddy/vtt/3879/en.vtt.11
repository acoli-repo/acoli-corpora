00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.318
and that's this curve, and it's going
to have some operating properties,

00:05:32.318 --> 00:05:34.808
but it's never going to avoid
all of the accidents,

00:05:34.808 --> 00:05:36.867
because it doesn't have that capability.

00:05:36.867 --> 00:05:39.116
But we'll pick some place
along the curve here,

00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:42.370
and maybe it avoids half of accidents
that the human driver misses,

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.667
and that's amazing, right?

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:46.394
We just reduced accidents on our roads
by a factor of two.

00:05:46.394 --> 00:05:50.381
There are now 17,000 less people
dying every year in America.

00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:52.401
But if we want a self-driving car,

00:05:52.401 --> 00:05:54.708
we need a technology curve
that looks like this.

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:57.307
We're going to have to put
more sensors in the vehicle,

00:05:57.307 --> 00:05:59.328
and we'll pick some
operating point up here

00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:01.347
where it basically never
gets into a crash.
