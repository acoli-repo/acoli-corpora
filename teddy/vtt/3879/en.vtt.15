00:07:27.524 --> 00:07:31.226
So it can be much safer than
a driver assistance system can ever be.

00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:33.956
So that's enough about
the differences between the two.

00:07:33.956 --> 00:07:37.440
Let's spend some time talking about
how the car sees the world.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.692
So this is our vehicle.

00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:41.130
It starts by understanding
where it is in the world,

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.917
by taking a map and its sensor data
and aligning the two,

00:07:43.917 --> 00:07:46.865
and then we layer on top of that
what it sees in the moment.

00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:50.520
So here, all the purple boxes you can see
are other vehicles on the road,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.048
and the red thing on the side
over there is a cyclist,

00:07:53.048 --> 00:07:55.450
and up in the distance,
if you look really closely,

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.244
you can see some cones.

00:07:57.244 --> 00:08:00.017
Then we know where the car
is in the moment,
