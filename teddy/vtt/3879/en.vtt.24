And similarly, here, a cyclist

00:12:03.755 --> 00:12:06.501
And of course,
the vehicle responds safely.

00:12:06.501 --> 00:12:09.102
And of course, we have people
who do I don't know what

sometimes on the road, like this guy
pulling out between two self-driving cars.

00:12:12.925 --> 00:12:14.970
You have to ask, "What are you thinking?"

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.182

00:12:18.703 --> 00:12:21.353
so I'm going to break one of these
down pretty quickly.

00:12:21.353 --> 00:12:24.293
So what we're looking at is the scene
with the cyclist again,

00:12:24.293 --> 00:12:27.784
and you might notice in the bottom,
we can't actually see the cyclist yet,

00:12:27.784 --> 00:12:30.288
but the car can: it's that little
blue box up there,
