00:04:29.328 --> 00:04:33.322
All the time he's been doing
65 miles per hour down the freeway.

00:04:33.322 --> 00:04:35.806
Right? Unbelievable.

00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:38.927
So we thought about this and we said,
it's kind of obvious, right?

00:04:38.927 --> 00:04:41.190
The better the technology gets,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.311
the less reliable
the driver is going to get.

00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:45.707
So by just making the cars
incrementally smarter,

00:04:45.707 --> 00:04:48.609
we're probably not going to see
the wins we really need.

00:04:48.609 --> 00:04:52.510
Let me talk about something
a little technical for a moment here.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.948
So we're looking at this graph,
and along the bottom

00:04:54.948 --> 00:04:57.999
is how often does the car
apply the brakes when it shouldn't.

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.620
You can ignore most of that axis,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.339
because if you're driving around town,
and the car starts stopping randomly,
