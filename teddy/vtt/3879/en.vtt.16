00:07:57.244 --> 00:08:00.017
Then we know where the car
is in the moment,

00:08:00.017 --> 00:08:03.850
but we have to do better than that:
we have to predict what's going to happen.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.338
So here the pickup truck in top right
is about to make a left lane change

00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:09.561
because the road in front of it is closed,

00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:11.292
so it needs to get out of the way.

00:08:11.292 --> 00:08:13.155
Knowing that one pickup truck is great,

00:08:13.155 --> 00:08:15.634
but we really need to know
what everybody's thinking,

00:08:15.634 --> 00:08:18.141
so it becomes quite a complicated problem.

00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:22.890
And then given that, we can figure out
how the car should respond in the moment,

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.756
so what trajectory it should follow, how
quickly it should slow down or speed up.

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:29.821
And then that all turns into
just following a path:

00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:33.018
turning the steering wheel left or right,
pressing the brake or gas.
