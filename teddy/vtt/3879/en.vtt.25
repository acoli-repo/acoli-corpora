00:12:27.784 --> 00:12:30.288
but the car can: it's that little
blue box up there,

00:12:30.288 --> 00:12:32.369
and that comes from the laser data.

00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:34.787
And that's not actually
really easy to understand,

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:38.371
so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to turn that laser data and look at it,

00:12:38.371 --> 00:12:41.400
and if you're really good at looking
at laser data, you can see

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.887
a few dots on the curve there,

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:45.259
right there, and that blue box
is that cyclist.

00:12:45.259 --> 00:12:46.408
Now as our light is red,

00:12:46.408 --> 00:12:48.600
the cyclist's light
has turned yellow already,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.038
and if you squint, you can see that
in the imagery.

00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:54.324
But the cyclist, we see, is going
to proceed through the intersection.

00:12:54.324 --> 00:12:56.718
Our light has now turned green,
his is solidly red,

00:12:56.718 --> 00:13:01.010
and we now anticipate that this bike
is going to come all the way across.
