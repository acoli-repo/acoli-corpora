00:00:29.657 --> 00:00:32.918
Now, today I'm going to talk to you
a little bit about the difference

00:00:32.918 --> 00:00:36.726
between patching around the problem
with driver assistance systems

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:39.290
and actually having fully
self-driving cars

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.170
and what they can do for the world.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.165
I'm also going to talk to you
a little bit about our car

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:48.164
and allow you to see how it sees the world
and how it reacts and what it does,

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:51.351
but first I'm going to talk
a little bit about the problem.

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:53.299
And it's a big problem:

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.388
1.2 million people are killed
on the world's roads every year.

00:00:56.388 --> 00:01:00.172
In America alone, 33,000 people
are killed each year.
