00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:33.018
turning the steering wheel left or right,
pressing the brake or gas.

00:08:33.018 --> 00:08:35.482
It's really just two numbers
at the end of the day.

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:37.723
So how hard can it really be?

00:08:38.433 --> 00:08:40.385
Back when we started in 2009,

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:42.183
this is what our system looked like.

00:08:42.183 --> 00:08:45.574
So you can see our car in the middle
and the other boxes on the road,

00:08:45.574 --> 00:08:46.845
driving down the highway.

00:08:46.845 --> 00:08:50.663
The car needs to understand where it is
and roughly where the other vehicles are.

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:53.092
It's really a geometric
understanding of the world.

00:08:53.092 --> 00:08:56.040
Once we started driving
on neighborhood and city streets,

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.485
the problem becomes a whole
new level of difficulty.

00:08:58.485 --> 00:09:01.979
You see pedestrians crossing in front
of us, cars crossing in front of us,
