What if we had something
whose entire purpose and goal

00:12:32.993 --> 00:12:37.266
was to help create net new positive
contributions to human life?

00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:42.326
And what if we could
value it a different way,

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.848
so it would actually work?

00:12:44.634 --> 00:12:48.565
Imagine you gave this different
premium shelf space on app stores.

00:12:48.589 --> 00:12:50.924
Imagine you had web browsers
that helped route you

00:12:50.948 --> 00:12:53.422
to these kinds of design products.

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:59.973
Can you imagine how exciting it would be
to live and create that world?
