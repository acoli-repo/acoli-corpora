00:03:00.173 --> 00:03:01.983
So what are we going to do?

00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:06.012
Because it leaves us
with this all-or-nothing relationship

00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:07.516
with technology, right?

00:03:08.478 --> 00:03:10.016
You're either on,

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.885
and you're connected
and distracted all the time,

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.759
or you're off,

00:03:14.783 --> 00:03:16.037
but then you're wondering,

00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.686
am I missing something important?

00:03:18.352 --> 00:03:20.606
In other words, you're either distracted

00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:23.504
or you have fear of missing out.

00:03:24.363 --> 00:03:25.520
Right?

00:03:26.822 --> 00:03:30.924
So we need to restore choice.
