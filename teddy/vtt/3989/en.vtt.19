00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:31.953
how many hours did
those two people spend together?

00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:34.112
And then after they spend
that time together,

00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:35.326
they ask both of them:

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.308
How positive was your experience?

00:09:37.332 --> 00:09:40.381
Did you have a good experience
with this person that you met?

00:09:40.952 --> 00:09:44.322
And they subtract
from those positive hours

00:09:44.346 --> 00:09:47.663
the amount of time
people spent on the website,

00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:51.139
because that's a cost to people's lives.

00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:53.426
Why should we value that as success?

00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:55.522
And what you were left with

00:09:55.546 --> 00:10:00.287
is something they refer to as "net
orchestrated conviviality,"
