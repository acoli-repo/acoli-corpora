00:00:01.863 --> 00:00:05.553
What does it mean to spend our time well?

00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:09.982
I spend a lot of my time

00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:13.616
thinking about how to spend my time.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.201
Probably too much --
I probably obsess over it.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.670
My friends think I do.

00:00:18.694 --> 00:00:23.181
But I feel like I kind of have to,
because these days,

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:27.086
it feels like little bits of my time
kind of slip away from me,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.628
and when that happens, it feels like
parts of my life are slipping away.
