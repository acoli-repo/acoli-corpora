Arguably, you have more power
than many people in your organization

00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:35.634
to create the choices
that all of us live by.

00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:37.712
Maybe like in medicine,

00:13:37.736 --> 00:13:39.594
where we have a Hippocratic oath

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:43.740
to recognize the responsibility
and this higher value

00:13:43.764 --> 00:13:45.331
that we have to treat patients.

00:13:45.355 --> 00:13:47.395
What if designers had something like that,

00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:49.251
in terms of this new kind of design?

00:13:50.668 --> 00:13:52.673
And users, for all of us --

00:13:52.697 --> 00:13:56.200
we can demand technology
that works this way.

00:13:57.176 --> 00:13:58.843
Now it may seem hard,

00:13:58.867 --> 00:14:03.264
but McDonald's didn't have salads
until the consumer demand was there.
