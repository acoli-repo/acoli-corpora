And subtracted the amount of time
people spent on the website.

Or imagine dating services,

00:11:11.702 --> 00:11:13.440
like maybe Tinder or something,

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.942
where instead of measuring the number
of swipes left and right people did,

00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:19.050
which is how they measure success today,

00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:25.219
instead measured the deep, romantic,

00:11:26.613 --> 00:11:28.672
Whatever that was for them, by the way.
