Can you imagine a whole world
that worked this way?

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:34.319
Can you imagine a social network that --

00:10:34.343 --> 00:10:35.926
let's say you care about cooking,

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.981
and it measured its success
in terms of cooking nights organized

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:41.970
and the cooking articles
that you were glad you read,

00:10:41.994 --> 00:10:44.971
and subtracted from that the articles
you weren't glad you read

00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:47.558
or the time you spent scrolling
that you didn't like?

00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:51.505
Imagine a professional social network

00:10:51.529 --> 00:10:55.444
that, instead of measuring its success
in terms of connections created

00:10:55.468 --> 00:10:57.057
or messages sent,

00:10:57.081 --> 00:11:01.393
instead measured its success in terms
of the job offers that people got
