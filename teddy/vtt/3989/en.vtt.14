00:07:00.538 --> 00:07:02.297
Well, I'll tell you one story.

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:05.391
A little over a year ago,

00:07:05.415 --> 00:07:08.495
I got to help organize a meeting

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:13.391
between some of technology's leading
designers and Thich Nhat Hanh.

00:07:14.297 --> 00:07:19.134
Thich Nhat Hanh is an international
spokesperson for mindfulness meditation.

00:07:19.158 --> 00:07:20.909
And it was the most amazing meeting.

00:07:20.933 --> 00:07:22.953
You have to imagine -- picture a room --

00:07:22.977 --> 00:07:26.830
on one side of the room,
you have a bunch of tech geeks;

00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:28.350
on the other side of the room,

00:07:28.374 --> 00:07:33.355
you have a bunch of long brown robes,
shaved heads, Buddhist monks.
