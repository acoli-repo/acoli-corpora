00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:03.932
We can create this world today.

00:13:04.978 --> 00:13:07.750
Company leaders, all you have to do --

00:13:07.774 --> 00:13:10.662
only you can prioritize a new metric,

00:13:11.146 --> 00:13:15.549
which is your metric for net positive
contribution to human life.

00:13:15.573 --> 00:13:17.624
And have an honest
conversation about that.

00:13:17.648 --> 00:13:19.809
Maybe you're not
doing so well to start with,

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.524
but let's start that conversation.

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:28.730
Designers, you can redefine success;
you can redefine design.

00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:32.687
Arguably, you have more power
than many people in your organization
