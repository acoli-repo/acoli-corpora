00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.628
and when that happens, it feels like
parts of my life are slipping away.

00:00:33.086 --> 00:00:34.237
Specifically,

00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:37.110
it feels like little bits
of my time get slipped away

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:38.738
to various things like this,

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:40.729
like technology -- I check things.

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:42.804
I'll give you an example.

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:45.577
If this email shows up --

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.286
how many of you have gotten
an email like this, right?

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.608
I've been tagged in a photo.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.487
When this appears,

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:56.922
I can't help but click on it right now.

00:00:56.946 --> 00:00:59.487
Right? Because, like,
what if it's a bad photo?

00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:01.216
So I have to click it right now.
