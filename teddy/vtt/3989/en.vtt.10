00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:02.327
This is crazy.

00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:03.652
So how do we fix this?

00:05:03.676 --> 00:05:06.926
Because Nancy and John are in this
all-or-nothing relationship.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.451
Nancy might want to disconnect,

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:09.828
but then she'd be worried:

00:05:09.852 --> 00:05:11.903
What if I'm missing something important?

00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:14.259
Design can fix this problem.

00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:17.344
Let's say you have
Nancy again on the left,

00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:18.540
John on the right.

00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:21.255
And John remembers,
"I need to send Nancy that document."

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.508
Except this time,

00:05:22.532 --> 00:05:24.469
Nancy can mark that she's focused.

00:05:24.493 --> 00:05:26.461
Let's say she drags a slider and says,

00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:28.408
"I want to be focused for 30 minutes,"

00:05:28.432 --> 00:05:29.867
so -- bam -- she's focused.
