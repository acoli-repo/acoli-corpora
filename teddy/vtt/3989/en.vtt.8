00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.846
Nancy's on the left
and she's working on a document,

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.077
and John's on the right.

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.306
And John suddenly remembers,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.933
"I need to ask Nancy
for that document before I forget."

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.958
So when he sends her that message,

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:14.068
it blows away her attention.

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:18.844
That's what we're doing all the time,
bulldozing each other's attention,

00:04:18.868 --> 00:04:20.282
left and right.

00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:22.072
And there's serious cost to this,

00:04:22.534 --> 00:04:25.165
because every time
we interrupt each other,

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.976
it takes us about 23 minutes, on average,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.840
to refocus our attention.
