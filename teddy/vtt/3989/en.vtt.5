00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:30.138
I'm playing the slot machine to see,

00:02:30.162 --> 00:02:31.354
what am I going to get?

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:33.085
What am I going to get?

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.950
Every time I check my email,

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:36.426
I'm playing the slot machine,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.061
saying, "What am I going to get?"

00:02:38.085 --> 00:02:40.806
Every time I scroll a news feed,

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:43.276
I'm playing the slot machine to see,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.882
what am I going to get next?

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:47.497
And the thing is that,

00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:50.613
again, knowing exactly
how this works -- and I'm a designer,

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.914
I know exactly how
the psychology of this works,

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:54.793
I know exactly what's going on --

00:02:54.817 --> 00:02:57.059
but it doesn't leave me with any choice,

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:59.134
I still just get sucked into it.
