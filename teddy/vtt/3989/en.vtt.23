00:11:31.886 --> 00:11:35.114
But can you imagine a whole world
that worked this way,

00:11:35.138 --> 00:11:37.390
that was helping you spend your time well?

00:11:39.009 --> 00:11:41.038
Now to do this you also need a new system,

00:11:41.062 --> 00:11:42.740
because you're probably thinking,

00:11:42.764 --> 00:11:44.319
today's Internet economy --

00:11:44.343 --> 00:11:45.776
today's economy in general --

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.070
is measured in time spent.

00:11:47.094 --> 00:11:49.141
The more users you have,

00:11:49.165 --> 00:11:50.543
the more usage you have,

00:11:50.567 --> 00:11:51.885
the more time people spend,

00:11:51.909 --> 00:11:53.567
that's how we measure success.

00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:56.351
But we've solved this problem before.

00:11:57.335 --> 00:11:59.901
We solved it with organic,

00:11:59.925 --> 00:12:02.859
when we said we need
to value things a different way.
