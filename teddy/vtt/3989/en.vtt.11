00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:33.391
Now when John wants to message her,

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:35.542
he can get the thought off of his mind --

00:05:35.566 --> 00:05:37.639
because he has a need,
he has this thought,

00:05:37.663 --> 00:05:40.090
and he needs to dump it out
before he forgets.

00:05:40.744 --> 00:05:42.266
Except this time,

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.594
it holds the messages
so that Nancy can still focus,

00:05:46.618 --> 00:05:49.161
but John can get the thought
off of his mind.

00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:54.074
But this only works
if one last thing is true,

00:05:54.098 --> 00:05:58.584
which is that Nancy needs to know
that if something is truly important,

00:05:59.564 --> 00:06:01.242
John can still interrupt.
