00:07:57.606 --> 00:08:01.969
meaning, you might highlight a word
that might be accidentally abrasive --

00:08:01.993 --> 00:08:03.907
perceived as abrasive by someone else.

00:08:04.844 --> 00:08:08.815
So does this kind of conversation
happen in the real world,

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:10.961
not just in these design meetings?

00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:13.092
Well, the answer is yes,

00:08:13.116 --> 00:08:15.413
and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.866
If you didn't know,
Couchsurfing is a website

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.775
that matches people
who are looking for a place to stay

00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:25.670
with a free couch, from someone
who's trying to offer it.

00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:27.728
So, great service --

00:08:27.752 --> 00:08:29.416
what would their design goal be?

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.187
What are you designing
for if you work at Couchsurfing?
