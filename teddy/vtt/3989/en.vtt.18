00:08:59.343 --> 00:09:01.926
And the most amazing thing
about this was in 2007,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.591
they introduced a way to measure this,

00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:06.066
which is incredible.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.397
I'll tell you how it works.

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:08.968
For every design goal you have,

00:09:08.992 --> 00:09:11.060
you have to have
a corresponding measurement

00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:12.633
to know how you're doing --

00:09:12.657 --> 00:09:13.992
a way of measuring success.

00:09:14.016 --> 00:09:15.312
So what they do is,

00:09:15.336 --> 00:09:17.779
let's say you take two people who meet up,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.765
and they take the number of days
those two people spent together,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.480
and then they estimate how many
hours were in those days --

00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:31.953
how many hours did
those two people spend together?
