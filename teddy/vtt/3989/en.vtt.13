00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.253
"Let's design it so it's easy
to send a message" --

00:06:33.277 --> 00:06:34.707
that's the goal of chat,

00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:37.426
it should be really easy to send
a message to someone --

00:06:37.808 --> 00:06:40.888
we change the goal to something
deeper and a human value,

00:06:40.912 --> 00:06:45.116
which is: "Let's create the highest
possible quality communication

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.623
in a relationship between two people.

00:06:48.162 --> 00:06:50.027
So we upgraded the goal.

00:06:51.832 --> 00:06:54.643
Now, do designers
actually care about this?

00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:59.696
Do we want to have conversations
about what these deeper human goals are?
