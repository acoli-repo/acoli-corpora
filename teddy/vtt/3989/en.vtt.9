00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.840
to refocus our attention.

00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:35.212
We actually cycle through
two different projects

00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:37.945
before we come back
to the original thing we were doing.

00:04:38.806 --> 00:04:43.147
This is Gloria Mark's research
combined with Microsoft research,

00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:44.529
that showed this.

00:04:44.553 --> 00:04:48.508
And her research also shows
that it actually trains bad habits.

00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:50.977
The more interruptions we get externally,

00:04:51.482 --> 00:04:55.762
it's conditioning and training us
to interrupt ourselves.

00:04:56.303 --> 00:04:59.883
We actually self-interrupt
every three-and-a-half minutes.
