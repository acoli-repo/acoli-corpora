00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.036
Second, the practice of patent-holding companies have changed.

00:05:00.036 --> 00:05:04.420
Here you see the patent practices

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.509
before the World Trade Organization's rules, before '95,

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.894
before antiretroviral drugs.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.594
This is what you see today,

00:05:13.594 --> 00:05:16.282
and this is in developing countries, so what that means is,

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.705
unless we do something deliberate

00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:21.088
and unless we do something now,

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:26.204
we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis,

00:05:26.204 --> 00:05:28.424
because new drugs are developed,

00:05:28.424 --> 00:05:31.786
new drugs go to market, but these medicines are patented
