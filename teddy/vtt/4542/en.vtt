to discuss the early development of the airplane.

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:14.486
The Wright Brothers, in the beginning of the last century,

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:16.188
had for the first time managed

00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:18.760
to make one of those devices fly.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.023
They also had taken out numerous patents

00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:23.999
on essential parts of the airplane.

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.440
They were not the only ones.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.024

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:31.316
and those who held patents on airplanes
