00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.089
So what's the problem?

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:31.955
Well, things have changed.

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:35.783
First of all, the rules have changed.

00:04:35.783 --> 00:04:41.714
Today, all countries are obliged to provide

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:46.236
patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years.

00:04:46.236 --> 00:04:49.172
This is as a result of the intellectual property rules

00:04:49.172 --> 00:04:51.520
of the World Trade Organization.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.699
So what India did is no longer possible.

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.036
Second, the practice of patent-holding companies have changed.
