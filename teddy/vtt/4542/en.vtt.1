00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:31.316
and those who held patents on airplanes

00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:32.472
were defending them fiercely

00:00:32.472 --> 00:00:35.894
and suing competitors left and right.

00:00:35.894 --> 00:00:40.811
This actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry,

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:44.117
and this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government

00:00:44.117 --> 00:00:46.674
was interested in ramping up

00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:49.363
the production of military airplanes.

00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:52.074
So there was a bit of a conflict there.

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:55.313
The U.S. government decided to take action,

00:00:55.313 --> 00:00:57.645
and forced those patent holders

00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:01.806
to make their patents available to share with others
