00:05:28.424 --> 00:05:31.786
new drugs go to market, but these medicines are patented

00:05:31.786 --> 00:05:34.855
in a much wider range of countries.

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:39.492
So unless we act, unless we do something today,

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:43.424
we will soon be faced [with] what some have termed

00:05:43.424 --> 00:05:46.468
the treatment time bomb.

00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:51.327
It isn't only the number of drugs that are patented.

00:05:51.327 --> 00:05:54.110
There's something else that can really scare

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.951
generic manufacturers away.

00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:59.952
This shows you a patent landscape.

00:05:59.952 --> 00:06:03.636
This is the landscape of one medicine.
