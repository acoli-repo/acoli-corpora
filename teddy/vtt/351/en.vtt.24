So, the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
is to provide places for people to experience

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
who you are.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
For people to experience who you are.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Right, it's not advertising does it.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
That's why you have companies like Starbucks,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
right, that doesn't advertise at all.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
They said, you want to know who we are, you have to come experience us.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And think about the economic value they have provided

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
by that experience.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Right? Coffee, at its core, is what?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Right? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.
