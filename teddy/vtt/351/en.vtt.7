which is: I point out that first of all,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you have to understand that there is no such thing

And there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
