00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
you can't help but turn it into a memorable event --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
you can't help but turn it into an experience.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So we're shifting to an experience economy,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now most places that I talk to,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
when I talk about experience, I talk about Disney --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the world's premier experience-stager.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I talk about theme restaurants, and experiential retail,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and boutique hotels, and Las Vegas --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the experience capital of the world.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But here, when you think about experiences,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
think about Thomas Dolby and his group, playing music.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Think about meaningful places.
