00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Long-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price;

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing;

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
but services as well.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
What that means is that it's time

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to move to a new level of economic value.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Time to go beyond the goods and the services,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and use, in that same heuristic, what happens when you customize a service?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that's exactly what they need at this moment in time?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Then you can't help but make them go "wow";

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
you can't help but turn it into a memorable event --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
you can't help but turn it into an experience.
