00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in the very fabric of the modern economy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
because in the beginning were commodities.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Commodities are things that you grow in the ground, raise on the ground or pull out of the ground:

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
basically, animal, mineral, vegetable.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then you extract them out of the ground,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and sell them on the open marketplace.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that lasted for millennia.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But then along came the industrial revolution,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then goods became the predominant economic offering,
