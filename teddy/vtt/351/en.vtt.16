"is not true to itself," and "is not what it says it is,"

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
yielding a two-by-two matrix.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And of course, if you are both true to yourself,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and are what you say you are, then you're real real!

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
(Laughter)

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
The opposite, of course, is -- fake fake.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
All right, now, there is value for fake.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
There will always be companies around to supply the fake,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
because there will always be desire for the fake.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Fact is, there's a general rule: if you don't like it, it's fake;

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
if you do like it, it's faux.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
(Laughter)
