00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Is it --

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
you can see behind all of it,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and see what is going on in the facades of it.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So she calls it a real fake.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Disney World, on the other hand, is a fake real,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
or a fake reality.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Right? It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
(Laughter)

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
But it is -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
(Laughter)

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
-- sorry.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We won't talk about Santa Claus then.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
(Laughter)

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself.
