00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
particularly coming from the Dutch,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
is that the Netherlands

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
(Laughter)

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And the Dutch, they always go ...

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and they realize, I'm right!

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
There isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that hasn't been reclaimed from the sea,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
or otherwise moved, modified and manicured

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
to look as if it had always been there.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
(Laughter)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But nonetheless, not just the Dutch,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
but everyone has this desire for the authentic.
