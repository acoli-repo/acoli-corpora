00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
With the industrial economy, it is about controlling costs --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
getting the costs down as low as possible

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
so we can offer them to the masses.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
With the service economy, it is about

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
improving quality.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
That has -- the whole quality movement has risen

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And now, with the experience economy,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
it's about rendering authenticity.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is "rendering."

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Right? Rendering, because you have to get your consumers --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
as business people --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to percieve your offerings as authentic.
