00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Think about meaningful places.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Think about drinking wine,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Those are all experiences. Think about TED itself.

The experience capital in the world of conferences.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000

and particularly in the Netherlands,

and whenever I talk about the experience economy there,

I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
almost invariably.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And the question isn't really so much a question
