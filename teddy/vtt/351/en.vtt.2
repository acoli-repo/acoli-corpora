Now, there's an antidote to commoditization,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and that is customization.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
My first book was called "Mass Customization" --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
it came up a couple of times yesterday --

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and how I discovered this progression of economic value

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
was realizing that customizing a good

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
automatically turned it into a service,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
because it was done just for a particular person,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
because it wasn't inventoried,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it was delivered on demand to that individual person.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So, we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But over the past 10 or 20 years, what's happened is that

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
services are being commoditized as well.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Long-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price;

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing;
