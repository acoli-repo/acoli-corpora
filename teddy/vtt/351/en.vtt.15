00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And I don't know about you, but whenever I encounter two dimensions,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I immediately go, ahh, two-by-two!

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
All right? Anybody else like that, no?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Well, if you think about that, you do, in fact, get

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
a two-by-two.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Where, on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
As businesses, are the economic offerings you are providing --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
are they true to themselves?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And the other dimension is:

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
are they what they say they are to others?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
If not, you have,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
"is not true to itself," and "is not what it says it is,"
