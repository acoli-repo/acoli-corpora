00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then goods became the predominant economic offering,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
where we used commodities as a raw material

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to be able to make or manufacture goods.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So, we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Well, what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is that goods have become commoditized.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Commoditized: where they're treated like a commodity,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
where people don't care who makes them.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
They just care about three things and three things only:

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
price, price and price.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, there's an antidote to commoditization,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and that is customization.
