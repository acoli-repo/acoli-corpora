00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Now, the other two sides of the coin are:

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
being a real fake --

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
is what it says it is,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
but is not true to itself,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
or being a fake real:

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
is true to itself, but not what it says it is.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
You can think about those two -- you know, both of these

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
better than being fake fake -- not quite as good as being real real.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
You can contrast them by thinking about

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Universal City Walk versus

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Disney World, or Disneyland.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Universal City Walk is a real fake --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
in fact, we got this very term
