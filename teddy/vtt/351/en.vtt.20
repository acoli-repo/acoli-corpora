00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Right? Just wonderfully true to itself.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
When you are there you are just immersed

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
in this wonderful environment.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So, it's a fake real.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Now the easiest way

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
to fall down in this,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and not be real real,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
right, the easiest way not to be true to yourself

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
is not to understand your heritage,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and thereby repudiate that heritage.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Right, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Knowing where your heritage is: what you have done in the past.
