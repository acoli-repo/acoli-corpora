00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.176
I got few if any comments
about my hair and pantsuit.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.776
(Applause)

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.000
So kudos to them.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.096
But there is another experience
that's very important.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.376
I ran as an independent candidate,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.696
not with any political party
or muscle behind me.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.056
That lack of experience

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.336
and lack of access to resources

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.376
probably came at a cost to our campaign,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:02.016
but it also allowed us to innovate
and do politics differently.
