00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.216
my first reaction was,
"Who am I to run for president?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.600
Who am I to be president?"

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.015
It turns out that women

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.600
are less likely
to consider running than men.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.976
So a study done in the US in 2011

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.240
showed that 62 percent of men
had considered running for office,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.096
but 45 percent of women.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.496
That's gap of 16 percentage points,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.000
and it's the same gap
that existed a decade earlier.
