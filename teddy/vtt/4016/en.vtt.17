WEBVTT

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.720
where I took questions from voters
on anything and responded on the spot.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.856
And we put all the questions I got
and all the answers on an open Facebook

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.936
because we thought
transparency is important

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.480
if you want to establish trust.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.256
And when reaching young voters
proved to be challenging,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.280
I became a Snapchatter.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.536
I got young people
to teach me how to do that,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.816
and I used every filter on Snapchat
during the last part of the campaign.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.056
And I actually had to use a lot of humor
and humility, as I was very bad at it.
