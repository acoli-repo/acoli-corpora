The foremost challenges I had to face
and overcome on this journey

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.896
had to do with media, muscle and money.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.736
Let's start with media.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.136
There are those who say
gender doesn't matter

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.896
when it comes to media and politics.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.560
I can't say that I agree.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.040
It proved harder for me
to both get access and airtime in media.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.136
As a matter of fact, the leading candidate
appeared in broadcast media

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.256
87 times in the months
leading up to the elections,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.400
whereas I appeared 31 times.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.856
And I am not saying
media is doing this consciously.
