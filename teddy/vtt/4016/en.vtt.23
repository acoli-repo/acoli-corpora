00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.136
Audience: Aw!

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.640
This picture was really
enough of a win for me.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.560
What we see, we can be.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.336
So screw fear and challenges.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.736

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.976
and it's time for women to run for office,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.920
be it the office of the CEO
or the office of the president.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.240
I also managed to put an impression
on your very own "New Yorker."
