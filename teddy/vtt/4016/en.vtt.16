00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.280
We ran a positive campaign,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.880
and we probably changed the tone
of the election for others by doing that.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.176
It may be the reason
why I had less airtime on TV,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.280
because I wanted to show
other contenders respect.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.616
When access to media
proved to be so difficult,

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.696
we ran our own media.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.576
I ran live Facebook sessions

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.720
where I took questions from voters
on anything and responded on the spot.
