00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.680
it was not looking too good for me.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.056
I did not even make the graph
in the newspaper.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.056
The polls had me at 1 percent,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.536
but that was still the highest

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.600
that any woman announcing
her candidacy had earned.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.176
So it would be an understatement
to say that I had to work extremely hard

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.496
to get my seat at the table

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.976
and access to television,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.416
because the network decided
that they would only include

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.856
those with 2.5 percent
or more in the polls
