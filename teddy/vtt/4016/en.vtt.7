00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.576
The journey started with potentially
as many as 20 candidates.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.016
It boiled down to
nine candidates qualifying,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.280
and ultimately the race
came down to four of us,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.016
three men and me.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.720
(Applause)

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.456
But that's not all the drama yet.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.736
You may think you have drama in the US,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.976
but I can --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.440
(Laughter)

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.056
I can assure you
we had our own drama in Iceland.
