00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.856
And I am not saying
media is doing this consciously.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.776
I think largely this has to do
with unconscious bias,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.600
because in media,
much like everywhere else,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.096
we have both conscious
and unconscious bias,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.576
and we need to have the courage
to talk about it if we want to change it.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.736
When I finally got access to TV,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.920
the first question I got was,
"Are you going to quit?"

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.336
And that was a hard one.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.216
But of course, with 1 percent
to 2.5 percent in the polls,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.520
maybe it's understandable.
