00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.520
maybe it's understandable.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.856
But media really matters,
and every time I appeared on TV,

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.096
we saw and experienced
a rise in the polls,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.736
so I know firsthand how much this matters

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.056
and why we have to talk about it.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.496
I was the only one
out of the final four candidates

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.816
that never got a front page interview.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.936
I was sometimes left out of the questions
asked of all other candidates

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.080
and out of coverage about the elections.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.976
So I did face this,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.456
but I will say this
to compliment the Icelandic media.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.176
I got few if any comments
about my hair and pantsuit.
