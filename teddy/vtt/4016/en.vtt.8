00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.056
I can assure you
we had our own drama in Iceland.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.016
So our sitting president of 20 years

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.696
announced initially
that he was not going to run,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.296
which is probably what gave rise

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.720
to so many candidates considering running.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.096
Then later he changed his mind

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.656
when our prime minister resigned

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.935
following the infamous Panama Papers

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.856
that implicated him and his family.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.936
And there was a popular
protest in Iceland,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.240
so the sitting president thought
they needed a trusted leader.
