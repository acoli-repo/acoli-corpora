00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.375
90 percent of women participated --

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.176
and peacefully and in solidarity

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.040
asked for equality.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.080
Nothing worked in Iceland that day,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.736
because nothing works
when women are not at work.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.040
(Applause)

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.336
Five years later,
Icelanders had the courage

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.496
to be the first country in the world

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.936
to democratically elect a woman
as their president.
