00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.280
So the first numbers,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.816
I came in neck to neck
to the leading candidate.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.240
(Cheers)

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.656
Well, too early,
because I didn't quite pull that,

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.176
but I came in second,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.376
and we went a long way
from the one percent,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.376
with nearly a third of the vote,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.416
and we beat the polls
by an unprecedented margin,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.320
or 10 percentage points
above what the last poll came in at.
