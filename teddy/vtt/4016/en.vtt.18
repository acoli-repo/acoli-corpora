00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.056
And I actually had to use a lot of humor
and humility, as I was very bad at it.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.096
But we grew the following
amongst young people by doing that.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.296
So it's possible to run
a different type of campaign.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.400
But unfortunately, one cannot talk
about politics without mentioning money.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.816
I am sad that it is that way,
but it's true,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.920
and we had less financial resources
than the other candidates.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.896
This probably was partly due to the fact

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.016
that I think I had a harder time
asking for financial support.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.416
And maybe I also had the ambition
to do more with less.
