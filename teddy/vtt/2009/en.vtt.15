00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:32.682
So, ironically, I took
a flight back to China

00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:35.728
and headed toward the North Korean border.

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:39.521
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese,

00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:44.394
I had to guide them somehow
through more than 2,000 miles

00:07:44.418 --> 00:07:47.965
in China, and then into Southeast Asia.

00:07:48.743 --> 00:07:50.837
The journey by bus took one week,

00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:53.582
and we were almost caught several times.

00:07:54.201 --> 00:08:00.336
One time, our bus was stopped
and boarded by a Chinese police officer.
