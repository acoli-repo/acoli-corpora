00:05:57.964 --> 00:06:00.922
And I started a new life yet again.

00:06:00.946 --> 00:06:02.534
Settling down in South Korea

00:06:02.558 --> 00:06:05.569
was a lot more challenging
than I had expected.

00:06:06.331 --> 00:06:09.664
English was so important in South Korea,

00:06:09.688 --> 00:06:12.251
so I had to start learning
my third language.

00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:17.997
Also, I realized there was a wide gap
between North and South.

00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:20.174
We are all Korean, but inside,

00:06:20.198 --> 00:06:24.923
we have become very different,
due to 67 years of division.

00:06:25.931 --> 00:06:28.911
I even went through an identity crisis.

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.308
Am I South Korean or North Korean?
