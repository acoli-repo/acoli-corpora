Soon after, when I was walking
past a train station,

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:35.206
I saw something terrible that to this day
I can't erase from my memory.

00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:39.377
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground,

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:42.566
while an emaciated child in her arms

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.825
just stared helplessly
at his mother's face.

00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:49.398
But nobody helped them,

00:01:49.422 --> 00:01:54.363
because they were so focused on taking
care of themselves and their families.

00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:59.616
A huge famine hit North Korea
in the mid-1990s.
