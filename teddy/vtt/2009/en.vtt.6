00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:07.103
I can't reveal many details
about how I left North Korea,

00:03:07.127 --> 00:03:11.265
but I only can say that
during the ugly years of the famine,

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:15.863
I was sent to China to live
with distant relatives.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.983
But I only thought that I would
be separated from my family

00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:22.575
for a short time.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.515
I could have never imagined

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.784
that it would take 14 years
to live together.

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:33.062
In China, it was hard living
as a young girl without my family.
