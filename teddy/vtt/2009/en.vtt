When I was little, I thought my country
was the best on the planet.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.111
And I grew up singing a song
called "Nothing To Envy."

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:10.682
And I was very proud.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.605
In school, we spent a lot of time
studying the history of Kim Il-Sung,

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.704
but we never learned much
about the outside world,

00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:22.925
except that America, South Korea,
Japan are the enemies.

00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:27.195
Although I often wondered
about the outside world,

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:30.859
I thought I would spend
my entire life in North Korea,
