00:10:27.892 --> 00:10:31.751
are truly the rays of hope
we North Korean people need.

00:10:33.077 --> 00:10:35.284
Eventually, after our long journey,

00:10:35.308 --> 00:10:38.482
my family and I were reunited
in South Korea.

00:10:39.045 --> 00:10:41.990
But getting to freedom
is only half the battle.

00:10:42.577 --> 00:10:46.053
Many North Koreans
are separated from their families,

00:10:46.077 --> 00:10:48.637
and when they arrive in a new country,

00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:51.172
they start with little or no money.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.482
So we can benefit
from the international community

00:10:55.506 --> 00:11:00.298
for education, English language training,
job training, and more.
