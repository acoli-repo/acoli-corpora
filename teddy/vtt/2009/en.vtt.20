00:09:59.192 --> 00:10:02.525
I thanked him with all my heart,
and I asked him,

00:10:02.549 --> 00:10:04.225
"Why are you helping me?"

00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:06.686
"I'm not helping you," he said.

00:10:07.384 --> 00:10:09.479
"I'm helping the North Korean people."

00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:14.157
I realized that this
was a symbolic moment in my life.

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:20.039
The kind stranger symbolized new hope
for me and the North Korean people,

00:10:20.063 --> 00:10:21.531
when we needed it most.

00:10:22.014 --> 00:10:24.864
And he showed me
that the kindness of strangers

00:10:24.888 --> 00:10:27.868
and the support
of the international community

00:10:27.892 --> 00:10:31.751
are truly the rays of hope
we North Korean people need.
