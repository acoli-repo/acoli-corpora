00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:33.976
This is a satellite picture
showing North Korea at night,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.521
compared to neighbors.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:39.355
This is the Amnok River,

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.833
which serves as a part of the border
between North Korea and China.

00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:48.549
As you can see, the river can be
very narrow at certain points,

00:02:48.573 --> 00:02:51.444
allowing North Koreans to secretly cross.

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:54.412
But many die.

00:02:54.714 --> 00:02:59.204
Sometimes, I saw dead bodies
floating down the river.
