I remember running into her patients
with her at the grocery store

00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:32.337
or on the sidewalk,

00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:35.201
and sometimes they would come
and pay her right on the spot

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:36.583
for previous appointments.

00:00:36.607 --> 00:00:37.846
She would thank them,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.591
and ask them about their families
and their health.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.718
She gave them credit
because she trusted them.

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.489
Most of us are like my mom.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.762
We would give credit to someone we know

00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:52.182
or that we live next to.

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:55.910
But most of us are probably not
going to lend to a stranger

00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:59.000
unless we know a little
something about them.

00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:03.337
Banks, credit card companies
and other financial institutions
