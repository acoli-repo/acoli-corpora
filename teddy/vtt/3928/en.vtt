How much do you need
to know about a person

00:00:02.862 --> 00:00:05.396
before you'd feel comfortable
making a loan?

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:08.499
Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars

00:00:08.523 --> 00:00:10.837
to the person sitting two rows behind you.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.322
What would you need to know
about that person

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.267
before you'd feel comfortable?

00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:19.215
My mom came to the US from India
in her late thirties.

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:21.046
She's a doctor in Brooklyn,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.293
and she often lets friends and neighbors
come to see her for health services,

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:27.546
whether they can pay right away or not.

00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:31.162
I remember running into her patients
with her at the grocery store
