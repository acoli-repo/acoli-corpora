00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:30.722
But ...

00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:35.113
there are 2.5 billion people
around the world

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:37.223
that don't have a credit score.

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:40.271
That's a third of the world's population.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.185
They don't have a score

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:45.470
because there are no formal
public records on them --

00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:46.858
no bank accounts,

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:48.376
no credit histories

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.458
and no social security numbers.

00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:52.201
And because they don't have a score,

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:56.876
they don't have access
to the credit or financial products

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.746
that can improve their lives.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.571
They are not trusted.
