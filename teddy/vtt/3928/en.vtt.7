If Jenipher wants credit,
her options are limited.

00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:35.111
She could get a microloan,

00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:38.979
but she'd have to form a group
that could help vouch for her credibility.

00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:41.975
And even then, the loan sizes
would be way too small

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.256
to really have an impact on her business,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.568
averaging around 150 dollars.

00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:50.043
Loan sharks are always an option,

00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:54.017
but with interest rates
that are well above 300 percent,

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:55.595
they're financially risky.

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.064
And because Jenipher doesn't have
collateral or a credit history,
