Banks, credit card companies
and other financial institutions

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.621
don't know us on a personal level,

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:08.524
but they do have a way of trusting us,

00:01:08.548 --> 00:01:11.009
and that's through our credit scores.

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:13.028
Our credit scores have been created

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:17.572
through an aggregation and analysis
of our public consumer credit data.

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:20.837
And because of them, we have
pretty much easy access

00:01:20.861 --> 00:01:23.305
to all of the goods
and services that we need,

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.173
from getting electricity to buying a home,

00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:28.654
or taking a risk and starting a business.

00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:30.722
