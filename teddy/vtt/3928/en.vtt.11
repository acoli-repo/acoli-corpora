00:05:26.704 --> 00:05:31.384
that people who communicate
with more than 58 different contacts

00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:34.309
tend to be more likely
to be good borrowers.

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:35.602
In Jenipher's case,

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:39.669
she communicated
with 89 different individuals,

00:05:39.693 --> 00:05:42.944
which showed a nine percent
increase in her repayment.

00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:47.655
These are just some of the thousands
of different data points

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:50.912
that we look at to understand
a person's creditworthiness.

00:05:51.397 --> 00:05:54.470
And after analyzing all
of these different data points,

00:05:54.494 --> 00:05:56.466
we took the first risk

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.533
and gave Jenipher a loan.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.696
This is data that would not
be found on a paper trail
