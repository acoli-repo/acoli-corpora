"There were a lot of people there
from JFK hospital:

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.640
my family, my elder brother,
my wife was there.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.216
A lot of other doctors were there, too,
and members of the media were there.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.496
And I felt like Nelson Mandela,
it felt like the 'Long Walk to Freedom,'

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.736
and I walked and raised
my hands to the heaven,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.400
thanking God for saving my life."

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.840
And Philip said,
"Then I saw something else.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.976
There were a lot of crying people,
people happy to see me.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.160
But when I got close to anybody,
they backed away."
