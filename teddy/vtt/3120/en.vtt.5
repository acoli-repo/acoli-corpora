00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.200
And so did several other
brave health care professionals.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.376
But we would pay a heavy price.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.336
Many persons and health professionals
had become high-risk contacts.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.920
This actually meant 21 days counting
to potentially disease or death.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.296
Our health systems were fragile,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.640
our health workers
lacked skills and training.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.936
So in the weeks and months that followed,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.336
health workers were disproportionately
affected by the Ebola virus disease.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.216
More than 400 nurses, doctors and other
health professionals became infected.
