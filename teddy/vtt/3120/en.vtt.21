her life has never been the same.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.240
She became blind as the result of Ebola.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.416
In 2014, the baby of a dear friend of mine
was only two months old,

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.776
when both parents and child were admitted
in an Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.360
Luckily, they survived.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.056
My friend's baby
is almost three years old now,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.296
but cannot stand,
cannot walk, cannot speak.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.800
He has failure to thrive.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.960
There are many more hidden experiences
and many stories are yet untold.
