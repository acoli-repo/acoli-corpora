00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.216
We kept a close watch on her,
we tried to help her.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.896
We were treating her for malaria,
typhoid and gastroenteritis.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.720
We didn't know it,
but by then it was too late.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.056
The next morning I walked in
to check on my patient.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.240
I could tell by the look in her eyes
that she was filled with fear.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.400
I gave her reassurance,
but shortly after ...

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.040
she died of Ebola.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.176
For me, her death was very personal.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.800
But this was just the beginning.
