00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.536
imagine what it was for someone
who actually had symptoms,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.480
someone who had Ebola.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.896
We learned that to treat
Ebola successfully,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.840
we had to suspend
some of the normal rules of society.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.176
Our president declared
a state of emergency in August

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.840
and suspended certain rights.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.240
And the national police even supported
our work during the Ebola response.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.336
In February 2015,
gang members came in for isolation

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.240
in our Ebola isolation unit.
