00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.296
June 13, 2014

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.696
started as a routine Friday

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.000
in Redemption Hospital in Monrovia,
the capital of Liberia.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.480
Redemption is the largest
free public health hospital in the city.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.560
We are called upon to serve
hundreds of thousands of people.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.280
In the best of times
it puts strain on our resources.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.896
Monthly supplies run out within weeks,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.480
and patients without beds
would be seated in chairs.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.776
That summer, we had a nurse
who had been sick for a while.
