That summer, we had a nurse
who had been sick for a while.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.120
Sick enough to be admitted
in our hospital.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.136
But our treatment
didn't seem to be helping her;

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.736
her symptoms were getting worse:

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.680
diarrhea, severe abdominal pain,
fever and weakness.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.576
On that particular Friday,
she developed severe respiratory distress,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.360
and her eyes were menacingly red.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.696
One of my fellow doctors,
a general surgeon,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.456
became suspicious of her condition.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.440
He said her symptoms
were suggestive of Ebola.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.216
We kept a close watch on her,
we tried to help her.
