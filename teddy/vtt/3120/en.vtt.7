00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.976
pulled out of Liberia,
out of Sierra Leone and Guinea

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.200
due to Ebola.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.016
In August, six weeks after the nurse died,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.096
hundreds of people were dying
of the disease each week.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.720
People were dying in the streets.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.176
Over the months that followed,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.976
West Africa would lose thousands of people
to Ebola virus disease.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.216
In August, I joined a team
to set up the Ebola treatment unit

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.776
at JFK hospital in Monrovia.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.840
I was charged with running the second
Ebola treatment unit in the city.
