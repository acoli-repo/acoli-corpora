00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.400
I was not trained for this.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.696
I had just graduated
from medical school two years before.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.656
At this time,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.776
my total knowledge about Ebola
came from a one-page article

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.440
I had read in medical school.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.336
I perceived the disease as so dangerous,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.256
this one page in essence had convinced me
to run out of the hospital, too,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.200
the moment I heard of a case of Ebola.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.696
But when it finally happened,
I stayed on and decided to help.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.200
And so did several other
brave health care professionals.
