00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.240
in our Ebola isolation unit.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.896
They were also know
as the VIP Boys of Monrovia,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.296
terrifying small-time drug addicts

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.176
whose presence could instill
a tremendous amount of fear,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.880
although they could not
legally carry guns.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.856
They underwent quarantine for 21 days
in our unit and were not arrested.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.760
We told the police,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.800
"If you arrest them here,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.800
they will stop coming,
they won't get treated.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.520
And the Ebola virus
will continue to spread."
