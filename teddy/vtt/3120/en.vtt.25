My best memories of the outbreak

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.656
center on those many people
who survived the disease,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.016
but I cannot forget the hard-working
nurses, doctors, volunteers and staff

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.616
who risked their own safety
in service of humanity.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.920
And some even losing
their lives in the process.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.336
During the worst of the contagion,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.336
one thing kept us making those perilous
daily journeys into the Ebola wards.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.000
We had a passion to save lives.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.616
Was I afraid during the Ebola outbreak?
