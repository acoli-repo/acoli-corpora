00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.120
No bed available for one more patient.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.216
This is neither national policy
nor officially condoned,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.840
but many people are still afraid
of the sporadic resurgence of Ebola virus.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.400
The results can be tragic.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.776
I have seen Beatrice, an Ebola
survivor, several times now.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.280
She's 26 years old.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.760
Many of her family members
became infected, she luckily survived.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.736
But since that day in 2014
she was discharged

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.096
to cheering health workers,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.936
her life has never been the same.
