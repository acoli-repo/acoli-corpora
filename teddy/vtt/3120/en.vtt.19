00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:31.456
In theory, Liberia's public
health services are free of charge.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.896
In practice, our health system
lacks the funding and capacity

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.840
to expand care
to all at the point of need.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.296
Many survivors have waited
many months to undergo surgery

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.120
to heal their blinding cataracts.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.856
Few had to relive
the traumatic experience,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.416
when their blood was retested for Ebola
at the point of admission.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.656
Some survivors experienced
delayed or deferred admission

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.280
due to limited bed capacity.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.120
No bed available for one more patient.
