In the summer of 1997,

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:20.611
NASA's Pathfinder spacecraft landed 
on the surface of Mars,

00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:25.241
and began transmitting incredible,
iconic images back to Earth.

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.480
But several days in, 
something went terribly wrong.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.662
The transmissions stopped.
