00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.741
WRTC invited Ross and I
to a grief retreat,

00:04:00.765 --> 00:04:03.518
and we met about
15 other grieving families

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:06.169
who had donated their loved one's
organs for transplant.

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:09.895
Some of them had even received letters

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.888
from the people who received
their loved one's organs,

00:04:12.912 --> 00:04:14.077
saying thank you.

00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:17.227
I learned that they
could even meet each other

00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:18.689
if they'd both sign a waiver,

00:04:18.713 --> 00:04:20.109
almost like an open adoption.

00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:23.746
And I was so excited,
I thought maybe I could write a letter

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.379
or I could get a letter
and learn about what happened.

00:04:26.403 --> 00:04:27.942
But I was disappointed to learn

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:31.136
that this process only exists
for people who donate for transplant.
