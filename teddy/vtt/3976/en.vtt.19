And he has a job at Cytonet,

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:33.844
and he has colleagues and he has coworkers

00:09:33.868 --> 00:09:35.629
who are in the top of their fields.

00:09:35.653 --> 00:09:38.224
And they need him
in order to do their job.

00:09:39.137 --> 00:09:43.788
And a life that once seemed
brief and insignificant

00:09:43.812 --> 00:09:49.494
revealed itself to be vital,
everlasting and relevant.

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:52.771
And I only hope that my life
can be as relevant.

00:09:53.512 --> 00:09:54.663
Thank you.

00:09:54.687 --> 00:10:04.415
(Applause)
