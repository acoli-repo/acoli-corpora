00:00:01.798 --> 00:00:04.271
I was three months pregnant with twins

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:07.639
when my husband Ross and I
went to my second sonogram.

00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:11.539
I was 35 years old at the time,

00:00:11.563 --> 00:00:14.883
and I knew that that meant
we had a higher risk

00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:16.851
of having a child with a birth defect.

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:20.965
So, Ross and I researched
the standard birth defects,

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.989
and we felt reasonably prepared.

00:00:23.973 --> 00:00:25.918
Well, nothing would have prepared us

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:28.996
for the bizarre diagnosis
that we were about to face.
