(Laughter)

00:08:30.038 --> 00:08:33.188
So in closing, I have two
simple messages today.

00:08:33.578 --> 00:08:37.382
One is that most of us probably
don't think about donating to research.

00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:40.516
I know I didn't.
I think I'm a normal person.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.691
But I did it.

00:08:41.715 --> 00:08:43.857
It was a good experience,
and I recommend it,

00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:45.825
and it brought my family a lot of peace.

00:08:45.849 --> 00:08:48.634
And second is if you work
with human tissue

00:08:48.658 --> 00:08:51.253
and you wonder about the donor
and about the family,

00:08:51.277 --> 00:08:52.472
write them a letter.

00:08:52.496 --> 00:08:55.312
Tell them you received it,
tell them what you're working on,

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:57.003
and invite them to visit your lab,

00:08:57.027 --> 00:08:59.552
because that visit may be
even more gratifying for you

00:08:59.576 --> 00:09:00.807
than it is for them.
