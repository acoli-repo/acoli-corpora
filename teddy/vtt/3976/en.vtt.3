00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:31.292
So there I was, three months pregnant,
with two trimesters ahead of me,

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:36.195
and I had to find a way to manage
my blood pressure and my stress.

00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:42.204
And it felt like having a roommate
point a loaded gun at you for six months.

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:48.483
But I stared down
the barrel of that gun for so long

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:50.570
that I saw a light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:54.610
While there was nothing we could do
to prevent the tragedy,

00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:57.097
I wanted to find a way
for Thomas's brief life

00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.342
to have some kind of positive impact.

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:03.032
So I asked my nurse about organ,
eye and tissue donation.
