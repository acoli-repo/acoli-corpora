that this process only exists
for people who donate for transplant.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.422
So I was jealous.
I had transplant envy, I guess.

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:35.596
(Laughter)

00:04:36.104 --> 00:04:38.000
But over the years that followed,

00:04:38.024 --> 00:04:40.500
I learned a lot more about donation,

00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:42.602
and I even got a job in the field.

00:04:42.626 --> 00:04:44.039
And I came up with an idea.

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.538
I wrote a letter that started out,

00:04:47.562 --> 00:04:48.728
"Dear Researcher."

00:04:50.468 --> 00:04:52.318
I explained who I was,

00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:56.210
and I asked if they could tell me
why they requested infant retinas

00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:58.469
in March of 2010,

00:04:58.493 --> 00:05:00.762
and I asked if my family
could visit their lab.
