As opposed to just a victim of a disease,

00:02:31.264 --> 00:02:34.851
I started to see him as a possible key
to unlock a medical mystery.

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:39.566
On March 23, 2010,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.097
the twins were born,
and they were both born alive.

00:02:43.978 --> 00:02:45.644
And just like the doctor said,

00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:48.747
Thomas was missing
the top part of his skull,

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:50.294
but he could nurse,

00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:51.770
drink from a bottle,

00:02:51.794 --> 00:02:55.093
cuddle and grab our fingers
like a normal baby,

00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:56.714
and he slept in our arms.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:01.442
After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms
