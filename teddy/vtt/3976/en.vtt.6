00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:01.442
After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms

00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:02.862
surrounded by our family.

00:03:04.846 --> 00:03:08.981
We called WRTC, who sent a van to our home

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:11.544
and brought him to Children's
National Medical Center.

00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:16.572
A few hours later, we got a call to say
that the recovery was a success,

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.830
and Thomas's donations
would be going to four different places.

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.555
His cord blood would go
to Duke University.

00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:27.223
His liver would go to a cell-therapy
company called Cytonet in Durham.

00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:31.508
His corneas would go
to Schepens Eye Research Institute,
