00:04:58.493 --> 00:05:00.762
and I asked if my family
could visit their lab.

00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:05.049
I emailed it to the eye bank
that arranged the donation,

00:05:05.073 --> 00:05:07.451
the Old Dominion Eye Foundation,

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:09.967
and asked if they could
send it to the right person.

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:12.626
They said that they had
never done this before,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.539
and they couldn't guarantee a response,

00:05:14.563 --> 00:05:17.379
but they wouldn't be an obstacle,
and they would deliver it.

00:05:18.506 --> 00:05:20.697
Two days later, I got a response

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:23.705
from Dr. Arupa Ganguly
of the University of Pennsylvania.

00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:26.239
She thanked me for the donation,

00:05:26.263 --> 00:05:28.986
and she explained
that she is studying retinoblastoma,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.827
which is a deadly cancer of the retina
