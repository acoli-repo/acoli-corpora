Francesca Fedeli: Ciao.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.907
So he's Mario. He's our son.

00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:09.766
He was born two and a half years ago,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.979
and I had a pretty tough pregnancy

00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:17.129
because I had to stay still
in a bed for, like, eight months.

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:20.188
But in the end everything
seemed to be under control.

00:00:20.212 --> 00:00:23.042
So he got the right weight at birth.

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.189
He got the right Apgar index.

00:00:25.213 --> 00:00:28.274
So we were pretty reassured by this.

00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:35.126
But at the end, 10 days
later after he was born,
