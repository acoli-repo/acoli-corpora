00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:01.485
(Ping-pong)

00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:05.444
(Knives being sharpened)

00:15:05.786 --> 00:15:08.832
(Record scratches)

00:15:09.405 --> 00:15:10.591
(Saw cuts)

00:15:10.615 --> 00:15:12.072
(Woman screams)

00:15:12.663 --> 00:15:16.458
What I'm sort of trying
to demonstrate with these tools

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.119
is that sound is a language.

00:15:20.516 --> 00:15:23.658
It can trick us by transporting
us geographically;

00:15:24.571 --> 00:15:26.087
it can change the mood;

00:15:26.579 --> 00:15:28.000
it can set the pace;

00:15:29.482 --> 00:15:32.936
it can make us laugh
or it can make us scared.
