When you watch a movie and you see
a bird flapping its wings --

00:02:02.794 --> 00:02:04.815
(Wings flap)

00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:08.404
They haven't really recorded the bird.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:13.422
It sounds a lot more realistic
if you record a sheet

00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:14.998
or shaking kitchen gloves.

00:02:15.022 --> 00:02:17.374
(Flaps)

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.792
The burning of a cigarette up close --

00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:23.813
(Cigarette burns)

00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:28.102
It actually sounds a lot more authentic

00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:30.971
if you take a small Saran Wrap ball
