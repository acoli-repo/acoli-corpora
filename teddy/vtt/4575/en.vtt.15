It's silence.

00:07:41.807 --> 00:07:45.411
A few moments of silence
is going to make us pay attention.

00:07:45.881 --> 00:07:48.321

00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:50.468
we're not really used to verbal silences.

00:07:50.492 --> 00:07:53.521
They're considered awkward or rude.

00:07:54.537 --> 00:07:58.110
