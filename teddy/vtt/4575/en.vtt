00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:03.476
I want to start by doing an experiment.

00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:08.307
I'm going to play three videos
of a rainy day.

00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:12.819
But I've replaced the audio
of one of the videos,

00:00:12.843 --> 00:00:15.217
and instead of the sound of rain,

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.309
I've added the sound of bacon frying.

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:23.109
So I want you think carefully
which one the clip with the bacon is.

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:25.607
(Rain falls)

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.300
