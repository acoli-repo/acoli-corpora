00:03:56.664 --> 00:04:00.322
So basically, what they did is,

00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:03.701
they went to a friend's swimming pool,

00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:08.260
and Frank performed
a cannonball, or bomba.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.265
They placed an underwater mic

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.065
and an overhead mic
outside the swimming pool.

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.342
So here's what the underwater
mic sounds like.

00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:18.901
(Underwater plunge)

00:04:19.608 --> 00:04:21.114
Adding the overhead mic,

00:04:21.138 --> 00:04:23.091
it sounded a bit like this:

00:04:23.115 --> 00:04:25.490
(Water splashes)

00:04:25.514 --> 00:04:29.961
So now they took the sound
and pitched it one octave down,

00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:32.461
sort of like slowing down a record.
