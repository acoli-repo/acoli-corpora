00:06:56.657 --> 00:07:00.627
because that's how it would sound
if someone was speaking inside our ear.

00:07:01.024 --> 00:07:02.985
On the completely other side,

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.505
adding a lot of reverb to a voice

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:08.906
is going to make us think
that we're listening to a flashback,

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.946
or perhaps that we're inside
the head of a character

00:07:13.946 --> 00:07:16.422
or that we're listening
to the voice of God.

00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:18.708
Or, even more powerful in film,

00:07:18.732 --> 00:07:20.219
Morgan Freeman.

00:07:20.243 --> 00:07:21.527
(Laughter)

00:07:21.551 --> 00:07:22.718
So --

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:24.972
(Applause)

00:07:25.502 --> 00:07:29.373
But what are some other tools or hacks

00:07:29.397 --> 00:07:31.257
that sound designers use?
