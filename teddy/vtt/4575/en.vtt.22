00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.303
(Birds chirp)

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:09.480
On the other hand, industrial sounds
have been introduced to us

00:11:09.504 --> 00:11:10.995
a little more recently.

00:11:11.969 --> 00:11:14.027
Even though I really like
them personally --

00:11:14.051 --> 00:11:16.464
they've been used by one
of my heroes, David Lynch,

00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:18.423
and his sound designer, Alan Splet --

00:11:18.447 --> 00:11:21.009
industrial sounds often carry
negative connotations.

00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:23.787
(Machine noises)

00:11:28.092 --> 00:11:32.948
Now, sound effects can tap
into our emotional memory.
