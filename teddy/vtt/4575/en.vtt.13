But reverb can do a lot more.

00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:36.401
Listening to a sound
with a lot less reverberation

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:38.508
than the on-screen action

00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:41.552
is going to immediately signify to us

00:06:41.576 --> 00:06:44.219
that we're listening to a commentator,

00:06:44.243 --> 00:06:49.034
to an objective narrator that's not
participating in the on-screen action.

00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:54.662
Also, emotionally intimate
moments in cinema

00:06:54.686 --> 00:06:56.633
are often heard with zero reverb,

00:06:56.657 --> 00:07:00.627
because that's how it would sound
if someone was speaking inside our ear.
