Now, sound effects can tap
into our emotional memory.

00:11:34.869 --> 00:11:37.226
Occasionally, they can be so significant

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.824
that they become a character in a movie.

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:45.174
The sound of thunder may indicate
divine intervention or anger.

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:49.338

00:11:51.957 --> 00:11:55.932
Church bells can remind us
of the passing of time,

00:11:55.956 --> 00:11:57.861
or perhaps our own mortality.
