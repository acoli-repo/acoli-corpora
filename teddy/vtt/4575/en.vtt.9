00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:32.461
sort of like slowing down a record.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.266
(Water splashes at lower octave)

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:38.697
And then they removed
a lot of the high frequencies.

00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:40.996
(Water splashes)

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.076
And pitched it down another octave.

00:04:44.314 --> 00:04:46.602
(Water splashes at lower octave)

00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:49.132
And then they added
a little bit of the splash

00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:51.440
from the overhead microphone.

00:04:51.464 --> 00:04:54.629
(Water splashes)

00:04:54.653 --> 00:04:57.191
And by looping and repeating that sound,

00:04:57.215 --> 00:04:58.405
they got this:

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:01.270
(Propeller churns)
