00:12:55.887 --> 00:13:00.920
well, the term "acousmatic" comes
from Pythagoras in ancient Greece,

00:13:00.944 --> 00:13:04.535
who used to teach behind
a veil or curtain for years,

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:07.749
not revealing himself to his disciples.

00:13:07.773 --> 00:13:10.561
I think the mathematician
and philosopher thought that,

00:13:11.727 --> 00:13:12.878
in that way,

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:17.621
his students might focus
more on the voice,

00:13:17.645 --> 00:13:19.609
and his words and its meaning,

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:22.803
rather than the visual of him speaking.

00:13:22.827 --> 00:13:25.526
So sort of like the Wizard of Oz,

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:30.364
or "1984's" Big Brother,
