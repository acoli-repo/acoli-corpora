Silence can place us inside
the head of a character

00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:32.237
or provoke thought.

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.314
We often relate silences with ...

00:08:36.654 --> 00:08:37.972
contemplation,

00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:39.815
meditation,

00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:42.752
being deep in thought.

00:08:44.569 --> 00:08:47.671
But apart from having one meaning,

00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:49.865
silence becomes a blank canvas

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:54.414
upon which the viewer is invited
to the paint their own thoughts.

00:08:54.962 --> 00:08:58.638
But I want to make it clear:
there is no such thing as silence.

00:08:59.192 --> 00:09:03.637
And I know this sounds like the most
pretentious TED Talk statement ever.
