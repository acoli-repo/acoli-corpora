WEBVTT

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.677
we can make it sound like
it was recorded inside a bathroom.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.033
(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom)

00:06:05.057 --> 00:06:08.562
Or like it was recorded
inside a chapel or a church.

00:06:08.887 --> 00:06:10.440
(Gunshot reverbs church)

00:06:11.043 --> 00:06:13.047
Or in a canyon.

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.960
(Gunshot reverbs in canyon)

00:06:15.984 --> 00:06:18.637
So reverb gives us a lot of information

00:06:18.661 --> 00:06:23.591
about the space between the listener
and the original sound source.

00:06:23.615 --> 00:06:25.724
If the sound is the taste,

00:06:25.748 --> 00:06:29.932
then reverb is sort of like
the smell of the sound.
