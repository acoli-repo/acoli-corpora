00:09:59.189 --> 00:10:02.129
(Voices, music)

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.238
And here's a recording
of Times Square in New York.

00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:13.366
(Traffic sounds, car horns, voices)

00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:19.071
Room tone is the addition of all
the noises inside the room:

00:10:19.095 --> 00:10:21.484
the ventilation, the heating, the fridge.

00:10:21.508 --> 00:10:24.419
Here's a recording
of my apartment in Brooklyn.

00:10:24.443 --> 00:10:29.321
(You can hear the ventilation, the boiler,
the fridge and street traffic)
