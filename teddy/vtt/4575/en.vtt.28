Richard Wagner famously
created the hidden orchestra

00:14:06.104 --> 00:14:09.940
that was placed in a pit
between the stage and the audience.

00:14:09.964 --> 00:14:15.007
And one of my heroes, Aphex Twin,
famously hid in dark corners of clubs.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:20.163
I think what all these masters knew
is that by hiding the source,

00:14:20.187 --> 00:14:21.850
you create a sense of mystery.

00:14:21.874 --> 00:14:23.943
This has been seen
in cinema over and over,

00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:27.047
with Hitchcock,
and Ridley Scott in "Alien."

00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:29.463
Hearing a sound without knowing its source

00:14:29.487 --> 00:14:32.712
is going to create some sort of tension.
