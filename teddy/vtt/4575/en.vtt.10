00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:01.270
(Propeller churns)

00:05:04.463 --> 00:05:10.991
So, creativity and technology put together
in order to create the illusion

00:05:11.015 --> 00:05:14.186
that we're inside the submarine.

00:05:14.868 --> 00:05:18.229
But once you've created your sounds

00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:20.647
and you've synced them to the image,

00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:24.722
you want those sounds to live
in the world of the story.

00:05:25.397 --> 00:05:29.431
And one the best ways to do
that is to add reverb.

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.612
So this is the first audio tool
I want to talk about.
