Ambiences work in a most primal way.

00:10:40.718 --> 00:10:43.572
They can speak directly
to our brain subconsciously.

00:10:44.538 --> 00:10:50.387
So, birds chirping outside your window
may indicate normality,

00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:53.728
perhaps because, as a species,

00:10:53.752 --> 00:10:57.889
we've been used to that sound
every morning for millions of years.
