There's always some sort of noise.

00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:35.661
Now, since there's no such
thing as silence,

00:09:35.685 --> 00:09:39.256
what do filmmakers
and sound designers use?

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.776
Well, as a synonym,
they often use ambiences.

00:09:44.307 --> 00:09:48.176
Ambiences are the unique background sounds

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.248
that are specific to each location.

00:09:51.272 --> 00:09:53.121
Each location has a unique sound,

00:09:53.145 --> 00:09:55.121
and each room has a unique sound,

00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:56.718
which is called room tone.

00:09:56.742 --> 00:09:59.165
So here's a recording
of a market in Morocco.
