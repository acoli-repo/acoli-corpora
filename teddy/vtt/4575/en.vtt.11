00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.612
So this is the first audio tool
I want to talk about.

00:05:33.198 --> 00:05:38.320
Reverberation, or reverb,
is the persistence of the sound

00:05:38.344 --> 00:05:40.275
after the original sound has ended.

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:42.867
So it's sort of like the --

00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:45.927
all the reflections from the materials,

00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:48.838
the objects and the walls
around the sound.

00:05:48.862 --> 00:05:51.074
Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot.

00:05:51.098 --> 00:05:54.100
The original sound is less
than half a second long.

00:05:56.138 --> 00:05:57.288
(Gunshot)

00:05:57.747 --> 00:05:59.436
By adding reverb,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.677
we can make it sound like
it was recorded inside a bathroom.
