00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:04.261
I moved to Boston
10 years ago from Chicago,

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:06.880
with an interest in cancer
and in chemistry.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:10.668
You might know that chemistry
is the science of making molecules

00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:12.008
or, to my taste,

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:13.663
new drugs for cancer.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.976
And you might also know that,
for science and medicine,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.408
Boston is a bit of a candy store.

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:25.130
You can't roll a stop sign in Cambridge
without hitting a graduate student.

00:00:25.154 --> 00:00:27.329
The bar is called the Miracle of Science.

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.595
The billboards say "Lab Space Available."
