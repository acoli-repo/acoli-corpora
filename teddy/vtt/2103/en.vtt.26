♫ We're taking calls -- from the dead. ♫

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
♫ We're taking phone calls from the dead. ♫

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
♫ They're calling from beyond the grave. ♫

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
♫ Beyond the grave. ♫

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
♫ They have some questions ♫

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
♫ And things to share ♫

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
♫ From underneath the cold, cold ground. ♫

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
We're soliciting phone calls from dead people

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
as a special TED presentation.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
We're taking calls live on stage

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
here at TED in Monterey.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And I think we have a caller coming in here.
