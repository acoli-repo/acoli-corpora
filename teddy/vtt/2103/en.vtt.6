00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
♫ Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying ♫

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
♫ You can't walk, you can't ramble ♫

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
♫ 'cause you're gonna have to scramble ♫

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
♫ from the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
♫ Catbird is a cat ♫

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
♫ but he's got bugness in his veins. ♫

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
♫ Manhouse lives within himself ♫

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
♫ with thoughtful human brains. ♫

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
♫ Neither one is equal 
♫
