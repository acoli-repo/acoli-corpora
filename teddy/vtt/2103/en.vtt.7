00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
♫ with thoughtful human brains. ♫

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
♫ Neither one is equal 
♫

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
♫ to the challenge of the freak we'll call ♫

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
♫ the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
♫ Now the moth ♫

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
♫ defeats the mouse and man. ♫

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
♫ It's messing with the plan. ♫

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
♫ It can't be believed ♫

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
♫ 'cause it's just a hummingbird moth ♫

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
♫ who's acting like the bird ♫

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
♫ that thinks it's a bee. ♫
