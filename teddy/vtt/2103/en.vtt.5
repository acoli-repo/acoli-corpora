00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But I guess that's in keeping,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This is a brand new song.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In the spirit of TED, we're bringing you something

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that has not been released.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
John, do you want to introduce the song?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
which imitates another creature

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which imitates yet another creature.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It's completely fucked up

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and can only be explained in song.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
♫ Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying ♫
