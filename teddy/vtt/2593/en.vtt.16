00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.680
offsets about six million tons
of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.176
By 2020, we'll be exporting
enough electricity

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.880
to offset 17 million tons
of carbon dioxide.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.936
And if we were to harness
even half our hydropower potential,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.000
and that's exactly what we are working at,

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.496
the clean, green energy that we export

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.640
would offset something like
50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.200
That is more CO2 than what the entire city
of New York generates in one year.
