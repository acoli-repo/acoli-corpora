Two years later, that same tiger

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.536
was spotted near 4,000 meters

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.080
in our cold alpine mountains.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.040
Isn't that awesome?

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.776
(Applause)

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.640
We must keep it that way.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.560
We must keep our parks awesome.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.536
So every year, we set aside resources
to prevent poaching, hunting,

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.936
mining and pollution in our parks,

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.096
and resources to help communities
who live in those parks
