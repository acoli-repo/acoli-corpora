00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.200
That is more CO2 than what the entire city
of New York generates in one year.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.256
So inside our country,
we are a net carbon sink.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.816
Outside, we are offsetting carbon.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.200
And this is important stuff.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.039
You see, the world is getting warmer,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.120
and climate change is a reality.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.680
Climate change is affecting my country.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.720
Our glaciers are melting,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.856
causing flash floods and landslides,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.320
which in turn are causing disaster
and widespread destruction in our country.
