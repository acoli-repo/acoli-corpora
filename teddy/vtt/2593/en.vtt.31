00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.976
This means that individual donors
can commit without having to worry

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.960
that they'll be left
supporting an underfunded plan.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.736
It's something like a Kickstarter project,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.136
only with a 15-year time horizon

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.480
and millions of tons
of carbon dioxide at stake.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.120
Once the deal is closed,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.376
we use the transition fund
to protect our parks,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.576
giving our government time
to increase our own funding gradually

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.616
until the end of the 15-year period.
