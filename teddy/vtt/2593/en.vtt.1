00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.600
we men get to wear pretty bright colors,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.240
but unlike our women,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.816
we get to show off our legs.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.856
(Laughter)

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.296
Our national dress is unique,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.520
but this is not the only thing
that's unique about my country.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.176
Our promise to remain
carbon neutral is also unique,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.416
and this is what I'd like
to speak about today,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.800
our promise to remain carbon neutral.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.680
But before I proceed,
I should set you the context.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.160
I should tell you our story.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.240
Bhutan is a small country
in the Himalayas.
