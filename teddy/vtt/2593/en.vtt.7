00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.640
We manage this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.720
because we use our limited
resources very carefully,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.256
and because we stay faithful
to the core mission of GNH,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.080
which is development with values.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.496
Our economy is small,
and we must strengthen it.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.696
Economic growth is important,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.856
but that economic growth must not come
from undermining our unique culture

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.960
or our pristine environment.
