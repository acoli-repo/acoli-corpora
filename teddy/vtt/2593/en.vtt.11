00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.800
this constitution,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.240
imposes forest cover on us.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.096
Incidentally, our king
used this constitution

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.880
to impose democracy on us.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.816
You see, we the people
didn't want democracy.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.816
We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.640
and we certainly didn't fight for it.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.976
Instead, our king imposed democracy on us

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.840
by insisting that he include it
in the constitution.
