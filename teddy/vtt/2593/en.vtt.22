What was different in Paris
was that governments came round together

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.776
to accept the realities of climate change,

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.160
and were willing to come together
and act together and work together.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.160
All countries, from the very small
to the very large,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.360
committed to reduce
the greenhouse gas emissions.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.776
The UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.560
says that if these so-called
intended commitments are kept,

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.616
we'd be closer
to containing global warming

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.000
by two degrees Celsius.
