The reality is that we are a small,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.360
doing our best to survive.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.400
But we are doing OK. We are surviving.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.120
In fact, we are thriving,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.360
and the reason we are thriving
is because we've been blessed

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.096
with extraordinary kings.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.136
Our enlightened monarchs
have worked tirelessly

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.016
to develop our country,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.616
balancing economic growth carefully
