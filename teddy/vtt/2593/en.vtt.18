00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.200
I was at that lake recently.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.000
It's stunning.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.216
That's how it looked 10 years ago,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.840
and that's how it looked 20 years ago.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.160
Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.680
It was a solid glacier.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.560
A few years ago, a similar lake

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.160
breached its dams

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.160
and wreaked havoc in the valleys below.
