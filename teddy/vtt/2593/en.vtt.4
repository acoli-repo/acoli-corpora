00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.616
balancing economic growth carefully

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.536
with social development,
environmental sustainability

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.416
and cultural preservation,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.919
all within the framework
of good governance.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.056
We call this holistic approach
to development

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.800
"Gross National Happiness," or GNH.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.456
Back in the 1970s,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.016
our fourth king famously
pronounced that for Bhutan,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.576
Gross National Happiness is more important
than Gross National Product.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.480
