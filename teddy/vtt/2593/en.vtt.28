00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.096
and resources to help communities
who live in those parks

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.616
manage their forests,

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.096
adapt to climate change,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.120
and lead better lives while continuing
to live in harmony with Mother Nature.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.840
But that is expensive.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.376
Over the next few years,
our small economy won't have the resources

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.120
to cover all the costs that are required
to protect our environment.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.176
In fact, when we run the numbers,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.896
it looks like it'll take us
at least 15 years

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.080
before we can fully finance
all our conservation efforts.
