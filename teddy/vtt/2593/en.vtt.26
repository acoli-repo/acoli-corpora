00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.376
Today, more than half
our country is protected,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.776
as national parks, nature reserves

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.720
and wildlife sanctuaries.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.496
But the beauty is that we've connected
them all with one another

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.440
through a network of biological corridors.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.376
Now, what this means

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.320
is that our animals are free
to roam throughout our country.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.176
Take this tiger, for example.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.896
It was spotted
at 250 meters above sea level

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.240
in the hot, subtropical jungles.
