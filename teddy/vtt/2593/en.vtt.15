00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.536
Our entire country generates
2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.400
but our forests, they sequester
more than three times that amount,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.856
so we are a net carbon sink

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.800
for more than four million tons
of carbon dioxide each year.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.416
But that's not all.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.536
(Applause)

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.656
We export most
of the renewable electricity

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.840
we generate from our fast-flowing rivers.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.576
So today, the clean energy that we export

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.680
offsets about six million tons
of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.
