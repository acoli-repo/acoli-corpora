00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.616
retired 10 years ago

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.920
at the peak of his popularity.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.680
He was all of 51 years at that time.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.400
So as I was saying,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.896
72 percent of our country
is under forest cover,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.160
and all that forest is pristine.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.096
That's why we are one of the few remaining

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.136
global biodiversity hotspots in the world,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.520
and that's why we are
a carbon neutral country.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.696
In a world that is threatened
with climate change,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.640
we are a carbon neutral country.
