00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.048
We're living in difficult times

00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:05.819
because, on one hand,
thanks to connectivity,

00:00:05.843 --> 00:00:08.262
we can see the most
beautiful sides of humanity

00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:11.123
but, on the other hand, also the ugliest:

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:15.686
hunger, violence, war,
hatred, intolerance;

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.189
daily scenes

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:19.816
that, when we come home
at the end of the day,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.775
we feel that everything is kind of lost.

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.056
But it's not,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.388
because it's precisely at home
where we might find

00:00:28.412 --> 00:00:30.811
one of the most infallible tools
