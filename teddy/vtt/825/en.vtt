00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I grew up on a small farm in Missouri.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We lived on less than a dollar a day

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for about 15 years.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I got a scholarship, went to university,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
studied international agriculture, studied anthropology,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and decided I was going to give back.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I was going to work with small farmers.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I was going to help alleviate poverty.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I was going to work on international development,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then I took a turn

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and ended up here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, if you get a Ph.D., and you decide not to teach,
