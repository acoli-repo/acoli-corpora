00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:31.083
besides the original hydrogen and helium,

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:32.548
have higher density areas

00:02:32.548 --> 00:02:34.672
that attract more matter, and so on.

00:02:34.672 --> 00:02:37.548
As before, new stars result.

00:02:37.548 --> 00:02:40.302
Our sun was born this way about 5 billion years ago.

00:02:40.302 --> 00:02:42.231
That means that the gas it arose from

00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:44.266
had itself been enriched with many elements

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:47.980
from supernova explosions since the universe began.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.646
So that's how the sun wound up with all the elements.

00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:52.862
It's still mostly hydrogen at 71 percent,

00:02:52.862 --> 00:02:55.565
with most of the rest being helium at 27 percent.

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:56.483
But bear in mind

00:02:56.498 --> 00:02:57.813
that while the first stars were made up

00:02:57.813 --> 00:02:59.647
of hydrogen and helium alone,

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:01.481
the remaining elements in the periodic table
