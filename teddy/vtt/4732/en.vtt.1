00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:31.900
have existed for billions of years

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.882
and were created in places very unlike our planet.

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:38.349
How those atoms came about is what I want to share with you.

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:39.933
It all started 14 billion years ago

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.685
with an event we call The Big Bang,

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:44.856
which resulted in a universe consisting of gas alone.

00:00:44.856 --> 00:00:46.896
There were no stars and no planets.

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:48.480
The gas was made up only of atoms

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.479
belonging to the simplest elements.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.313
It was about 75 percent hydrogen

00:00:52.313 --> 00:00:54.396
and almost all the rest was helium.

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:57.314
No elements like carbon, oxygen or nitrogen existed.

00:00:57.314 --> 00:00:59.396
No iron, silver or gold.

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:03.146
In some places, the density of this gas was slightly higher than in others.
