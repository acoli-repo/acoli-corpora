00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:01.481
the remaining elements in the periodic table

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.731
make up two percent of the sun.

00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:05.146
And what about Earth?

00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:07.997
Planets form as an incidental process to star formation

00:03:07.997 --> 00:03:11.126
out of the same gas cloud as the star itself.

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:13.042
Small planets like ours don't have enough gravity

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:15.587
to hold on to much hydrogen or helium gas

00:03:15.587 --> 00:03:17.672
since both of those are very light.

00:03:17.672 --> 00:03:20.312
So, even though carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and so on

00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:23.731
made up only two percent of the gas cloud from which Earth was formed,

00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:26.307
these heavier elements form the bulk of our planet

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:28.266
and everything on it.

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:29.518
Think about this:

00:03:29.518 --> 00:03:31.645
with the exception of hydrogen and some helium,
