00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:03.146
In some places, the density of this gas was slightly higher than in others.

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:05.981
Due to gravity, those places attracted even more gas,

00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:07.980
which further strengthened the pull of gravity,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.670
which then drew more gas in, and so on.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.507
Eventually, large dense gas balls formed,

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.312
shrinking under their own gravity

00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:18.055
and consequently heating up on the inside.

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:19.645
At some point, the core of such a ball

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:22.147
gets hot enough that nuclear fusion occurs.

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:24.896
Hydrogen atoms smash together to form helium,

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:27.063
accompanied by a great release of energy,

00:01:27.063 --> 00:01:30.564
strong enough to counteract the shrinking force of the gravity.
