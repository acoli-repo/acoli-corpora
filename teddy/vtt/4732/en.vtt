00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.769
All the material objects around you

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.395
are composed of submicroscopic units

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.146
we call molecules.

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:13.398
And molecules in turn are composed

00:00:13.398 --> 00:00:15.146
of individual atoms.

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:16.980
Molecules frequently break apart

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.063
and then form new molecules.

00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:20.313
On the other hand,

00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:22.248
virtually all the atoms you come in to contact with

00:00:22.248 --> 00:00:23.813
through the course of your life,

00:00:23.813 --> 00:00:25.417
the ones in the ground beneath you,

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:27.419
the air you breath, the food you eat,

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.712
those that make up every living thing, including you,

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:31.900
have existed for billions of years
