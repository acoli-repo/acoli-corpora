00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:01.563
about how supernovas create elements.

00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:04.310
First, this explosion releases so much energy

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.935
that fusion goes wild

00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:08.564
forming elements with atoms even heavier than iron

00:02:08.564 --> 00:02:10.897
like silver, gold and uranium.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.730
Second, all the elements that had been accumulating

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.145
in the core of the star,

00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:16.695
like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron,

00:02:16.695 --> 00:02:19.561
as well as all of those formed in the supernova explosion,

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.981
are ejected in to interstellar space

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.397
where they mix with the gas that's already there.

00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:26.480
History then repeats itself.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.667
Gas clouds, now containing many elements

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:31.083
besides the original hydrogen and helium,
