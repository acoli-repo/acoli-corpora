00:01:27.063 --> 00:01:30.564
strong enough to counteract the shrinking force of the gravity.

00:01:30.564 --> 00:01:32.563
When the energy pushing out from the fusion reactions

00:01:32.563 --> 00:01:35.113
matches the gravity pulling all the gas inwards,

00:01:35.113 --> 00:01:37.063
an equilibrium occurs.

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.369
From this a star is born.

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.367
Over its lifetime,

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.480
the fusion reactions in the core of a massive star

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.064
will produce not only helium,

00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:46.206
but also carbon, oxygen, nitrogen

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:50.125
and all the other elements in the periodic table up to iron.

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:52.146
But eventually, the core's fuel runs out,

00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:54.089
leaving it to collapse completely.

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:56.257
That causes an unbelievably powerful explosion

00:01:56.257 --> 00:01:58.480
we call a supernova.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.595
Now there are two things to note

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:01.563
about how supernovas create elements.
