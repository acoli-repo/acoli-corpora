00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.096
so on a fine March day last year,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.696
I was doing one of the things I do best:

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.656
I was cheering for my Wildcats.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.056
The daffodils were blooming,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.536
but the referees were not blowing
the whistle when I was telling them to.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.816
(Laughter)

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.576
Funny, they're very friendly
to me before the opening tip,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.656
but they really ignore me during the game.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.696
(Laughter)

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.176
Three of my players were bleeding,
so I did the next best thing ...

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.416
I tweeted.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.616

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.256
It is routine for me to be treated
in the ways I've already described to you.
