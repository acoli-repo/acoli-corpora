WEBVTT

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.096
and we give that data

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.816
so that we understand
the intersectionality of it:

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.096
when I get porn,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.976
when it's about political affiliation,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.200
when it's about age,
when it's about all of it.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.840
We're going to win this fight.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.440
There are a lot of solutions --

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.920
thank goodness.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.496
I'm going to offer just a few,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.160
and of course I challenge you
to create and contribute your own.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.616
Number one: we have to start
with digital media literacy,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.176
and clearly it must have a gendered lens.
