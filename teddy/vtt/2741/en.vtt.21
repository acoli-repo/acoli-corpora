00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.656
And guess what, Silicon Valley?

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.656
If L'Oréal in India,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.856
in the Philippines, in Brazil

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.776
and in Russia can do it,

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.840
you can, too.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.160
Enough excuses.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.976
Only when women have critical mass
in every department at your companies,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.816
including building platforms
from the ground up,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.176
will the conversations
about priorities and solutions change.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.256
And more love for my friends in tech:

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.200
profiteering off misogyny
in video games must end.
