00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.536
saying they "can't wait
to cum on my face,"

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.320
I have a right to set that boundary.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.600
(Applause)

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.736
And this distinction
between virtual and real is specious

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.976
because guess what --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.496
that actually happened to me
once when I was a child,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.096
and so that tweet brought up that trauma,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.896
and I had to do work on that.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.096
But you know what we do?
We take all of this hate speech,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.000
and we disaggregate it,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.216
and we code it,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.096
and we give that data
