profiteering off misogyny
in video games must end.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.256
I'm so tired of hearing you
talk to me at cocktail parties --

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.616
like you did a couple
weeks ago in Aspen --

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.576
about how deplorable #Gamergate was,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.216
when you're still making
billions of dollars off games

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.456
that maim and dump women for sport.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.016
Basta! -- as the Italians would say.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.296
Enough.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.040
(Applause)

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.736
Our friends in law enforcement
have much to do,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.376
because we've seen

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.840
that online violence
is an extension of in-person violence.
