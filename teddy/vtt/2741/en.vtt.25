"What's Twitter?"

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.536
Our legislators must write
and pass astute legislation

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.456
that reflects today's technology

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.680
and our notions of free and hate speech.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.816
In New York recently, the law
could not be applied to a perpetrator

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.016
because the crimes
must have been committed --

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.376
even if it was anonymous --

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.856
they must have been committed
by telephone, in mail,

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.296
by telegraph --

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.800
