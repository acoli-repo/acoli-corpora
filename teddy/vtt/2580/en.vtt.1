00:00:27.053 --> 00:00:30.992
But these individuals,
they risk their lives every day

00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:33.933
to protect the individuals
in their communities,

00:00:33.957 --> 00:00:36.537
and by doing so, protect us all.

00:00:37.093 --> 00:00:40.001
But one of the most extraordinary things
I learned about them

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:42.592
on one of my first visits
out there many years ago

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:44.325
was that they start each morning --

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:49.292
these challenging, extraordinary days
on the front lines -- by singing.

00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:53.070
They gather together,
and they show their joy.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.616
They show their spirit.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.799
And over the years,

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:58.936
from year after year as I've visited them
and they've visited me,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.953
I get to gather with them and I sing
