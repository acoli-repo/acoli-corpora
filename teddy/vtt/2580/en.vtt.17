00:08:29.198 --> 00:08:32.394
it could happen in a city of millions,
it could start there.

00:08:32.418 --> 00:08:35.117
It could be something
that's transmitted through the air.

00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:37.288
It could even be
disseminated intentionally.

00:08:37.312 --> 00:08:40.293
And I know that that is frightening,
I understand that,

00:08:40.317 --> 00:08:42.971
but I know also,
and this experience shows us,

00:08:42.995 --> 00:08:46.315
that we have the technology
and we have the capacity

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:47.934
to win this thing,

00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.804
to win this and have
the upper hand over viruses.

00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:53.100
But we can only do it if we do it together

00:08:53.124 --> 00:08:54.321
and we do it with joy.

00:08:54.871 --> 00:08:56.392
So for Dr. Khan

00:08:56.416 --> 00:09:00.582
and for all of those who sacrificed
their lives on the front lines
