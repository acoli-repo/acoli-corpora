00:08:56.416 --> 00:09:00.582
and for all of those who sacrificed
their lives on the front lines

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:03.006
in this fight with us always,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.837
let us be in this fight with them always.

00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:07.736
And let us not let the world be defined

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.879
by the destruction wrought by one virus,

00:09:09.903 --> 00:09:12.684
but illuminated by billions
of hearts and minds

00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:13.916
working in unity.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.114
Thank you.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:22.007
(Applause)
