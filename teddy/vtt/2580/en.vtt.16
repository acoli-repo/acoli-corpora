00:07:59.008 --> 00:08:01.102
because without knowing it,
we'd always felt

00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:04.310
that in order to honor the individuals
in Kenema where we worked,

00:08:04.334 --> 00:08:08.621
we had to work openly, we had to share
and we had to work together.

00:08:09.074 --> 00:08:10.251
And we have to do that.

00:08:10.275 --> 00:08:14.036
We all have to demand that
of ourselves and others --

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.934
to be open to each other
when an outbreak happens,

00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.608
to fight in this fight together.

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:21.541
Because this is not the first
outbreak of Ebola,

00:08:21.565 --> 00:08:23.013
it will not be the last,

00:08:23.037 --> 00:08:26.192
and there are many other microbes
out there that are lying in wait,

00:08:26.216 --> 00:08:27.641
like Lassa virus and others.

00:08:27.665 --> 00:08:29.174
And the next time this happens,

00:08:29.198 --> 00:08:32.394
it could happen in a city of millions,
it could start there.
