00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.009
And we worked around the clock
trying to do everything we could,

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:03.994
trying to help the individuals,
trying to get attention,

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:05.965
but we also did one other simple thing.

00:03:06.544 --> 00:03:10.333
From that specimen that we take
from a patient's blood to detect Ebola,

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.412
we can discard it, obviously.

00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:16.052
The other thing we can do is, actually,
put in a chemical and deactivate it,

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:18.806
so just place it into a box
and ship it across the ocean,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.981
and that's what we did.

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.101
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.

00:03:22.724 --> 00:03:26.561
And we also worked around the clock
doing shift work, day after day,

00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:30.454
and we quickly generated 99 genomes
of the Ebola virus.
