WEBVTT

00:05:00.022 --> 00:05:01.451
we published it to the web.

00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:04.311
We just released it to the whole world
and said, "Help us."

00:05:04.335 --> 00:05:05.670
And help came.

00:05:05.694 --> 00:05:06.856
Before we knew it,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.216
we were being contacted
from people all over,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.684
surprised to see the data
out there and released.

00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:13.960
Some of the greatest
viral trackers in the world

00:05:13.984 --> 00:05:16.063
were suddenly part of our community.

00:05:16.087 --> 00:05:18.417
We were working together
in this virtual way,

00:05:18.441 --> 00:05:21.422
sharing, regular calls, communications,

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.197
trying to follow the virus
minute by minute,

00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:26.442
to see ways that we could stop it.

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:30.785
And there are so many ways
that we can form communities like that.
