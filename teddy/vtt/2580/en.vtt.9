00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:32.260
But the way that science works,
the position I was in at that point

00:04:32.284 --> 00:04:33.435
is, I had the data,

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:36.095
and I could have worked
in a silo for many, many months,

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:38.318
analyzed the data carefully, slowly,

00:04:38.342 --> 00:04:41.802
submitted the paper for publication,
gone through a few back-and-forths,

00:04:41.826 --> 00:04:44.955
and then finally when the paper came out,
might release that data.

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.183
That's the way the status quo works.

00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:49.778
Well, that was not going to work
at this point, right?

00:04:49.802 --> 00:04:51.410
We had friends on the front lines

00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:54.688
and to us it was just obvious
that what we needed is help,

00:04:54.712 --> 00:04:55.868
lots of help.

00:04:55.892 --> 00:04:57.289
So the first thing we did is,

00:04:57.313 --> 00:04:59.998
as soon as the sequences
came off the machines,
