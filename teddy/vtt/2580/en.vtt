You may never have heard
of Kenema, Sierra Leone

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:05.333
or Arua, Nigeria.

00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:09.128
But I know them as two of the most
extraordinary places on earth.

00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:15.009
In hospitals there, there's a community
of nurses, physicians and scientists

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:16.590
that have been quietly battling

00:00:16.614 --> 00:00:19.314
one of the deadliest threats
to humanity for years:

00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:20.512
Lassa virus.

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:23.256
Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.513
It can cause a severe fever
and can often be fatal.

00:00:27.053 --> 00:00:30.992
But these individuals,
they risk their lives every day
