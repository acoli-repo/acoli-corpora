00:06:57.746 --> 00:07:01.757
Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma
and Mohamed Fullah.

00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:04.307
These are just five
of many health-care workers

00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:06.095
at Kenema and beyond

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:09.155
that died while the world waited
and while we all worked,

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:11.039
quietly and separately.

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:13.096
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.004
it's fueled by mistrust
and distraction and division.

00:07:17.028 --> 00:07:20.801
When we build barriers amongst ourselves
and we fight amongst ourselves,

00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:22.645
the virus thrives.

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:24.461
But unlike all threats to humanity,

00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:27.131
Ebola is one where
we're actually all the same.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.035
We're all in this fight together.

00:07:29.059 --> 00:07:31.693
Ebola on one person's doorstep
could soon be on ours.
