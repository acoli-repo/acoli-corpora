00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.953
I get to gather with them and I sing

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.151
and we write and we love it,

00:01:03.175 --> 00:01:06.718
because it reminds us that we're not
just there to pursue science together;

00:01:06.742 --> 00:01:09.059
we're bonded through a shared humanity.

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:13.909
And that of course, as you can imagine,
becomes extremely important,

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.706
even essential, as things begin to change.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.519
And that changed a great deal
in March of 2014,

00:01:21.543 --> 00:01:23.889
when the Ebola outbreak
was declared in Guinea.

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:26.558
This is the first outbreak in West Africa,

00:01:26.582 --> 00:01:29.024
near the border
of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
