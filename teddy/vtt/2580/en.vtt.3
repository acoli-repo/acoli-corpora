00:01:30.074 --> 00:01:32.596
And it was frightening,
frightening for us all.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.532
We had actually suspected for some time

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:37.198
that Lassa and Ebola were more
widespread than thought,

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.531
and we thought it could
one day come to Kenema.

00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:42.306
And so members of my team
immediately went out

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.727
and joined Dr. Humarr Khan
and his team there,

00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:48.428
and we set up diagnostics to be able
to have sensitive molecular tests

00:01:48.452 --> 00:01:50.605
to pick up Ebola if it came
across the border

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:51.892
and into Sierra Leone.

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.912
We'd already set up this kind
of capacity for Lassa virus,

00:01:54.936 --> 00:01:56.093
we knew how to do it,

00:01:56.117 --> 00:01:57.547
the team is outstanding.

00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:00.808
We just had to give them
the tools and place to survey for Ebola.
