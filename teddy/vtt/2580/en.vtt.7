00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:30.454
and we quickly generated 99 genomes
of the Ebola virus.

00:03:30.478 --> 00:03:33.535
This is the blueprint -- the genome
of a virus is the blueprint.

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:34.718
We all have one.

00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:36.687
It says everything that makes up us,

00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:38.620
and it tells us so much information.

00:03:38.644 --> 00:03:41.821
The results of this kind of work
are simple and they're powerful.

00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:44.866
We could actually take
these 99 different viruses,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.337
look at them and compare them,

00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:49.207
and we could see, actually,
compared to three genomes

00:03:49.231 --> 00:03:52.067
that had been previously
published from Guinea,

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:55.802
we could show that the outbreak
emerged in Guinea months before,

00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:57.668
once into the human population,

00:03:57.692 --> 00:04:00.364
and from there had been transmitting
from human to human.
