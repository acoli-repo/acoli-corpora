We just had to give them
the tools and place to survey for Ebola.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.968
And unfortunately, that day came.

00:02:02.992 --> 00:02:07.973
On May 23, 2014, a woman checked
into the maternity ward at the hospital,

00:02:07.997 --> 00:02:11.723
and the team ran
those important molecular tests

00:02:11.747 --> 00:02:15.582

the case immediately,

00:02:20.464 --> 00:02:22.777

00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:25.819

to follow what was going on.

00:02:25.843 --> 00:02:27.815
It could've stopped something.

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.686
But by the time that day came,
