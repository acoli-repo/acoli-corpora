00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:30.785
And there are so many ways
that we can form communities like that.

00:05:31.182 --> 00:05:35.507
Everybody, particularly when the outbreak
started to expand globally,

00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:39.121
was reaching out to learn,
to participate, to engage.

00:05:39.788 --> 00:05:41.382
Everybody wants to play a part.

00:05:41.406 --> 00:05:44.186
The amount of human capacity
out there is just amazing,

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.933
and the Internet connects us all.

00:05:45.957 --> 00:05:49.208
And could you imagine that instead
of being frightened of each other,

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:51.089
that we all just said, "Let's do this.

00:05:51.113 --> 00:05:53.636
Let's work together,
and let's make this happen."

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.402
But the problem is that the data
that all of us are using,

00:05:56.426 --> 00:06:00.463
Googling on the web, is just too limited
to do what we need to do.
