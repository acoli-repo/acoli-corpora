00:03:57.692 --> 00:04:00.364
and from there had been transmitting
from human to human.

00:04:00.388 --> 00:04:01.932
Now, that's incredibly important

00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:04.324
when you're trying to figure out
how to intervene,

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:06.414
but the important thing
is contact tracing.

00:04:06.438 --> 00:04:09.840
We also could see that as the virus
was moving between humans,

00:04:09.864 --> 00:04:11.121
it was mutating.

00:04:11.145 --> 00:04:13.296
And each of those mutations
are so important,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.640
because the diagnostics, the vaccines,

00:04:15.664 --> 00:04:17.149
the therapies that we're using,

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:20.531
are all based on that genome
sequence, fundamentally --

00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:21.776
that's what drives it.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.682
And so global health experts
would need to respond,

00:04:24.706 --> 00:04:25.903
would have to develop,

00:04:25.927 --> 00:04:28.480
to recalibrate everything
that they were doing.

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:32.260
But the way that science works,
the position I was in at that point
