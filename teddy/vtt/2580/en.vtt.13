00:06:29.801 --> 00:06:32.455
So we were waiting for more data
to release that.

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.523
and the data has still not come.

00:06:34.547 --> 00:06:37.079
We are still waiting, tweaking away,

00:06:37.103 --> 00:06:39.941
in silos rather than working together.

00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:42.197
And this just -- we can't accept that.

00:06:42.221 --> 00:06:46.025
Right? You, all of you,
cannot accept that.

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:47.731
It's our lives on the line.

00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:49.466
And in fact, actually,

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.033
many lives were lost,
many health-care workers,

00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:53.951
including beloved colleagues of mine,

00:06:53.975 --> 00:06:57.722
five colleagues:
Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi,

00:06:57.746 --> 00:07:01.757
Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma
and Mohamed Fullah.
