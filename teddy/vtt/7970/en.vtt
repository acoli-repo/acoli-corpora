In late 1775, the newly appointed 
General George Washington

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:16.095
received a poem from one 
of colonial America’s most famous writers.

00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:19.015
Its verses praised 
the burgeoning revolution,

00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:23.394
invoking the goddess of their new nation
to aid the general’s righteous cause.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.441
But this ode to liberty wasn’t written
by some aloof, aristocratic admirer.

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:33.112
Its author was a young Black woman
who’d been enslaved for over a decade.
