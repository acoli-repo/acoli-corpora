(Laughter)

00:00:31.092 --> 00:00:33.942
And later in life, I became a scientist.

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:38.679
I joined the MIT faculty
and started working on wireless signals.

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:42.327
These are things like Wi-Fi
or cellular systems,

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:44.703
and I did a lot of work in that domain.

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.078
But then, again, this Force thing
kept nagging me,

00:00:50.102 --> 00:00:52.027
and at some point, I was just like,

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:56.703
"Wait a minute, these wireless signals --
they are like the Force."

00:00:56.727 --> 00:00:57.921
So if you think about it,

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:00.576
wireless signals,
they travel through space,
