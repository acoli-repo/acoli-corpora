00:08:57.739 --> 00:09:00.707
And that got doctors very excited,

00:09:00.731 --> 00:09:01.882
because doctors,

00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:04.863
they always want to know
more information about their patients,

00:09:04.887 --> 00:09:06.057
particularly at home,

00:09:06.081 --> 00:09:08.715
and this is particularly true
in chronic diseases,

00:09:08.739 --> 00:09:12.894
like pulmonary diseases, like COPD,

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:17.442
or heart failure or Alzheimer's
and even depression.

00:09:17.466 --> 00:09:19.783
All of these chronic diseases
are very important.

00:09:19.807 --> 00:09:22.275
In fact -- perhaps you know --

00:09:22.299 --> 00:09:25.179
two-thirds of the cost
of health care in the US

00:09:25.203 --> 00:09:27.187
is due to chronic diseases.

00:09:27.545 --> 00:09:30.076
But what is really interesting
about chronic diseases
