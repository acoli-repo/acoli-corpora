She has heart failure,

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:04.452
and I'm sure many of you guys
in the audience

00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:09.164
have parents, grandparents,
loved ones who have chronic diseases.

00:11:09.188 --> 00:11:12.046
So I want you to imagine with me a future

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.952
where in every home
that has a chronic disease patient,

00:11:14.976 --> 00:11:18.101
there is a device like this device
sitting in the background

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:20.490
and just monitoring passively

00:11:20.514 --> 00:11:25.180
sleep, breathing, the health
of this chronic disease patient,

00:11:25.204 --> 00:11:27.328
and before an emergency occurs,

00:11:27.352 --> 00:11:30.375
it would detect the degradation
in the physiological signal
