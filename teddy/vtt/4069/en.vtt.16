00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:00.342
Inhaling, exhaling.

00:08:00.366 --> 00:08:05.968
(Applause)

00:08:05.992 --> 00:08:08.144
So, he can breathe.

00:08:08.168 --> 00:08:09.589
(Laughter)

00:08:09.613 --> 00:08:11.811
Zach, can you hold your breath, please?

00:08:13.216 --> 00:08:16.279
OK, so now he's holding his breath,

00:08:16.303 --> 00:08:18.557
so you see the signal stays
at a steady level,

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.207
and these are his heartbeats.

00:08:20.231 --> 00:08:23.707
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat.

00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:24.732
(Applause)

00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:26.923
OK, Zach, you can breathe again.

00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:28.836
(Laughter)

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.280
We don't want accidents here.
