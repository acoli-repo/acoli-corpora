00:01:55.568 --> 00:02:00.322
purely based on how his body interacts
with the surrounding wireless signals.

00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:03.335
Pretty accurate, isn't it?

00:02:04.702 --> 00:02:06.575
He has no wearables, nothing.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.413
(Applause)

00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:11.182
Now you might be wondering,

00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:14.388
how is it possible
that we can sense people

00:02:14.412 --> 00:02:18.258
and track them, without
any wearables, through walls,

00:02:18.282 --> 00:02:21.648
and the easiest analogy
to think about is radar.

00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:23.765
I'm sure many of you
have seen this picture.

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:25.947
You transmit a wireless signal to the sky,

00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:28.939
it reflects off some airplane,
comes back to you,

00:02:28.963 --> 00:02:31.304
and you start detecting these airplanes.
