00:02:57.684 --> 00:03:00.810
and that means that your device
has to be very sensitive.

00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:06.275
The second difference is that,
unlike the sky, where it's empty --

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.443
if you are lucky, there is one airplane
that you can catch there.

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:10.809
Like, look at the room

00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:13.721
and look how many objects
and people there are.

00:03:13.745 --> 00:03:17.682
So in indoor environments, the signal
not only reflects off the person,

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:21.499
if reflects off the person,
off the floor, the ceiling,

00:03:21.523 --> 00:03:23.745
off other people around,

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.752
and you get very complex reflections

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:28.507
where the same signal reflects
off me and then off you,

00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:30.769
and then off the ceiling,
then off the floor.
