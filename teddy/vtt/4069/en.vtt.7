00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:30.769
and then off the ceiling,
then off the floor.

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:33.962
And you have to make sense of that mess.

00:03:35.993 --> 00:03:37.842
But we were lucky.

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:40.358
We were coming at the right time.

00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:43.124
So two things helped us.

00:03:43.148 --> 00:03:47.204
The first thing is radiotechnologies
have evolved a lot,

00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:49.003
and over the last decade,

00:03:49.027 --> 00:03:51.337
radio technology
became much more powerful,

00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:55.098
so we were able to build
very sensitive radios

00:03:55.122 --> 00:03:58.479
that can sense weak and minute RF signals.

00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:02.764
The second thing: machine learning.
