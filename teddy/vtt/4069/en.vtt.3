00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.531
and I want to show you
some of our early results.

00:01:32.584 --> 00:01:34.867
So here, you see my student standing,

00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:36.868
and here is our device.

00:01:36.892 --> 00:01:42.502
And we are going to put the device
in the other office, behind the wall,

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:45.343
and we are going
to monitor him as he moves.

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:49.446
This red dot is tracking him
using wireless signals.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.544
And as you can see, the red dot
is tracking his movements very accurately,

00:01:55.568 --> 00:02:00.322
purely based on how his body interacts
with the surrounding wireless signals.
