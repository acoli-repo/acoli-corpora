00:02:28.963 --> 00:02:31.304
and you start detecting these airplanes.

00:02:32.328 --> 00:02:34.272
But if it were just radar,

00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:36.549
then we would have this 50 years ago.

00:02:37.272 --> 00:02:38.978
So it's not just radar.

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:41.475
There are two key differences.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.992
So the first difference, of course --

00:02:44.016 --> 00:02:47.535
you can't, like radar, just blast
wireless power at somebody.

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.286
You're going to fry them
like if they were in a microwave.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.460
Don't do that.

00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:57.660
So it means that you have to be able
to deal with very weak signals,

00:02:57.684 --> 00:03:00.810
and that means that your device
has to be very sensitive.
