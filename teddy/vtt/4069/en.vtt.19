But what is really interesting
about chronic diseases

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.920
is that when the person, for example,

00:09:31.944 --> 00:09:36.681
has a problem that leads
to the hospital and the emergency room,

00:09:36.705 --> 00:09:39.020
this problem doesn't happen overnight.

00:09:39.044 --> 00:09:41.123
Actually, things happen gradually.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:44.869
So if we can monitor
chronic disease patients in their home,

00:09:44.893 --> 00:09:49.154
we can detect changes in their breathing,
heartbeat, mobility, sleep --

00:09:49.178 --> 00:09:53.360
and we can detect emergencies
before they occur

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:55.701
and have the doctor intervene earlier

00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:57.788
so that we can avoid hospitalization.

00:09:58.645 --> 00:10:02.747
And indeed, today we are working
with multiple doctors
