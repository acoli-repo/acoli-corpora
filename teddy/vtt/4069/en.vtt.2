wireless signals,
they travel through space,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.080
they go through obstacles
and walls and occlusions,

00:01:04.104 --> 00:01:05.345
and some of them,

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.519
they reflect off our bodies,
because our bodies are full of water,

00:01:09.543 --> 00:01:11.749
and some of these minute reflections,

00:01:11.773 --> 00:01:13.031
they come back.

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:20.026
And if, just if, I had a device that can
just sense these minute reflections,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.034
then I would be able to feel people
that I cannot see.

00:01:24.444 --> 00:01:28.197
So I started working with my students
on building such a device,

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.531
and I want to show you
some of our early results.
