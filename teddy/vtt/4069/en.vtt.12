00:05:57.511 --> 00:06:00.065
they put all of these
electrodes on their head,

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:01.919
and they ask them to sleep like that.

00:06:01.943 --> 00:06:04.003
(Laughter)

00:06:04.027 --> 00:06:06.962
It's not really a happy experience.

00:06:08.155 --> 00:06:11.091
So what if I tell you
that I can do the same thing

00:06:11.115 --> 00:06:14.282
but without any of these electrodes
on the person's body?

00:06:15.596 --> 00:06:17.468
So here is our device,

00:06:17.492 --> 00:06:20.254
transmitting very low power
wireless signal,

00:06:20.278 --> 00:06:22.390
analyzes the reflections using AI

00:06:22.414 --> 00:06:25.580
and spits out the sleep stages
throughout the night.

00:06:26.647 --> 00:06:30.229
So we know, for example,
when this person is dreaming.
