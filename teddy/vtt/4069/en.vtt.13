00:06:26.647 --> 00:06:30.229
So we know, for example,
when this person is dreaming.

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:33.483
Not just that ...

00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:37.778
we can even get your breathing
while you are sitting like that,

00:06:37.802 --> 00:06:39.375
and without touching you.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.001
So he is sitting and reading

00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:43.970
and this is his inhales, exhales.

00:06:43.994 --> 00:06:45.985
We asked him to hold his breath,

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:48.875
and you see the signal
staying at a steady level

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:50.050
because he exhaled.

00:06:50.074 --> 00:06:51.224
He did not inhale.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.763
And I want to zoom in on the signal.

00:06:55.787 --> 00:06:57.850
And this is the same signal as before.

00:06:57.874 --> 00:06:59.555
These are the inhales,

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:01.223
these are the exhales.
