00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
We sort of worked things out.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I couldn't fit them in.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So what I did was I made an adventure strip.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Basically, this bottle travels a long way.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
What I'm trying to tell readers

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
is that plastic doesn't really go away;

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
it just continues to wash downstream.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
especially if they can't stand each other, like these two.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So, I sent them to Boise, Idaho,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
where they dropped a plastic bottle
