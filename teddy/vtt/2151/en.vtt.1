00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when I was about eight or nine.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I was particularly fascinated with sharks.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is some of my early work.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Eventually, my mom took the red crayon away,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so it was [unclear].

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that really made me see the ocean differently,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and it's become the foundation of my work

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because, I feel like, if in a day,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I can see the ocean differently,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
then I can evoke that same kind of change in others,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
especially kids.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's just a big blue surface.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time.
