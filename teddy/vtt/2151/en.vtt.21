00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
with a plastic bottle following along.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
but we really talked about marine debris and plastic

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
in the course of that one.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
was probably my most difficult.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
It was on shark finning, and I felt really strongly

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
about this issue.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And I felt like, since my main character was a shark,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Now, finning is the act

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
of taking a shark, cutting the valuable fins off

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and throwing the live animal back in the water.
