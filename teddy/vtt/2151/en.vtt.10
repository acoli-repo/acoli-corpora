Or take this sea cucumber.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It's not an animal we draw cartoons of

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
or draw at all.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
He's like an underwater Spiderman.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
He shoots out these sticky webs

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to entangle his enemy.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Of course, sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
which, in my opinion, makes them much more interesting a superhero.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
(Laughter)

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
He can't spin a web anytime; he's got to pull his pants down first.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
(Laughter)
