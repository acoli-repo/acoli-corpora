00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So from that day on, I was an ordinary kid

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
walking around on dry land,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but my head was down there, underwater.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Up until that day,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
these were the animals that were most common in my life.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
These were the ones I'd like to draw --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon
