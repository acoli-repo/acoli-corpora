00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But that day I flew low over the islands --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it was a family trip to the Caribbean,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and I flew in a small plane low over the islands.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I saw forests and meadows.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I saw grottoes and secret gardens

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and places I'd love to hide as a kid,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
if I could only breathe underwater.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And best of all, I saw the animals.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So from that day on, I was an ordinary kid

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
walking around on dry land,
