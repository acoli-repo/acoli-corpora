00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and this enormous humpback whale

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
was like something out of a science-fiction movie.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Whenever I talk to kids, I always like to tell them,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's not a dinosaur; it's a whale,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
animals as big as office buildings

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
still swimming around out there in our ocean.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Speaking of dinosaurs, sharks are basically

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the same fish they were 300 million years ago.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So if you ever fantasize about going back in time

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and seeing what a dinosaur looked like,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that's what a dinosaur looks like.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So you have living dinosaurs
