00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
the famous vampire squid -- elusive, hard to find --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and the Dumbo octopus, which looks so much like a cartoon in real life

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
that really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I did another story on marine debris.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I was speaking to a lot of my friends

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
in the conservation business,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and they --

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I asked them, "So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about?"

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And they said -- this one friend of mine said,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
"I've got one word for you: plastic."

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And I told him, "Well, I need something a little sexier than that.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Plastic just is not going to do it."

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
We sort of worked things out.
