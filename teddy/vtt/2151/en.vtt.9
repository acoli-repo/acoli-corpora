00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
like superheroes in a comic book.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
For instance,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
take these sea turtles.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
They kind of have a sixth sense

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
like Superman's x-ray vision.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And they can use that sense

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I kind of give my turtle hands

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with.
