00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I didn't want to go with this ruthless

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
predator image.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
He's kind of just out there making a living.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And then his sidekick

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
is a sea turtle, as I mentioned before, named Filmore.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
He uses his wonderful skills at navigation

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
to wander the oceans, looking for a mate.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And he does manage to find them,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
but great navigation skills, lousy pick-up lines.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
He never seems

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
to settle on

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
any particular girl.
