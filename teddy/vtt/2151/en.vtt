Cartoons are basically short stories.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Not all of them have happy endings.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So how did I get started cartooning?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I doodled a lot as a kid,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and if you spend enough time doodling,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
sooner or later, something happens:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
all your career options run out.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So you have to make a living cartooning.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Actually, I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when I was about eight or nine.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I was particularly fascinated with sharks.
