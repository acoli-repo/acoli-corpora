00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imagination

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
as a society.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We say to ourselves,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
"Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something."

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So, what I'd like to do now

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
is try a little drawing.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I love to draw the deep sea fish,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
because they are so ugly,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
but beautiful in their own way.
