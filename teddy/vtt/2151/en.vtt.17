00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
This next one here,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I did a story on the census of marine life.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And that was a lot of fun because, as most of you know,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
it's a real project we've heard about.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
But it was a chance for me to introduce readers

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to a lot of crazy undersea characters.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So we start off the story with Ernest,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
who volunteers as a census taker.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Then he meets the yeti crab,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
the famous vampire squid -- elusive, hard to find --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and the Dumbo octopus, which looks so much like a cartoon in real life
