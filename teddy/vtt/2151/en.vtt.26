00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So you go back into the room,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and you break this thing to pieces, and you haul it away.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And you find other things, and you break that up, and you haul those away.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And you hear other people doing the same thing.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So you get this sense of urgency,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And then some yells, "Stop!"

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And they turn up the lights.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And you realize where you are; you're in the Louvre.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And you've taken all this complexity and beauty,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and you've turned it into a cheap commodity.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And that's what we're doing with the ocean.
