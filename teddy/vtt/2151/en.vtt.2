00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's a mystery.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
There's been a lot of folklore

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
developed around the ocean,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
mostly negative.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And that prompted people to make maps like this,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but when you get to the waters edge,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And this is the way I saw the ocean at school --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
as if to say, "All geography and science lessons

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
stop at water's edge.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This part's not going to be on the test."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But that day I flew low over the islands --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it was a family trip to the Caribbean,
