00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So, I sent them to Boise, Idaho,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
where they dropped a plastic bottle

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
into the Boise sewer system.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And it ended up in the Boise River

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and then on to the Columbia River

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and then to the mouth of the Columbia

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and to the Pacific Ocean

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch --

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around --

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and then back onto the lagoon.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So that was basically a buddy story

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
with a plastic bottle following along.
