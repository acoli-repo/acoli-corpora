00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So you have living dinosaurs

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and space aliens,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
could come up with something more interesting than that.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
make it look like it's floating in outer space.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and we saw that?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It would start a whole new space race.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But instead, we stick a camera in the deep ocean,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imagination

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
as a society.
