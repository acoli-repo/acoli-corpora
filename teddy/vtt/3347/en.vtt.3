00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.576
of some famous and obscure paintings

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600
mostly from the Italian Renaissance.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.736
Now, art used to provide me
with a necessary break

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.056
from the hurly-burly of politics

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.456
in my daily work at the ACLU,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.680
but not anymore.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.616

in San Francisco

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.176

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.256
and the crowd was chanting,
"This is what democracy looks like."

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.440
"This is what democracy looks like."

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.536
And there I was holding my sign
and my umbrella in the rain,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.376
and I flashed on an old painting
