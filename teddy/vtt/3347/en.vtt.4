00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.376
and I flashed on an old painting

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.520
that first captivated me many years ago.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.856
I struggled to remember
the different pieces

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.216
of an actual painting

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.440
of good and bad government.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.640
It was almost like the old master
was taunting me.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.360
You want to know
what democracy looks like?

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720
Go back and look at my frescoes.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.160
And so I did.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.936
In 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzetti
finished a monumental commission

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.200
in the governing council chamber
of Siena's Palazzo Pubblico.
