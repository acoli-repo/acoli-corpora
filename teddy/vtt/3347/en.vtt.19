00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.360
Democracy must not be a spectator sport.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.296
The right to protest,
the right to assemble freely,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.216
the right to petition one's government,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.056
these are not just rights.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.576
In the face of Avarice,
Fraud and Division,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.440
these are obligations.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.256
We have to disrupt --

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.040
(Applause)

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.896
We have to disrupt our lives

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.576
so that we can disrupt

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.336
the amoral accretion of power

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.400
by those who would betray our values.
