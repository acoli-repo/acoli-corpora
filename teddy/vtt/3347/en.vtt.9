00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.696
holds a string that comes
off the scales of justice

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.736
that binds her to the citizens,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.560
making them all
compatriots in the republic.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.856
And finally we see Peace.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.336
She looks chilled out,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.736
like she's listening to Bob Marley.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.736
When good government rules,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.640
Peace doesn't break a sweat.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.656
Now, these are big images and big ideas,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.880
but I really love the small stuff.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.896
Along another wall,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.256
Lorenzetti illustrates
the effects of good government

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.656
on the real and everyday lives
of ordinary people
