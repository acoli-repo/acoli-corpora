00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.096
that even Donald Trump
has free speech rights as president,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.176
and an effort to hold him accountable

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.776
for incitement of violence
at his marches or his rallies

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.976
is unconstitutional and un-American.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.176
And when you put that statement out there

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.856
to a very frothy base

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.176
that always is very excited for you
to fight Donald Trump,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.696
and then you have a new one saying,
"Wait, these rights are for everybody,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.616
even the president that we don't like."

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.216
And that's our job.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.376
(Applause)

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.976
CA: Anthony, you spoke
to so many of us so powerfully.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.576
Thank you so much. Thank you.
