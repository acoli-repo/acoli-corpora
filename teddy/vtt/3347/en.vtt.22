Anthony Romero:
I think we have to recognize

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.616
the legitimacy of him as president

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.536
versus the legitimacy of his policies.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.336
And when so many of the policies
are contrary to fundamental values,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.296
that we're all equal under the law,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.896
that we're not judged by the color
of our skin or the religion we worship,

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.656
we have to contest those values

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.936
even as we recognize and honor the fact

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.440
that our democracy rendered us a president
who is championing those values.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.216
CA: And the ACLU isn't just
this force on the left, right?
