00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.936
Now, what's amazing
about these images from 800 years ago

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.880
is that they're familiar to us today.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.856
We see what democracy looks like.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.296
We experience the effects
of good government in our lives,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.280
just as Lorenzetti did in his life.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.896
But it is the allegory of bad government

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.280
that has been haunting me
since November 9.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.776
It's badly damaged,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.680
but it reads like today's newspapers.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.456
And ruling over bad government
is not the Commune

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.680
but the Tyrant.
