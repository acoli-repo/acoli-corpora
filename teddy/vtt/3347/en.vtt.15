00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.696
Treason, half lamb, half scorpion,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.456
lulls us into a false sense of security

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.280
and then poisons a republic.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.200
Fraud, with the flighty wings of a bat.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.320
On the Tyrant's left, you see Division.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.840
She's dressed in Siena's colors.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.696
"Si" and "No" are painted on her body.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.840
She uses a carpenter's saw
to chop her body in half.
