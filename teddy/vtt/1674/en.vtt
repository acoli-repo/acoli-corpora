Joe Kowan: I have stage fright.

00:00:02.074 --> 00:00:03.567
I've always had stage fright,

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:05.395
and not just a little bit,

00:00:05.395 --> 00:00:07.186
it's a big bit.

00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:09.979
And it didn't even matter until I was 27.

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.537
That's when I started writing songs, and even then

00:00:12.537 --> 00:00:14.339
I only played them for myself.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.084
Just knowing my roommates were in the 
same house made me uncomfortable.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.891
But after a couple of years, 
just writing songs wasn't enough.

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.910
I had all these stories and ideas,
and I wanted to share them with people,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.216
but physiologically, I couldn't do it.

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:30.142
I had this irrational fear.
