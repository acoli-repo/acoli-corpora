00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.896
but this year's forecast
was three percent. Why?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.096
In an uncertain global environment,
commodity prices have fallen.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.296
Many of the economies
are still commodity driven,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.880
and therefore their
performance has slipped.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.456
And now the issue of Brexit
doesn't make it any easier.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.096
I never knew that the Brexit could happen

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.256
and that it could be one of the things
that would cause global uncertainty

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.576
such as we have.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.776
So now we've got this situation,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.656
and I think it's time to take stock

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.536
and to say what were the things
that the African countries did right?
