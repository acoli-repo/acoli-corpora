00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.096
We are not creating enough
decent manufacturing jobs for our youth,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.736
and trade among ourselves is low.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.256
Only about 12 percent of our trade
is among ourselves.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.976
So that's another serious problem.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.096
Then governance.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.536
Governance is a serious issue.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.776
We have weak institutions,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.816
and sometimes nonexistent institutions,
and I think this gives way for corruption.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.056
Corruption is an issue that we have not
yet gotten a good enough handle on,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.696
and we have to fight tooth and nail,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.296
that and increased transparency
in the way we manage our economies
