Africa cannot develop in the dark.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.256
The other thing we have not done

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.696
is that our economies
retain the same structure

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.336
that we've had for decades.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.016
So even though we've been growing,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.736
the structure of the economies
has not changed very much.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.336
We are still exporting commodities,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.216
and exporting commodities is what?
It's exporting jobs.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.536
Our manufacturing value-added
is only 11 percent.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.096
We are not creating enough
decent manufacturing jobs for our youth,
