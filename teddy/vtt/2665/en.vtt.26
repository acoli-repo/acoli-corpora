It's a trend, and if we continue,
if we unleash our youth,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.896
if we unleash our women,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.936
we may step backwards sometimes,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.856
we may even step sideways,

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.496
but the trend is clear.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.536
Africa will continue to rise.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.296
And I tell you businesspeople
in the audience,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.776
investment in Africa is not for today,
is not for tomorrow,

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.056
it's not a short-term thing,
it's a longer term thing.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.496
But if you are not invested in Africa,

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.936
then you will be missing

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.216
one of the most important
emerging opportunities in the world.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.456
Thank you.
