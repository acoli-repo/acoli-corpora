00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.456
Thank you.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.000
(Applause)

00:13:39.227 --> 00:13:41.896
Kelly Stoetzel: So you mentioned
corruption in your talk,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.416
and you're known, well-known
as a strong anticorruption fighter.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.976
But that's had consequences.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.936
People have fought back,
and your mother was kidnapped.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.520
How have you been handling this?

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.456
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala:
It's been very difficult.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.816
Thank you for mentioning
the issue of the kidnap of my mother.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.416
It's a very difficult subject.
