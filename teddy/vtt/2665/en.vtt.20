that and increased transparency
in the way we manage our economies

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.776
and the way we manage our finances.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.536
We also need to be wary of new conflicts,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.496
new types of conflicts,

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.736
such as we have with Boko Haram
in my country, Nigeria,

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.816
and with Al-Shabaab in Kenya.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.176
We need to partner
with international partners,

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.056
developed countries,
to fight this together.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.976
Otherwise, we create a new reality

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.256
which is not the type
we want for a rising Africa.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.816
And finally, the issue of education.
