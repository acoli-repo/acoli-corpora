00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.816
And finally, the issue of education.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.136
Our education systems
in many countries are broken.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.696
We are not creating the types of skills
needed for the future.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.360
So we have to find a way
to educate better.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.640
So those are the things
that we are not doing right.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.640
Now, where do we go from there?

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.936
I believe that the way forward
is to learn to manage success.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.696
Very often, when people succeed
or countries succeed,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.920
they forget what made them succeed.
