Tanzania and Senegal are performing
relatively well at the moment.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.256
But what did we do wrong?

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.656
Let me mention eight things.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.856
You have to have
more things wrong than right.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.336
(Laughter)

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.736
So there are eight things we did wrong.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.280
The first was that even though we grew,
we didn't create enough jobs.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.696
We didn't create jobs for our youth.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.656
Youth unemployment on the continent
is about 15 percent,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.720
and underemployment is a serious problem.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.936
The second thing that we did is that
the quality of growth was not good enough.
