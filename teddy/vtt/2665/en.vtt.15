00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.936
The second thing that we did is that
the quality of growth was not good enough.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.496
Even those jobs we created
were low-productivity jobs,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.016
so we moved people
from low-productivity agriculture

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.976
to low-productivity commerce
and working in the informal sector

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.720
in the urban areas.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.040
The third thing
is that inequality increased.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.576
So we created more billionaires.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.296
50 billionaires worth 96 billion dollars

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.160
own more wealth than the bottom
75 million people on the continent.
