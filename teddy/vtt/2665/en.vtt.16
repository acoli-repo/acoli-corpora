00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.160
own more wealth than the bottom
75 million people on the continent.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.496
Poverty,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.896
the proportion of people in poverty --
that's the fourth thing -- did decrease,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.016
but the absolute numbers did not
because of population growth.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.616
And population growth is something

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.056
that we don't have enough
of a dialogue about on the continent.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.216
And I think we will need
to get a handle on it,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.496
particularly how we educate girls.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.160
That is the road to really working
on this particular issue.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:36.696
The fifth thing is that we didn't invest
enough in infrastructure.
