buy fodder for cattle,
feed children in school

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.096
and in short keep the populations home
instead of migrating out of the area.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.976
So these are the kinds of stories

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.616
of an Africa ready
to take responsibility for itself,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.816
and to look for solutions
for its own problems.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.336
But that narrative is being challenged now

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.176
because the continent has not
been doing well in the last two years.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.136
It had been growing
at five percent per annum

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.096
for the last one and a half decades,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.896
but this year's forecast
was three percent. Why?
