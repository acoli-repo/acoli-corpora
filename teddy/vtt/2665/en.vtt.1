I want to tell you two stories
about this rising Africa.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.496
The first has to do with Rwanda,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.936
a country that has gone
through many trials and tribulations.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.456
And Rwanda has decided to become
the technology hub, or a technology hub

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.816
on the continent.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.856
It's a country with mountainous
and hilly terrain,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.096
a little bit like here,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.296
so it's very difficult
to deliver services to people.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.016
So what has Rwanda said?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.696
In order to save lives,
it's going to try using drones

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.936
to deliver lifesaving drugs,
vaccines and blood

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.976
to people in hard-to-reach places

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.496
in partnership with
a company called Zipline,
