00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.536
In 1994, the debt-to-GDP ratio
of African countries was 130 percent,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.816
and they didn't have fiscal space.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.856
They couldn't use their resources
to invest in their development

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.336
because they were paying debt.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.096
There may be some of you in this room
who worked to support African countries

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.416
to get debt relief.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.896
So private creditors, multilaterals
and bilaterals came together

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.536
and decided to do the Highly Indebted
Poor Countries Initiative

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.816
and give debt relief.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.936
So this debt relief in 2005

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.896
made the debt-to-GDP ratio
fall down to about 30 percent,
