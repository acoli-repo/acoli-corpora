The narrative of a rising Africa
is being challenged.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.816
About 10 years ago,
I spoke about an Africa,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.536
an Africa of hope and opportunity,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.496
an Africa of entrepreneurs,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.976
an Africa very different from the Africa
that you normally hear about

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.776
of death, poverty and disease.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.856
And that what I spoke about,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.336
became part of what is known now
as the narrative of the rising Africa.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.696
I want to tell you two stories
about this rising Africa.
