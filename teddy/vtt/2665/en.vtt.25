00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.296
get out of their way,
support them to create and innovate

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.536
and lead the way.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.256
And I know that they will lead us
in the right direction.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.456

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.120
It's a trend.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.536
It's a trend, and if we continue,
if we unleash our youth,
