It's a very difficult subject.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.296
But what it means
is that when you fight corruption,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.736
when you touch the pockets
of people who are stealing money,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.616
they don't just keep quiet.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.296
They fight back, and the issue for you
is when they try to intimidate you,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.776
do you give up, or do you fight on?

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.936
Do you find a way
to stay on and fight back?

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.216
And the answer that I had
with the teams I worked with

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.016
is we have to fight on.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.856
We have to create those institutions.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.096
We have to find ways to stop these people
