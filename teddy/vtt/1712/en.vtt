00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero],

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.
