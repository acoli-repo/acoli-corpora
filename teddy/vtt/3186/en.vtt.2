00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:02.831
And we had actually tried to get into
original content back in 2005,

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:06.458
when we were on DVD only
and buying films at Sundance --

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:09.318
Maggie Gyllenhaal, "Sherrybaby,"
we published on DVD --

00:01:09.342 --> 00:01:10.807
we were a mini studio.

00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:13.490
And it didn't work out,
because we were subscale.

00:01:13.514 --> 00:01:16.687
And then, as you said, in 2011,

00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:20.974
Ted Sarandos, my partner at Netflix
who runs content,

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:23.014
got very excited about "House of Cards."

00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:25.958
And at that time,
it was 100 million dollars,

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:29.815
it was a fantastic investment,

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:32.220
and it was in competition with HBO.
