00:12:57.506 --> 00:13:02.235
Or is it even more about having shows

00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:04.237
that might not have been so much time

00:13:04.261 --> 00:13:06.949
as watching the whole season
of "Nailed It!" or whatever?

00:13:06.973 --> 00:13:09.144
But just get into them more;
they just think,

00:13:09.168 --> 00:13:11.791
"That was nourishing,
that was extraordinary,

00:13:11.815 --> 00:13:14.029
I'm so glad I watched
that with my family."

00:13:14.053 --> 00:13:16.887
Isn't there a version
of the business model

00:13:16.911 --> 00:13:19.474
that would be less content
but more awesome content,

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:22.228
possibly even more uplifting content?

00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:24.737
RH: And people choose
that uplifting content.

00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:27.783
I think you're right, which is,
when people talk about Netflix,

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.815
they talk about the shows that move them:

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:32.648
"13 Reasons Why" or "The Crown."
