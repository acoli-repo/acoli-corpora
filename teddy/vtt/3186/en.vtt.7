00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:35.172
"Narcos," "Jessica Jones,"
"Orange is the New Black," "The Crown,"

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:38.244
"Black Mirror" -- personal favorite --

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:39.633
"Stranger Things" and so on.

00:03:39.657 --> 00:03:41.984
And so, this coming year,

00:03:42.008 --> 00:03:45.474
the level of investment you're planning
to make in new content

00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:47.003
is not 100 million.

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.283
It's what?

00:03:48.307 --> 00:03:51.061
RH: It's about eight billion dollars
around the world.

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.148
And it's not enough.

00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:58.168
There are so many great shows
on other networks.

00:03:58.192 --> 00:04:00.125
And so we have a long way to go.
