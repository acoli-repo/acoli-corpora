00:03:58.192 --> 00:04:00.125
And so we have a long way to go.

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:02.736
CA: But eight billion --

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.625
that's pretty much higher than any other
content commissioner at this point?

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:09.403
RH: No, Disney is in that realm,

00:04:09.427 --> 00:04:12.828
and if they're able to acquire Fox,
they're even bigger.

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.418
And then, really, that's spread globally,

00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:19.909
so it's not as much as it sounds.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.855
(Laughter)

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:26.314
CA: But clearly, from the Barry Dillers
and others in the media business,

00:04:26.324 --> 00:04:28.107
it feels like from nowhere,

00:04:28.131 --> 00:04:31.230
this company has come and has
really revolutionized the business.
