Chris Anderson: I have been long
so fascinated and amazed

00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:05.856
by so many aspects of Netflix.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.152
You're full of surprises, if I may say so.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:12.150
One of those surprises happened,
I think about six years ago.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.586
So, the company back then
was doing really well,

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.669
but you were basically a streaming service

00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:22.498
for other people's films and TV content.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.808
You'd persuaded Wall Street
that you were right

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:28.889
to make the kind of radical shift
away from just sending people DVDs,

00:00:28.913 --> 00:00:30.551
so you were doing it by streaming.
