The algorithm’s one part,
the way we commission the content,

00:15:03.165 --> 00:15:05.365
our relationships with societies.

00:15:05.934 --> 00:15:08.417
So there's a lot of ways
that we have to look at it.

00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:11.965
So if you get too stuck in
"Let's just increase viewing"

00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:13.479
or "Just increase subscribers,"

00:15:13.503 --> 00:15:17.990
you're unlikely to be able to grow
and be the great company you want to be.

00:15:18.014 --> 00:15:20.878
So think of it as this
multiple measures of success.

00:15:21.196 --> 00:15:24.307
CA: So, speaking of algorithms
that have raised questions:

00:15:24.331 --> 00:15:26.236
You were on the board of Facebook,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.335
and I think Mark Zuckerberg --
you've done some mentoring for him.
