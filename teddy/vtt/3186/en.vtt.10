00:04:55.231 --> 00:05:00.508
that allowed you to take such
bold -- I won't say "reckless" --

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:02.450
bold, well thought-through decisions.

00:05:02.474 --> 00:05:03.649
RH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:03.673 --> 00:05:06.387
We did have one advantage,
which is we were born on DVD,

00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:08.656
and we knew that that
was going to be temporary.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.085
No one thought we'd be
mailing discs for 100 years.

00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:14.744
So then you have a lot of paranoia
about what's coming next,

00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:17.561
and that's part of the founding ethos,

00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:19.887
is really worrying
about what's coming next.

00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:21.712
So that's an advantage.

00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:23.333
And then in terms of the culture,

00:05:23.357 --> 00:05:25.452
it's very big on freedom
and responsibility.

00:05:25.476 --> 00:05:28.918
I pride myself on making as few decisions
as possible in a quarter.

00:05:29.717 --> 00:05:31.909
And we're getting better
and better at that.
