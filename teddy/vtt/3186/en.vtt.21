00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:31.585
you watched what they did,
and then found the stuff that,

00:10:31.609 --> 00:10:36.202
"Oh my God, I never knew I would like
a show about making horrible recipes,

00:10:36.226 --> 00:10:37.633
called 'Nailed It!'"

00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:39.138
RH: Called "Nailed It!" Right.

00:10:39.162 --> 00:10:42.061
CA: It's hilarious. I would never
have even thought of that.

00:10:42.085 --> 00:10:43.704
But aren't there risks with this,

00:10:43.728 --> 00:10:48.934
if this go-only-with-revealed-values
approach is taken too far?

00:10:49.434 --> 00:10:52.458
RH: Well, we get a lot of joy
from making people happy,

00:10:52.482 --> 00:10:56.081
Sometimes you just want to relax
and watch a show like "Nailed It!"

00:10:56.736 --> 00:10:59.256
And it's fun, and it's not stressful.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.442
Other times, people want
to watch very intensive film.
