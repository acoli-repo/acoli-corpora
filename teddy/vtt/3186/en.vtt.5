00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:32.854
you know, with the DVD --
next episode, next episode.

00:02:32.878 --> 00:02:35.144
And so that was the trigger
to make us think,

00:02:35.168 --> 00:02:39.077
wow, you know, with episodic content,
especially serialized,

00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:42.289
it's so powerful to have
all the episodes at once.

00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:44.782
And it's something
that linear TV can't do.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.988
And so both of those
made it really positive.

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.934
CA: And so, did it work out on the math
pretty much straight away,

00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.668
that an hour spent watching
"House of Cards," say,

00:02:56.692 --> 00:02:58.665
was more profitable to you

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.417
than an hour spent watching
someone else's licensed content?
