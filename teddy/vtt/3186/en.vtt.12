And if you Google
the Netflix culture deck,

00:06:02.117 --> 00:06:06.601
you see this list of quite surprising
admonitions to your employees.

00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:08.077
Talk about a few of them.

00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:12.821
RH: Well, you know, my first company --
we were very process obsessed.

00:06:12.845 --> 00:06:14.486
This was in the 1990s.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.416
And every time someone made a mistake,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.084
we tried to put a process in place

00:06:18.108 --> 00:06:20.442
to make sure that mistake
didn't happen again --

00:06:20.466 --> 00:06:23.628
so, very semiconductor-yield orientation.

00:06:24.173 --> 00:06:27.236
And the problem is, we were trying
to dummy-proof the system.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.024
And then, eventually,
only dummies wanted to work there.
