00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.537
a word we've heard
a certain amount about this week.

00:08:31.561 --> 00:08:35.566
You've often taken
really surprising stances

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.260
towards building smart
algorithms at Netflix.

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:42.224
Back in the day, you opened up
your algorithm to the world

00:08:42.248 --> 00:08:45.668
and said, "Hey, can anyone do better
than this recommendation we've got?

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.606
If so, we'll pay you a million dollars."

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.317
You paid someone a million dollars,

00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:51.645
because it was like 10 percent
better than yours.

00:08:51.669 --> 00:08:52.820
RH: That's right.

00:08:52.844 --> 00:08:55.377
CA: Was that a good decision?
Would you do that again?

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:58.521
RH: Yeah, it was super exciting
at the time; this was about 2007.

00:08:58.545 --> 00:09:00.537
But you know, we haven't done it again.
