00:08:58.545 --> 00:09:00.537
But you know, we haven't done it again.

00:09:00.561 --> 00:09:03.172
So clearly, it's a very specialized tool.

00:09:03.728 --> 00:09:07.029
And so think of that as
a lucky break of good timing,

00:09:07.053 --> 00:09:08.921
rather than a general framework.

00:09:09.903 --> 00:09:14.387
So what we've done is invest a lot
on the algorithms,

00:09:14.411 --> 00:09:17.245
so that we feature the right content
to the right people

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:19.741
and try to make it fun
and easy to explore.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.667
CA: And you made this, what seems
like a really interesting shift,

00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:24.846
a few years ago.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.800
You used to ask people,
"Here are 10 movies. What do you think?

00:09:29.824 --> 00:09:32.799
Which ones of these
are your best movies?"
