00:06:57.855 --> 00:07:00.625
internally, people are stunned
at how much information --

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.728
all the core strategies, etc.

00:07:02.752 --> 00:07:05.910
We're like the "anti-Apple" --
you know how they compartmentalize?

00:07:05.934 --> 00:07:09.680
We do the opposite, which is:
everybody gets all the information.

00:07:09.704 --> 00:07:13.298
So what we're trying to do is build
a sense of responsibility in people

00:07:13.322 --> 00:07:14.974
and the ability to do things.

00:07:14.998 --> 00:07:18.252
I find out about big decisions now
that are made all the time,

00:07:18.276 --> 00:07:20.668
I've never even heard about it,
which is great.

00:07:20.692 --> 00:07:22.240
And mostly, they go well.

00:07:23.166 --> 00:07:25.712
CA: So you just wake up
and read them on the internet.

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:26.888
RH: Sometimes.

00:07:26.912 --> 00:07:28.553
CA: "Oh, we just entered China!"

00:07:28.577 --> 00:07:30.481
RH: Yeah, well that would be a big one.
