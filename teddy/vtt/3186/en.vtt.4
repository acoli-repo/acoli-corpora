00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.074
(Laughter)

00:02:01.098 --> 00:02:05.074
CA: And with that, it wasn't just
producing new content.

00:02:05.098 --> 00:02:07.711
You also, pretty much with that,
if I understand right,

00:02:07.735 --> 00:02:09.759
introduced this idea of binge-viewing.

00:02:09.783 --> 00:02:13.042
It wasn't, "We're going to do
these episodes and build excitement" --

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.057
boom! -- all at one time.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.746
And that consumer mode
hadn't really been tested.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.236
Why did you risk that?

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.984
RH: Well, you know,
we had grown up shipping DVDs.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.498
And then there were series,
box sets, on DVD.

00:02:24.522 --> 00:02:29.535
And all of us had that experience
watching some of the great HBO content

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:32.854
you know, with the DVD --
next episode, next episode.
