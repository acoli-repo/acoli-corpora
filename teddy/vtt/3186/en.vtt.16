00:08:08.531 --> 00:08:11.738
And so we're very focused
on trying to get to good decisions

00:08:11.762 --> 00:08:15.028
through the debate that always happens.

00:08:15.052 --> 00:08:18.253
And we try not to make it intense,
like yelling at each other --

00:08:18.277 --> 00:08:19.448
nothing like that.

00:08:19.472 --> 00:08:22.163
You know, it's really curiosity
drawing people out.

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:26.189
CA: You've got this other
secret weapon at Netflix, it seems,

00:08:26.213 --> 00:08:28.636
which is this vast trove of data,

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.537
a word we've heard
a certain amount about this week.
