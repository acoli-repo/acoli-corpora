Living in Africa is to be on the edge,

00:00:03.543 --> 00:00:06.297
metaphorically, and quite literally

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:09.929
when you think about connectivity before 2008.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.641
Though many human intellectual and technological leaps

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:16.665
had happened in Europe and the rest of the world,

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:19.254
but Africa was sort of cut off.

00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:21.881
And that changed, first with ships

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:25.158
when we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.259
and also the Industrial Revolution.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.286
And now we've got the digital revolution.
