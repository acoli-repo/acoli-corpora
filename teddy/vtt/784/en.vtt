Chris Anderson: Welcome to TED.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Richard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
CA: Have you met anyone interesting?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
because I had an apology to make to her.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I went home to my wife that night

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and she wanted to know why I had another woman's big,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
massive, big wedding ring on my finger.
