00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.521
in whatever ethnic group they happen

00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:03.783
to have issues with,

00:06:03.783 --> 00:06:05.668
and I think you look back at history,

00:06:05.668 --> 00:06:08.669
and a lot of the terrible things
we've done to each other

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.575
is because one group thinks
another group is sub-human,

00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:13.040
and you can't do that anymore.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.410
We're not just part of the same species.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.177
We're part of the same family.

00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:19.813
We share 99.9 percent of our DNA.

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:22.114
Now the final one is number five,

00:06:22.114 --> 00:06:23.793
a democratizing effect.

00:06:23.793 --> 00:06:27.250
Some genealogy has an elitist strain,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.240
like people say, "Oh, I'm descended

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.511
