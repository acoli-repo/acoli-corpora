00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.571
(Laughter) —

00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:04.535
who is my first cousin's twice removed's

00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:06.927
wife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed's

00:03:06.927 --> 00:03:08.137
niece's husband.

00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:10.272
So six degrees of Kevin Bacon,

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:14.391
plus or minus several degrees.

00:03:14.391 --> 00:03:16.772
Now, I'm not boasting, because all of you

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.667
in your tree, because we are all connected,

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:25.830
and 75 million may seem like a lot,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.556
but in a few years, it's quite likely

00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:30.069
we will have a family tree
