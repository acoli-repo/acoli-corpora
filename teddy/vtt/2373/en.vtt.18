00:08:59.901 --> 00:09:02.996
and figure out how you're on the family tree,

00:09:02.996 --> 00:09:07.189
because these are big issues, family and tribe,

00:09:07.189 --> 00:09:09.907
and I don't know all the answers,

00:09:09.907 --> 00:09:12.756
but I have a lot of smart relatives,

00:09:12.756 --> 00:09:14.337
including you guys,

00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:17.604
so together, I think we can figure it out.

00:09:17.604 --> 00:09:20.259
Only together can we solve these big problems.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:22.289
So from cousin to cousin,

00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:24.681
I thank you. I can't wait to see you.

00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:26.582
Goodbye.

00:09:26.582 --> 00:09:28.520
