10,000 dollars to his Nigerian bank, right?

00:00:31.888 --> 00:00:35.561
I also thought, 80,000 relatives,

00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:36.854
do I want that?

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:38.672
I have enough trouble with some of the ones

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.109
I have already.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.775
And I won't name names, but you know who you are.

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:47.024
But another part of me said, this is remarkable.

00:00:47.024 --> 00:00:49.760
Here I am alone in my office, but I'm not alone at all.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.320
I'm connected to 80,000 people around the world,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.697
and that's four Madison Square Gardens

00:00:56.697 --> 00:00:58.412
full of cousins.

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:01.349
And some of them are going to be great,
