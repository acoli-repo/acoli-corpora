00:06:55.265 --> 00:07:00.185
and there's intermarriage
on an unprecedented scale,

00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:02.411
and this makes some of my
more conservative cousins

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:04.020
a little nervous,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.824
but I actually think it's a good thing.

00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:09.653
I think the more inclusive the idea of family is,

00:07:09.653 --> 00:07:10.680
the better,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.784
because then you have more potential caretakers,

00:07:12.784 --> 00:07:17.099
and as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:19.226
Hillary Clinton says --

00:07:19.226 --> 00:07:20.970
(Laughter) —

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.299
it takes a village.

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:27.562
So I have all these hundreds and thousands,

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:28.680
millions of new cousins.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.421
I thought, what can I do with this information?
