00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:02.673
Six months ago, I got an email

00:00:02.673 --> 00:00:04.080
from a man in Israel

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.461
who had read one of my books,

00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:06.964
and the email said,

00:00:06.964 --> 00:00:08.971
"You don't know me,

00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:11.443
but I'm your 12th cousin."

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:13.820
And it said, "I have a family tree

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.724
with 80,000 people on it, including you,

00:00:17.724 --> 00:00:18.878
Karl Marx,

00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:21.478
and several European aristocrats."

00:00:21.478 --> 00:00:23.880
Now I did not know what to make of this.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.231
Part of me was like, okay,

00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:28.191
when's he going to ask me to wire

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:31.888
10,000 dollars to his Nigerian bank, right?
