00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.827
the Wikipedia approach to family trees,

00:01:31.827 --> 00:01:34.180
collaboration and crowdsourcing,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.358
and what you do is,

00:01:35.358 --> 00:01:38.240
you load your family tree on,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.720
and then these sites search

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.402
to see if the A.J. Jacobs in your tree

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.882
is the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree,

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:48.115
and if it is, then you can combine,

00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:50.010
and then you combine and combine and combine

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.911
until you get these massive,

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.761
mega-family trees

00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.262
with thousands of people on them,

00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:57.677
or even millions.

00:01:57.677 --> 00:02:00.004
