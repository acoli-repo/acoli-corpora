00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:30.069
we will have a family tree

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.820
with all, almost all, seven billion people on Earth.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.613
But does it really matter?

00:03:36.613 --> 00:03:37.955
What's the importance?

00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:39.633
And I do think it is important,

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:42.111
and I'll give you five reasons why, really quickly.

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:44.931
First, it's got scientific value.

00:03:44.931 --> 00:03:48.545
This is an unprecedented history of the human race,

00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:51.976
and it's giving us valuable data

00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:54.125
about how diseases are inherited,

00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:55.993
how people migrate,

00:03:55.993 --> 00:03:58.913
and there's a team of scientists at MIT right now

00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:01.593
studying the world family tree.
