Peering into the eyes 
of different animals,

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:12.383
you’ll see some extraordinarily

00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:13.760
But why?

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:17.055

is a powerful indicator

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:20.141
of what role an animal plays 
in its ecosystem.

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:23.644
Pupils mark the hollow opening
in the iris,

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:26.147

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:29.609
They’re the portholes through which
light enters the eye,

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.613
where it then strikes the retina 
and activates light-sensitive cells,
