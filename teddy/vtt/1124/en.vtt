I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.

00:00:02.246 --> 00:00:04.976
I've been making games
online now for 10 years,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.976
and my goal for the next decade

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.396
is to try to make it as easy
to save the world in real life

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.976
as it is to save the world
in online games.

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:18.617
Now, I have a plan for this,

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:21.554
and it entails convincing more people,

00:00:21.578 --> 00:00:26.435
including all of you, to spend more time
playing bigger and better games.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:30.976
Right now we spend three billion hours
a week playing online games.
