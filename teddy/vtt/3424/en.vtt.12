Each pixel is two-thousandths
of a millimeter wide.

00:06:01.673 --> 00:06:03.077
Two microns.

00:06:03.101 --> 00:06:06.490
That means that spot focus --
full width half max --

00:06:06.514 --> 00:06:08.304
is six to eight microns.

00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:11.654
To give you an idea of what that means:

00:06:12.442 --> 00:06:16.444
that's the diameter of the smallest neuron
in the human brain.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.750
So that means we can focus
through skull and brain to a neuron.

00:06:22.104 --> 00:06:25.738
No one has seen this before,
we're doing this for the first time here.

00:06:26.207 --> 00:06:27.796
It's not impossible.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.762
(Applause)

00:06:29.786 --> 00:06:32.768
We made it work with our system,
so we've made a breakthrough.
