What this means is
that we can focus deep into tissue.

00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:33.815
Our translucency is the first key.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:37.870
Holography enabling de-scattering
is the second key

00:04:37.894 --> 00:04:41.761
to enable us to see deep inside
of our bodies and brains.

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:44.648
You're probably thinking,

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:48.127
"Sounds good, but what about
skull and bones?

00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:52.221
How are you going to see through the brain
without seeing through bone?"

00:04:52.245 --> 00:04:54.533
Well, this is real human skull.

00:04:55.188 --> 00:04:58.323
We ordered it at skullsunlimited.com.
