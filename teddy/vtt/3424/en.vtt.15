And here it is in action.

00:07:30.932 --> 00:07:33.074
We wanted to see how good we could do.

00:07:34.535 --> 00:07:36.596
We've built this over the last year.

00:07:37.626 --> 00:07:39.151
And the result is,

00:07:39.814 --> 00:07:44.151
we're able to find tumors

00:07:44.175 --> 00:07:45.345
in this sample --

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:48.510
70 millimeters deep,
the light going in here,

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:50.748
half a millimeter resolution,

00:07:50.772 --> 00:07:53.060
and that's the tumor it found.

00:07:53.526 --> 00:07:55.987
You're probably looking at this,

00:07:56.011 --> 00:08:01.002
like, "Sounds good,
but that's kind of a big system.
