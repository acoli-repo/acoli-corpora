00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:00.093
(Laughter)

00:05:00.117 --> 00:05:01.355
No kidding.

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:06.103
But we treat this skull with great respect
at our lab and here at TED.

00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:07.723
And as you can see,

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.760
the red light goes right through it.

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:13.447
Goes through our bones.

00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:18.489
So we can go through skull
and bones and flesh with just red light.

00:05:19.268 --> 00:05:22.997
Gamma rays and X-rays do that, too,
but they cause tumors.

00:05:23.637 --> 00:05:26.713
Red light is all around us.

00:05:27.137 --> 00:05:30.041
So, using that, I'm going
to come back here
