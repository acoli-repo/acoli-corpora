Our system could enable this
noninvasively.

00:13:33.932 --> 00:13:38.211
Let me give you three more examples
of what this technology can do.

00:13:38.592 --> 00:13:39.981
One: stroke.

00:13:40.601 --> 00:13:42.868
There's two major kinds of stroke:

00:13:42.892 --> 00:13:45.044
the one caused by clogs

00:13:45.068 --> 00:13:47.029
and another caused by rupture.

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:51.151
If you can determine the type of stroke
within an hour or two,

00:13:51.175 --> 00:13:55.883
you can give medication to massively
reduce the damage to the brain.

00:13:56.358 --> 00:13:57.810
Get the drug wrong,

00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:00.016
and the patient dies.
