00:06:29.786 --> 00:06:32.768
We made it work with our system,
so we've made a breakthrough.

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.593
(Laughter)

00:06:34.617 --> 00:06:37.569
Just to give an idea -- like,
that's not just 50 marbles.

00:06:37.593 --> 00:06:40.490
That's billions, trillion of photons,

00:06:40.514 --> 00:06:43.910
all falling in line as directed
by the hologram,

00:06:43.934 --> 00:06:49.005
to ricochet through
densely scattering brain,

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:51.966
and emerge as a focus.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.998
It's pretty cool.

00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:55.299
We're excited about it.

00:06:55.728 --> 00:06:57.760
This is an MRI machine.

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:59.946
It's a few million dollars,
it fills a room,

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.156
many people have probably been in one.
