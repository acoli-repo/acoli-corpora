00:11:58.612 --> 00:12:00.287
We scan fast.

00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:04.958
Our system may be extraordinary
at finding blood.

00:12:05.534 --> 00:12:09.415
And that's because blood absorbs
red light and infrared light.

00:12:09.439 --> 00:12:11.002
Blood is red.

00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:13.383
Here's a beaker of blood.

00:12:13.407 --> 00:12:14.874
I'm going to show you.

00:12:15.704 --> 00:12:18.771
And here's our laser,
going right through it.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.109
It really is a laser,
you can see it on the -- there it is.

00:12:22.133 --> 00:12:26.074
In comparison to my pound of flesh,

00:12:26.098 --> 00:12:28.526
where you can see
the light goes everywhere.

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.482
So let's see that again, blood.
