00:15:29.815 --> 00:15:33.942
while simultaneously
mapping oxygen use in the brain --

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:36.553
all together in a noninvasive portable

00:15:36.577 --> 00:15:39.363
that can enable
brain-computer communication,

00:15:39.387 --> 00:15:43.713
no implants, no surgery,
no optional brain surgery required.

00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:46.141
This can do enormous good

00:15:46.165 --> 00:15:50.698
for the two billion people
that suffer globally with brain disease.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:57.155
(Applause)

00:15:57.179 --> 00:15:59.069
People ask me how deep we can go.

00:15:59.093 --> 00:16:02.022
And the answer is:
the whole body's in reach.
