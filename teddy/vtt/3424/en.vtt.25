00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.482
So let's see that again, blood.

00:12:32.303 --> 00:12:35.006
This is really key: blood absorbs light,

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:38.195
flesh scatters light.

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:40.521
This is significant,

00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:44.410
because every tumor bigger
than a cubic millimeter or two

00:12:44.434 --> 00:12:48.213
has five times the amount of blood
as normal flesh.

00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:53.691
So with our system, you can imagine
detecting cancers early,

00:12:53.715 --> 00:12:55.855
when intervention is easy,

00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:59.812
or tracking the size of your tumor
as it grows or shrinks.
