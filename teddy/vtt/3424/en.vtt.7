00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:34.014
This is optically similar to human brain.

00:03:34.787 --> 00:03:37.477
I'm going to switch to green light now,

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:41.259
because green light is brighter
to your eyes than red or infrared,

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:43.243
and I really need you to see this.

00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:48.490
So we're going to put a hologram
in front of this brain

00:03:48.514 --> 00:03:51.180
and make a stream of light come out of it.

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:55.760
Seems impossible but it isn't.

00:03:55.784 --> 00:03:57.990
This is the setup you're going to see.

00:03:58.014 --> 00:03:59.164
Green light.
