If we record a hologram
at the bottom inside of the screen,

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:09.815
we can record the position and angle
of each marble exiting the maze.

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:12.853
And then we can bring in
marbles from below

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:20.209
and have the hologram direct each marble
to exactly the right position and angle,

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:25.495
such as they emerge in a line
at the top of the scatter matrix.

00:03:27.162 --> 00:03:29.078
We're going to do that with this.

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:34.014
This is optically similar to human brain.
