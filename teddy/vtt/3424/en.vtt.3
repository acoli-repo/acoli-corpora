00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.395
Can you see it?

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:32.747
Audience: Yes.

00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:37.443
Mary Lou Jepsen: So this means,
using red light and infrared light,

00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:39.924
we can see tumors in human flesh.

00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:42.450
But there's a catch.

00:01:43.534 --> 00:01:45.828
When I throw another
piece of chicken on it,

00:01:47.137 --> 00:01:48.924
the light still goes through,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.450
but you can no longer see the tumor.

00:01:53.188 --> 00:01:55.807
That's because the light scatters.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.917
So we have to do something
about the scatter

00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:00.541
so we can see the tumor.
