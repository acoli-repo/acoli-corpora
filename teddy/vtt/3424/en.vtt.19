00:09:28.306 --> 00:09:31.276
of a multimillion-dollar MRI machine

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.990
into a consumer electronics price point,

00:09:34.014 --> 00:09:39.347
that you could wear as a bandage,
line a ski hat, put inside a pillow.

00:09:39.882 --> 00:09:41.554
That's what we're building.

00:09:41.578 --> 00:09:42.747
(Applause)

00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:44.050
Oh, thanks!

00:09:44.074 --> 00:09:47.049
(Applause)

00:09:47.073 --> 00:09:49.212
So you're probably thinking,

00:09:49.236 --> 00:09:52.069
"I get the light going through our bodies.

00:09:52.911 --> 00:09:55.845
I even get the holography
de-scattering the light.

00:09:56.656 --> 00:09:59.523
But how do we use these new
chip inventions, exactly,

00:09:59.547 --> 00:10:00.802
to do the scanning?"
