00:10:27.347 --> 00:10:30.743
And the red light that goes
through that sonic spot

00:10:30.767 --> 00:10:33.127
changes color slightly,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.685
much like the pitch
of the police car siren changes

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:38.176
as it speeds past you.

00:10:40.042 --> 00:10:41.283
So.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:44.608
There's this other thing about holography
I haven't told you yet,

00:10:44.632 --> 00:10:45.941
that you need to know.

00:10:46.427 --> 00:10:51.196
Only two beams of exactly the same color
can make a hologram.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:57.156
So, that's the orange light
that's coming off of the sonic spot,

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.363
that's changed color slightly,

00:10:59.387 --> 00:11:03.036
and we create a glowing disc
of orange light
