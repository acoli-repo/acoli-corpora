Hologram here, green light going in,

00:04:03.403 --> 00:04:04.553
that's our brain.

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:10.849
And a stream of light comes out of it.

00:04:10.873 --> 00:04:15.603
We just made a brain lase
of densely scattering tissue.

00:04:15.627 --> 00:04:18.897
Seems impossible,
no one's done this before,

00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:21.661
you're the first public audience
to ever see this.

00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:26.471
(Applause)

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:30.162
What this means is
that we can focus deep into tissue.
