00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:34.299
You see this laser pointer
and the spot it makes on my hand?

00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:37.510
The light goes right through my hand --

00:00:37.534 --> 00:00:39.601
if we could bring
the lights down, please --

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:40.806
as I've already shown.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.584
But you can no longer see that laser spot.

00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:45.068
You see my hand glow.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:49.703
That's because the light
spreads out, it scatters.

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:53.434
I need you to understand
what scattering is,

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.260
so I can show you how we get rid of it

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:58.720
and see deep inside our bodies and brains.
