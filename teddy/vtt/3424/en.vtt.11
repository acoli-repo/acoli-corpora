So, using that, I'm going
to come back here

00:05:30.065 --> 00:05:33.468
and show you something more useful
than making a brain lase.

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.183
We challenged ourselves to see how fine
we could focus through brain tissue.

00:05:38.967 --> 00:05:41.069
Focusing through this brain,

00:05:41.093 --> 00:05:45.667
it was such a fine focus,
we put a bare camera die in front of it.

00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:48.088
And the bare camera die ...

00:05:51.454 --> 00:05:53.081
Could you turn down the spotlight?

00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:54.255
OK, there it is.

00:05:55.117 --> 00:05:56.276
Do you see that?

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.576
Each pixel is two-thousandths
of a millimeter wide.
