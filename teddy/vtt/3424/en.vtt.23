00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:32.299
And then we move on
to shift the sonic focus to another spot.

00:11:32.323 --> 00:11:36.283
And that way, spot by spot,
we scan out the brain.

00:11:37.309 --> 00:11:39.952
Our chips decode holograms

00:11:39.976 --> 00:11:45.740
a bit like Rosalind Franklin decoded
this iconic image of X-ray diffraction

00:11:45.764 --> 00:11:48.875
to reveal the structure of DNA
for the first time.

00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:52.571
We're doing that electronically
with our chips,

00:11:52.595 --> 00:11:56.332
recording the image
and decoding the information,

00:11:56.356 --> 00:11:58.184
in a millionth of a second.

00:11:58.612 --> 00:12:00.287
We scan fast.
