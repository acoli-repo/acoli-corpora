at all of the positions
and all of the angles, simultaneously.

00:02:35.173 --> 00:02:36.323
It's amazing.

00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:39.462
To see what we can do with holography ...

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:42.498
You see these marbles?

00:02:42.522 --> 00:02:45.231
Look at these marbles

00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:49.418
as an analogy to light
being scattered by our bodies.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:03.252
If we record a hologram
