00:10:59.387 --> 00:11:03.036
and we create a glowing disc
of orange light

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.679
underneath a neighboring chip

00:11:05.212 --> 00:11:08.839
and then record a hologram
on the camera chip.

00:11:09.362 --> 00:11:10.577
Like so.

00:11:10.601 --> 00:11:15.934
From that hologram, we can extract
information just about that sonic spot,

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.892
because we filter out
all of the red light.

00:11:20.037 --> 00:11:23.964
Then, we can optionally
focus the light back down into the brain

00:11:23.988 --> 00:11:27.171
to stimulate a neuron
or part of the brain.

00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:32.299
And then we move on
to shift the sonic focus to another spot.
