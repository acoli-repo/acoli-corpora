many people have probably been in one.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.720
I've spent a lot of time in one.

00:07:03.744 --> 00:07:06.141
It has a focus of about a millimeter --

00:07:06.165 --> 00:07:08.998
kind of chunky, compared to
what I just showed you.

00:07:09.022 --> 00:07:14.680
A system based on our technology
could enable dramatically lower cost,

00:07:14.704 --> 00:07:16.519
higher resolution

00:07:16.543 --> 00:07:19.036
and smaller medical imaging.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.549
So that's what we've started to do.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.408
My team and I have built a rig, a lab rig

00:07:26.432 --> 00:07:28.288
to scan out tissue.

00:07:28.797 --> 00:07:30.463
And here it is in action.
