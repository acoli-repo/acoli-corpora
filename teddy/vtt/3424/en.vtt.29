00:14:26.085 --> 00:14:30.681
two-thirds of humanity
lacks access to medical imaging.

00:14:31.394 --> 00:14:36.418
Compact, portable, inexpensive
medical imaging can save countless lives.

00:14:37.347 --> 00:14:38.902
And three:

00:14:38.926 --> 00:14:40.988
brain-computer communication.

00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:45.877
I've shown here onstage our system
focusing through skull and brain

00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:48.631
to the diameter of the smallest neuron.

00:14:49.187 --> 00:14:53.474
Using light and sound,
you can activate or inhibit neurons,

00:14:53.498 --> 00:14:56.990
and simultaneously,
we can match spec by spec

00:14:57.014 --> 00:14:59.720
the resolution of an fMRI scanner,

00:14:59.744 --> 00:15:02.252
which measures oxygen use in the brain.
