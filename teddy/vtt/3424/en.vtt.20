00:09:59.547 --> 00:10:00.802
to do the scanning?"

00:10:01.903 --> 00:10:03.969
Well, we have a sound approach.

00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:06.277
No, literally -- we use sound.

00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:11.049
Here, these three discs represent
the integrated circuits

00:10:11.073 --> 00:10:12.538
that we've designed,

00:10:12.562 --> 00:10:17.409
that massively reduce the size
of our current bulky system.

00:10:18.157 --> 00:10:21.577
One of the spots, one of the chips,
emits a sonic ping,

00:10:22.369 --> 00:10:24.023
and it focuses down,

00:10:24.696 --> 00:10:26.777
and then we turn red light on.

00:10:27.347 --> 00:10:30.743
And the red light that goes
through that sonic spot
