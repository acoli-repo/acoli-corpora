00:14:59.744 --> 00:15:02.252
which measures oxygen use in the brain.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:05.617
We do that by looking
at the color change in the blood,

00:15:05.641 --> 00:15:07.974
rather than using a two-ton magnet.

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:15.693
So you can imagine
that with fMRI scanners today,

00:15:16.617 --> 00:15:21.174
we can decode the imagined words,
images and dreams of those being scanned.

00:15:21.665 --> 00:15:24.982
We're working on a system
that puts all three of these capabilities

00:15:25.006 --> 00:15:26.553
into the same system --

00:15:26.577 --> 00:15:29.791
neural read and write
with light and sound,

00:15:29.815 --> 00:15:33.942
while simultaneously
mapping oxygen use in the brain --
