00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:00.541
so we can see the tumor.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.188
We have to de-scatter the light.

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:06.395
So ...

00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:10.633
A technology I spent
the early part of my career on

00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:12.125
enables de-scattering.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.253
It's called holography.

00:02:14.728 --> 00:02:17.664
And it won the Nobel Prize
in physics in the 70s,

00:02:17.688 --> 00:02:21.720
because of the fantastic things
it enables you to do with light.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.146
This is a hologram.

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:29.505
It captures all of the light,
all of the rays, all of the photons

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:34.039
at all of the positions
and all of the angles, simultaneously.
