I've spent the last two decades
inventing, prototype-developing

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:38.248
and then shipping billions of dollars
of consumer electronics --

00:08:38.272 --> 00:08:40.577
with full custom chips --

00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:43.337
on the hairy edge of optical physics.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.601
So my team and I built the big lab rig

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:53.367
to perfect our architecture
and test the corner cases

00:08:53.849 --> 00:08:56.040
and really fine-tune our chip designs,

00:08:56.064 --> 00:08:59.713
before spending the millions of dollars
to fabricate each chip.
