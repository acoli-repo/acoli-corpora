00:00:00.838 --> 00:00:03.021
Cancer affects all of us --

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:06.412
especially the ones that come
back over and over again,

00:00:06.436 --> 00:00:09.432
the highly invasive
and drug-resistant ones,

00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:11.835
the ones that defy medical treatment,

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.375
even when we throw our best drugs at them.

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:18.167
Engineering at the molecular level,

00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:20.839
working at the smallest of scales,

00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:23.386
can provide exciting new ways

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.338
to fight the most aggressive
forms of cancer.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.737
Cancer is a very clever disease.
