00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.984
I mean, every good weapon
needs to be targeted,

00:04:32.008 --> 00:04:36.073
we have to target this superweapon
to the supervillain cells

00:04:36.097 --> 00:04:38.047
that reside in the tumor.

00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:41.344
But our bodies have a natural
immune-defense system:

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:43.867
cells that reside in the bloodstream

00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:46.236
and pick out things that don't belong,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.559
so that it can destroy or eliminate them.

00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:53.019
And guess what? Our nanoparticle
is considered a foreign object.

00:04:53.718 --> 00:04:57.817
We have to sneak our nanoparticle
past the tumor defense system.

00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:04.095
We have to get it past this mechanism
of getting rid of the foreign object
