It is a very aggressive cancer,

00:08:31.334 --> 00:08:34.219
in part because it's discovered
at very late stages,

00:08:34.243 --> 00:08:35.690
when it's highly advanced

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:37.990
and there are a number
of genetic mutations.

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:41.555
After the first round of chemotherapy,

00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:45.969
this cancer comes back
for 75 percent of patients.

00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:49.159
And it usually comes back
in a drug-resistant form.

00:08:50.215 --> 00:08:51.909
High-grade ovarian cancer

00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:54.100
is one of the biggest
supervillains out there.

00:08:54.124 --> 00:08:56.036
And we're now directing our superweapon

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.376
toward its defeat.

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:00.637
