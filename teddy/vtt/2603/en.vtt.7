00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:31.480
it has to be about one one-hundredth
the size of a human hair.

00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:35.605
Let's take a closer look
at how we can build this nanoparticle.

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:39.543
First, let's start
with the nanoparticle core.

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:43.367
It's a tiny capsule that contains
the chemotherapy drug.

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:47.566
This is the poison that will
actually end the tumor cell's life.

00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:51.937
Around this core, we'll wrap a very thin,

00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:54.794
nanometers-thin blanket of siRNA.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.452
This is our gene blocker.

00:03:57.093 --> 00:04:00.682
Because siRNA is strongly
negatively charged,
