00:01:57.462 --> 00:02:00.584
And we need a new and powerful
mode of attack.

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:04.788
Actually, we can turn off a gene.

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:08.669
The key is a set of molecules
known as siRNA.

00:02:09.143 --> 00:02:12.746
siRNA are short sequences of genetic code

00:02:13.253 --> 00:02:16.334
that guide a cell to block a certain gene.

00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:20.557
Each siRNA molecule
can turn off a specific gene

00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:22.151
inside the cell.

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:25.313
For many years since its discovery,

00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:27.287
scientists have been very excited

00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:30.668
about how we can apply
these gene blockers in medicine.
