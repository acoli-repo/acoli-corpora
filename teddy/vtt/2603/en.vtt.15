A nanolayer particle with siRNA
against the chemo pump,

00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:36.846
plus, we have the dox in the core.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.185
And look -- we found that not only
did the tumors stop growing,

00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:43.725
they actually decreased in size

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:46.164
and were eliminated in some cases.

00:07:46.188 --> 00:07:49.444
The tumors were actually regressing.

00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:56.841
(Applause)

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.628
What's great about this approach
is that it can be personalized.
