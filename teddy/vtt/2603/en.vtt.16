00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.628
What's great about this approach
is that it can be personalized.

00:08:01.652 --> 00:08:04.488
We can add many different layers of siRNA

00:08:04.512 --> 00:08:08.070
to address different mutations
and tumor defense mechanisms.

00:08:08.094 --> 00:08:11.379
And we can put different drugs
into the nanoparticle core.

00:08:11.946 --> 00:08:15.153
As doctors learn how to test patients

00:08:15.177 --> 00:08:18.951
and understand certain
tumor genetic types,

00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:22.717
they can help us determine which patients
can benefit from this strategy

00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:25.019
and which gene blockers we can use.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.313
Ovarian cancer strikes
a special chord with me.

00:08:29.337 --> 00:08:31.310
It is a very aggressive cancer,
