00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:04.095
We have to get it past this mechanism
of getting rid of the foreign object

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:05.539
by disguising it.

00:05:05.563 --> 00:05:09.908
So we add one more
negatively charged layer

00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:11.256
around this nanoparticle,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.718
which serves two purposes.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.108
First, this outer layer is one
of the naturally charged,

00:05:17.132 --> 00:05:20.845
highly hydrated polysaccharides
that resides in our body.

00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:26.289
It creates a cloud of water molecules
around the nanoparticle

00:05:26.313 --> 00:05:29.384
that gives us an invisibility
cloaking effect.
