00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:02.003
and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug.

00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:04.179
But how do we carry that out?

00:03:04.764 --> 00:03:06.544
Using molecular engineering,

00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:10.893
we can actually design a superweapon

00:03:11.648 --> 00:03:13.899
that can travel through the bloodstream.

00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:16.919
It has to be tiny enough
to get through the bloodstream,

00:03:16.943 --> 00:03:19.814
it's got to be small enough
to penetrate the tumor tissue,

00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:24.513
and it's got to be tiny enough
to be taken up inside the cancer cell.

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.651
To do this job well,

00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:31.480
it has to be about one one-hundredth
the size of a human hair.
