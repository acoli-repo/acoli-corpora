They're clever, they're adaptable,

00:01:00.184 --> 00:01:02.993
and they're very good at staying alive.

00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:06.406
And, like most supervillains these days,

00:01:06.996 --> 00:01:10.906
their superpowers come
from a genetic mutation.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.682
The genes that are modified
inside these tumor cells

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:20.973
can enable and encode for new
and unimagined modes of survival,

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.472
allowing the cancer cell to live through

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:25.861
even our best chemotherapy treatments.

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.296
One example is a trick
in which a gene allows a cell,
