00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:30.668
about how we can apply
these gene blockers in medicine.

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:32.934
But, there is a problem.

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.418
siRNA works well inside the cell.

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:38.848
But if it gets exposed to the enzymes

00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:41.372
that reside in our bloodstream
or our tissues,

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:43.251
it degrades within seconds.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.085
It has to be packaged, protected
through its journey through the body

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.179
on its way to the final target
inside the cancer cell.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.057
So, here's our strategy.

00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:58.271
First, we'll dose the cancer cell
with siRNA, the gene blocker,

00:02:58.295 --> 00:02:59.891
and silence those survival genes,

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:02.003
and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug.
