There are some forms of cancer,

00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:36.682
which, fortunately, we've learned
how to address relatively well

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:40.098
with known and established
drugs and surgery.

00:00:40.627 --> 00:00:42.604
But there are some forms of cancer

00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:44.860
that don't respond to these approaches,

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:47.512
and the tumor survives or comes back,

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:49.665
even after an onslaught of drugs.

00:00:50.053 --> 00:00:54.047
We can think of these
very aggressive forms of cancer

00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:56.937
as kind of supervillains in a comic book.

00:00:57.455 --> 00:01:00.160
They're clever, they're adaptable,
