00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.296
One example is a trick
in which a gene allows a cell,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.804
even as the drug approaches the cell,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.039
to push the drug out,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.023
before the drug can have any effect.

00:01:40.047 --> 00:01:43.733
Imagine -- the cell effectively
spits out the drug.

00:01:44.393 --> 00:01:47.323
This is just one example
of the many genetic tricks

00:01:47.347 --> 00:01:49.947
in the bag of our supervillain, cancer.

00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:52.131
All due to mutant genes.

00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:57.438
So, we have a supervillain
with incredible superpowers.

00:01:57.462 --> 00:02:00.584
And we need a new and powerful
mode of attack.
