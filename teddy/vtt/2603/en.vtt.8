00:03:57.093 --> 00:04:00.682
Because siRNA is strongly
negatively charged,

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:02.263
we can protect it

00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:07.012
with a nice, protective layer
of positively charged polymer.

00:04:07.503 --> 00:04:10.760
The two oppositely charged
molecules stick together

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:12.220
through charge attraction,

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:14.378
and that provides us
with a protective layer

00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:17.453
that prevents the siRNA
from degrading in the bloodstream.

00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:19.406
We're almost done.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.890
(Laughter)

00:04:20.914 --> 00:04:24.992
But there is one more big obstacle
we have to think about.

00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:27.408
In fact, it may be the biggest
obstacle of all.

00:04:27.432 --> 00:04:29.406
How do we deploy this superweapon?

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.984
I mean, every good weapon
needs to be targeted,
