00:00:58.431 --> 00:01:00.708
started doing science competitions,

00:01:00.732 --> 00:01:03.589
started participating in science fairs,

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:05.489
doing anything I could

00:01:05.513 --> 00:01:08.402
to get the knowledge
that I so desperately wanted.

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:13.871
So while I was studying anatomy
for a competition,

00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:17.895
I came across the topic
of something called chronic wounds.

00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:22.669
And one thing that stood out
to me was a statistic

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:27.783
that said that the number of people
in the United States with chronic wounds

00:01:27.807 --> 00:01:31.387
exceeds the number of people
with breast cancer,
