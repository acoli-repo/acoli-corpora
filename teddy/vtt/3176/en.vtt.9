00:04:28.078 --> 00:04:31.522
I couldn't exactly control
the sensitivity of my sensors.

00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:34.053
I couldn't scale them up or down,

00:04:34.077 --> 00:04:36.157
I couldn't really do
anything of that sort.

00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:37.819
So I wanted something to solve it.

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:40.934
Problem one was easily solved
by some scouting on eBay and Amazon

00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.703
for syringes that I could use.

00:04:42.727 --> 00:04:45.839
Problem two, however,
required a lot more thought.

00:04:45.863 --> 00:04:48.053
So this is where this factors in.

00:04:48.077 --> 00:04:49.717
So what a space-filling curve does

00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:54.156
is it aims to take up all the area it can
within one unit square.

00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:58.914
And by writing a computer program,
you can have different iterations

00:04:58.938 --> 00:05:00.458
of the different curve,
