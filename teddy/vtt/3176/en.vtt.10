00:04:58.938 --> 00:05:00.458
of the different curve,

00:05:00.482 --> 00:05:02.744
which increasingly get close
to one unit square,

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:04.768
but never quite reaches there.

00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:08.653
So now I could control
the thickness, the size,

00:05:08.677 --> 00:05:12.038
I could do whatever I want with it,
and I could predict my results.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.943
So I started constructing my sensors

00:05:15.967 --> 00:05:18.094
and testing them more rigorously,

00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:21.681
using money that I had gotten
from previous science fair awards.

00:05:22.177 --> 00:05:26.065
Lastly, I had to connect this data
in order to be read.

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:28.558
So I interfaced it with a Bluetooth chip,

00:05:28.582 --> 00:05:31.835
which you can see here
by the app screenshots on the right.
