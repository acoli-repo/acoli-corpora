00:02:57.696 --> 00:03:01.061
And essentially, expedite
the healing process.

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:03.685
So that's exactly what I set out to do.

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:08.331
Being a 14-year-old working
out of her garage-turned-lab,

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.395
I had a lot of constraints.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.204
Most being that I wasn't given a grant,
I wasn't given a lot of money,

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:16.766
and I wasn't given a lot of resources.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.305
In addition, I had
a lot of criteria, as well.

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.020
Since this product would be
readily interacting with the body,

00:03:24.044 --> 00:03:26.220
it had to be biocompatible,

00:03:26.244 --> 00:03:28.181
it also had to be low-cost,

00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:31.116
as I was designing it
and paying for it myself.
