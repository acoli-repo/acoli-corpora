00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.013
So that's what I'm currently
in the process of doing.

00:06:00.776 --> 00:06:02.829
However, what I learned was

00:06:02.853 --> 00:06:06.149
what's more important
than the actual thing I designed

00:06:06.173 --> 00:06:09.706
is an attitude that I had
taken on while doing this.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.315
And that attitude was,

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.673
even though I'm a 14-year-old
working in her garage

00:06:15.697 --> 00:06:19.394
on something that she doesn't
completely understand,

00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:22.907
I could still make a difference
and contribute to the field.

00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:26.212
And that's what inspired me to keep going,

00:06:26.236 --> 00:06:30.093
and I hope it inspires many others
to also do work like this
