00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:31.116
as I was designing it
and paying for it myself.

00:03:32.157 --> 00:03:34.379
It also had to be mass-manufacturable,

00:03:34.403 --> 00:03:37.438
because I wanted it to be made
anywhere, for anyone.

00:03:39.442 --> 00:03:41.458
Thus, I drafted up a schematic.

00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:45.974
What you see on the left hand-side
is the early schematics in my design,

00:03:45.998 --> 00:03:51.342
showing both a bird's-eye view
and also one stacking variant.

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:52.541
A stacking variant means

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:57.755
that the entire product is consisted
of different individual parts

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.569
that have to work in unison.

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:03.575
And what's shown there
is one possible arrangement.
