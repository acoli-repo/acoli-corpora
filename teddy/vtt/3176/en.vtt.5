00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.418
In addition, it's estimated
that about two percent of the population

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:34.394
will get a chronic wound
at some point in their lifetime.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.132
This was absurd.

00:02:37.244 --> 00:02:38.991
So as I started doing more research,

00:02:39.015 --> 00:02:40.736
I found that there was a correlation

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.379
between the moisture level
inside a wound dressing

00:02:43.403 --> 00:02:47.283
and the stage of healing
that the chronic wound would be at.

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.657
So I decided, why don't I design something

00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:52.910
to measure the moisture level
within the wound

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:57.242
so this can help doctors and patients
treat their wounds better.

00:02:57.696 --> 00:03:01.061
And essentially, expedite
the healing process.
