00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:03.575
And what's shown there
is one possible arrangement.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.047
So what exactly is this?

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.664
So I had gone on to testing my sensors

00:04:10.688 --> 00:04:14.204
and as all scientists have
stumbles along their work,

00:04:14.228 --> 00:04:17.776
I also had a couple of problems
in my first generation of sensors.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.505
First of all, I couldn't figure out

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.498
how to get a nanoparticle ink
into a printcheck cartridge

00:04:22.522 --> 00:04:24.450
without spilling it all over my carpet.

00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:26.251
That was problem number one.

00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:28.054
Problem number two was,

00:04:28.078 --> 00:04:31.522
I couldn't exactly control
the sensitivity of my sensors.
