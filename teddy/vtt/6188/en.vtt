Pat Mitchell: So I was thinking
about female friendship a lot,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.056
and by the way, these two women,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.456
I'm very honored to say,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.416
have been my friends

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.656

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.360
(Laughter)

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.936
JF: We're in big trouble.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.936
