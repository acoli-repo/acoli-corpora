00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.019
And this is an example

00:01:31.043 --> 00:01:37.895
of the ways our own governments
are using technology

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:39.973
against us, the citizens.

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:46.253
And this is one of the main three sources
of online problems today.

00:01:46.277 --> 00:01:49.267
If we look at what's really
happening in the online world,

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:52.196
we can group the attacks
based on the attackers.

00:01:52.768 --> 00:01:54.576
We have three main groups.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.039
We have online criminals.

00:01:56.063 --> 00:01:58.266
Like here, we have Mr. Dmitry Golubov,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.266
from the city of Kiev in Ukraine.
