00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:31.214
services like Gmail.

00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:35.764
Now we all, or a big part of us,
use Gmail or one of their competitors,

00:05:35.788 --> 00:05:41.576
but these services are especially popular
in totalitarian states like Iran,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.576
where dissidents
use foreign services like Gmail

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.791
because they know they are more
trustworthy than the local services

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:52.576
and they are encrypted
over SSL connections,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.904
so the local government
can't snoop on their discussions.

00:05:56.936 --> 00:05:58.280
Except they can,

00:05:58.304 --> 00:06:02.155
if they hack into a foreign CA
and issue rogue certificates.
