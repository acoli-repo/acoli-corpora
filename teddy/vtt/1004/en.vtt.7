00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.776
In the future, the majority of crime
will be happening online.

00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:39.576
The second major group of attackers
that we are watching today

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.859
are not motivated by money.

00:03:41.883 --> 00:03:43.986
They're motivated by something else --

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.987
motivated by protests,

00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:48.223
motivated by an opinion,

00:03:48.247 --> 00:03:50.418
motivated by the laughs.

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:55.967
Groups like Anonymous
have risen up over the last 12 months

00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:59.947
and have become a major player
in the field of online attacks.
