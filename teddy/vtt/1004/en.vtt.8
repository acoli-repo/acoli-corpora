00:04:01.027 --> 00:04:02.859
So those are the three main attackers:

00:04:02.883 --> 00:04:04.938
criminals who do it for the money,

00:04:04.962 --> 00:04:09.461
hacktivists like Anonymous
doing it for the protest,

00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:12.687
but then the last group
are nation states --

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.750
governments doing the attacks.

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:20.784
And then we look at cases
like what happened in DigiNotar.

00:04:20.808 --> 00:04:24.694
This is a prime example of what happens
when governments attack

00:04:24.718 --> 00:04:26.414
against their own citizens.

00:04:27.152 --> 00:04:32.139
DigiNotar is a certificate
