00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:32.024
It's a question of freedom

00:08:32.048 --> 00:08:33.489
against control.

00:08:34.786 --> 00:08:41.649
And while we might trust our governments
right now, right here in 2011,

00:08:41.673 --> 00:08:45.112
any rights we give away
will be given away for good.

00:08:45.136 --> 00:08:49.717
And do we trust, do we blindly trust,
any future government,

00:08:49.741 --> 00:08:53.025
a government we might have
50 years from now?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.986
And these are the questions

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.223
that we have to worry about
for the next 50 years.
