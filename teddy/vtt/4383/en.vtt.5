Now, I would say, I'm still in recovery
from that early impression.

00:02:32.263 --> 00:02:33.934
I got into journalism

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:39.341
in part because I cared about things
like equality and justice.

00:02:40.563 --> 00:02:44.215
For a long time, racism
was just such a puzzle to me.

00:02:44.894 --> 00:02:48.689
Why is it still with us
when it's so clearly wrong?

00:02:49.418 --> 00:02:52.521
Why such a persistent force?

00:02:53.743 --> 00:02:57.144
Maybe I was puzzled because
I wasn't yet looking in the right place

00:02:57.168 --> 00:02:59.303
or asking the right questions.
