00:15:29.538 --> 00:15:33.318
isn't it easier to see
that it's our problem to solve?

00:15:34.297 --> 00:15:36.097
It's a white people problem.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.171
I'm embarrassed to say
that for a long time,

00:15:39.195 --> 00:15:44.381
I thought of racism as being mainly
a struggle for people of color to fight,

00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:47.366
sort of like the people
on the TV screen when I was a kid.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.763
Or, as if I was on the sidelines
at a sports contest,

00:15:52.787 --> 00:15:54.577
on one side people of color,

00:15:54.601 --> 00:15:57.441
on the other those real racists,

00:15:57.465 --> 00:15:58.816
the Southern sheriff,

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.102
the people in hoods.
