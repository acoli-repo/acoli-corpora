00:10:29.099 --> 00:10:30.406
here we go --

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.199
slave traders tied to the Portuguese crown

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:37.486
had effectively pioneered
the Atlantic slave trade.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.533
They were the first Europeans
to sail directly to sub-Saharan Africa

00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:44.205
to kidnap and enslave African people.

00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:47.526
So it was suddenly really helpful

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.052
to have a story about
the inferiority of African people

00:10:52.076 --> 00:10:54.107
to justify this new trade

00:10:55.206 --> 00:10:56.876
to other people, to the church,

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.499
to themselves.
