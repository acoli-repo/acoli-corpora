00:14:27.843 --> 00:14:31.688
I thought about racism
as being sort of like the flat Earth --

00:14:31.712 --> 00:14:34.708
just bad, outdated thinking
that would fade away on its own

00:14:34.732 --> 00:14:35.966
before long.

00:14:37.962 --> 00:14:39.882
But no, this tool of whiteness

00:14:39.906 --> 00:14:42.751
is still doing the job
it was invented to do.

00:14:43.305 --> 00:14:45.606
Powerful people go to work every day,

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.895
leveraging and reinforcing
this old weapon

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:51.824
in the halls of power,

00:14:51.848 --> 00:14:54.527
in some broadcast studios
we could mention ...

00:14:55.596 --> 00:14:57.051
And we don't need to fuss over

00:14:57.075 --> 00:14:59.441
whether these people
believe what they're saying,

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:01.400
whether they're really racist.
