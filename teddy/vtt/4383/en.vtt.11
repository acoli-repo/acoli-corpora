00:05:26.402 --> 00:05:31.338
I had seen almost no journalism
that looked deeply at whiteness,

00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:35.320
but, of course, people of color
and especially Black intellectuals

00:05:35.344 --> 00:05:37.988
have made sharp critiques
of white supremacist culture

00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:39.463
for centuries,

00:05:39.487 --> 00:05:41.835
and I knew that in the last
two or three decades,

00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:44.438
scholars had done interesting work

00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:47.955
looking at race
through the frame of whiteness,

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.483
what it is, how we got it,
how it works in the world.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.873
I started reading,

00:05:54.897 --> 00:05:59.780
and I reached out to some leading experts
on race and the history of race.
