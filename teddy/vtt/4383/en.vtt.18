00:08:57.671 --> 00:09:00.053
for centuries.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.838
Slavery wasn't about race either,

00:09:02.862 --> 00:09:05.992
because no one
had thought up race yet.

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:08.675
So who did?

00:09:09.404 --> 00:09:12.618
I put that question
to another leading historian,

00:09:12.642 --> 00:09:14.087
Ibram Kendi.

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:16.851
I didn't expect
he would answer the question

00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:19.414
in the form of one person's
name and a date,

00:09:19.438 --> 00:09:21.546
as if we were talking
about the light bulb.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.616
(Laughter)

00:09:23.037 --> 00:09:24.319
But he did.

00:09:24.343 --> 00:09:25.999
(Laughter)

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:29.007
He said, in his exhaustive research,

00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:33.376
he found what he believed to be
the first articulation of racist ideas.
