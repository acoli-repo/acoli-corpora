I think if you had asked me
to speculate on that,

00:07:01.327 --> 00:07:04.349
in my ignorance, some years ago,

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:06.291
I probably would have said,

00:07:06.315 --> 00:07:10.930
"Well, I guess somewhere
back in deep history,

00:07:10.954 --> 00:07:12.920
people encountered one another,

00:07:12.944 --> 00:07:15.302
and they found each other strange.

00:07:15.326 --> 00:07:17.971
'Your skin is a different color,
your hair is different,

00:07:17.995 --> 00:07:19.533
you dress funny.

00:07:19.557 --> 00:07:22.120
I guess I'll just go ahead
and jump to the conclusion

00:07:22.144 --> 00:07:23.448
that since you're different

00:07:23.472 --> 00:07:25.597
that you're somehow less than me,

00:07:25.621 --> 00:07:28.709
and maybe that makes it OK
for me to mistreat you.'"

00:07:29.284 --> 00:07:30.438
Right?
