00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.026
approved and supported

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.291
Martin Luther King and his work
with the civil rights movement

00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:36.867
while Dr. King was still alive.

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:40.729
I'm proud to say my parents
were in that group.

00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:44.029
Race got talked about in our house.

00:01:44.577 --> 00:01:48.757
And when the shows that dealt with race
would come on the television,

00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:51.954
they would sit us kids down,
made sure we watched:

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:54.837
the Sidney Poitier movies, "Roots" ...

00:01:56.238 --> 00:01:57.922
The message was loud and clear,

00:01:57.946 --> 00:01:59.172
and I got it:

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.592
racism is wrong; racists are bad people.
