But for most of human history,

00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:02.469
people had no notion of race.

00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:05.330
In Ancient Greece, for example --

00:08:05.354 --> 00:08:09.141
and I learned this from
the historian Nell Irvin Painter --

00:08:09.165 --> 00:08:13.584
the Greeks thought they were better
than the other people they knew about,

00:08:13.608 --> 00:08:17.528
but not because of some idea
that they were innately superior.

00:08:17.552 --> 00:08:21.475
They just thought that they'd developed
the most advanced culture.

00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:25.721
So they looked around at the Ethiopians,

00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:27.841
but also the Persians and the Celts,

00:08:27.865 --> 00:08:30.807
and they said, "They're all
kind of barbaric compared to us.
