I didn't learn those two facts in school.

00:13:30.424 --> 00:13:32.192
I suspect most of us didn't.

00:13:32.216 --> 00:13:34.732
If you did, you had a special teacher.

00:13:35.324 --> 00:13:36.475
Right?

00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:37.678
But once they sink in,

00:13:38.845 --> 00:13:41.546
for one thing, it becomes clear

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.549
that racism is not mainly
a problem of attitudes,

00:13:45.573 --> 00:13:47.297
of individual bigotry.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.536
No, it's a tool.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.791
It's a tool to divide us
and to prop up systems --

00:13:54.815 --> 00:13:57.603
economic, political and social systems

00:13:57.627 --> 00:14:00.784
that advantage some people
and disadvantage others.
