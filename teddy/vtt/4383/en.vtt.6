Have you noticed

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:07.508
that when people in our mostly white media

00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:10.218
report on what they consider
to be racial issues,

00:03:10.242 --> 00:03:12.752
what we consider to be racial issues,

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:15.587
what that usually means
is that we're pointing our cameras

00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:17.481
and our microphones and our gaze

00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:19.513
at people of color,

00:03:19.537 --> 00:03:21.691
asking questions like,

00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:26.668
"How are Black folks or Native Americans,
Latino or Asian Americans,

00:03:26.692 --> 00:03:28.788
how are they doing?"

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:32.064
in a given community
or with respect to some issue --
