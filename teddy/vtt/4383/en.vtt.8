#OscarsSoWhite --

00:04:01.334 --> 00:04:06.455
all the incidents from
the day-to-day of American life,

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.204
these overtly racist incidents

00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:11.151
that we now get to see
because they're captured on smartphones

00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:12.857
and sent across the internet.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.675
And beneath those visible events,

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.403
the stubborn data,

00:04:18.427 --> 00:04:22.802
the studies showing systemic racism
in every institution we have:

00:04:23.692 --> 00:04:26.947
housing segregation, job discrimination,

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:29.782
the deeply racialized
inequities in our schools

00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:31.606
and criminal justice system.
