00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.102
the people in hoods.

00:16:00.643 --> 00:16:03.997
And I was sincerely rooting
for people of color to win the struggle.

00:16:05.407 --> 00:16:06.885
But no.

00:16:06.909 --> 00:16:08.803
There are no sidelines.

00:16:09.555 --> 00:16:10.869
We're all in it.

00:16:11.249 --> 00:16:12.972
We are implicated.

00:16:14.116 --> 00:16:17.021
And if I'm not joining the struggle
to dismantle a system

00:16:17.045 --> 00:16:19.364
that advantages me,

00:16:19.388 --> 00:16:20.842
I am complicit.

00:16:22.685 --> 00:16:24.769
This isn't about shame or guilt.

00:16:25.408 --> 00:16:27.436
White guilt doesn't get anything done,

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.679
and honestly, I don't feel a lot of guilt.
