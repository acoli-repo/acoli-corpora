racism is wrong; racists are bad people.

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:05.998
At the same time,

00:02:06.022 --> 00:02:09.159
we lived in a very
white place in Minnesota.

00:02:09.848 --> 00:02:11.454
And I'll just speak for myself,

00:02:11.478 --> 00:02:17.433
I think that allowed me to believe
that those white racists on the TV screen

00:02:17.457 --> 00:02:20.037
were being beamed in
from some other place.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.881
It wasn't about us, really.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.530
I did not feel implicated.

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:31.003
Now, I would say, I'm still in recovery
from that early impression.
