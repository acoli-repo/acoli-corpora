Perhaps Emily,

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.739
in weighing the excitement
of the new job offer

00:07:05.763 --> 00:07:09.525
might have also thought about
what that would mean for the cost to Deb

00:07:09.549 --> 00:07:12.239
and what would be owed to Deb

00:07:12.263 --> 00:07:16.207
as a result of her taking on
full-time parenthood.

00:07:17.281 --> 00:07:19.853
So, let's go back to Lisa and Andy.

00:07:19.877 --> 00:07:22.369
Lisa had an inheritance
from her grandmother

00:07:22.393 --> 00:07:23.599
before the marriage.

00:07:23.623 --> 00:07:25.980
And when they got married,
they bought a home,

00:07:26.004 --> 00:07:29.815
and Lisa put that inheritance
toward a down payment on that home.
