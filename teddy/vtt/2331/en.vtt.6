00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:01.633
Three ideas that I want
to put on the table

00:03:01.657 --> 00:03:02.991
for you to consider.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.522
One, sacrifice should be thought of
as a fair exchange.

00:03:10.078 --> 00:03:13.808
Two, there's no such thing
as free childcare.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.689
And three, what's yours
probably becomes ours.

00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:26.508
So let me talk about each of these ideas.

00:03:26.532 --> 00:03:27.898
The first one,

00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:30.176
sacrifice should be a fair exchange.
