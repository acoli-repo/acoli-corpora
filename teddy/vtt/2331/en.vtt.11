00:05:25.687 --> 00:05:30.185
And Andy might have decided
to take that job in that other city

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:33.788
and maybe the two of them
would have commuted for a couple of years

00:05:33.812 --> 00:05:36.240
while Lisa finished her degree.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:40.599
So let's take another couple,
Emily and Deb.

00:05:40.623 --> 00:05:42.056
They live in a big city,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.738
they have two children, they both work.

00:05:44.762 --> 00:05:47.666
Emily gets a job in a small town,

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.402
and they decide to move there together.

00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:54.894
And Deb quits her job
to look after the children full-time.

00:05:55.633 --> 00:05:58.514
Deb leaves behind an extended family,

00:05:58.538 --> 00:05:59.871
her friends

00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:02.028
and a job that she really liked.
