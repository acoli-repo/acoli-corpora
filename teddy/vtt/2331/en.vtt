00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.761
"Till death do us part."

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:07.206
When we get married, we make vows.

00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:10.323
To love, to honor,

00:00:10.347 --> 00:00:11.950
to forsake all others.

00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:15.323
Or as a friend of mine put it,

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:17.527
"Not to leave dirty socks
all over the house."

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:18.918
(Laughter)

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:22.147
We may fall short of some of our promises

00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:23.981
some of the time,

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:28.474
but one that will always hold true
is that first one:

00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:30.323
"Till death do us part."
