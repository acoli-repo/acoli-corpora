00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:30.176
sacrifice should be a fair exchange.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.466
Take the example of Lisa and Andy.

00:03:32.886 --> 00:03:35.728
Lisa decides to go to medical school
early in the marriage,

00:03:35.752 --> 00:03:37.819
and Andy works to support them.

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.263
And Andy works night shifts
in order to do that,

00:03:42.287 --> 00:03:45.588
and he also gives up a great job
in another city.

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:47.954
He does this out of love.

00:03:48.383 --> 00:03:50.097
But of course, he also understands

00:03:50.121 --> 00:03:53.825
that Lisa's degree
will benefit them both in the end.

00:03:54.326 --> 00:04:00.541
But after a few years,
Andy becomes neglected and resentful.
