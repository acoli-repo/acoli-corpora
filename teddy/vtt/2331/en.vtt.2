00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:09.934
what makes a marriage work,

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.537
you should think
about how a marriage ends.

00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:18.759

00:01:20.148 --> 00:01:23.743
what the tacit rules of marriage are.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.950

understand those rules,

00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:33.728
because doing so can help us build
better marriages from the beginning.
