in marriage and in divorce.

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:44.388
So, a mentor of mine once told me,

00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:48.260
"You should always marry
your second husband first."

00:00:48.284 --> 00:00:53.126
(Laughter)

00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:54.860
What did that mean?

00:00:55.276 --> 00:01:00.554
It didn't mean that Mr. Right
is somehow waiting behind door number two.
