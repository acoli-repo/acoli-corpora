00:08:59.045 --> 00:09:00.419
The point is,

00:09:00.443 --> 00:09:03.339
if they had had
a divorce-conscious discussion

00:09:03.363 --> 00:09:05.291
about what to keep separate,

00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:10.425
their marriage might have been
more connected and more together.

00:09:12.187 --> 00:09:15.331
Too often in marriage, we make sacrifices,

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:18.520
and we demand them,

00:09:18.544 --> 00:09:20.477
without reckoning their cost.

00:09:20.815 --> 00:09:24.149
But there is wisdom
in looking at the price tags

00:09:24.173 --> 00:09:26.926
attached to our marital decisions

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.180
in just the way that divorce law
teaches us to do.
