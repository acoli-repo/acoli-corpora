00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and I had no idea where I was.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
where I was going, or where I had come from

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
because we are all essentially permanently displaced people.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
All of us are refugees.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
moving towards a new place.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
