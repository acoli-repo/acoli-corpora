00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and she would teach people, everywhere she went,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
In the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
She saved 1,500 girls from being cut.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
When V-Day met her, we asked her how we could support her

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I could get around a lot faster." So, we bought her a Jeep.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
In the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So, we said, what else could we do?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
She said, "If you help me get money, I could open a house."

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Three years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.
