00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I began "The Vagina Monologues" because I was worried about vaginas.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm very worried today about this notion, this world,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
this prevailing kind of force of security.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Real security, security checks, security watch, security clearance.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure?
