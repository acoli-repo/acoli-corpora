00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You're a heterosexual or a homosexual, or you never have sex.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Or at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You become part of an "us."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In order to be secure, you defend against "them."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You cling to your land because it is your secure place.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You become your nation. You become your religion.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and protect you from doubt or change.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But all this does, actually, is shut down your mind.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
In reality, it does not really make you safer.
