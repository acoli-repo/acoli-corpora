00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and then moving on, I'm fine.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
country to country, and city to city,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
the degree to which women, for example, are violated,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
or I have to take the time now, to process that.
