I think that when that is the focus of your life,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
these are the things that happen.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
as they might confuse you or challenge you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You can't open yourself to new experiences, new people,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You can't not know who you are, so you cling to hard-matter identity.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You become a Christian, Muslim, Jew.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American.
