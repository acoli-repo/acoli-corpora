00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
have never known security,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
or have had their illusion of security forever devastated.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
who were essentially brutalized and censored.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I've been in Bosnian refugee camps.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I was with women in Pakistan

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
who have had their faces melted off with acid.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I've been with girls all across America who were date-raped,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
is that there is this emerging species.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world.
