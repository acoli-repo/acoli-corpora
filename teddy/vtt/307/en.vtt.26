00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
will be raped or beaten in their lifetime,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
we're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
How does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
or thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.
