00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
is that if your end goal is security,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
is that you create not only more insecurity in other people,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
but you make yourself far more insecure.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Real security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Not running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Real security is not knowing something, when you don't know it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Real security is hungering for connection rather than power.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.
