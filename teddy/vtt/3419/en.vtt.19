I am doing my best to embrace this concept
as I move forward with grieving.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.976
In the early months
following Amy's death, though,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.696
I was sure that the feeling of despair
would be ever-present,

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.480
that it would be all-consuming.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.240
Soon I was fortunate
to receive some promising advice.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.856
Many members of the losing-a-spouse club

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.080
reached out to me.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.336
One friend in particular who had also
lost her life partner kept repeating,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.560
"Jason, you will find joy."
