On July 27, just a few months
after Amy's death,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.856
my dad died of complications

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.320
related to a decades-long battle
with Parkinson's disease.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.960
I had to wonder: How much
can the human condition handle?

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.896
What makes us capable
of dealing with this intense loss

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.600
and yet carry on?

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.096
Was this a test?

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.760
Why my family and my amazing children?

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.640
Looking for answers, I regret to say,
is a lifelong mission,
