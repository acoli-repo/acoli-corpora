00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.896
like the moment in the newest
Manchester Orchestra album,

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.216
when the song "The Alien"

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.760
seamlessly transitions
into "The Sunshine,"

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.376
or the haunting beauty
of Luke Sital-Singh's "Killing Me,"

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.096
whose chorus reads,

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.160
"And it's killing me
that you're not here with me.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.760
I'm living happily,
but I'm feeling guilty."

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.096
There is beauty in the simple moments
that life has to offer,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.496
a way of seeing that world
that was so much a part of Amy's DNA,
