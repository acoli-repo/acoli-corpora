00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.720
I have memories of those
final weeks that haunt me.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.840
I remember walking backwards
to the bathroom,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.040
assisting Amy with each step.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.240
I felt so strong.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.176
I'm not such a big guy,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.480
but my arms looked and felt so healthy
compared to Amy's frail body.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.960
And that body failed in our house.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.640
On March 13 of last year,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.880
my wife died of ovarian cancer in our bed.
