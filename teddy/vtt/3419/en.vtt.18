and other family members.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.696
In Japanese Zen, there is a term "Shoji,"

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.320
which translates as "birth death."

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.696
There is no separation
between life and death

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.200
other than a thin line
that connects the two.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.856
Birth, or the joyous,
wonderful, vital parts of life,

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.296
and death, those things
we want to get rid of,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.280
are said to be faced equally.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.856
In this new life that I find myself in,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.000
I am doing my best to embrace this concept
as I move forward with grieving.
