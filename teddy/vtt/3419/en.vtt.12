Just say you heard this guy Jason

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.896
talk about how tough it must be
to have those memories

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.736
and that you're there
if they ever want to talk about it.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.776
They may not want to talk,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.840
but it's nice to connect with someone
living each day with those lasting images.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.760
I know this sounds unbelievable,
but I've never been asked that question.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.800
Amy's essay caused me
to experience grief in a public way.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.680
Many of the readers who reached out to me
wrote beautiful words of reflection.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.896
The scope of Amy's impact
was deeper and richer
