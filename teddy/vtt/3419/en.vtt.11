00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.880
my wife died of ovarian cancer in our bed.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.640
I carried her lifeless body

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.560
down our stairs,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.720
through our dining room

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.280
and our living room

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.840
to a waiting gurney

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.640
to have her body cremated.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.240
I will never get that image
out of my head.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.336
If you know someone who has been
through the hospice experience,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.616
acknowledge that.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.256
Just say you heard this guy Jason
