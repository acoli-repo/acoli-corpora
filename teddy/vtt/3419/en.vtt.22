There was his brother Miles,
walking to the train

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.440
for his first day of work
after graduating college,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.496
who stopped and looked
back at me and asked,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.760
"What am I forgetting?"

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.880
I assured him right away,
"You are 100 percent ready. You got this."

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.856
And my daughter Paris,

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.896
walking together
through Battersea Park in London,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.736
the leaves piled high,

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.880
the sun glistening in the early morning
on our way to yoga.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.136
I would add that beauty
is also there to discover,
