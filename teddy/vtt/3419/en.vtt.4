talking with children
and adults of all ages

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.040
all over the world.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.816
Now, my story of grief is only unique
in the sense of it being rather public.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.640
However, the grieving process itself
was not my story alone.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.400
Amy gave me permission to move forward,
and I'm so grateful for that.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.056
Now, just a little over a year
into my new life,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.520
I've learned a few things.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.656
I'm here to share with you
part of the process of moving forward

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.720
through and with grief.
