00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.696
From observing that my deck had sun
beating down on it on a cold day,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.976
stepping out in it, laying there,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.280
the warmth consuming my body.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.000
The joy comes from my three
stunning children.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.536
There was my son Justin,

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.176
texting me a picture of himself
with an older gentleman

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.136
with a massive, strong forearm
and the caption, "I just met Popeye,"

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.856
with a huge grin on his face.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.336
(Laughter)
