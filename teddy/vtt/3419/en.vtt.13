The scope of Amy's impact
was deeper and richer

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.000
than even us and her family knew.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.216
Some of the responses I received helped me
with the intense grieving process

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.440
because of their humor,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.616
like this email I received
from a woman reader

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.120
who read the article, declaring,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.056
"I will marry you when you are ready --

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.656
(Laughter)

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.760
"provided you permanently stop drinking.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.480
No other conditions.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.000
I promise to outlive you.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.280
Thank you very much."
