00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.136
by stressing what a great relationship
I had with each one of them,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.840
and that I can do it.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.136
I know there will be many times

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.136
where I wish she and I
can make decisions together.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.360
We were always so in sync.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.816
May I be so audacious as to suggest

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.616
that you have these conversations now,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.255
when healthy.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.280
Please don't wait.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.256
As part of our hospice experience,
we organized groups of visitors.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.400
How brave of Amy to receive them,
even as she began her physical decline.
