00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.096
She was my partner in raising
three wonderful, now grown children,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.135
and really, she was my girl, you know?

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.080
We had so much in common.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.896
We loved the same art,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.536
the same documentaries, the same music.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.416
Music was a huge part
of our life together.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.280
And we shared the same values.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.576
We were in love,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.520
and our love grew stronger
up until her last day.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.056
Amy was a prolific author.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.616
In addition to two groundbreaking memoirs,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.040
she published over 30 children's books.
