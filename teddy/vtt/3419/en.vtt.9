00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.400
How brave of Amy to receive them,
even as she began her physical decline.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.016
We had a Krouse night,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.416
her parents and three siblings.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.776
Friends and family were next.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.560
Each told beautiful stories
of Amy and of us.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.480
Amy made an immense impact
on her loyal friends.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.880
But home hospice is not so beautiful
for the surviving family members.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.496
I want to get a little personal here
and tell you that to this date,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.720
I have memories of those
final weeks that haunt me.
