00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:04.833
What I'd like to do today is talk
about one of my favorite subjects,

00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:07.759
and that is the neuroscience of sleep.

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:11.096
Now, there is a sound --

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.126
(Alarm clock)

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.166
Ah, it worked!

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.768
A sound that is desperately
familiar to most of us,

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:21.132
and of course it's the sound
of the alarm clock.

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:24.323
And what that truly ghastly,
awful sound does

00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:29.714
is stop the single most important
behavioral experience

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.708
that we have, and that's sleep.
