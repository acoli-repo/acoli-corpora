don't leave too much of themselves

00:06:01.914 --> 00:06:03.245
in the trunk of their car.

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:06.158
I mean, human beings
are amazing on weekends.

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:09.326
Think about the people that you know
and what they do on Saturdays.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.326
They're artists, carpenters,
chefs and athletes.

00:06:13.086 --> 00:06:16.982
But on Monday, they're back
to being Junior HR Specialist

00:06:17.006 --> 00:06:19.105

(Laughter)

00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:26.252
You know, these narrow job titles
not only sound boring,

00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:28.372
but they're actually
a subtle encouragement

00:06:28.396 --> 00:06:31.436
for people to make narrow
and boring job contributions.
