for people to make narrow
and boring job contributions.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.576
But I've seen firsthand
that when you invite people to be more,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.990
they can amaze us
with how much more they can be.

00:06:38.327 --> 00:06:40.560
A few years ago,
I was working at a large bank

00:06:40.584 --> 00:06:43.680
that was trying to bring more innovation
into its company culture.

00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:46.045
So my team and I designed
a prototyping contest

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.039
that invited anyone to build
anything that they wanted.

00:06:49.704 --> 00:06:51.537
We were actually trying to figure out

00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:53.829
whether or not
the primary limiter to innovation

00:06:53.853 --> 00:06:56.343
was a lack of ideas or a lack of talent,

00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:58.228
and it turns out it was neither one.

00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:00.007
It was an empowerment problem.
