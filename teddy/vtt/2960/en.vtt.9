like clerks and bookkeepers,

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.321
will see the vast majority
of their work disappear.

00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:38.199
To counteract this,
we have to start creating new jobs

00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:40.762
that are less centered
on the tasks that a person does

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:43.652
and more focused on the skills
that a person brings to work.

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.776
For example, robots are great
at repetitive and constrained work,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.749
but human beings have an amazing ability

00:04:49.773 --> 00:04:52.052

00:04:52.076 --> 00:04:54.776
when faced with problems
that we've never seen before.

00:04:55.122 --> 00:04:58.102
It's when every day
brings a little bit of a surprise

00:04:58.126 --> 00:05:00.130
that we have designed work for humans
