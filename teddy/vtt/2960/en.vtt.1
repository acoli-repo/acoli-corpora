00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:33.052
Well, a recent study
from Forrester Research

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:36.239
goes so far to predict
that 25 million jobs

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:38.425
might disappear over the next 10 years.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:40.882
To put that in perspective,

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:45.052
that's three times as many jobs lost
in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:49.078
And it's not just blue-collar jobs
that are at risk.

00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:53.155
On Wall Street and across Silicon Valley,
we are seeing tremendous gains

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.361
in the quality of analysis
and decision-making

00:00:55.385 --> 00:00:57.039
because of machine learning.

00:00:57.063 --> 00:01:00.587
So even the smartest, highest-paid people
will be affected by this change.
