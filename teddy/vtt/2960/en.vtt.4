00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.524
The challenge we face this time,
however, is one of time.

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:06.562
We had a hundred years
to move from farms to factories,

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:09.161
and then 60 years to fully build out
a service economy.

00:02:09.678 --> 00:02:11.003
The rate of change today

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:14.001
suggests that we may only have
10 or 15 years to adjust,

00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:15.728
and if we don't react fast enough,

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:18.508
that means by the time
today's elementary-school students

00:02:18.532 --> 00:02:20.417
are college-aged,

00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:22.582
we could be living
in a world that's robotic,

00:02:22.606 --> 00:02:26.289
largely unemployed and stuck
in kind of un-great depression.

00:02:27.797 --> 00:02:29.736
But I don't think it has to be this way.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.460
You see, I work in innovation,
