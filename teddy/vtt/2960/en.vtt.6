I believe that the key
to preventing our jobless future

00:03:00.355 --> 00:03:02.701
is to rediscover what makes us human,

00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:05.683
and to create a new generation
of human-centered jobs

00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:08.313
that allow us to unlock
the hidden talents and passions

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:09.990
that we carry with us every day.

00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:14.294
But first, I think
it's important to recognize

00:03:14.318 --> 00:03:16.470
that we brought this problem on ourselves.

00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:19.951
And it's not just because, you know,
we are the one building the robots.

00:03:20.507 --> 00:03:23.691
But even though most jobs
left the factory decades ago,

00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:25.652
we still hold on to this factory mindset

00:03:25.676 --> 00:03:27.635
of standardization and de-skilling.

00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:30.876
We still define jobs
around procedural tasks
