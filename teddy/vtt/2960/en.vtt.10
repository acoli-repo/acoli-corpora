00:04:58.126 --> 00:05:00.130
that we have designed work for humans

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:01.423
and not for robots.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.028
Our entrepreneurs and engineers
already live in this world,

00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:07.644
but so do our nurses and our plumbers

00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:09.131
and our therapists.

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:12.806
You know, it's the nature
of too many companies and organizations

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.520
to just ask people to come to work
and do your job.

00:05:16.544 --> 00:05:18.730
But if you work is better done by a robot,

00:05:18.754 --> 00:05:21.551
or your decisions better made by an AI,

00:05:21.575 --> 00:05:23.287
what are you supposed to be doing?

00:05:24.013 --> 00:05:26.497
Well, I think for the manager,

00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:29.918
we need to realistically think about
the tasks that will be disappearing

00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:31.093
over the next few years
