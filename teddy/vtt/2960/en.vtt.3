00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:32.261
Instead, I think the response
needs to be led by us in industry.

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:34.809
We have to recognize
the change that's ahead of us

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.808
and start to design the new kinds of jobs

00:01:36.832 --> 00:01:39.527
that will still be relevant
in the age of robotics.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.652
The good news is that we have
faced down and recovered

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:45.862
two mass extinctions of jobs before.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.733
From 1870 to 1970,

00:01:48.757 --> 00:01:53.165
the percent of American workers
based on farms fell by 90 percent,

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.734
and then again from 1950 to 2010,

00:01:55.758 --> 00:01:57.901
the percent of Americans
working in factories

00:01:57.925 --> 00:01:59.601
fell by 75 percent.
