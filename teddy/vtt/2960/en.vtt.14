00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:00.007
It was an empowerment problem.

00:07:00.698 --> 00:07:02.940
And the results
of the program were amazing.

00:07:04.378 --> 00:07:06.755
We started by inviting
people to reenvision

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:08.894
what it is they could bring to a team.

00:07:08.918 --> 00:07:12.656
This contest was not only a chance
to build anything that you wanted

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.016
but also be anything that you wanted.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.326
And when people were no longer
limited by their day-to-day job titles,

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.497
they felt free to bring all kinds
of different skills and talents

00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:24.007
to the problems
that they were trying to solve.

00:07:24.031 --> 00:07:27.941
We saw technology people being designers,
marketing people being architects,

00:07:27.965 --> 00:07:31.330
and even finance people showing off
their ability to write jokes.
