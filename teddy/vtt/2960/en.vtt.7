00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:30.876
We still define jobs
around procedural tasks

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.388
and then pay people for the number
of hours that they perform these tasks.

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:36.168
We've created narrow job definitions

00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:39.432
like cashier, loan processor
or taxi driver

00:03:39.456 --> 00:03:41.939
and then asked people
to form entire careers

00:03:41.963 --> 00:03:43.593
around these singular tasks.

00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:47.784
These choices have left us with
actually two dangerous side effects.

00:03:47.808 --> 00:03:50.558
The first is that these
narrowly defined jobs

00:03:50.582 --> 00:03:53.005
will be the first
to be displaced by robots,

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:56.014
because single-task robots
are just the easiest kinds to build.

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:59.174
But second, we have accidentally made it

00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:01.326
so that millions of workers
around the world
