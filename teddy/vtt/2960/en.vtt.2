00:00:57.063 --> 00:01:00.587
So even the smartest, highest-paid people
will be affected by this change.

00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:04.384
What's clear is that no matter
what your job is,

00:01:04.408 --> 00:01:06.380
at least some, if not all of your work,

00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:09.796
is going to be done by a robot
or software in the next few years.

00:01:10.918 --> 00:01:13.989
And that's exactly why people
like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates

00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:17.401
are talking about the need for
government-funded minimum income levels.

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:20.767
But if our politicians can't agree
on things like health care

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.070
or even school lunches,

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:24.524
I just don't see a path
where they'll find consensus

00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:27.874
on something as big and as expensive
as universal basic life income.

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:32.261
Instead, I think the response
needs to be led by us in industry.
