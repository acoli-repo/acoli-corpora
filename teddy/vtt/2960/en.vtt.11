00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:31.093
over the next few years

00:05:31.117 --> 00:05:34.989
and start planning for more meaningful,
more valuable work that should replace it.

00:05:35.013 --> 00:05:36.442
We need to create environments

00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:38.705
where both human beings and robots thrive.

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.265
I say, let's give more work to the robots,

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.192
and let's start with the work
that we absolutely hate doing.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:46.592
Here, robot,

00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:48.467
process this painfully idiotic report.

00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:49.914
(Laughter)

00:05:49.938 --> 00:05:51.363
And move this box. Thank you.

00:05:51.387 --> 00:05:53.086
(Laughter)

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.639
And for the human beings,

00:05:54.663 --> 00:05:58.217
we should follow the advice from Harry
Davis at the University of Chicago.

00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:01.890
He says we have to make it so that people
don't leave too much of themselves
