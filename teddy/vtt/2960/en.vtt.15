00:07:27.965 --> 00:07:31.330
and even finance people showing off
their ability to write jokes.

00:07:31.607 --> 00:07:32.757
(Laughter)

00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:34.186
We ran this program twice,

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.006
and each time more than 400 people
brought their unexpected talents to work

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.169
and solved problems that they had been
wanting to solve for years.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.509
Collectively, they created
millions of dollars of value,

00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:49.098
building things like a better
touch-tone system for call centers,

00:07:49.122 --> 00:07:50.790
easier desktop tools for branches

00:07:50.814 --> 00:07:52.339
and even a thank you card system

00:07:52.363 --> 00:07:55.677
that has become a cornerstone
of the employee working experience.

00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.504
Over the course of the eight weeks,

00:07:57.528 --> 00:08:01.061
people flexed muscles that they never
dreamed of using at work.
