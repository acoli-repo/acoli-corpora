00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:03.026
So there's a lot of valid
concern these days

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.255
that our technology is getting so smart

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.027
that we've put ourselves
on the path to a jobless future.

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:11.834
And I think the example
of a self-driving car

00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:13.532
is actually the easiest one to see.

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:16.884
So these are going to be fantastic
for all kinds of different reasons.

00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:20.346
But did you know that "driver"
is actually the most common job

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.159
in 29 of the 50 US states?

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:26.520
What's going to happen to these jobs
when we're no longer driving our cars

00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:27.709
or cooking our food

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.692
or even diagnosing our own diseases?
