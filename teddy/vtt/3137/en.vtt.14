that Westerners rarely
have to think about them.

00:07:01.772 --> 00:07:03.292
So let's explore this.

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:09.508
Imagine your internet access
went off for a day,

00:07:11.158 --> 00:07:13.159
and when it came back,

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:15.469
it only stayed on
for three hours at a time,

00:07:15.493 --> 00:07:17.754
with random 15-hour outages?

00:07:19.027 --> 00:07:20.439
How would your life change?

00:07:21.773 --> 00:07:24.193
Now replace internet access
with electricity.

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.911
Think of your fridges,
your TVs, your microwaves,

00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:30.537
just sitting idly for days.
