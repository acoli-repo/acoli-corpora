00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:30.774
but we need to think about sequencing.

00:06:32.504 --> 00:06:35.193
Forget putting the cart before the horse.

00:06:35.217 --> 00:06:37.883
You can't put the self-driving car
before the roads.

00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:44.653
(Applause)

00:06:44.677 --> 00:06:48.106
There's a whole infrastructural
and logical layer to innovation

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.424
that we take for granted,

00:06:50.448 --> 00:06:53.022
but we have to triage for Africa,

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:56.276
because some of the biggest
infrastructure gaps

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.888
are for things that are so basic

00:06:57.912 --> 00:07:00.244
that Westerners rarely
have to think about them.
