00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:02.630
Now, honesty requires that we acknowledge

00:04:02.654 --> 00:04:04.670
that Africa is behind
the rest of the world

00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:07.224
and needs to move swiftly to catch up.

00:04:08.044 --> 00:04:09.966
But thinking of a way forward,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.124
I'd like us to engage
in a thought exercise.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.339
What if we could go back a hundred years,

00:04:15.363 --> 00:04:17.925
say to the US in 1917,

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.525
but we could take with us
all the modern ideas,

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.869
innovations, inventions
that we have today?

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:28.137
What could we achieve with this knowledge?

00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:32.707
How richly could we improve quality
of life and living conditions for people?
