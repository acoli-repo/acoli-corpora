00:00:00.982 --> 00:00:03.633
As a child growing up in Nigeria,

00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:05.836
books sparked my earliest imagination,

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:10.389
but films, films transported me

00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:13.881
to magical places with flying cars,

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:18.437
to infinite space with whole universes
of worlds to discover.

00:00:19.413 --> 00:00:22.872
And my journey of discovery
has led to many places and possibilities,

00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:26.133
all linked with ideas and imagination.

00:00:27.213 --> 00:00:29.229
A decade and a half ago,

00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:32.328
I moved from working in law
and technology in New York
