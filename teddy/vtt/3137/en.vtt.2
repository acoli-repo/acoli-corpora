Wanuri Kahiu's superb sci-fi flick,

00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:05.152
paint brilliant pictures
of Africa's future,

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:08.017
while Rungano Nyoni's "I Am Not A Witch"

00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:10.073
and Akin Omotoso's "Vaya"

00:01:10.097 --> 00:01:12.858
show us and catalogue our present.

00:01:13.358 --> 00:01:19.041
These filmmakers offer nuanced snapshots
of Africa's imagined and lived reality,

00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:23.469
in contrast to some of the images
of Africa that come from outside,

00:01:23.493 --> 00:01:26.764
and the perspectives
that accompany all of these images,

00:01:26.788 --> 00:01:30.192
whether sympathetic or dismissive,
shape or distort
