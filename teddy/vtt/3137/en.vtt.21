WEBVTT

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:33.873
has taken the country's
words and languages

00:10:33.897 --> 00:10:37.723
into the vocabulary
and imaginations of millions

00:10:37.747 --> 00:10:40.075
in many other African countries.

00:10:40.099 --> 00:10:42.084
It has torn down borders,

00:10:42.108 --> 00:10:44.986

sowed linguistic and geographic
division across Africa.

and boy, Nigerian film speaks it loudly.

00:10:54.845 --> 00:10:57.020
Making Africa's hundred-year leap

00:10:57.044 --> 00:11:00.845
will require that Africans summon
the creativity to generate ideas
