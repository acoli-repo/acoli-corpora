00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.804
If we had access then
to modern semiconductors,

00:05:00.828 --> 00:05:03.327
computers, mobile devices, the internet?

00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:05.778
Just imagine.

00:05:05.802 --> 00:05:10.508
If we did, we could take
a quantum leap forward, couldn't we.

00:05:10.532 --> 00:05:14.389
Well, Africa can take a leap
of that magnitude today.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.163
There's enough untapped innovation

00:05:18.187 --> 00:05:22.315
to move Africa a century forward
in living conditions

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:24.805
if the will and commitment is there.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.394
This is not just a possibility;
it's an imperative for Africa's future,
