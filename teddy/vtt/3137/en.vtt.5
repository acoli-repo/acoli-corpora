00:02:27.053 --> 00:02:33.125
Do we accept Emmanuel Macron's
imagination of Africa in 2017

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:36.664
as a place in which all women
have seven or eight children?

00:02:38.807 --> 00:02:42.038
Or do we instead rely on the UN's account

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:47.125
that only one of Africa's 54 countries
has a fertility rate as high as seven?

00:02:47.843 --> 00:02:49.586
Do we focus on the fact

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.399
that infant mortality
and life expectancy in Africa today

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:56.408
is roughly comparable
to the US a hundred years ago,

00:02:56.432 --> 00:02:58.987
or do we focus on progress,

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:02.242
the fact that Africa has cut
infant mortality in half
