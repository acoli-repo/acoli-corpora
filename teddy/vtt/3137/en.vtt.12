Nigeria had fewer than half a million
working phone lines.

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.021
Today it has a hundred million
mobile phone subscriptions,

00:06:06.045 --> 00:06:09.975
and this mobile miracle
is mirrored in every African country.

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:14.693
There are over three quarters of a billion
mobile phones in use in Africa today,

00:06:14.717 --> 00:06:18.599
and this has spurred justified
excitement about leapfrogging,

00:06:18.623 --> 00:06:22.567
about bringing the sharing economy,
artificial intelligence,

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:24.821
autonomous machines to Africa.

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.631
And this is all promising,

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:30.774
but we need to think about sequencing.
