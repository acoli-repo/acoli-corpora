the fact that Africa has cut
infant mortality in half

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:03.535
in the last four decades

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:07.686
and has raised life expectancy by 10 years
since the year 2000?

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:11.365
These dueling perspectives

00:03:13.327 --> 00:03:14.493
are all accurate.

00:03:14.517 --> 00:03:16.803
Well, aside from Macron's.
He's just wrong.

00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:18.692
(Laughter)

00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:24.256
But one version makes it easy
to dismiss Africa as hopeless,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.534
while the other fuels hope
that a billion people

00:03:26.558 --> 00:03:29.121
can continue to make progress
towards prosperity.
