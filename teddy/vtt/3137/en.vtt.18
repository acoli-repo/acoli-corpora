Beautiful, engaging films

00:09:00.838 --> 00:09:03.235
like these stills of "Pumzi,"

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:06.005
"Vaya," and "I Am Not A Witch" show.

00:09:07.515 --> 00:09:10.925
For while its external image
might be dated,

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:14.301
Africa continues to evolve,
as does African film.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.618
Now, every now and again,
the rest of the world catches on,

00:09:18.642 --> 00:09:22.952
perhaps with Djo Munga's
hard-hitting "Viva Riva!"

00:09:22.976 --> 00:09:25.695
with Newton Aduaka's intense "Ezra,"

00:09:25.719 --> 00:09:28.465
or with Abderrahmane Sissako's
poetic "Timbuktu."

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.472
With mobile, Africans are discovering
more and more of these films,
