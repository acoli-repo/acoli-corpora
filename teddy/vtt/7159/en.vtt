[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]

00:00:05.163 --> 00:00:08.954
One of the hallmarks of living
in a technologically advanced society

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:12.038
is even the little details of life
that seem mundane

00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:13.663
end up being astonishing,

00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:17.788
like the fact that it takes five gallons
of water to produce a walnut,

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.288
or that half the plastic
that's ever been made

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.371
has been made in the past 15 years.

00:00:22.413 --> 00:00:25.204
My favorite of these examples
is what it takes

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:27.704
to keep a room room temperature.

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:29.538
Allow me to explain.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.287
Heating is generally done
by combusting a fossil fuel.
