00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.930
When I was 27 years old,

00:00:02.954 --> 00:00:06.277
I left a very demanding job
in management consulting

00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:10.058
for a job that was even more
demanding: teaching.

00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:13.778
I went to teach seventh graders math

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:15.702
in the New York City public schools.

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:19.083
And like any teacher,
I made quizzes and tests.

00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:21.083
I gave out homework assignments.

00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:23.829
When the work came back,
I calculated grades.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:29.310
What struck me was that IQ
was not the only difference

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:32.470
between my best and my worst students.
