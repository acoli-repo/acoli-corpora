we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition.

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:35.382
Throughout my career, I have responded

00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:37.328
to a number of incidents where the patient

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.965
had minutes left to live

00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:42.090
and there was nothing I could do for them.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.876
With this, I was faced with a dilemma:

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:48.588
Do I tell the dying that they are about to face death,

00:00:48.588 --> 00:00:51.615
or do I lie to them to comfort them?

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:53.808
Early in my career, I faced this dilemma

00:00:53.808 --> 00:00:55.366
by simply lying.

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.295
I was afraid.

00:00:57.295 --> 00:00:59.635
I was afraid if I told them the truth,

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:02.976
that they would die in terror, in fear,
