00:00:00.824 --> 00:00:04.517
I've been a critical care EMT for the past
seven years in Suffolk County, New York.

00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:06.359
I've been a first responder in a number of incidents

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.677
ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy.

00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:11.421
If you are like most people, death might be

00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:13.389
one of your greatest fears.

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.810
Some of us will see it coming.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.809
Some of us won't.

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:18.913
There is a little-known documented medical term

00:00:18.913 --> 00:00:20.859
called impending doom.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.186
It's almost a symptom.

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:23.919
As a medical provider, I'm trained to respond

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.741
to this symptom like any other,

00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.282
so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:29.510
and says, "I'm going to die today,"

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.236
we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition.
