that they would die in terror, in fear,

00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:06.182
just grasping for those last moments of life.

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:08.950
That all changed with one incident.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.799
Five years ago, I responded to a motorcycle accident.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.601
The rider had suffered critical, critical injuries.

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:17.432
As I assessed him, I realized that there was nothing

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:19.399
that could be done for him,

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.664
and like so many other cases,
he looked me in the eye

00:01:22.664 --> 00:01:27.076
and asked that question: "Am I going to die?"

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:30.582
In that moment, I decided to do something different.
