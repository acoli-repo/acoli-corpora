00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:30.582
In that moment, I decided to do something different.

00:01:30.582 --> 00:01:33.462
I decided to tell him the truth.

00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:36.556
I decided to tell him that he was going to die

00:01:36.556 --> 00:01:39.820
and that there was nothing I could do for him.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.596
His reaction shocked me to this day.

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:45.501
He simply laid back and had a look

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.927
of acceptance on his face.

00:01:47.927 --> 00:01:49.630
He was not met with that terror or fear

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.010
that I thought he would be.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.222
He simply laid there, and as I looked into his eyes,

00:01:55.222 --> 00:01:57.950
I saw inner peace and acceptance.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.688
From that moment forward, I decided

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:04.402
it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies.
