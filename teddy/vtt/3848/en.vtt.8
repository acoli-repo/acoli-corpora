00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.319
This came to me very, very early in my career.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.408
I had responded to a call.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.332
There was a female in her late 50s

00:04:04.332 --> 00:04:06.390
severely pinned within a vehicle.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.068
She had been t-boned at a high rate of speed,

00:04:10.068 --> 00:04:12.500
critical, critical condition.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.740
As the fire department worked
to remove her from the car,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.707
I climbed in to begin to render care.

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:20.767
As we talked, she had said to me,

00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:23.980
"There was so much more
I wanted to do with my life."

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.832
She had felt she had not left her mark on this Earth.

00:04:27.832 --> 00:04:29.789
As we talked further, it would turn out

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.197
that she was a mother of two adopted children
