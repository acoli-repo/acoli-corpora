00:03:29.474 --> 00:03:32.118
within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones,

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:35.391
myself, my crew, or anyone around.

00:03:35.391 --> 00:03:38.282
Countless times, I have had a 
patient look me in the eyes

00:03:38.282 --> 00:03:42.220
and say, "Will you remember me?"

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.672
The final pattern I observe

00:03:44.672 --> 00:03:47.900
always touched me the deepest, to the soul.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.440
The dying need to know that their life had meaning.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.222
They need to know that they did not waste their life

00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:57.170
on meaningless tasks.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.319
This came to me very, very early in my career.
