00:07:25.538 --> 00:07:30.552
So as a humanist, I believe
we must not despair for humanity.

00:07:30.576 --> 00:07:33.894
Even in the face
of overwhelming difficulties

00:07:33.918 --> 00:07:36.632
and in the bleakest of circumstances.

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:38.856
Human beings are creative beings.

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:45.672
We have the power to generate new ideas,
new solutions and new cures.

00:07:45.696 --> 00:07:49.443
So why despair when the unexpected
knocks on the horizon?

00:07:49.776 --> 00:07:53.458
It is in our nature to create anew,
to be inventive and innovative,

00:07:53.482 --> 00:07:58.082
so why languish in idle expectation
of a savior from above?

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:02.125
So it is time for us Africans
to take our destiny in our hands
