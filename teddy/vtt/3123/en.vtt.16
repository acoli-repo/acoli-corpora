00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:02.125
So it is time for us Africans
to take our destiny in our hands

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:04.688
and realize we have agency
in the scheme of life.

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:07.935
We need to put an end
to this game of blame

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:11.751
that has prevented us from taking
full responsibility for our own lives.

00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:15.522
For too long, we have been
prisoners of our past.

00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:18.776
We have allowed despair
and pessimism to drain us,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.299
drain our energies,
limit our imaginations

00:08:21.323 --> 00:08:24.855
and dim our vision
for a better and brighter future.

00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:27.387
We have let this continent flounder.

00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:29.720
Why passing the buck like a Frisbee?

00:08:29.744 --> 00:08:32.903
We've blamed slavery, colonialism
and the new colonialism
