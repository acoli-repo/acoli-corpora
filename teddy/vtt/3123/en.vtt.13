but also what is seemingly impossible.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.656
But I realize that at the end of the day,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.164
our efforts do not always
yield our desires.

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:44.442
We fail, we suffer
disappointments and setbacks.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:49.180
Some problems, such as wars and conflict,
poverty and diseases

00:06:49.204 --> 00:06:51.577
and other natural and human-made disasters

00:06:51.601 --> 00:06:53.868
seem as if they may never go away.

00:06:54.538 --> 00:06:58.125
Solutions to old problems
have led to new dangers,

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:01.121
new cures to diseases
have resulted in new health risks.
