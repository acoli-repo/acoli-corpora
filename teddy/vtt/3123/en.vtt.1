00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:32.609
Humanism is a way of thinking and living

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:35.566
that emphasizes the agency
of human beings.

00:00:36.712 --> 00:00:40.157
Humanism stresses the fact
that we, human beings,

00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:42.344
are capable of changing the world.

00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:46.895
That we have the power
to make a difference in our lives,

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:49.625
both individually and collectively,

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.182
without recourse to some outside force.

00:00:53.768 --> 00:00:58.910
It may interest you to know
that the best humanist lessons I learned

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:01.585
were not from reading philosophy books
