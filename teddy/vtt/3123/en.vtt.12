00:05:58.133 --> 00:06:03.161
So as a humanist, I believe
we must be adventurous and even daring.

00:06:03.504 --> 00:06:07.466
The path of success is paved
with risk and uncertainties.

00:06:07.807 --> 00:06:12.203
We have to muster the will and courage
to do what people have never done.

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:14.562
To think what people have never thought.

00:06:14.586 --> 00:06:16.791
Envisage what people have never imagined.

00:06:16.815 --> 00:06:19.244
Go to places human beings
have not been to.

00:06:19.268 --> 00:06:22.611
And succeed where people
have tried but failed.

00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.672
We must be ready to explore new frontiers
of knowledge and understanding

00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:29.426
and attempt doing
not just what is possible

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.791
but also what is seemingly impossible.
