00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:03.466
And if other parts of the world
have moved on,

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.211
why can't we, now?

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:10.315
So as a humanist, I believe
that the past is gone;

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:12.736
we cannot change it, we cannot alter it.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.736
But the future beckons us on
with limitless possibilities

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.879
to recreate, reshape
and remake our destinies.

00:09:19.903 --> 00:09:23.275
So let's all of us seize this opportunity.

00:09:23.728 --> 00:09:27.212
And as my parents did,
begin the urgent task

00:09:27.236 --> 00:09:29.966
of rebuilding Africa, brick by brick.
