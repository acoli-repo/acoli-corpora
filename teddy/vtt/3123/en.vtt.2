00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:01.585
were not from reading philosophy books

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.813
or from poring over humanist
manifestos and declarations.

00:01:06.363 --> 00:01:08.061
No, not at all.

00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:13.394
The best humanist lesson I learned
was from the life of my own parents.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.633
My parents come
from a poor family background

00:01:17.657 --> 00:01:20.005
in Mbaise, in southeastern Nigeria.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.136
They had limited opportunities.

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:28.419
But my parents did not allow
the circumstances of their bad upbringing

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:33.512
to determine the ambition and dreams
for themselves and for their children.
