new cures to diseases
have resulted in new health risks.

00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:03.918
But the fact that these problems persist

00:07:03.942 --> 00:07:06.823
and that solutions sometimes
create their own problems

00:07:06.847 --> 00:07:10.045
is not a reason for us
to give up or to resign.

00:07:10.355 --> 00:07:14.307
It's not a reason for us to think
that our efforts are of no consequence.

00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:17.045
In fact, there is fulfillment in striving,

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:20.196
and trying to provide
answers and solutions

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.212
to the problem humanity faces

00:07:22.236 --> 00:07:24.969
even when the likely outcome is failure.

00:07:25.538 --> 00:07:30.552
So as a humanist, I believe
we must not despair for humanity.
