00:01:54.442 --> 00:02:00.710
combining farming, petty trading
and taking care of my siblings and me.

00:02:01.807 --> 00:02:03.314
By the time I was born --

00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:06.251
that was shortly after
the Nigerian civil war --

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:10.148
life was very difficult,
a struggle day by day.

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:13.387
My family was living in a hut.

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:16.299
With the eye of a child,
I can still see water

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:19.497
dripping from the thatched roof
of our house when it rained.

00:02:20.252 --> 00:02:24.110
My father reared goats
to supplement the family income.

00:02:24.712 --> 00:02:28.506
And part of my duty
after school hours or during vacation

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.196
was to feed these goats.
