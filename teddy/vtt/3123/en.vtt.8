In contrast, millions of Africans
imagine that their religious faith

00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:04.306
will help their dream come true,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.522
and they spend so much time
praying for miracles

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:10.479
and for divine intervention
in their lives.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.228
In 2009, a Gallup survey in 114 countries

00:04:16.252 --> 00:04:22.005
revealed that religiosity was highest
in the world's poorest nations.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:27.553
In fact, six of the 10 countries
where 95 percent of the population

00:04:27.577 --> 00:04:32.661
said that religion was an important part
of their daily lives, were African.
