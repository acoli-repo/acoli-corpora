00:09:30.323 --> 00:09:33.077
Let's give free reign
to our ideas and imaginations,

00:09:33.101 --> 00:09:37.593
as demonstrated at this TEDGlobal 2017.

00:09:37.617 --> 00:09:39.617
Let's open our hearts and minds.

00:09:40.029 --> 00:09:43.934
And exert our energy,
intelligence and ingenuity

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.403
and begin the urgent task
of rebuilding Africa

00:09:47.427 --> 00:09:49.799
and of transforming this continent

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:53.572
into a citadel of unrivaled
prosperity and civilization.

00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:58.712
This is what I believe as a humanist,
as an African humanist.

00:09:58.736 --> 00:09:59.910
Thank you.

00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:06.484
