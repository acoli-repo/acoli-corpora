00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.751
if we recoil and retreat into our shells,
wishing and imagining

00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:36.375
that those problems will somehow
magically disappear.

00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:41.011
The good life that we desire
will not fall like manna from heaven.

00:05:41.442 --> 00:05:45.926
My parents did not erect a block apartment
by wishing and dreaming.

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:50.180
They worked hard, they failed,
they tried again.

00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:52.371
They toiled with rolled-up sleeves,

00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:55.236
with their hands deep in debt,
they plowed ahead,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.569
growing their dreams into reality.

00:05:58.133 --> 00:06:03.161
So as a humanist, I believe
we must be adventurous and even daring.
