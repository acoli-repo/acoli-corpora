00:00:00.682 --> 00:00:03.484
Bacteria are the oldest
living organisms on the earth.

00:00:03.508 --> 00:00:05.529
They've been here for billions of years,

00:00:05.553 --> 00:00:09.506
and what they are are single-celled
microscopic organisms.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.826
So they're one cell

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.522
and they have this special property
that they only have one piece of DNA.

00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:17.474
So they have very few genes
and genetic information

00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:20.496
to encode all of the traits
that they carry out.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.897
And the way bacteria make a living
is that they consume nutrients

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:25.081
from the environment,

00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:26.779
they grow to twice their size,

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:28.682
they cut themselves down in the middle,

00:00:28.706 --> 00:00:31.418
and one cell becomes two,
and so on and so on.
