00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:30.102
from my car-sharing apps.

00:04:30.126 --> 00:04:34.222
Instead, I linked a debit card
that only had 300 dollars a month.

00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:35.444
If I needed more,

00:04:35.468 --> 00:04:38.318
I had to go through the whole process
of adding a new card,

00:04:38.342 --> 00:04:42.794
and we know that every click,
every barrier, changes our behavior.

00:04:42.818 --> 00:04:44.088
We aren't machines.

00:04:44.112 --> 00:04:46.564
We don't carry around an abacus every day,

00:04:46.588 --> 00:04:50.274
adding up what we're spending,
in comparison to what we wanted.

00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:52.552
But what our brains are very good at

00:04:52.576 --> 00:04:55.727
is counting up the number of times
we've done something.

00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:57.536
So I gave myself a limit.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.118
I can only use ride-sharing apps
three times a week.
