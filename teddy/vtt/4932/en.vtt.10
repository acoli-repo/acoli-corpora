00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.118
I can only use ride-sharing apps
three times a week.

00:05:01.142 --> 00:05:03.856
It forced me to ration my travels.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.538
I got a handle on my car-sharing expenses
to the benefit of my husband,

00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:09.809
because of the environmental
changes that I did.

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:12.705
So get a handle on whatever
that purchase is for you,

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.702
and change your environment
to make it harder to do so.

00:05:16.095 --> 00:05:17.896
Those are my tips for you.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.055
But I want you to remember one thing.

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:24.006
As human beings, we can be irrational
when it comes to saving

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.904
and spending and budgeting.

00:05:25.928 --> 00:05:28.174
But luckily, we know this about ourselves,

00:05:28.198 --> 00:05:31.817
and we can predict how we'll act
under certain environments.
