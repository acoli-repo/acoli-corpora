It adds up and decreases
our ability to save.

00:04:02.713 --> 00:04:04.444
Back when I lived in New York City,

00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:05.849
I looked at my expenses

00:04:05.873 --> 00:04:10.063
and saw that I spent over 2,000 dollars
on ride-sharing apps.

00:04:10.087 --> 00:04:12.102
It was more than my New York City rent.

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:13.928
I vowed to make a change.

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:16.914
And the next month,
I spent 2,000 dollars again --

00:04:16.938 --> 00:04:20.753
no change, because the information
alone didn't change my behavior.

00:04:20.777 --> 00:04:22.476
I didn't change my environment.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.035
So now that I was 4,000 dollars
in the hole, I did two things.

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:28.613
The first is that I unlinked
my credit card

00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:30.102
from my car-sharing apps.
