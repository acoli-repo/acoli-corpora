00:00:59.182 --> 00:01:02.067
What I am going to share with you
is how to bridge this gap

00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:03.904
from your intentions to save

00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:05.222
and your actions.

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:06.427
Are you ready?

00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:07.642
Here's number one:

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.413
harness the power of pre-commitment.

00:01:09.437 --> 00:01:12.460
Fundamentally, we think about ourselves
in two different ways:

00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:14.945
our present self and our future self.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:16.620
In the future, we're perfect.

00:01:16.644 --> 00:01:19.000
In the future, we're going to
save for retirement,

00:01:19.024 --> 00:01:20.319
we're going to lose weight,

00:01:20.343 --> 00:01:22.136
we're going to call our parents more.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.285
But we oftentimes forget
that our future self

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:27.349
is exactly the same person
as our present self.

00:01:27.373 --> 00:01:30.952
We know that one of the best times to save
is when you get your tax return.
