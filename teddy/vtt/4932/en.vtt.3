00:01:27.373 --> 00:01:30.952
We know that one of the best times to save
is when you get your tax return.

00:01:30.976 --> 00:01:32.610
So we tried an A/B test.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:36.023
In the first group, we texted people
in early February,

00:01:36.047 --> 00:01:38.499
hopefully before
they even filed for their taxes.

00:01:38.523 --> 00:01:39.682
And we asked them,

00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:43.043
"If you get a tax refund,
what percentage would you like to save?"

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:44.765
Now this is a really hard question.

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.365
They didn't know if they would
receive a tax refund or how much.

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.082
But we asked the question anyway.

00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:54.295
In the second group, we asked people
right after they received their refund,

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.295
"What percentage would you like to save?"

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:57.613
Now, here's what happened.

00:01:57.637 --> 00:02:01.572
In that second condition, when people
just received their tax refund,
