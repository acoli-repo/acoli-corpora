00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:02.124
We all know that saving is important

00:00:02.148 --> 00:00:04.142
and is something that we should be doing.

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.523
And yet, overall, we're doing
less and less of it.

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:09.149
[The Way We Work]

00:00:10.822 --> 00:00:12.409
We know what we need to do.

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:14.568
The question is: How do we do it?

00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:16.418
And that's what I'm here to teach you.

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:19.275
Your savings behavior
isn't a question of how smart you are

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:20.809
or how much willpower you have.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.110
The amount we save depends
on the environmental cues around us.

00:00:24.134 --> 00:00:25.547
Let me give you an example.

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:28.079
We ran a study in which, in one group,

00:00:28.103 --> 00:00:30.999
we showed people
their income on a monthly basis.
