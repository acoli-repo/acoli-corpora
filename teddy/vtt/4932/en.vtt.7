00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:31.737
So right now, put a meeting
request on your calendar

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:33.642
for the day before your next birthday.

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:36.758
Identify the one financial thing
you most want to do.

00:03:37.063 --> 00:03:38.956
And commit yourself to it.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.697
The third and final trick:

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.912
get a handle on small, frequent purchases.

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:45.968
We've run a few different studies

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:50.579
and found that the number one purchase
people say they regret, after bank fees,

00:03:50.603 --> 00:03:51.753
is eating out.

00:03:51.777 --> 00:03:54.555
It's a frequent purchase
we make almost every day,

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.750
and it's death by a thousand cuts.

00:03:56.774 --> 00:03:59.133
A coffee here, a burrito there ...

00:03:59.157 --> 00:04:02.003
It adds up and decreases
our ability to save.
