00:02:57.127 --> 00:03:00.168
In one group, we said,
"Hey, you're getting older.

00:03:00.192 --> 00:03:01.626
Are you ready for retirement?

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.833
House sharing can help."

00:03:02.857 --> 00:03:05.673
In the second group,
we got a little bit more specific

00:03:05.697 --> 00:03:08.079
and said, "You're 64 turning 65.

00:03:08.103 --> 00:03:09.528
Are you ready for retirement?

00:03:09.552 --> 00:03:10.880
House sharing can help."

00:03:10.904 --> 00:03:12.745
What we're doing in that second group

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.261
is highlighting that
a transition is happening.

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:16.436
All of a sudden,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.582
we saw click-through rates,
and ultimately sign-up rates, increase

00:03:19.606 --> 00:03:20.766
when we highlight that.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.507
In psychology, we call this
the "fresh start effect."

00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.706
Whether it's the start of a new year
or even a new season,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.164
your motivation to act increases.

00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:31.737
