00:01:57.637 --> 00:02:01.572
In that second condition, when people
just received their tax refund,

00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:04.717
they wanted to save about 17 percent
of their tax refund.

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:09.257
But in the condition when we asked people
before they even filed their taxes,

00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:13.734
savings rates increased
from 17 percent to 27 percent

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:15.136
when we asked in February.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.330
Why?

00:02:16.354 --> 00:02:18.570
Because you're committing
for your future self,

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:21.293
and of course your future self
can save 27 percent.

00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:23.920
These large changes in savings behavior

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:27.103
came from the fact that we changed
the decision-making environment.

00:02:27.127 --> 00:02:29.546
We want you to be able
to harness that same power.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.830
So take a moment
