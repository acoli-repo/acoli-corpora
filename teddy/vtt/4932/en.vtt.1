WEBVTT

00:00:28.103 --> 00:00:30.999
we showed people
their income on a monthly basis.

00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:34.666
In another group, we showed people
their income on a weekly basis.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.976
And what we found was that people
who saw their income on a weekly basis

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.372
were able to budget better
throughout the month.

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:42.696
Now, it's important to know

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.497
that we didn't change
how much money people were receiving,

00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:48.835
we just changed the environment
in which they understood their income.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.304
And environmental cues
like this have an impact.

00:00:51.328 --> 00:00:54.336
So I'm not going to share tricks with you
that you already know.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.122
I'm not going to tell you
how to open up a savings account

00:00:57.146 --> 00:00:59.158
or how to start saving
for your retirement.

00:00:59.182 --> 00:01:02.067
What I am going to share with you
is how to bridge this gap
