Amber Galloway-Gallego: OK, hi.

00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:04.931
I'm a sign-language interpreter

00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:07.236
that specializes in music interpreting.

00:00:07.704 --> 00:00:11.893
And you're probably wondering
why Deaf people would attend concerts,

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:15.647
but actually, music
is so much more than sound

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.977
simply traveling through the ear.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.343
See, Deaf people experience music,
just in a different way.

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:25.186
For example, my friend Lisa,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.182
she cuts her hair a certain length,

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:30.959
so she feels the vibrations
of sound in the music.
