00:00:07.038 --> 00:00:13.371
In 1963, scientists studying Hubbard Brook
Experimental Forest in New Hampshire

00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:15.288
made a shocking discovery.

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:21.329
Their most recent rainfall samples were
nearly 100 times more acidic than usual.

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:25.288
At these levels, additional downpours
of acid rain

00:00:25.288 --> 00:00:29.288
would destroy the regionâ€™s 
marine and arboreal ecosystems

00:00:29.288 --> 00:00:30.913
in a matter of decades.
