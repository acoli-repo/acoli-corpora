And I took the headmaster to task

00:09:03.052 --> 00:09:06.915
and then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley

00:09:06.915 --> 00:09:10.161
who was unlucky in love, and I just swore up and down

00:09:10.161 --> 00:09:12.277
that this wasn't about me,

00:09:12.277 --> 00:09:16.079
but all these years later it was totally me.

00:09:16.079 --> 00:09:18.207
But it was so cool because I could write these stories,

00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:19.385
I could come up with these ideas,

00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:21.688
and they'd be published in the school paper,

00:09:21.688 --> 00:09:24.298
and people who I didn't know could read them.

00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:27.353
And I loved that thought, of being able to share my ideas

00:09:27.353 --> 00:09:29.683
through the printed page.

00:09:29.698 --> 00:09:32.879
