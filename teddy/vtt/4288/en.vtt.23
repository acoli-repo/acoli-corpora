Celebrate your own style. Don't draw the way you're being told to draw.

00:11:37.002 --> 00:11:39.160
Draw the way you're drawing and keep at it,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.609
because you're really good."

00:11:41.609 --> 00:11:45.183
Now when I was a teenager, I was angsty as any teenager was,

00:11:45.183 --> 00:11:48.696
but after 17 years of having a mother

00:11:48.696 --> 00:11:50.858
who was in and out of my life like a yo-yo

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:57.481
And when I was 17, I met my father for the first time,

00:11:57.481 --> 00:12:01.382
upon which I learned I had a brother and sister I had never known about.
