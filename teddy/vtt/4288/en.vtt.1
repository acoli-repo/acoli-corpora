And when your parent is a drug addict,

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:35.236
it's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football,

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:37.732
because as much as you want to love on that person,

00:00:37.732 --> 00:00:39.970
as much as you want to receive love from that person,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.223
every time you open your heart, you end up on your back.

00:00:43.223 --> 00:00:47.443
So throughout my childhood, my mother was incarcerated

00:00:47.443 --> 00:00:48.869
and I didn't have my father because

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:52.529
I didn't even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade.

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:54.849
But I had my grandparents,

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:57.420
my maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.702
who adopted me just before my third birthday
