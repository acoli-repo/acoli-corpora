00:11:57.481 --> 00:12:01.382
upon which I learned I had a brother and sister I had never known about.

00:12:01.382 --> 00:12:03.302
And on the day I met my father for the first time,

00:12:03.302 --> 00:12:06.066
I was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design,

00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:09.817
my one and only choice for college.

00:12:09.817 --> 00:12:12.209
But it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine

00:12:12.209 --> 00:12:14.709
to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids,

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:17.781
kids with leukemia, and this kid Eric changed my life.

00:12:17.781 --> 00:12:20.346
Eric didn't live to see his sixth birthday,

00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:22.911
and Eric lives with me every day.

00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:26.600
So after this experience, my art teacher, Mr. Shilale,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.792
he brought in these picture books,

00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:29.642
and I thought, "Picture books for kids!"

00:12:29.642 --> 00:12:34.710
and I started writing books for young readers
