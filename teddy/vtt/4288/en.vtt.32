00:15:59.549 --> 00:16:02.109
I have 10 picture books out.

00:16:02.109 --> 00:16:05.509
"Punk Farm," "Baghead," "Ollie the Purple Elephant."

00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:07.793
I just finished the ninth book

00:16:07.793 --> 00:16:10.286
in the "Lunch Lady" series, which is a graphic novel series

00:16:10.286 --> 00:16:12.870
about a lunch lady who fights crime.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.686
I'm expecting the release of a chapter book

00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:19.366
called "Platypus Police Squad: The Frog Who Croaked."

00:16:19.366 --> 00:16:22.936
And I travel the country visiting countless schools,

00:16:22.936 --> 00:16:27.446
letting lots of kids know that they draw great cats.

00:16:27.446 --> 00:16:29.974
And I meet Bagheads.

00:16:29.974 --> 00:16:34.545
Lunch ladies treat me really well.
