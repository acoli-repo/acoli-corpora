00:05:59.913 --> 00:06:02.152
and he said, "Jarrett, it's up to you, but if you'd like to,

00:06:02.152 --> 00:06:04.641
we'd like to send you to the classes at the Worcester Art Museum."

00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:06.238
And I was so thrilled.

00:06:06.238 --> 00:06:07.908
So from sixth through 12th grade,

00:06:07.908 --> 00:06:09.909
once, twice, sometimes three times a week,

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.628
I would take classes at the art museum,

00:06:11.628 --> 00:06:14.660
and I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw,

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.064
other kids who shared a similar passion.

00:06:18.064 --> 00:06:21.023
Now my publishing career began when I designed the cover

00:06:21.023 --> 00:06:23.634
for my eighth grade yearbook,

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:26.901
and if you're wondering about the style of dress I put our mascot in,

00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:29.509
I was really into Bell Biv DeVoe and MC Hammer

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.370
and Vanilla Ice at the time. (Laughter)
