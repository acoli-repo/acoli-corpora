00:01:55.851 --> 00:02:00.652
and the characters that I read about, I fell in love with,

00:02:00.652 --> 00:02:03.727
and they became my friends.

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:06.029
So my best friends in life were the characters

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:08.500
I read about in books.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.587
I went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester, Massachusetts,

00:02:11.587 --> 00:02:14.283
and I had wonderful teachers there,

00:02:14.283 --> 00:02:17.684
most notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch.

00:02:17.684 --> 00:02:21.443
And I just, I can just remember the love that she offered

00:02:21.443 --> 00:02:24.190
us as her students.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.089
When I was in the third grade,

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.832
a monumental event happened.

00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:31.176
An author visited our school, Jack Gantos.
