00:10:26.651 --> 00:10:30.483
and I instantly started making my own animations

00:10:30.483 --> 00:10:32.683
on my own,

00:10:32.683 --> 00:10:35.363
and all throughout high school I made my own animations.

00:10:35.363 --> 00:10:38.460
I convinced my 10th grade English teacher to allow me

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.787
to do my book report on Stephen King's "Misery"

00:10:40.787 --> 00:10:45.551
as an animated short. (Laughter)

00:10:45.551 --> 00:10:48.407
And I kept making comics.

00:10:48.407 --> 00:10:52.351
I kept making comics, and at the Worcester Art Museum,

00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:56.584
I was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given.

00:10:56.584 --> 00:10:59.473
Mark Lynch, he's an amazing teacher

00:10:59.473 --> 00:11:01.688
and he's still a dear friend of mine,
