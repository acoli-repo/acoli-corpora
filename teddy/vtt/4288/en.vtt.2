00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.702
who adopted me just before my third birthday

00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:02.164
and took me in as their own,

00:01:02.164 --> 00:01:04.092
after they had already raised five children.

00:01:04.092 --> 00:01:07.302
So two people who grew up in the Great Depression,

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:12.340
there in the very, very early '80s took on a new kid.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.398
I was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom

00:01:14.398 --> 00:01:16.504
of the Krosoczka family,

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:19.085
the new kid who came out of nowhere.

00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:23.228
And I would like to say that life was totally easy with them.

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:26.321
They each smoked two packs a day, each, nonfiltered,

00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:28.524
and by the time I was six,

00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:30.627
I could order a Southern Comfort Manhattan,
