I started calling him "Monkey Boy,"

00:14:00.469 --> 00:14:04.150
and I went home and wrote a book called "Good Night, Monkey Boy."

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.432
And I sent out one last batch of postcards.

00:14:07.432 --> 00:14:10.806
And I received an email from an editor at Random House

00:14:10.806 --> 00:14:14.557
with a subject line, "Nice work!" Exclamation point.

00:14:14.557 --> 00:14:16.345
"Dear Jarrett, I received your postcard.

00:14:16.345 --> 00:14:19.108
I liked your art, so I went to your website

00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:23.069
and I'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories,

00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:25.735
because I really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them.

00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:29.806
Please let me know if you're ever in New York City."

00:14:29.806 --> 00:14:33.108
And this was from an editor at Random House Children's Books.
