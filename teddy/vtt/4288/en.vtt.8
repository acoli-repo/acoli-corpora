00:03:56.774 --> 00:04:00.461
and I sometimes let the words have the stage on their own,

00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:03.531
and sometimes I allowed the pictures to work on their own

00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:05.766
to tell the story.

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:09.112
My favorite page is the "About the author" page.

00:04:09.112 --> 00:04:11.351
(Laughter)

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.194
So I learned to write about myself in third person

00:04:14.194 --> 00:04:17.314
at a young age.

00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:20.838
So I love that last sentence: "He liked making this book."

00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:24.769
And I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination,

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:25.954
and that's what writing is.

00:04:25.954 --> 00:04:28.469
Writing is using your imagination on paper,

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.440
and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now
