00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:00.409
and I thought, "Oh no, I'm doomed.

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:03.614
My grandfather's just going to kill me."

00:08:03.614 --> 00:08:05.175
And he came out to the hallway and he said,

00:08:05.175 --> 00:08:06.293
"Let me see the paper."

00:08:06.293 --> 00:08:11.357
And I thought, "Oh no. He thinks it's a note."

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:14.193
And so I took this picture, and I handed it to him.

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:17.406
And we sat in silence for that brief moment,

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:19.554
and he said to me,

00:08:19.554 --> 00:08:22.917
"You're really talented." (Laughter)

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:25.606
"You're really good. You know, the school newspaper

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:27.989
needs a new cartoonist, and you should be the cartoonist.

00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:31.615
Just stop drawing in my class."
