and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.497

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.578

00:04:44.578 --> 00:04:47.073

and I would staple them together,

00:04:48.994 --> 00:04:51.834
and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:55.510
