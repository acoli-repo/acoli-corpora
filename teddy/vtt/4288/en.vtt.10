00:04:57.622 --> 00:05:00.682
There was an egg, a tomato, a head of lettuce and a pumpkin,

00:05:00.682 --> 00:05:03.156
and they all lived in this refrigerator city,

00:05:03.156 --> 00:05:05.978
and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:07.381
that was filled with so many dangers

00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:12.065
like an evil blender who tried to chop them up,

00:05:12.065 --> 00:05:18.007
an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple,

00:05:18.007 --> 00:05:20.362
and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:23.759
who was a stick of butter. (Laughter)

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.962
And I'd make my own comics too,

00:05:25.962 --> 00:05:28.099
and this was another way for me to tell stories,

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.330
through words and through pictures.
