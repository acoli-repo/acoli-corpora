00:10:59.473 --> 00:11:01.688
and he's still a dear friend of mine,

00:11:01.688 --> 00:11:04.095
and I was 14 or 15,

00:11:04.095 --> 00:11:07.116
and I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course,

00:11:07.116 --> 00:11:08.930
and I was so excited, I was beaming.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.231
I had this book that was how to draw comics in the Marvel way,

00:11:12.231 --> 00:11:14.536
and it taught me how to draw superheroes,

00:11:14.536 --> 00:11:16.864
how to draw a woman, how to draw muscles

00:11:16.864 --> 00:11:18.790
just the way they were supposed to be

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.615
if I were to ever draw for X-Men or Spiderman.

00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:24.507
And all the color just drained from his face,

00:11:24.507 --> 00:11:26.246
and he looked at me, and he said,

00:11:26.246 --> 00:11:29.016
"Forget everything you learned."

00:11:29.016 --> 00:11:32.840
And I didn't understand. He said, "You have a great style.
