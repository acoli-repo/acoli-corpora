00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:31.176
An author visited our school, Jack Gantos.

00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:34.616
A published author of books came to talk to us

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:37.114
about what he did for a living.

00:02:37.114 --> 00:02:40.488
And afterwards, we all went back to our classrooms

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:43.062
and we drew our own renditions of his main character,

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:44.511
Rotten Ralph.

00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:47.368
And suddenly the author appeared in our doorway,

00:02:47.368 --> 00:02:50.320
and I remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.940
going from kid to kid looking at the desks, not saying a word.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.137
But he stopped next to my desk,

00:02:57.137 --> 00:02:59.637
and he tapped on my desk, and he said,

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.991
"Nice cat." (Laughter)
