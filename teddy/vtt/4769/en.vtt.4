and make it deaf 
to the pituitary's guiding commands.

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:05.171
The first problem this causes 
is hyperthyroidism,

00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:09.237
which happens when the organ sends out
too many hormones.

00:02:09.237 --> 00:02:11.959
That means the cells 
are overloaded with instructions

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.665
to consume nutrients and oxygen.

00:02:14.665 --> 00:02:17.228
They become overactive as a result,

00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:21.895
meaning a person with hyperthyroidism
experiences a higher metabolism

00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:27.131
signaled by a faster heartbeat,
constant hunger, and rapid weight loss.

00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:32.041
They also feel hot, sweaty, anxious,
and find it difficult to sleep.
