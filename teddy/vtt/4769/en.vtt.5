The opposite problem is hypothyroidism,

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:38.863
which happens when the thyroid 
sends out too few hormones,

00:02:38.863 --> 00:02:42.847
meaning the body's cells don't have
as many messengers to guide them.

00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:47.279
In response, cells grow listless
and metabolism slows.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.042
People with hypothyroidism
see symptoms in weight gain,

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:57.341
sluggishness, sensitivity to cold, 
swollen joints and feeling low.

00:02:57.341 --> 00:02:59.268
Luckily, there are medical treatments

00:02:59.268 --> 00:03:02.192
that can help trigger 
the thyroid's activities again,
