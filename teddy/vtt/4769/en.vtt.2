the series of reactions our cells perform
to provide us with energy.

00:01:02.936 --> 00:01:05.379
This hormonal notification 
from the thyroid

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.015
gets the heart pumping more efficiently,

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:11.298
and makes our cells 
break down nutrients faster.

00:01:11.298 --> 00:01:12.808
When you need more energy,

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:17.270
the thyroid helps by sending out 
hormones to increase metabolism.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.344
Ultimately, the thyroid allows our cells

00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:27.709
The thyroid is controlled by
the pituitary gland,

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.341
a hormonal gland deep in the brain
that oversees the thyroid's tasks,
