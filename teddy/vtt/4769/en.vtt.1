00:00:29.523 --> 00:00:32.894
This high-ranking organ 
is made up of lobules

00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:36.179
that each contains smaller cells
called follicles,

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.584
which store the hormones 
the thyroid sends out into your blood.

00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:41.822
Two of the most important 
hormones it produces

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:48.609
are thyroxine and triiodothyronine,
or T3 and T4.

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.727
As messengers, the hormone's job


00:00:50.727 --> 00:00:55.575
is to instruct every cell in the body
when to consume oxygen and nutrients.

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:57.797
That maintains the body's metabolism,

00:00:57.797 --> 00:01:02.936
the series of reactions our cells perform
to provide us with energy.
