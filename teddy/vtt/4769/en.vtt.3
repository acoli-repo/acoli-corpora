00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.341
a hormonal gland deep in the brain
that oversees the thyroid's tasks,

00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.816
making sure it knows 
when to send out its messengers.

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:39.250
The pituitary's role is to sense 
if hormone levels in the blood

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.807
are too low or too high,

00:01:40.807 --> 00:01:43.234
in which case it sends out instructions

00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:46.651
in the form of the thyroid-
stimulating hormone.

00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:49.020
Even in this tightly 
controlled system, however,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.944
management sometimes slips up.

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:53.230
Certain diseases,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.580
growths in the thryoid

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.342
or chemical imbalances in the body
can confuse the organ

00:01:58.342 --> 00:02:02.041
and make it deaf 
to the pituitary's guiding commands.
