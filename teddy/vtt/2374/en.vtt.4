00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:03.158
a set of MRI cross-sectional images

00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:04.776
through a familiar object,

00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:05.651
and we're going to fly through them

00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:08.124
and you're going to try to figure out what the object is.

00:02:08.124 --> 00:02:10.235
Here we go.

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.130
It's not that easy. It's an artichoke.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.760
Okay, let's try another one,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.356
starting from the bottom and going through the top.

00:02:20.812 --> 00:02:21.963
Broccoli! It's a head of broccoli.

00:02:21.963 --> 00:02:23.627
Isn't it beautiful? I love that.

00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:26.384
Okay, here's another one. It's a brain, of course.

00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:27.970
In fact, it's my brain.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.703
We're going through slices through my head like that.

00:02:29.703 --> 00:02:31.461
That's my nose over on the right, and now
