00:02:29.703 --> 00:02:31.461
That's my nose over on the right, and now

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:34.870
we're going over here, right there.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.471
So this picture's nice, if I do say so myself,

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:41.383
but it shows only anatomy.

00:02:41.383 --> 00:02:43.903
The really cool advance with functional imaging

00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:45.475
happened when scientists figured out how to make

00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:48.870
pictures that show not just anatomy but activity,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.305
that is, where neurons are firing.

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:52.821
So here's how this works.

00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:53.938
Brains are like muscles.

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:55.501
When they get active,

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:58.475
they need increased blood flow to supply that activity,

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:02.043
and lucky for us, blood flow
control to the brain is local,
