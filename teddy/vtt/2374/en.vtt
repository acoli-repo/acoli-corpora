00:00:00.604 --> 00:00:01.820
Today I want to tell you

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.623
about a project being carried out

00:00:03.623 --> 00:00:06.310
by scientists all over the world

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.598
to paint a neural portrait of the human mind.

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:11.770
And the central idea of this work

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.628
is that the human mind and brain

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:16.485
is not a single, general-purpose processor,

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:19.927
but a collection of highly specialized components,

00:00:19.927 --> 00:00:22.910
each solving a different specific problem,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.246
and yet collectively making up

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:29.602
who we are as human beings and thinkers.

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:31.078
To give you a feel for this idea,
