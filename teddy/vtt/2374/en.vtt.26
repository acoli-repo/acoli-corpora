00:12:57.513 --> 00:13:00.134
But importantly, I don't think we have

00:13:00.134 --> 00:13:01.698
specializations in the brain

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.444
for every important mental function,

00:13:04.444 --> 00:13:07.853
even mental functions that may be critical for survival.

00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:09.955
In fact, a few years ago,

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.072
there was a scientist in my lab

00:13:11.072 --> 00:13:12.481
who became quite convinced

00:13:12.481 --> 00:13:14.230
that he'd found a brain region

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.142
for detecting food,

00:13:16.142 --> 00:13:18.060
and it responded really strongly in the scanner

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.788
when people looked at images like this.

00:13:20.788 --> 00:13:23.700
And further, he found a similar response

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.639
in more or less the same location

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.640
in 10 out of 12 subjects.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.934
So he was pretty stoked,

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.194
and he was running around the lab
