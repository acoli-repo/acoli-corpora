00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:32.654
well, of the seven that we've tested.

00:14:32.654 --> 00:14:34.823
So each of the brain regions that I've described

00:14:34.823 --> 00:14:36.129
to you today

00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:38.896
is present in approximately the same location

00:14:38.896 --> 00:14:40.638
in every normal subject.

00:14:40.638 --> 00:14:42.261
I could take any of you,

00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:43.487
pop you in the scanner,

00:14:43.487 --> 00:14:45.772
and find each of those regions in your brain,

00:14:45.772 --> 00:14:47.677
and it would look a lot like my brain,

00:14:47.677 --> 00:14:49.747
although the regions would be slightly different

00:14:49.747 --> 00:14:53.311
in their exact location and in their size.

00:14:53.311 --> 00:14:55.676
What's important to me about this work

00:14:55.676 --> 00:14:58.645
is not the particular locations of these brain regions,

00:14:58.645 --> 00:15:01.232
but the simple fact that we have
