00:09:59.795 --> 00:10:02.140
Also in this vicinity

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.785
is a region that's selectively involved

00:10:03.785 --> 00:10:05.721
in processing visual motion,

00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:07.225
like these moving dots here,

00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:09.914
and that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain,

00:10:09.914 --> 00:10:13.082
and near that is a region that responds

00:10:13.082 --> 00:10:15.979
when you look at images of bodies and body parts

00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:18.724
like these, and that region is shown in lime green

00:10:18.724 --> 00:10:20.727
at the bottom of the brain.

00:10:20.727 --> 00:10:23.359
Now all these regions I've shown you so far

00:10:23.359 --> 00:10:27.791
are involved in specific aspects of visual perception.

00:10:27.791 --> 00:10:29.939
Do we also have specialized brain regions

00:10:29.939 --> 00:10:32.752
for other senses, like hearing?
