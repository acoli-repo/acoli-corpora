00:01:28.148 --> 00:01:32.016
Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:36.551
mental deficits that can happen after brain damage.

00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:37.914
These syndromes collectively

00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:40.153
have suggested for a long time

00:01:40.153 --> 00:01:43.921
that the mind is divvied up into distinct components,

00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:46.306
but the effort to discover those components

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:47.920
has jumped to warp speed

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.502
with the invention of brain imaging technology,

00:01:50.502 --> 00:01:53.550
especially MRI.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.790
So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.376
at high resolution,

00:01:58.376 --> 00:01:59.806
so I'm going to show you in a second

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:03.158
a set of MRI cross-sectional images
