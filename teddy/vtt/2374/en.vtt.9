00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:30.118
and here's what I saw.

00:04:30.118 --> 00:04:33.774
Now this image looks just awful by today's standards,

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:36.582
but at the time I thought it was beautiful.

00:04:36.582 --> 00:04:38.532
What it shows is that region right there,

00:04:38.532 --> 00:04:39.815
that little blob,

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:41.562
it's about the size of an olive

00:04:41.562 --> 00:04:43.718
and it's on the bottom surface of my brain

00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:46.924
about an inch straight in from right there.

00:04:46.924 --> 00:04:49.714
And what that part of my brain is doing

00:04:49.714 --> 00:04:52.634
is producing a higher MRI response,

00:04:52.634 --> 00:04:54.382
that is, higher neural activity,

00:04:54.382 --> 00:04:55.864
when I was looking at faces

00:04:55.864 --> 00:04:58.130
than when I was looking at objects.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.490
So that's pretty cool,

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.808
but how do we know this isn't a fluke?
