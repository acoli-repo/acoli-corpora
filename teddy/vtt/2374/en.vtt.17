00:08:29.268 --> 00:08:33.491
(Applause) —

00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:36.173
this experiment finally nails the case

00:08:36.173 --> 00:08:37.998
that this region of the brain is not only

00:08:37.998 --> 00:08:40.135
selectively responsive to faces

00:08:40.135 --> 00:08:43.180
but causally involved in face perception.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.310
So I went through all of these details

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.774
about the face region to show you what it takes

00:08:47.774 --> 00:08:50.113
to really establish that a part of the brain

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:53.241
is selectively involved in a specific mental process.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.400
Next, I'll go through much more quickly

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.060
some of the other specialized regions of the brain

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.160
that we and others have found.
