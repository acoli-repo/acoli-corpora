00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:02.043
and lucky for us, blood flow
control to the brain is local,

00:03:02.043 --> 00:03:04.205
so if a bunch of neurons, say, right there

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:05.705
get active and start firing,

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:08.430
then blood flow increases just right there.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.151
So functional MRI picks up
on that blood flow increase,

00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:14.184
producing a higher MRI response

00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:17.110
where neural activity goes up.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.810
So to give you a concrete feel

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.295
for how a functional MRI experiment goes

00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:22.734
and what you can learn from it

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:24.118
and what you can't,

00:03:24.118 --> 00:03:27.560
let me describe one of the first studies I ever did.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.698
We wanted to know if there was a special
part of the brain for recognizing faces,
