00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.698
We wanted to know if there was a special
part of the brain for recognizing faces,

00:03:31.698 --> 00:03:34.770
and there was already reason to
think there might be such a thing

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.490
based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.613
that I described a moment ago,

00:03:38.613 --> 00:03:40.891
but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain

00:03:40.891 --> 00:03:42.810
in a normal person,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.866
so we set out to look for it.

00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:46.817
So I was the first subject.

00:03:46.817 --> 00:03:49.029
I went into the scanner, I lay on my back,

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.612
I held my head as still as I could

00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:56.629
while staring at pictures of faces like these

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.760
and objects like these

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.925
and faces and objects for hours.
