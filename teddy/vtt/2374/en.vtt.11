00:05:28.626 --> 00:05:31.081
so to find out, we scanned a bunch of other people

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.527
and found that pretty much everyone

00:05:33.527 --> 00:05:35.533
has that little face-processing region

00:05:35.533 --> 00:05:38.426
in a similar neighborhood of the brain.

00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:40.314
So the next question was,

00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:41.788
what does this thing really do?

00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:45.720
Is it really specialized just for face recognition?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.960
Well, maybe not, right?

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.762
Maybe it responds not only to faces

00:05:48.762 --> 00:05:50.871
but to any body part.

00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:53.240
Maybe it responds to anything human

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.020
or anything alive

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.676
or anything round.

00:05:56.676 --> 00:05:58.830
The only way to be really sure that that region

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.247
is specialized for face recognition
