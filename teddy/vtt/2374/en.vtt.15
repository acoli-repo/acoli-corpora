00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:31.534
It's going to start with a control condition

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.941
that will say "Sham" nearly invisibly

00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:35.651
in red in the lower left,

00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:37.933
when no current is delivered,

00:07:37.933 --> 00:07:41.748
and you'll hear the neurologist speaking
to the patient first. So let's watch.

00:07:41.748 --> 00:07:43.829
(Video) Neurologist: Okay, just look at my face

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:47.114
and tell me what happens when I do this.

00:07:47.114 --> 00:07:48.048
All right?

00:07:48.048 --> 00:07:50.871
Patient: Okay.

00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:55.191
Neurologist: One, two, three.

00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:58.206
Patient: Nothing.
Neurologist: Nothing? Okay.

00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:00.613
I'm going to do it one more time.
