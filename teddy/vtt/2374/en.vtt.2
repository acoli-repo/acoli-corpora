00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:01.536
except the children's faces.

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:03.322
You can see the faces,

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:05.030
but they don't look distinctive,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.888
and none of them looks familiar,

00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:09.386
and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:11.282
that you find your daughter.

00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:14.707
This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.253
actually happens to people.

00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:18.307
It's called prosopagnosia,

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:19.488
and it results from damage

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:21.614
to a particular part of the brain.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.114
The striking thing about it

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:25.709
is that only face recognition is impaired;

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.148
everything else is just fine.

00:01:28.148 --> 00:01:32.016
Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific
