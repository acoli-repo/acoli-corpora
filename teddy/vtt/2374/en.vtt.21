00:10:29.939 --> 00:10:32.752
for other senses, like hearing?

00:10:32.752 --> 00:10:35.789
Yes, we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit,

00:10:35.789 --> 00:10:38.190
here's a region in dark blue

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.536
that we reported just a couple of months ago,

00:10:40.536 --> 00:10:42.170
and this region responds strongly

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.599
when you hear sounds with pitch, like these.

00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:47.742
(Sirens)

00:10:47.742 --> 00:10:49.823
(Cello music)

00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:51.740
(Doorbell)

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.348
In contrast, that same region
does not respond strongly

00:10:55.348 --> 00:10:56.910
when you hear perfectly familiar sounds

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.272
that don't have a clear pitch, like these.

00:10:59.272 --> 00:11:01.741
(Chomping)
