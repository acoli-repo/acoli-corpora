WEBVTT

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.160
that we and others have found.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.274
So to do this, I've spent a lot of time

00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:04.141
in the scanner over the last month

00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:06.402
so I can show you these things in my brain.

00:09:06.402 --> 00:09:09.635
So let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere.

00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:12.297
So we're oriented like that.
You're looking at my head this way.

00:09:12.297 --> 00:09:13.390
Imagine taking the skull off

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.658
and looking at the surface of the brain like that.

00:09:15.658 --> 00:09:17.416
Okay, now as you can see,

00:09:17.416 --> 00:09:18.919
the surface of the brain is all folded up.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:20.640
So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.074
We want to see the whole thing,

00:09:22.074 --> 00:09:25.386
so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing.

00:09:25.386 --> 00:09:28.215
Next, let's find that face area I've been talking about

00:09:28.215 --> 00:09:30.442
that responds to images like these.
