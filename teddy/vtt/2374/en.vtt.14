00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:00.912
where he's just had electrodes placed

00:07:00.912 --> 00:07:02.983
on the surface of his brain

00:07:02.983 --> 00:07:05.537
to identify the source of his seizures.

00:07:05.537 --> 00:07:08.070
So it turned out by total chance

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.019
that two of the electrodes

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:13.242
happened to be right on top of his face area.

00:07:13.242 --> 00:07:15.571
So with the patient's consent,

00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:18.158
the doctors asked him what happened

00:07:18.158 --> 00:07:22.324
when they electrically stimulated
that part of his brain.

00:07:22.324 --> 00:07:23.978
Now, the patient doesn't know

00:07:23.978 --> 00:07:25.362
where those electrodes are,

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.574
and he's never heard of the face area.

00:07:27.574 --> 00:07:29.565
So let's watch what happens.

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:31.534
It's going to start with a control condition
