00:09:28.215 --> 00:09:30.442
that responds to images like these.

00:09:30.442 --> 00:09:31.961
To see that, let's turn the brain around

00:09:31.961 --> 00:09:33.980
and look on the inside surface on the bottom,

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.285
and there it is, that's my face area.

00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:38.992
Just to the right of that is another region

00:09:38.992 --> 00:09:40.630
that is shown in purple

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.702
that responds when you process color information,

00:09:43.702 --> 00:09:46.393
and near those regions are other regions

00:09:46.393 --> 00:09:48.756
that are involved in perceiving places,

00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:51.594
like right now, I'm seeing
this layout of space around me

00:09:51.594 --> 00:09:53.346
and these regions in green right there

00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:54.620
are really active.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.990
There's another one out on the outside surface again

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.795
where there's a couple more face regions as well.

00:09:59.795 --> 00:10:02.140
Also in this vicinity
