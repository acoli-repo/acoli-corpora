00:10:59.272 --> 00:11:01.741
(Chomping)

00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:03.941
(Drum roll)

00:11:03.941 --> 00:11:06.708
(Toilet flushing)

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:09.206
Okay. Next to the pitch region

00:11:09.206 --> 00:11:11.680
is another set of regions that
are selectively responsive

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.445
when you hear the sounds of speech.

00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:16.285
Okay, now let's look at these same regions.

00:11:16.285 --> 00:11:18.753
In my left hemisphere, there's a similar arrangement —

00:11:18.753 --> 00:11:20.226
not identical, but similar —

00:11:20.226 --> 00:11:22.435
and most of the same regions are in here,

00:11:22.435 --> 00:11:24.437
albeit sometimes different in size.

00:11:24.437 --> 00:11:26.451
Now, everything I've shown you so far

00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:29.477
are regions that are involved in
different aspects of perception,

00:11:29.477 --> 00:11:31.310
vision and hearing.
