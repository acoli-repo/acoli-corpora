To give you a feel for this idea,

00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:33.742
imagine the following scenario:

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.938
You walk into your child's day care center.

00:00:35.938 --> 00:00:38.175
As usual, there's a dozen kids there

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:39.766
waiting to get picked up,

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.398
but this time,

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:44.383
the children's faces look weirdly similar,

00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:47.191
and you can't figure out which child is yours.

00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:48.940
Do you need new glasses?

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.848
Are you losing your mind?

00:00:50.848 --> 00:00:53.300
You run through a quick mental checklist.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.194
No, you seem to be thinking clearly,

00:00:55.194 --> 00:00:57.585
and your vision is perfectly sharp.

00:00:57.585 --> 00:00:59.374
And everything looks normal

00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:01.536
except the children's faces.
