00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:30.502
No, we haven't.

00:06:30.502 --> 00:06:32.453
Brain imaging can never tell you

00:06:32.453 --> 00:06:34.893
if a region is necessary for anything.

00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:36.333
All you can do with brain imaging

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:38.381
is watch regions turn on and off

00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:40.349
as people think different thoughts.

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.960
To tell if a part of the brain is
necessary for a mental function,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.469
you need to mess with it and see what happens,

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:48.744
and normally we don't get to do that.

00:06:48.744 --> 00:06:51.328
But an amazing opportunity came about

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:53.792
very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine

00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:56.863
tested this man who has epilepsy

00:06:56.863 --> 00:06:59.545
and who is shown here in his hospital bed

00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:00.912
where he's just had electrodes placed
