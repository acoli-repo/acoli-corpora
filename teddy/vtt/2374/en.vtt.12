00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.247
is specialized for face recognition

00:06:01.247 --> 00:06:03.890
is to rule out all of those hypotheses.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.720
So we spent much of the next couple of years

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.367
scanning subjects while they looked at lots

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:09.973
of different kinds of images,

00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:11.930
and we showed that that part of the brain

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.880
responds strongly when you look at

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.333
any images that are faces of any kind,

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:19.246
and it responds much less strongly

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:22.395
to any image you show that isn't a face,

00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:23.700
like some of these.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.939
So have we finally nailed the case

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:29.179
that this region is necessary for face recognition?

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:30.502
No, we haven't.
