00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:01.096
you can trace bundles of neurons

00:16:01.096 --> 00:16:03.671
that connect to different parts of the brain,

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:05.302
and with this method shown here,

00:16:05.302 --> 00:16:08.999
you can trace the connections of
individual neurons in the brain,

00:16:08.999 --> 00:16:11.717
potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram

00:16:11.717 --> 00:16:13.783
of the entire human brain.

00:16:13.783 --> 00:16:15.830
Third, how does all of this

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.979
very systematic structure get built,

00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:21.935
both over development in childhood

00:16:21.935 --> 00:16:24.747
and over the evolution of our species?

00:16:24.747 --> 00:16:26.647
To address questions like that,

00:16:26.647 --> 00:16:28.430
scientists are now scanning

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.587
other species of animals,
