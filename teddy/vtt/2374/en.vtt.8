00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.925
and faces and objects for hours.

00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:06.697
So as somebody who has
pretty close to the world record

00:04:06.697 --> 00:04:10.240
of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.672
I can tell you that one of the skills

00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:14.335
that's really important for MRI research

00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:16.113
is bladder control.

00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:17.915
(Laughter)

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:19.452
When I got out of the scanner,

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:21.768
I did a quick analysis of the data,

00:04:21.768 --> 00:04:23.271
looking for any parts of my brain

00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:26.077
that produced a higher response
when I was looking at faces

00:04:26.077 --> 00:04:27.947
than when I was looking at objects,

00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:30.118
and here's what I saw.
