00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.194
and he was running around the lab

00:13:31.194 --> 00:13:33.196
telling everyone that he was going to go on "Oprah"

00:13:33.196 --> 00:13:35.214
with his big discovery.

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:38.236
But then he devised the critical test:

00:13:38.236 --> 00:13:41.419
He showed subjects images of food like this

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:44.160
and compared them to images with very similar

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.970
color and shape, but that weren't food, like these.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.101
And his region responded the same

00:13:50.101 --> 00:13:52.050
to both sets of images.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.377
So it wasn't a food area,

00:13:53.377 --> 00:13:56.148
it was just a region that liked colors and shapes.

00:13:56.148 --> 00:13:58.709
So much for "Oprah."
