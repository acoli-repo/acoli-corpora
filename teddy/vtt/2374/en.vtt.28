00:14:00.483 --> 00:14:02.708
But then the question, of course, is,

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:04.834
how do we process all this other stuff

00:14:04.834 --> 00:14:07.804
that we don't have specialized brain regions for?

00:14:07.804 --> 00:14:09.615
Well, I think the answer is that in addition

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:13.169
to these highly specialized components
that I've been describing,

00:14:13.169 --> 00:14:16.848
we also have a lot of very general-
purpose machinery in our heads

00:14:16.848 --> 00:14:18.342
that enables us to tackle

00:14:18.342 --> 00:14:20.448
whatever problem comes along.

00:14:20.448 --> 00:14:22.503
In fact, we've shown recently that

00:14:22.503 --> 00:14:24.571
these regions here in white

00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:27.982
respond whenever you do any difficult mental task

00:14:27.982 --> 00:14:29.083
at all —

00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:32.654
well, of the seven that we've tested.
