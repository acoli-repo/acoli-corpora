00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.394
where billions of brain cells
are working together,

00:03:00.418 --> 00:03:03.495
and you have more control
over those guesses

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.495
than you might imagine that you do.

00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:10.978
Now, if that sounds preposterous to you,
or, you know, kind of crazy,

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:15.510
I'm right there with you, because frankly,
if I hadn't seen the evidence for myself,

00:03:15.534 --> 00:03:17.590
decades of evidence for myself,

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.240
I am fairly sure
that I wouldn't believe it either.

00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:26.222
But the bottom line is that emotions
are not built into your brain at birth.

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:29.298
They are just built.
