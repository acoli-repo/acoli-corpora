00:00:00.877 --> 00:00:05.503
My research lab sits about a mile
from where several bombs exploded

00:00:05.527 --> 00:00:07.904
during the Boston Marathon in 2013.

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:12.973
The surviving bomber,
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev of Chechnya,

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:15.789
was tried, convicted
and sentenced to death.

00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:19.077
Now, when a jury has to make the decision

00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:22.776
between life in prison
and the death penalty,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.435
they base their decision largely
on whether or not the defendant

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:30.000
feels remorseful for his actions.
