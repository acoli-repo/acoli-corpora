And our brains might cause
our stomachs to churn a little bit,

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.897
to prepare for eating those cookies.

00:10:05.921 --> 00:10:07.652
And if we are correct,

00:10:07.676 --> 00:10:10.699
if in fact some cookies
have just come out of the oven,

00:10:10.723 --> 00:10:13.665
then our brains will
have constructed hunger,

00:10:13.689 --> 00:10:17.617
and we are prepared
to munch down those cookies

00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:20.015
and digest them in a very efficient way,

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.864
meaning that we can eat a lot of them,

00:10:21.888 --> 00:10:23.633
which would be a really good thing.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.684
You guys are not laughing enough.
I'm totally serious.

00:10:26.708 --> 00:10:30.525
(Laughter)
