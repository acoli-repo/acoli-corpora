00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:31.047
is exactly the same process.

00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:35.762
Your brain is basically
making predictions, guesses,

00:08:35.786 --> 00:08:38.072
that it's constructing in the moment

00:08:38.096 --> 00:08:42.305
with billions of neurons working together.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:47.393
Now your brain does come
prewired to make some feelings,

00:08:47.417 --> 00:08:52.219
simple feelings that come
from the physiology of your body.

00:08:52.243 --> 00:08:53.927
So when you're born,

00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:58.345
you can make feelings
like calmness and agitation,

00:08:58.369 --> 00:09:00.773
excitement, comfort, discomfort.
