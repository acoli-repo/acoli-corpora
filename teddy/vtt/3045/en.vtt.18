00:08:58.369 --> 00:09:00.773
excitement, comfort, discomfort.

00:09:01.266 --> 00:09:04.289
But these simple feelings
are not emotions.

00:09:04.313 --> 00:09:08.146
They're actually with you
every waking moment of your life.

00:09:08.694 --> 00:09:13.275
They are simple summaries
of what's going on inside your body,

00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:14.757
kind of like a barometer.

00:09:15.908 --> 00:09:17.980
But they have very little detail,

00:09:18.004 --> 00:09:20.907
and you need that detail
to know what to do next.

00:09:20.931 --> 00:09:22.713
What do you about these feelings?

00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:25.315
And so how does your brain
give you that detail?

00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:27.093
Well, that's what predictions are.
