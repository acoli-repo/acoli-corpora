00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:04.925
That's how we know
that a smile might mean sadness

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:07.981
and a cry might mean happiness,

00:08:08.005 --> 00:08:11.567
and a stoic, still face might mean

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:15.122
that you are angrily plotting
the demise of your enemy.

00:08:17.873 --> 00:08:21.270
Now, if I haven't already
gone out on a limb,

00:08:21.294 --> 00:08:24.682
I'll just edge out on that limb
a little further and tell you

00:08:24.706 --> 00:08:28.142
that the way that you experience
your own emotion

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:31.047
is exactly the same process.
