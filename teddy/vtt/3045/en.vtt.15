00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:33.816
are spending millions of research dollars
to build emotion-detection systems,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.870
and they are fundamentally
asking the wrong question,

00:07:36.894 --> 00:07:41.838
because they're trying to detect
emotions in the face and the body,

00:07:41.862 --> 00:07:44.676
but emotions aren't in your face and body.

00:07:45.137 --> 00:07:49.367
Physical movements
have no intrinsic emotional meaning.

00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:53.696
We have to make them meaningful.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.305
A human or something else
has to connect them to the context,

00:07:57.329 --> 00:07:59.115
and that makes them meaningful.

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:04.925
That's how we know
that a smile might mean sadness
