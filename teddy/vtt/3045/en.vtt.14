00:06:56.265 --> 00:07:00.695
is that emotions that you seem
to detect in other people

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:05.442
actually come in part
from what's inside your own head.

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:08.038
And this is true in the courtroom,

00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:11.021
but it's also true in the classroom,

00:07:11.045 --> 00:07:13.088
in the bedroom,

00:07:13.112 --> 00:07:15.100
and in the boardroom.

00:07:16.366 --> 00:07:18.224
And so here's my concern:

00:07:18.248 --> 00:07:21.167
tech companies
which shall remain nameless ...

00:07:22.047 --> 00:07:23.197
well, maybe not.

00:07:23.221 --> 00:07:24.673
You know, Google, Facebook --

00:07:24.697 --> 00:07:28.109
(Laughter)

00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:33.816
are spending millions of research dollars
to build emotion-detection systems,
