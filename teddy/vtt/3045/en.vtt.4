00:01:57.898 --> 00:02:01.008
and examined every
brain imaging study on emotion

00:02:01.032 --> 00:02:03.357
that has been published
in the past 20 years.

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.087
And the results of all of this research
are overwhelmingly consistent.

00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:15.669
It may feel to you
like your emotions are hardwired

00:02:15.693 --> 00:02:18.843
and they just trigger and happen to you,

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:20.169
but they don't.

00:02:20.984 --> 00:02:26.159
You might believe that your brain
is prewired with emotion circuits,

00:02:26.183 --> 00:02:29.492
that you're born with emotion
circuits, but you're not.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:33.517
In fact, none of us in this room
have emotion circuits in our brain.
