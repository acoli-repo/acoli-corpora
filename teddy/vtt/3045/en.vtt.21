00:10:26.708 --> 00:10:30.525
(Laughter)

00:10:30.549 --> 00:10:31.699
But here's the thing.

00:10:31.723 --> 00:10:34.127
That churning stomach,

00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:36.301
if it occurs in a different situation,

00:10:36.325 --> 00:10:38.325
it can have a completely
different meaning.

00:10:38.349 --> 00:10:41.904
So if your brain were to predict
a churning stomach

00:10:41.928 --> 00:10:46.927
in, say, a hospital room
while you're waiting for test results,

00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:49.650
then your brain will be constructing dread

00:10:49.674 --> 00:10:52.173
or worry or anxiety,

00:10:52.197 --> 00:10:55.895
and it might cause you to, maybe,

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:58.410
wring your hands

00:10:58.434 --> 00:11:00.996
or take a deep breath or even cry.
