same churning stomach,

00:11:06.505 --> 00:11:07.990
different experience.

00:11:08.678 --> 00:11:10.377
And so the lesson here

00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:14.536
is that emotions which seem
to happen to you

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.036
are actually made by you.

00:11:20.115 --> 00:11:25.139
You are not at the mercy
of mythical emotion circuits

00:11:25.163 --> 00:11:28.603
which are buried deep inside
some ancient part of your brain.
