is changing how you experience
these blobs right now.

00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:06.358
So your brain is constructing
the image of a snake

00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:08.509
where there is no snake,

00:05:08.533 --> 00:05:11.096
and this kind of a hallucination

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.572
is what neuroscientists like me
call "predictions."

00:05:14.995 --> 00:05:18.781
Predictions are basically
the way your brain works.

00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:21.321
It's business as usual for your brain.

00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:24.592
Predictions are the basis
of every experience that you have.

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:27.339
They are the basis
of every action that you take.

00:05:27.363 --> 00:05:32.506
In fact, predictions are what allow you
to understand the words that I'm speaking
