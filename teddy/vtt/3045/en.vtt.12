The way that we see emotions in others
are deeply rooted in predictions.

00:06:05.893 --> 00:06:08.892
So to us, it feels like
we just look at someone's face,

00:06:08.916 --> 00:06:12.701
and we just read the emotion
that's there in their facial expressions

00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:14.950
the way that we would read
words on a page.

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:19.204
But actually, under the hood,
your brain is predicting.

00:06:19.228 --> 00:06:23.138
It's using past experience
based on similar situations

00:06:23.162 --> 00:06:24.852
to try to make meaning.

00:06:24.876 --> 00:06:27.377
This time, you're not
making meaning of blobs,

00:06:27.401 --> 00:06:30.130
you're making meaning of facial movements
