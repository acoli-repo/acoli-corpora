Right now, your brain
is working like crazy.

00:03:39.355 --> 00:03:43.442
Your neurons are firing like mad
trying to make meaning out of this

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:46.602
so that you see something
other than black and white blobs.

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:51.109
Your brain is sifting
through a lifetime of experience,

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:53.968
making thousands of guesses
at the same time,

00:03:53.992 --> 00:03:55.977
weighing the probabilities,

00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:57.897
trying to answer the question,

00:03:57.921 --> 00:03:59.993
"What is this most like?"
