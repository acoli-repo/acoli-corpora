that you have more control
over your emotions than you might imagine,

00:16:00.706 --> 00:16:02.602
and that you have the capacity

00:16:02.626 --> 00:16:05.707
to turn down the dial
on emotional suffering

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:07.865

but eventually it becomes
pretty automatic.

00:16:23.302 --> 00:16:24.610
Now I don't know about you,

00:16:24.634 --> 00:16:29.954
but I find this to be
a really empowering and inspiring message,

00:16:29.978 --> 00:16:32.613
and the fact that it's backed up
by decades of research
