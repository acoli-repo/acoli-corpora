00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:30.000
feels remorseful for his actions.

00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:32.749
Tsarnaev spoke words of apology,

00:00:32.773 --> 00:00:34.977
but when jurors looked at his face,

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.001
all they saw was a stone-faced stare.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.601
Now, Tsarnaev is guilty,
there's no doubt about that.

00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:47.400
He murdered and maimed innocent people,

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:49.393
and I'm not here to debate that.

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:52.317
My heart goes out
to all the people who suffered.

00:00:52.668 --> 00:00:55.374
But as a scientist, I have to tell you

00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:59.740
that jurors do not
and cannot detect remorse

00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:03.327
or any other emotion in anybody ever.
