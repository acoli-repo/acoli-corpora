00:04:00.017 --> 00:04:01.246
not "What is it?"

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.646
but "What is this most like
in my past experience?"

00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:07.866
And this is all happening
in the blink of an eye.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.430
Now if your brain is still struggling
to find a good match

00:04:12.454 --> 00:04:14.988
and you still see black and white blobs,

00:04:15.012 --> 00:04:19.221
then you are in a state
called "experiential blindness,"

00:04:19.245 --> 00:04:23.132
and I am going to cure you
of your blindness.

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:25.695
This is my favorite part.
Are you ready to be cured?

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:27.514
(Cheers)

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:29.274
All right. Here we go.
