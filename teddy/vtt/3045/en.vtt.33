00:16:29.978 --> 00:16:32.613
and the fact that it's backed up
by decades of research

00:16:32.637 --> 00:16:35.546
makes me also happy as a scientist.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.713
But I have to also warn you
that it does come with some fine print,

00:16:38.737 --> 00:16:43.403
because more control
also means more responsibility.

00:16:45.225 --> 00:16:49.474
If you are not at the mercy
of mythical emotion circuits

00:16:49.498 --> 00:16:51.795
which are buried deep
inside your brain somewhere

00:16:51.819 --> 00:16:53.932
and which trigger automatically,

00:16:53.956 --> 00:16:56.613
then who's responsible,

00:16:56.637 --> 00:16:58.755
who is responsible when you behave badly?
