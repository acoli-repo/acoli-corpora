00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:10.707
and that's because emotions
are not what we think they are.

00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:14.135
They are not universally
expressed and recognized.

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:18.128
They are not hardwired brain reactions

00:01:18.152 --> 00:01:19.469
that are uncontrollable.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.267
We have misunderstood
the nature of emotion

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.781
for a very long time,

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:30.663
and understanding what emotions really are
has important consequences for all of us.
