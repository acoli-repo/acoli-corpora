00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:30.663
and understanding what emotions really are
has important consequences for all of us.

00:01:31.687 --> 00:01:35.611
I have studied emotions as a scientist
for the past 25 years,

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:41.185
and in my lab, we have probed human faces
by measuring electrical signals

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.015
that cause your facial muscles to contract
to make facial expressions.

00:01:45.742 --> 00:01:49.857
We have scrutinized
the human body in emotion.

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:53.476
We have analyzed
hundreds of physiology studies

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.143
involving thousands of test subjects.

00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:57.874
We've scanned hundreds of brains,

00:01:57.898 --> 00:02:01.008
and examined every
brain imaging study on emotion
