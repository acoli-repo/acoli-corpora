00:05:37.644 --> 00:05:41.039
Predictions are primal.

00:05:41.063 --> 00:05:44.476
They help us to make sense
of the world in a quick and efficient way.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.079
So your brain does not react to the world.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.716
Using past experience,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.902
your brain predicts and constructs

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:57.827
your experience of the world.
