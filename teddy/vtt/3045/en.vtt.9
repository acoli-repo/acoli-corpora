00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.222
(Gasps)

00:04:36.648 --> 00:04:37.941
All right.

00:04:37.965 --> 00:04:42.200
So now many of you see a snake,

00:04:42.224 --> 00:04:43.733
and why is that?

00:04:43.757 --> 00:04:48.399
Because as your brain is sifting
through your past experience,

00:04:48.423 --> 00:04:49.852
there's new knowledge there,

00:04:49.876 --> 00:04:52.026
the knowledge that came
from the photograph.

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:54.725
And what's really cool is that

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:57.511
that knowledge which you just
acquired moments ago

00:04:57.535 --> 00:05:02.177
is changing how you experience
these blobs right now.
