00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.616
Now, I wasn't horrified at me,
because I'm kind of used to myself.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.816
I was actually horrified

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.536
at the consequences
of what I had just said,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.736
at the consequences for the world

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.160
in which all our children
are going to have to live.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.056
It was frankly a horrible moment for me,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.176
and I thought, well, no, hang on,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.816
hang on.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.656
Impossible is not a fact,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.120
it's an attitude.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.176
It's only an attitude.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.136
And I decided right then and there
that I was going to change my attitude
