00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.480
first I remember

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.080
the day the Paris agreement was adopted.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.376
I cannot tell you
the euphoria in the room.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.776
5,000 people jumping out of their seats,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.456
crying, clapping, screaming, yelling,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.776
torn between euphoria and still disbelief
at what they had just seen,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.640
because so many people

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.120
had worked for years towards this,
and this was finally their reality.
