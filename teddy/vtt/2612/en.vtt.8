00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.856
And then I realized I have no idea
how we're going to solve this problem,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.816
but I do know one thing:

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.816
we have got to change
the tone of this conversation.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.936
Because there is no way
you can deliver victory

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.160
without optimism.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.616
And here,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.176
I use optimism as a very simple word,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.976
but let's understand it
in its broader sense.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.896
Let's understand it as courage,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.896
hope, trust, solidarity,
