00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.896
hope, trust, solidarity,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.816
the fundamental belief
that we humans can come together

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.120
and can help each other
to better the fate of mankind.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.416
Well, you can imagine
that I thought that without that,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.896
there was no way we were going
to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.736
And for six years,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.616
I have stubbornly, relentlessly
injected optimism into the system,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.496
no matter what the questions
from the press --

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.696
and I have gotten better at those --

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.896
and no matter what the evidence
to the contrary.
