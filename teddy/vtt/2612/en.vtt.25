00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.296
I'm the first one to recognize
that we have a lot of work still to do.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.656
We've only just started
our work on climate change.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.376
And in fact, we need to make sure
that we redouble our efforts

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.200
over the next five years
that are the urgent five years.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.496
But I do believe

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.456
that we have come over the past six years

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.680
from the impossible

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.536
to the now unstoppable.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.616
And how did we do that?
By injecting transformational optimism

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.096
that allowed us to go
from confrontation to collaboration,
