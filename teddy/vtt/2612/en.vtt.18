00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.576
onto a common direction of travel

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.736
that is going to take us
probably several decades,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.256
but over those several decades
is going to take us

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.736
into the new economy,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.336
into a decarbonized,
highly resilient economy,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.736
And the national contributions
that are currently on the table

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.056
on behalf of national governments

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.216
are insufficient to get us
to a stabilized climate,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.296
but they are only the first step,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.336
and they will improve over time.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.776
And the measurement, reporting
and verification of all of those efforts
