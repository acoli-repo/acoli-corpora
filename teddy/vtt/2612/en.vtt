00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.416
I have one more reason for optimism:

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.896
climate change.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.680
Maybe you don't believe it,
but here is the fact.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.800
On December 12, 2015,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.216
in Paris, under the United Nations,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.696
195 governments got together

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.880
and unanimously --

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.816
if you've worked with governments,
you know how difficult that is --

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.056
unanimously decided

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.896
to intentionally change the course
of the global economy
