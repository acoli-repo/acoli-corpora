00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.096
that allowed us to go
from confrontation to collaboration,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.416
that allowed us to understand
that national and local interests

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.816
are not necessarily at odds
with global needs,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.555
and that if we understand that,
we can bring them together

00:13:10.579 --> 00:13:12.816
and we can merge them harmoniously.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.576
And as I look forward
to other global issues

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.456
that will require
our attention this century --

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.960
food security, water security,
home security, forced migration --

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.496
I see that we certainly do not know

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.056
how we are going to solve
those problems yet.
