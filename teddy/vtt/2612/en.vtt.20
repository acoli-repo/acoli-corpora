00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.376
short-term emission reduction commitments

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.576
that were completely insufficient

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.016
and furthermore,
largely perceived as a burden.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.456
Now what do we have?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:16.056
Now we have all countries of the world
contributing with different intensities

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.376
from different approaches
in different sectors,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.880
but all of them
contributing to a common goal

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.496
and along a path

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.560
with environmental integrity.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.456
Well, once you have all of this in place
