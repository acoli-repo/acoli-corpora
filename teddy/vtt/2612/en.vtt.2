00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.920
the same governments
convened in Copenhagen

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.040
and failed miserably.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.016
Why did it fail miserably?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.616
For many different reasons,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.176
but primarily because
of the deeply entrenched divide

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.920
between the global
North and the global South.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.616
So now, six months after this failure,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.976
I was called in
to assume the responsibility

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.056
of the global climate change negotiations.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.456
You can imagine, the perfect moment
to start this new job.
