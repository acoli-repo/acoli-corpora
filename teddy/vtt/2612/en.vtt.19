And the measurement, reporting

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.456
is legally binding.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.216
And the checkpoints that we're
going to have every five years

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.736
to assess collective progress
towards our goal are legally binding,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.656
and the path itself toward
a decarbonized and more resilient economy

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.880
is legally binding.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.496

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.016
A very small handful of countries

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.280
who had undertaken very reduced,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.376
short-term emission reduction commitments
