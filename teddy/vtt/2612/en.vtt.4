On my first press conference,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.696
a journalist asked, "Um, Ms. Figueres,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.096
do you think that a global agreement
is ever going to be possible?"

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.456
And without engaging brain,
I heard me utter,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.080
"Not in my lifetime."

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.776
Well, you can imagine
the faces of my press team

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.496
who were horrified
at this crazy Costa Rican woman

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.920
who was their new boss.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.336
And I was horrified, too.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.616
Now, I wasn't horrified at me,
because I'm kind of used to myself.
