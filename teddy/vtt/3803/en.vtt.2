00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.817
Have you ever laughed or smiled

00:01:01.817 --> 00:01:04.489
when someone said something shitty to you

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.250
and then spent the rest of the day

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.354
wondering why you reacted that way?

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:12.532
Yes.

00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:15.292
Have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:17.180
a thousand times as you walked

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.210
from the check-in to the gate?

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.260
Yes.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.837
Have you ever put on a pair of pants

00:01:24.837 --> 00:01:26.676
and then much later realized that there was

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:29.308
a loose sock smushed up against your thigh?

00:01:29.308 --> 00:01:31.280
(Laughter)
