00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:07.976
and then found yourself looking

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:13.050
for an "undo" button in real life?

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.232
Have you ever misplaced your TED badge

00:02:15.232 --> 00:02:16.800
and then immediately started imagining

could suddenly become so beautiful?
