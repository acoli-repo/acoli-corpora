00:03:29.948 --> 00:03:33.356
Have you ever realized that very little, in the long run,

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:35.812
just happens naturally?

00:03:35.812 --> 00:03:39.341
Have you ever woken up blissfully

00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:42.148
and suddenly been flooded
by the awful remembrance

00:03:42.148 --> 00:03:45.212
that someone had left you?

00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:47.949
Have you ever lost the ability to imagine a future

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.246
without a person

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:52.500
that no longer was in your life?

00:03:54.418 --> 00:03:56.458
Have you ever looked back on that event

00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:58.366
with the sad smile of autumn

00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:01.766
and the realization that futures will happen
