00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello. I would like to start my talk

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
with actually two questions, and the first one is:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
How many people here actually eat pig meat?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Please raise your hand --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
oh, that's a lot.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And how many people have actually seen

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
a live pig producing this meat?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In the last year?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In the Netherlands -- where I come from --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you actually never see a pig, which is really strange,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because, on a population of 16 million people,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we have 12 million pigs.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs.
