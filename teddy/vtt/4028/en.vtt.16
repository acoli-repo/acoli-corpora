could be so important, so healing.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.440
This was the most important thing.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.520
It was what I always wanted.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.920
So after the funeral, it was time
for me to go back to my studio.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.416
So I packed up my car
and I drove back to Brooklyn,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.360
and painting is what I've always done,
so that's what I did.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.680
And here's what happened.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.480
It's like a release of everything
that was unraveling in me.
