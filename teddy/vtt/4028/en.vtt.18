00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.056
I got my paints,
and I wasn't a landscape painter,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.696
but I wasn't really
much of any kind of painter at all,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.216
so I had no attachment, no expectation,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.296
which allowed me to be reckless and free.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.376
I actually left one of these wet paintings

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.320
outside overnight

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.176
next to a light in the woods.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.160
By the morning it was lacquered with bugs.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.136
But I didn't care.
It didn't matter. It didn't matter.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.536
I took all these paintings
back to my studio,

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.216
and scraped them, and carved into them,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.736
and poured paint thinner on them,
