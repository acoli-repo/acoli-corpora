00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.760
I was driven by this
kind of impulsive curiosity,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.496
always looking for something new to add:

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.480

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.776

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.280
and surrounded by artists,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.800
always going to openings and events.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.216
I was having some success and recognition
