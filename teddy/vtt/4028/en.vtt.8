00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.320
but you're not yet weighed down
by the responsibilities of life."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.720
That was it. It was the light years.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.536
On October 8, 2011,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.616
the light years came to an end.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.520
My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.610
It had spread to her bones,
and it was in her brain.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.935
When she told me this, I fell to my knees.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.200
I totally lost it.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.136
And when I got myself together
and I looked at her,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.736
I realized, this isn't about me.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.800
This is about figuring out
how to help her.
