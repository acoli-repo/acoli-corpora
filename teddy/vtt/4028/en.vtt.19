but I was watching what was happening.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.585
This is the one with all the bugs in it.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.096
I wasn't trying to represent a real space.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.576

This is another one from the woods.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.136
There was a caveat now, though.
