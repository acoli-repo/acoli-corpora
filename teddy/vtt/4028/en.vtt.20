There was a caveat now, though.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.096
I couldn't be controlling
the paint like I used to.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.136
It had to be about implying
and suggesting,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.880
not explaining or describing.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.016
And that imperfect,
chaotic, turbulent surface

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.840
is what told the story.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.440
I started to be as curious
as I was when I was a student.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.096
So the next thing was I wanted
to put figures in these paintings, people,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.896
and I loved this new environment,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.200
so I wanted to have
both people and this atmosphere.
