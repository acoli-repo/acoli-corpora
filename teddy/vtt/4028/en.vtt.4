00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.696
and I couldn't use a microwave
and a toaster at the same time,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.960
but still, I could pay my rent.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.680
So I was very happy.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.120
Here's a painting
from back around that time.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.536
I needed it to be
as realistic as possible.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.960
It had to be specific and believable.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.720
This was the place where I was
isolated and in total control.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.376
Since then, I've made a career
of painting people in water.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.416
Bathtubs and showers were
the perfect enclosed environment.
