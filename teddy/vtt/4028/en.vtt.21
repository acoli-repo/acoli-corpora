00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.200
so I wanted to have
both people and this atmosphere.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.896
When the idea hit me of how to do this,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.696
I got kind of nauseous and dizzy,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.576
which is really just adrenaline, probably,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.536
but for me it's a really good sign.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.696
And so now I want to show you
what I've been working on.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.776
It's something I haven't shown yet,
and it's like a preview, I guess,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.056
of my upcoming show,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.280
what I have so far.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.960
Expansive space

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.080
instead of the isolated bathtub.
