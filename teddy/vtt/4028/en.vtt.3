00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.440
By 14, I knew I really wanted
to be an artist.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.200
My big plan was to be a waitress
to support my painting.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.296
So I continued honing my skills.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.456
I went to graduate school
and I got an MFA,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.776
and at my first solo show,
my brother asked me,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.776
"What do all these red dots
mean next to the paintings?"

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.800
Nobody was more surprised than me.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.016
The red dots meant
that the paintings were sold

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.136
and that I'd be able to pay my rent

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.480
with painting.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.376
Now, my apartment
had four electrical outlets,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.696
and I couldn't use a microwave
and a toaster at the same time,
