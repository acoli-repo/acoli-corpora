She took me to every available art class
from when I was eight to 16,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.280
because that's all I wanted to do.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.400
She even took a class with me
in New York City.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.736
Now, being the youngest of eight,
I learned a few survival skills.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.296
Rule number one:

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.280
don't let your big brother
see you do anything stupid.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.096
So I learned to be quiet and neat

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.760
and careful to follow the rules
and stay in line.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.616
But painting was where I made the rules.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.280
That was my private world.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.440
By 14, I knew I really wanted
to be an artist.
