00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.216
I was having some success and recognition

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.600
and I moved into an apartment
with more than four outlets.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.136
My mom and I would stay up very late

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.296
talking about our latest ideas
and inspiring each other.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.040
She made beautiful pottery.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.416
I have a friend named Bo
who made this painting

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.816
of his wife and I dancing by the ocean,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.507
and he called it "The Light Years."

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.576
I asked him what that meant, and he said,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.160
"Well, that's when you've stepped
into adulthood, you're no longer a child,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.320
but you're not yet weighed down
by the responsibilities of life."
