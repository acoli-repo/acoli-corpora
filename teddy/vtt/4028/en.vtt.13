I'd blow-dry her hair.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.056
My brothers would come in the evenings
and bring their kids,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.920
and that was the highlight of her day.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.400
Over time, we started to use a wheelchair,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.776
and she didn't want to eat so much,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.960
and she used the tiniest little teacup
we could find to drink her coffee.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.976
I couldn't support her myself anymore,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.280
so we hired an aide
to help me with the showers.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.056
These simple daily activities

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.840
became our sacred ritual,
