00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.496
My brothers, sister, and father and I

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.120
all came together in this
supportive and attentive way.

00:07:35.903 --> 00:07:37.856
It was as though our whole family dynamic

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.936
and all our established roles vanished

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.616
and we were just
all together in this unknown,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.496
feeling the same thing

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.000
and taking care of each other.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.920
I'm so grateful for them.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.776
As someone who spends most
of my time alone in a studio working,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.656
I had no idea that this kind of connection

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.616
could be so important, so healing.
