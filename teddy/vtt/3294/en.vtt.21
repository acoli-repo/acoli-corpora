00:10:28.134 --> 00:10:32.656
but we even take into consideration
the desires or our littlest citizens,

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.315
babies and toddlers.

00:10:34.887 --> 00:10:37.575
From toddlers, we learned
that the joy of walking

00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:40.533
comes from what you discover
along the way.

00:10:41.014 --> 00:10:45.490
When they evaluated the walkability
of Boulder's 19th Street corridor,

00:10:45.514 --> 00:10:49.474
toddlers spent long stretches
exploring leaves in a ditch

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:51.339
and sparkles in the sidewalk.

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:54.696
They reminded us to slow down

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.606
and design a path where the journey
is as important as the destination.
