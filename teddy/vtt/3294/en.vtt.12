00:05:59.544 --> 00:06:03.045
Now, fast-forward four years,
and I am pleased to report

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.473
that many of the children's ideas
are being implemented in the Civic Area.

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:09.283
For example,

00:06:09.307 --> 00:06:11.879
there will be improved
access to Boulder Creek,

00:06:11.903 --> 00:06:14.369
so kids can play safely in the water.

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.847
Lighting in previously dark underpasses,

00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:21.827
so high school students can walk home
safely after school at night.

00:06:22.588 --> 00:06:24.977
And separated biking and walking paths,

00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:28.949
so speeding bikers won't hit young people
as they stroll by the creek.
