00:03:26.752 --> 00:03:32.831
In 2012, the city of Boulder decided
to redesign a large downtown park,

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:34.455
known as the Civic Area.

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:38.813
This space is bounded
by a farmers' market on one end,

00:03:38.837 --> 00:03:41.242
Boulder Public Library on the other end,

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:44.329
and by Boulder Creek,
which runs through the middle.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.482
The space needed a new design

00:03:46.506 --> 00:03:49.847
to better handle the creek's
inevitable flash floods,

00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:52.560
restore a sense of safety to the area

00:03:52.584 --> 00:03:55.250
and support an expanded farmers' market.

00:03:55.996 --> 00:03:59.123
So from 2012 through 2014,

00:03:59.147 --> 00:04:02.625
we engaged more than 200
young people in the process,
