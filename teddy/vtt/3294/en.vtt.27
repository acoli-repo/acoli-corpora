00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:32.261
That goes for kids and for everyone else.

00:13:32.752 --> 00:13:37.569
So, adults, let's stop thinking
of our children as future citizens

00:13:37.593 --> 00:13:42.296
and instead, start valuing them
for the citizens they are today.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.010
Because our children

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:50.200
are designing the cities
that will make us happier and healthier.

00:13:50.637 --> 00:13:57.036
Cities filled with nature, play, movement,
social connection and beauty.

00:13:57.765 --> 00:14:01.955
Children are designing the cities
we all want to live in.
