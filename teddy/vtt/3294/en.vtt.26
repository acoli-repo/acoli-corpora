00:12:56.442 --> 00:13:00.172
So to me, all of this
has revealed something important.

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:01.796
An important blind spot.

00:13:02.355 --> 00:13:05.863
If we aren't including children
in our planning,

00:13:05.887 --> 00:13:07.820
who else aren't we including?

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:12.115
Are we listening
to people of color, immigrants,

00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:17.019
the elderly and people with disabilities,
or with reduced incomes?

00:13:17.641 --> 00:13:21.244
What innovative design solutions
are we overlooking,

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:24.300
because we aren't hearing the voices
of the full community?

00:13:24.855 --> 00:13:27.879
We can't possibly know
the needs and wants of other people

00:13:27.903 --> 00:13:29.053
without asking.

00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:32.261
That goes for kids and for everyone else.
