00:03:59.147 --> 00:04:02.625
we engaged more than 200
young people in the process,

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:06.069
ranging from preschool
through high school students.

00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:08.323
Now, how did we do this?

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:09.497
Let me explain.

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:12.839
First, we visited children
in their classrooms

00:04:12.863 --> 00:04:14.855
and presented the project:

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.831
what it was, why their ideas mattered

00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:20.370
and what would happen
with their recommendations.

00:04:20.807 --> 00:04:25.498
Before we could influence them,
we asked children to record their ideas,

00:04:25.522 --> 00:04:27.988
based on their own lived experiences.

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:32.704
Then we asked children to go
on a field trip with us,
