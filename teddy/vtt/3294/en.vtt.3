00:01:27.657 --> 00:01:30.527
I had encountered as the parent
of a young child.

00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:35.117
Perhaps we would advocate
for more changing tables in restaurants.

00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:39.141
Or create indoor play spaces
for those cold and rainy days.

00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:44.153
In other words, make the city
more hospitable to children and families.

00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:48.149
It wasn't until after
I committed to this project

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:50.506
that I realized I had it all wrong.

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:54.944
We wouldn't be designing
better cities for children.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:59.236
Children would be designing
better cities for themselves,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.196
and for the rest of us, too.
