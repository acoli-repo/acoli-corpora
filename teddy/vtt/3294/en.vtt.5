00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:31.061
Or unreasonable?

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.553
Do our cities really need a park
made out of candy?

00:02:35.577 --> 00:02:38.712
(Laughter)

00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:41.069
Or a bridge with water cannons

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:44.830
that fire water onto
unsuspecting kayakers below?

00:02:44.854 --> 00:02:47.788
(Laughter)

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.014
While these concerns sound legitimate,

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:55.307
I realized that not including
children in city planning

00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:57.198
was a bigger design problem.

00:02:57.728 --> 00:03:01.982
After all, shouldn't we include
end users in the design process?
