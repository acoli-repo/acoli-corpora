I work in urban design,
and not surprisingly,

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:35.364
most cities are designed by adults.

00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:39.529
Urban planners, architects,
developers, politicians,

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:41.953
and occasionally, a few loud citizens.

00:00:42.736 --> 00:00:46.768
Rarely do you consider the voices
of a group of four-year-olds,

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:50.539
barely tall enough to reach the podium
at city council chambers.

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:54.682
But today, I want to ask you this:

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:58.607
What would happen if we asked children
to design our cities?

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.594
(Laughter)
