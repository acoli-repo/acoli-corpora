In addition to trees and plants,

00:11:03.574 --> 00:11:07.093
kids almost always include animals
in their designs.

00:11:07.117 --> 00:11:09.418
Insects, birds and small mammals

00:11:09.442 --> 00:11:12.204
figure prominently
into children's pictures.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.379
Whether it's because
they're closer to the ground

00:11:15.403 --> 00:11:18.529
and can see the grasshoppers
better than we can,

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:22.790
or simply because they have a greater
sense of empathy for other beings,

00:11:22.814 --> 00:11:27.429
children almost always include
non-human species in their ideal worlds.

00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:32.529
Across the board, children are inclusive
in their city planning.
