observed that children
are a kind of indicator species.

00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:06.676
If we can build a successful
city for children,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.767
we will have a successful
city for all people.

00:12:10.359 --> 00:12:11.521
Think about it.

00:12:11.545 --> 00:12:14.926
Kids can't just hop in a car
and drive to the store.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.786
And most kids can't afford
an expensive lunch at the nearby cafe.

00:12:19.196 --> 00:12:22.490
So if we build cities
that take into the consideration

00:12:22.514 --> 00:12:24.910
their needs for alternative
forms of transportation

00:12:24.934 --> 00:12:26.831
and for cheaper food venues,

00:12:26.855 --> 00:12:30.188
we meet the needs
of many other populations, too.
