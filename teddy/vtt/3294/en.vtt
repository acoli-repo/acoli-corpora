00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:03.933
Our society routinely makes decisions

00:00:03.957 --> 00:00:06.812
without consulting
a quarter of the population.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.663
We're making choices about land use,
energy production and natural resources

00:00:12.687 --> 00:00:16.116
without the ideas and experiences
of the full community.

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:21.363
The car, an inanimate object,
has more say over public policy

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:23.253
than this group of citizens.

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:26.847
Can you guess which group
I'm talking about?

00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:28.182
It's children.
