(Laughter)

00:01:01.618 --> 00:01:05.863
Back in 2009, I was introduced
to a small group of people

00:01:05.887 --> 00:01:09.958
who wanted to start a child-friendly
city initiative in Boulder, Colorado.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.466
I come from a family
of civil rights advocates,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.291
and I had spent my career until that point

00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:19.291
working with low-income
children and families.

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:23.104
But I had never heard of a child-friendly
city initiative before.

00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:27.633
So I figured its purpose would be
to address some of the frustrations

00:01:27.657 --> 00:01:30.527
I had encountered as the parent
of a young child.
