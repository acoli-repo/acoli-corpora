00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:32.704
Then we asked children to go
on a field trip with us,

00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:35.831
to document what they liked
and didn't like about the space,

00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:37.307
using photography.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.863
Through green picture frames,

00:04:39.887 --> 00:04:42.783
students highlighted
what they liked about the space,

00:04:42.807 --> 00:04:45.562
such as college students,
tubing down the creek.

00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:47.696
(Laughter)

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.260
Then they flipped those frames over
and used the red side

00:04:51.284 --> 00:04:54.546
to highlight things
they didn't like, such as trash.

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.910
Our sixth-grade students
studied the Civic Area

00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:01.355
by researching sites
with similar challenges
