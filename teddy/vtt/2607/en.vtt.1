00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.616
distracted by our bread and circuses

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.000
and embroiled in the wars
that we have waged on each other,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.000
it seems that we have forgotten
this desire to explore.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.160
We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.960
for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.816
and so content are we
with our living conditions

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.256
that we have grown complacent
and just too busy

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.200
to notice that its resources are finite,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.280
and that our Sun's life is also finite.
