00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.856
how would we make
our plants cold-tolerant?

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.976
Because, on average,
the temperature on Mars

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.760
is a very uninviting
negative 60 degrees centigrade.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.776
The next question we should ask is,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.256
how do we make
our plants drought-tolerant?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.096
Considering that most of the water
that forms as frost

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.960
evaporates more quickly
than I can say the word "evaporate."

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.720
Well, it turns out
we've already done things like this.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.776
By borrowing genes
for anti-freeze protein from fish

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.976
and genes for drought tolerance
from other plants like rice

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.696
and then stitching them
into the plants that need them,
