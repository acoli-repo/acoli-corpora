00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.416
That fact has not changed much
in the last five minutes

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.880
that you were sitting here
and I was standing there.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.176
And so, if we were to dump
any of us on Mars right this minute,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.696
even given ample food, water, air

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.936
and a suit,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.336
we are likely to experience
very unpleasant health problems

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.656
from the amount of ionizing radiation
that bombards the surface

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.520
of planets like Mars that have little
or nonexistent atmosphere.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.296
Unless we plan
to stay holed up underground

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.960
for the duration of our stay
on every new planet,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.056
we must find better ways
of protecting ourselves
