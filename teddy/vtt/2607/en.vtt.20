00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.040
But, and this is a big but,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.656
such evolution requires two things
that we may not always have,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.120
or be able to afford,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.360
and they are death and time.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.576
In our species' struggle
to find our place in the universe,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.056
we may not always have the time necessary

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.616
for the natural evolution
of extra functions

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.640
for survival on non-Earth planets.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.856
We're living in what E.O. Wilson
has termed the age of gene circumvention,

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.256
during which we remedy our genetic defects
like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy
