00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.816
for us to complement
these bulky electronic giants

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.680
with what nature has already invented:

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.696
the microbe,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.936
a single-celled organism that is itself
a self-generating, self-replenishing,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.160
living machine.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.176
It requires fairly little to maintain,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.096
offers much flexibility in design

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.440
and only asks to be carried
in a single plastic tube.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.256
The field of study that has enabled us
to utilize the capabilities of the microbe

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.880
is known as synthetic biology.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.536
It comes from molecular biology,
which has given us antibiotics, vaccines
