00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.296
Well, that's a lot of you.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.520
How about a few weeks?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.256
That's a decent amount.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.480
How about a few months?

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.096
That's pretty good too.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.776
Now, let us imagine
that this local national forest

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.760
experiences an eternal winter.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.240
Same questions: how many of you think you
would be able to survive for a few days?

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.696
That's quite a lot.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.920
How about a few weeks?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.096
So for a fun twist, let us imagine
that the only source of water available

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.520
is trapped as frozen blocks
miles below the surface.
