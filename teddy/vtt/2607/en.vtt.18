00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.760
Even if we borrow just a fraction
of its ability to tolerate radiation,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.416
it would be infinitely better
than what we already have,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.400
which is just the melanin in our skin.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.576
Using the tools of synthetic biology,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.616
we can harness Deinococcus
radiodurans' ability

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.360
to thrive under otherwise
very lethal doses of radiation.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.240
As difficult as it is to see,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.240
homo sapiens, that is humans,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.496
evolves every day,
