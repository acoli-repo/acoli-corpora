00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.536
It comes from molecular biology,
which has given us antibiotics, vaccines

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.856
and better ways to observe
the physiological nuances

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.080
of the human body.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.496
Using the tools of synthetic biology,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.456
we can now edit the genes
of nearly any organism,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.416
microscopic or not,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.840
with incredible speed and fidelity.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.656
Given the limitations
of our man-made machines,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.656
synthetic biology will be a means for us
to engineer not only our food,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.416
our fuel and our environment,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.736
but also ourselves

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.376
to compensate
for our physical inadequacies
