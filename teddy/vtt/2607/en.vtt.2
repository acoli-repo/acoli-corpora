and that our Sun's life is also finite.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.176
While Mars and all the movies
made in its name

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.216
have reinvigorated
the ethos for space travel,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.616

that our species' fragile constitution

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.040
is woefully unprepared
for long duration journeys into space.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.416
Let us take a trek

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.256
for a quick reality check.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.976

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.576
how many of you think you would be able
to survive in this lush wilderness

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.800
for a few days?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.296
Well, that's a lot of you.
