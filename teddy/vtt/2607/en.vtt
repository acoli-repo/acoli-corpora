00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.336
So there are lands
few and far between on Earth itself

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.680
that are hospitable to humans
by any measure,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.120
but survive we have.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.056
Our primitive ancestors, when they found
their homes and livelihood endangered,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.216
they dared to make their way
into unfamiliar territories

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.080
in search of better opportunities.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.976
And as the descendants of these explorers,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.280
we have their nomadic blood
coursing through our own veins.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.496
But at the same time,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.616
distracted by our bread and circuses
