00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.616
And what about macrogravity,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.136
or any other variation
in gravitational pull

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.080
of the planet that we find ourselves on?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.096
In short, our cosmic voyages
will be fraught with dangers

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.720
both known and unknown.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.976
So far we've been looking to this
new piece of mechanical technology

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.256
or that great next generation robot

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.720
as part of a lineup to ensure
our species safe passage in space.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.536
Wonderful as they are,
I believe the time has come

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.816
for us to complement
these bulky electronic giants
