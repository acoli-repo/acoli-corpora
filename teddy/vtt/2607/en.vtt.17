It is known to be able to withstand cold,
dehydration, vacuum, acid,

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.640
and, most notably, radiation.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.135
While its radiation
tolerance mechanisms are known,

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.559
we have yet to adapt
the relevant genes to mammals.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.136
To do so is not particularly easy.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.976
There are many facets
that go into its radiation tolerance,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.240
and it's not as simple
as transferring one gene.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.216
But given a little bit of human ingenuity

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.496
and a little bit of time,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.960
I think to do so is not very hard either.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.760
Even if we borrow just a fraction
of its ability to tolerate radiation,
