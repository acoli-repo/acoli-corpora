00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.520
is trapped as frozen blocks
miles below the surface.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.176
Soil nutrients are so minimal
that no vegetation can be found,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.400
and of course hardly any atmosphere
exists to speak of.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.376
Such examples are only a few
of the many challenges we would face

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.240
on a planet like Mars.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.176
So how do we steel ourselves for voyages
whose destinations are so far removed

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.680
from a tropical vacation?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.160
Will we continuously ship supplies
from Planet Earth?
