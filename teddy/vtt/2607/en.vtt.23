00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.416
to protect ourselves
from the external dangers

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.080
and then protect ourselves from ourselves?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.816
I pose these questions

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.016
not to engender the fear of science

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.416
but to bring to light
the many possibilities

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.840
that science has afforded
and continues to afford us.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.736
We must coalesce as humans
to discuss and embrace the solutions

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.960
not only with caution

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.600
but also with courage.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.800
Mars is a destination,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.040
but it will not be our last.
