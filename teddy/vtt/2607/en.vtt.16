00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.056
we must find better ways
of protecting ourselves

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.736
without needing to resort
to wearing a suit of armor

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.216
that weighs something
equal to your own body weight,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.520
or needing to hide behind a wall of lead.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.840
So let us appeal
to nature for inspiration.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.296
Among the plethora of life here on Earth,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.176
there's a subset of organisms
known as extremophiles,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.176
or lovers of extreme living conditions,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.656
if you'll remember
from high school biology.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.160
And among these organisms is a bacterium
by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.416
It is known to be able to withstand cold,
dehydration, vacuum, acid,
