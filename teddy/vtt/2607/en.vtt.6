00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.160
on a ship, a hermetic flying can,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.840
possibly for many generations.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.896
The longest continuous amount of time
that any human has spent in space

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.800
is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.936
From astronauts' experiences in space,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.736
we know that spending time
in a microgravity environment

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.336
means bone loss, muscle atrophy,
cardiovascular problems,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.936
among many other complications

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.280
that range for the physiological
to the psychological.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.616
And what about macrogravity,
