00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.040
but it will not be our last.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.856
Our true final frontier
is the line we must cross

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.600
in deciding what we can and should make
of our species' improbable intelligence.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.120
Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.536
Our path to the stars
will be rife with trials

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.536
that will bring us to question
not only who we are

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.320
but where we will be going.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.736
The answers will lie in our choice
to use or abandon the technology

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.856
that we have gleaned from life itself,

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.736
and it will define us for the remainder
of our term in this universe.
