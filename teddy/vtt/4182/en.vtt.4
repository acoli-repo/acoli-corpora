When I hear them say such things,

00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:05.507
or sing songs like these,
I feel like I owe them an apology.

00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:10.171
What have the older generation, 
people like me, done for them?

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.115
But I still maintain that 
we are an amazing country.

00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:14.799
What an amazing country.

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.174
Where does the Ganga get its water from?

00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:19.977
From where?

00:02:20.216 --> 00:02:22.364
From the tall Himalayan mountains.

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.573
We pray even to those mountains.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.269
From the jungles.

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:29.260
These jungles which have a huge,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.254
a mind-boggling range of flora and fauna.
