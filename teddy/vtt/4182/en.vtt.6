if you threw 100 seeds, 99 would grow.

00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.962
Our land was fertile.
Our country was fertile.

00:03:06.137 --> 00:03:07.586
Our people were happy.


00:03:07.862 --> 00:03:09.924
We taught the world so much.

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.867
Now I think, we talk about thinking,

00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:17.178
the thinking has changed today.

00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:23.627
Today when people see the desert, 
they say let's make it green.

00:03:23.844 --> 00:03:25.896
I say, do not make it green

00:03:26.092 --> 00:03:28.333
because the desert has some creatures

00:03:28.563 --> 00:03:30.129
that can survive without water.
