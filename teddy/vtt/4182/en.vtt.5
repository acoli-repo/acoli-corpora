00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.254
a mind-boggling range of flora and fauna.

00:02:32.488 --> 00:02:33.639
And these jungles,

00:02:33.977 --> 00:02:36.691
I remember my old
Hindi teacher, Shankarji,

00:02:36.964 --> 00:02:40.806
used to say that 
jungle is the mother of the river.

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:43.632
Wherever there is jungle, 
there is water.

00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:46.130
That is why we go there to pray.

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:48.210
At the source of any river.

00:02:48.447 --> 00:02:50.020
What doesn’t the jungle hold?

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:52.576
And what an amazing country we have.

00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:54.954
Go to Andamans,
to the sea shore;

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.940
even if there was nothing,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.997
if you threw 100 seeds, 99 would grow.
