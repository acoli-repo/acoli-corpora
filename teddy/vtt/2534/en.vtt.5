It goes something like this:

00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:38.786
The people most at risk for these diseases

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.969
are also the ones least able
to pay for vaccines.

00:02:43.858 --> 00:02:47.257
This leaves little in the way
of market incentives

00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:50.245
for manufacturers to develop vaccines,

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.989
unless there are large numbers of people
who are at risk in wealthy countries.

00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:57.902
It's simply too commercially risky.

00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:03.408
As for Ebola, there is absolutely
no market at all,
