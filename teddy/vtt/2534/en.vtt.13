00:06:29.864 --> 00:06:31.867
and they're going to threaten the world.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.624
And vaccines are our best defense.

00:06:35.108 --> 00:06:39.417
So if we want to be able to prevent
epidemics like Ebola,

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:43.887
we need to take on the risk
of investing in vaccine development

00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:45.949
and in stockpile creation.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.385
And we need to view this, then,
as the ultimate deterrent --

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.529
something we make sure is available,

00:06:53.553 --> 00:06:57.192
but at the same time,
praying we never have to use it.

00:06:57.621 --> 00:06:58.772
Thank you.

00:06:58.796 --> 00:07:03.074
