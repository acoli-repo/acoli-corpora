00:00:59.373 --> 00:01:04.114
it has been Ebola that has stolen
all of the headlines and the fear.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.856
Clearly, there is something
deeply rooted about it,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.759
something which scares us
and fascinates us

00:01:10.783 --> 00:01:12.355
more than other diseases.

00:01:12.896 --> 00:01:14.490
But what is it, exactly?

00:01:15.357 --> 00:01:17.586
Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.087
but if you do, the risk
of a horrible death is high.

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:22.849
Why?

00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:27.689
Because right now, we don't have any
effective therapy or vaccine available.

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.276
And so, that's the clue.
