00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:32.763
Well, partially, because
it was really difficult --

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:35.436
or thought to be difficult --
to weaponize the virus,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.585
but mainly because
of the financial risk in developing it.

00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:42.822
And this is really the point.

00:03:43.718 --> 00:03:46.238
The sad reality is, we develop vaccines

00:03:46.262 --> 00:03:50.134
not based upon the risk
the pathogen poses to people,

00:03:50.158 --> 00:03:54.268
but on how economically risky it is
to develop these vaccines.

00:03:54.887 --> 00:03:57.796
Vaccine development
is expensive and complicated.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.891
It can cost hundreds
of millions of dollars

00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:04.223
to take even a well-known antigen
and turn it into a viable vaccine.
