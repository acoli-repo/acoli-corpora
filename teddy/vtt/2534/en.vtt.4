Ebola has this inevitability
that seems to defy modern medical science.

00:02:02.507 --> 00:02:04.261
But wait a second, why is that?

00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:07.607
We've known about Ebola since 1976.

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:10.108
We've known what it's capable of.

00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:12.762
We've had ample opportunity to study it

00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:15.174
in the 24 outbreaks that have occurred.

00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:19.967
And in fact, we've actually had
vaccine candidates available now

00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:21.348
for more than a decade.

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:26.295
Why is that those vaccines
are just going into clinical trials now?

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.764
This goes to the fundamental
problem we have

00:02:29.788 --> 00:02:32.792
with vaccine development
for infectious diseases.
