00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:31.931
It's an extreme form of dengue fever,
a mosquito-born disease

00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:36.016
which also does not have
an effective therapy or a vaccine,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.299
and kills 22,000 people each year.

00:00:40.018 --> 00:00:42.894
That is actually twice
the number of people

00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:44.947
that have been killed by Ebola

00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:48.010
in the nearly four decades
that we've known about it.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.439
As for measles, so much
in the news recently,

00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:56.285
the death toll is actually tenfold higher.

00:00:57.578 --> 00:00:59.349
Yet for the last year,

00:00:59.373 --> 00:01:04.114
it has been Ebola that has stolen
all of the headlines and the fear.
