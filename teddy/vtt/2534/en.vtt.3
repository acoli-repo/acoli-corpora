00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.276
And so, that's the clue.

00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:32.652
We may have it someday.

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:36.780
So we rightfully fear Ebola,

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:41.222
because it doesn't kill
as many people as other diseases.

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:47.246
In fact, it's much less transmissible
than viruses such as flu or measles.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.088
We fear Ebola because of the fact
that it kills us and we can't treat it.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:56.500
We fear the certain inevitability
that comes with Ebola.

00:01:56.524 --> 00:02:02.102
Ebola has this inevitability
that seems to defy modern medical science.
