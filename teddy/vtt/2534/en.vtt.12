00:05:58.763 --> 00:06:01.855
Every year, we spend billions of dollars,

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.952
keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines
permanently patrolling the oceans

00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:10.967
to protect us from a threat
that almost certainly will never happen.

00:06:11.527 --> 00:06:14.463
And yet, we spend virtually nothing

00:06:14.487 --> 00:06:19.514
to prevent something as tangible
and evolutionarily certain

00:06:19.538 --> 00:06:21.716
as epidemic infectious diseases.

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.904
And make no mistake about it --
it's not a question of "if," but "when."

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:29.840
These bugs are going to continue to evolve

00:06:29.864 --> 00:06:31.867
and they're going to threaten the world.
