00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:04.223
to take even a well-known antigen
and turn it into a viable vaccine.

00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:07.455
Fortunately for diseases like Ebola,

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.869
there are things we can do
to remove some of these barriers.

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:14.933
The first is to recognize
when there's a complete market failure.

00:04:15.314 --> 00:04:18.348
In that case, if we want vaccines,

00:04:18.372 --> 00:04:23.381
we have to provide incentives
or some type of subsidy.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:28.537
We also need to do a better job
at being able to figure out

00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:30.919
which are the diseases
that most threaten us.
