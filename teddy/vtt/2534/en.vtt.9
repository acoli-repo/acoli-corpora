00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:30.919
which are the diseases
that most threaten us.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.175
By creating capabilities within countries,
we then create the ability

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.816
for those countries to create
epidemiological and laboratory networks

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.109
which are capable of collecting
and categorizing these pathogens.

00:04:46.117 --> 00:04:48.379
The data from that then can be used

00:04:48.403 --> 00:04:51.682
to understand the geographic
and genetic diversity,

00:04:51.706 --> 00:04:54.342
which then can be used
to help us understand

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:58.009
how these are being changed
immunologically,

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:00.357
and what type of reactions they promote.
