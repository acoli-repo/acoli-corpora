00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How can we investigate

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
this flora of viruses that surround us, and aid medicine?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
into a simple, hand-held, single diagnostic assay?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and the spectrum of viruses that are out there

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
into, let's say, a small chip.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
When we started thinking about this project --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
how we would make a single diagnostic assay

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to screen for all pathogens simultaneously --
