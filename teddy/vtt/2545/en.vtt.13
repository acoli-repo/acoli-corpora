00:06:26.556 --> 00:06:31.466
All of a sudden, I saw my staff
running to rooms and locking the doors

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.443
and telling me, "Run away, hide!"

00:06:35.268 --> 00:06:37.776
And you know, as a leader, what do you do?

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.293
You're scared. You know it's dangerous.

00:06:42.317 --> 00:06:44.087
You know your life is on the line.

00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:46.896
But as a leader,
you have to hold it together.

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:50.007
You have to hold it together
and show strength.

00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:52.618
So I said, "What's going on?"

00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:55.507
And these people were pouring
into my office.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.539
So I invited them to the office.

00:06:57.563 --> 00:07:02.174
They came, and there were
nine of them -- nine Taliban.
