00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.482
I earned good money.

00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:32.172
I had a good life.

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:33.983
My family was here.

00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:35.998
I could live with them.

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.880
But I wasn't happy.

00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:39.625
I wanted to go back home.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.174
So I went to the refugee camp.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:46.102
And when I went
to the refugee camp in Pakistan,

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:49.031
there were 7.5 million refugees.

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:52.176
7.5 million refugees.

00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:56.993
About 90 percent of them
were women and children.

00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:01.088
Most of the men have been killed
or they were in war.
