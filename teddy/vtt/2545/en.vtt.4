00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:00.829
I brought my family to America.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.626
I wanted them to be safe.

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:05.808
But where was my heart?

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.197
My heart was in Afghanistan.

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:11.776
Day after day,
when I listened to the news,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.474
when I followed what was
going on with my country,

00:02:14.498 --> 00:02:16.069
my heart was breaking up.

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:18.641
I really wanted to go back to my country,

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:21.783
but at the same time I knew
I could not go there,

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:24.196
because there was no place for me.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.347
I had a good job.

00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:28.656
I was a professor at a university.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.482
I earned good money.
