00:08:28.777 --> 00:08:31.500
that's the way you work with those people,
and you know --

00:08:31.524 --> 00:08:32.975
(Laughter)

00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:37.022
So by that time,
they started speaking Pashto.

00:08:37.046 --> 00:08:38.975
They talked to each other,

00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:41.689
and they said, "Let's go,
leave her alone, she's OK."

00:08:42.904 --> 00:08:46.808
And you know, this time,
I offered them tea again,

00:08:46.832 --> 00:08:49.490
and they took a sip and they left.

00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:54.268
By that time, my staff
poured into my office.

00:08:54.292 --> 00:08:56.307
They were scared to death.

00:08:56.331 --> 00:08:58.402
They didn't know why they didn't kill me.

00:08:58.426 --> 00:09:00.863
They didn't know why
they didn't take me away.
