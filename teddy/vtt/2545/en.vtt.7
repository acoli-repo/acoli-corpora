00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:33.514
I saw young men that had lost
their father and their home,

00:03:33.538 --> 00:03:38.431
and they are supporting the family
as a 10-to-12-year old boy --

00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:40.145
being the head of the household,

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.360
trying to protect their sister
and their mother and their children.

00:03:44.113 --> 00:03:47.152
So it was a very devastating situation.

00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:50.104
My heart was beating for my people,

00:03:50.128 --> 00:03:51.795
and I didn't know what to do.

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:55.144
At that moment, we talk about momentum.

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:59.436
At that moment, I felt,
what can I do for these people?

00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:01.604
How could I help these people?
