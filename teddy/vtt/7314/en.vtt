You might believe that drinking milk,

00:00:01.914 --> 00:00:03.833
with all its calcium and vitamin D,

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:07.420
is the one thing you need
for strong and healthy bones.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.966
And it's a really nice message

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:15.511
but it's just not scientifically accurate.

So let's start at the beginning.

00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:27.231
Adults have 206 bones

00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:30.068
that form the main part
of the skeletal system.
