00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
doesn't mean it's not there."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What I wanted to do is to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
show the world that the little things

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
can be the biggest things.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We all seem to think that,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you know, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there.
