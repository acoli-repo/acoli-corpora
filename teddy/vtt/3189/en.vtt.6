00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.376
the bird is usually traveling
from point A to B,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.760
rather than circling above something dead.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.016
Actually, if you want to use a vulture
to try to find a body,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.096
look for a vulture in a tree
or on a fence post.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.896
Vultures are too big and slow to hunt.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.056
So they have to scavenge.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.936
In fact, vultures are
the only animals in the world

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.416
that depend upon death as a food source.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.696
The turkey vulture
that you see here is super cool,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.776
because it's one of the few bird species
that can actually smell.
