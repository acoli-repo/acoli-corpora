00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.376
One of the reasons I love vultures

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.416
is because they tend
to operate in a manner

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.576
that can be explained
by biology and physics.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.656
I started mentally going through
the numerous bating experiments

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.800
I had conducted at a body farm in Texas.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.776
A body farm is a place
where you can donate your body to science.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.080
I also went through
my experiences with trapping

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.920
and GPS tagging vultures.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.216
And then the year-long process
of monitoring vultures

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.760
via remote GPS technology.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.720
Next, I brought up my field notes
and had an "Aha!" moment.
