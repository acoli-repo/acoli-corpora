00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.016
Before we do that,
I want to tell you a story.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.816
So we're going to take a trip,
all 1,000 of us.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.896
It's May 2014 and we're standing in a park
in Nashville, Tennessee,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.816
because we've been at a horse race.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.096
As we wait for the porta potty,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.976
we see two ladies in their Sunday best:

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.096
heels, pearls and lovely,
floppy derby hats.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.536
At any moment, we expect them
to start talking

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.016
about their grandma's fine china.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.656
But they don't.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.536
Instead, we hear them say,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.936
"Oh, look.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.536
Something must be dead."
