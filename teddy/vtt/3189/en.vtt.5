00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.960
It's not that simple.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.416
I don't know if you've ever
seen a vulture up close

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.856
or spent much time with them,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.096
but they're huge, huge.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.016
Six-foot wingspan.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.096
Vultures circle in the air

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.936
because they are too big
to flap their wings and fly,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.456
so they soar.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.536
They soar in thermals,
which are vortexes or little tornadoes

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.136
caused by pressure differences in the air

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.416
that form throughout the day
as the sun heats up the ground.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.976
Therefore, when you see
a circling vulture,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.376
the bird is usually traveling
from point A to B,
