For example, here's an email
I received from a detective in Louisiana:

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.336
"Lauren, there's been a kidnapping.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.640
What buzzards or vultures
do we have in Louisiana?"

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.976
Before we address the kidnapping,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.736
I'll first address this buzzard/vulture
question I get all the time.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.176
Buzzards don't live in the United States.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.056
They are hawks that live in Europe.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.176
The big black birds you see circling
in the sky within the US are vultures.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.456
The two types of vultures
that live in Louisiana

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.240
are the turkey vulture and black vulture.
