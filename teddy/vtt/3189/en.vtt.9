00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.256
just like they will consume roadkill.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.136
But you don't ever hear about that,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.216
and it's because vultures
are so good at what they do.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.096
If vultures depend on death for survival
and if they scavenge humans,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.760
then how can vultures be absent from
forensic textbooks and training manuals?

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.096
The answer:

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.216
the tradition has been for researchers
to exclude animal scavengers

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.496
from decomposition studies

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.216
by placing a cage
over the decaying subject matter.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.656
Why?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.576
Because researchers were afraid an animal
would run away with their subject matter
