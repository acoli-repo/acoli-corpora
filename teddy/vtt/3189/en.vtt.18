This photo illustrates
the scavenging efficiency of vultures.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.416
This is important because it helps
support the time line

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.840
the detectives are putting
together for the murder.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.336
There's not a whole lot of evidence.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.776
You're not likely going to see
the vultures at the crime scene.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.280
Instead, vultures just leave
these very subtle clues.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.336
Rather than looking for the vulture,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.216
look for the feathers and pristine bones.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.496
Vultures are important

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.136
because they are so good
and fast at what they do.
