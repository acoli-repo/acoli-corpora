00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.216
Therefore, the importance
of vultures is not in the air,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.440
but on the ground.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.240
Vulture scavenging is somewhat gruesome.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.976
If you're ever on a bad first date,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.576
just reference this talk,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.456
and I don't think you'll have to worry

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.016
about your potential suitor
giving you another call.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.416
(Laughter)

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.496
Although gruesome,
vultures are key forensic players,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.760
and here's why.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.896
Vultures will consume a dead human

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.256
just like they will consume roadkill.
