because it's one of the few bird species
that can actually smell.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.576
It hones in on the deceased
by sensing a chemical

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.280
that's coming off the body during decay.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.496
The evolutionary role of the vulture

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.320
is to rid the earth of harmful toxins
produced following death.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.576
Once death has been detected,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.560
the turkey vulture lands
and quickly scavenges.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.136
Vultures usually remove the eyes first,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.736
then tear the skin,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.160
start pulling the tissues,
and leave you with a skeleton.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.216
Therefore, the importance
of vultures is not in the air,
