The feathers were next
to a bloody pine cone.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.616
Vultures aren't attracted to blood,
and they typically don't wander.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.776
They might wander 40 feet,
but they're not going to wander 40 yards.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.496
That would be a waste of energy

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.000
for a bird that doesn't know
when it will get its next meal.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.056
So my first job here was to determine
if vultures were at the scene.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.920
Indeed, the feather by the pine cone
was consistent with the turkey vulture.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.880
So why in the world
would a vulture wander 40 yards?

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.376
One of the reasons I love vultures
