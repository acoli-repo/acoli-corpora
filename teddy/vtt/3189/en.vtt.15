I knew of two things that would
lure a vulture 40 yards from a body.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.760
Guts and brain matter.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.936
I presented this information
to the detectives

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.056
and learned that they suspected
the victim had been incapacitated

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.096
by blunt force trauma to the head.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.456
The blow to the head
was thought to have occurred

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.496
in the area where the pine cone was found,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.080
and then the victim was drug 40 yards
and buried in a shallow grave.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.696
This suggested that brain matter
was the lure for the vulture
