[This talk contains graphic images]

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.720
My parents always wanted me
to be a doctor.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.976
But a doctor that studies
how vultures eat dead things

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.176
is probably not the type of doctor
my parents had in mind.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.936
(Laughter)

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.216
I study vulture scavenging behavior
and how vultures affect crime scenes.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.576
I'm here to talk to you
about how we take vultures for granted

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.960
in forensic science.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.016
Before we do that,
I want to tell you a story.
