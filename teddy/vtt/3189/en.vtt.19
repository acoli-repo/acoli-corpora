00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.136
because they are so good
and fast at what they do.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.816
They're like tornadoes.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.200
If you blink, you will miss them.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.640
I provided my opinion about
the vulture evidence to the detective.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.400
And he presented
the vulture evidence in court.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.200
The kidnapping case
was a death penalty case.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.680
And the defendant was found guilty.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.216
This case illustrates
how studying vulture behavior

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.880
helps innovate forensic science.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.456
Someone who has been murdered

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.640
deserves the most thorough
investigation possible.
