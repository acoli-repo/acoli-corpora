00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.856
And the skeletonized body
could have been there

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.096
for as little as five days
if scavenged by vultures.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.976
The failure to account
for vulture scavenging

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.736
can result in forensic scientists
inaccurately estimating

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.976
how long someone has been dead

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.880
and then searching through the wrong
missing person's files.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.616
Therefore, the goal is to get forensic
scientists to focus on vulture evidence

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.776
and to get law enforcement
to consider vulture scavenging

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.800
and a possible recent death
when skeletal remains are found.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.496
Let's get back to the importance
of the kidnapping case.
