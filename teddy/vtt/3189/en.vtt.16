This suggested that brain matter

studying vulture behavior

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.640
can help piece together
some of the evidence.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.760
The detectives also sent me this photo.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.360
The victim's arm is sticking up
out of the grave.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.936
As a forensic scientist,
you have to think about the whole picture.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.640
The feather by the pine cone
indicated that vultures were at the scene.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.776
This crime scene photo also depicts

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.176
characteristic vulture
scavenging behavior.
