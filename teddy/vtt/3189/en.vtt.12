00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.496
Let's get back to the importance
of the kidnapping case.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.936
I responded to the detectives

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.336
and told them that vultures
like areas with water.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.256
They like areas with white-tailed deer,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.376
they typically arrive within
the first five days following death,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.160
they're going to leave
an intact spinal column and feathers.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.936
The detectives write back and say,

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.400
"We found the body buried
in a shallow grave.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.320
We also found the feathers you mentioned."

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.336
But there appeared to be a problem

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.856
because the feathers were located
40 yards from where the body was found.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.376
The feathers were next
to a bloody pine cone.
