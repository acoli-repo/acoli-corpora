00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.240
are the turkey vulture and black vulture.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.376
To fully understand the role
of vultures in forensic science,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.480
I'll walk you through this forensic case.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.560
From the email,
certain things become apparent.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.376
We can assume the detective thinks
the individual is dead.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.840
And he wants to use the birds
to try to find the body.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.536
Like the ladies in Nashville,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.176
the detective thinks
that vultures circling in the sky

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.720
will lead him to the body.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.960
It's not that simple.
