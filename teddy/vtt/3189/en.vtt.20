00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.640
deserves the most thorough
investigation possible.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.576
When we include vultures
in forensic studies,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.256
we paint a more thorough picture
of what happened, when it happened

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.600
and who it happened to.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.016
So, the next time you're
at a crime scene with a dead body --

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.776
(Laughter)

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.776
look to the ground
to find the clues vultures have left.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.136
And if anyone ever
brings up vultures on a date,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.336
you'll know they're a keeper.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.576
Thank you.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.280
