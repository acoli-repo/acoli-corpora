00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:10.361
Following a devastating nuclear war,

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:14.661
Lilith Iyapo awakens
after 250 years of stasis

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:18.857
to find herself surrounded by a group 
of aliens called the Oankali.

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:21.737
These highly evolved beings
want to trade DNA

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:23.157
by breeding with humans

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:27.517
so that each speciesâ€™ genes 
can diversify and fortify the other.

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:32.257
The only alternative they offer is 
sterilization of the entire human race.
