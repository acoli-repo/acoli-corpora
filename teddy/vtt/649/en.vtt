00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:05.809
The Silicon Valley and the internet
gave me superpowers,

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.643
tools to go to battle with,

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.643
a suit to take bullets with

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:16.250
and a giant signal in the sky
that told me when it was time to fight.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:20.684
Now, I can't actually prove any of this.

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:22.726
I am not a "scientist,"

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.208
I don't have "facts."

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:28.434
In fact, my Rotten Tomato score
is running around 50 percent right now,

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:30.226
so I'm not sure why they let me in.
