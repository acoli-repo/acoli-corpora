00:02:27.202 --> 00:02:31.223
that run deep into the connective 
tissue of their face.

00:02:31.223 --> 00:02:34.956
Sea lions have full directional control 
over these whiskers,

00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:39.509
which can lie flat against their face, 
or stick out at a 90-degree angle.

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:40.812
When properly tuned,

00:02:40.812 --> 00:02:45.792
these whiskers can sense the slim trails 
of moving water fish leave in their wake.

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:49.128
And they’re precise enough to let 
blindfolded sea lions

00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:54.318
tell the difference between objects less 
than two centimeters different in size.

00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:58.525
With these tools a healthy sea lion can
catch generous helpings of fish

00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:02.476
such as anchovy, mackerel, 
and squid on every outing.
