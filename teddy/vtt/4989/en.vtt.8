00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:01.322
This tragic discovery is just one 
of the many ways

00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:04.089
the health of aquatic animal 
communities can help us

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.529
better understand Earth’s oceans.

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.680
These red flags help us take action

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.800
to protect ourselves and other 
maritime mammals.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.564
And the more we can learn about the 
changing ocean that sea lions inhabit,

00:04:15.564 --> 00:04:20.264
the better equipped we’ll be to help 
these clever creatures thrive.
