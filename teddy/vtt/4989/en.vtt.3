00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.316
which rely on reserve oxygen 
stored in blood and muscle.

00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:35.424
Once they arrive at their hunting ground,

00:01:35.424 --> 00:01:39.649
sea lions depend on their superior 
vision to find their prey.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.531
Most mammal eyes have 
a structure called a lens–

00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:47.351
a transparent, convex structure whose 
shape refracts light to enable sight.

00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:52.295
In humans, this lens is curved to process 
light waves traveling through air.

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:56.833
But sea lions need to see their 
best at hundreds of meters deep.

00:01:56.833 --> 00:02:01.773
To accommodate, their eyes have a much 
rounder lens to refract light underwater,
