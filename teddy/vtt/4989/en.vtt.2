00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:04.379
by collapsing their pliable rib cage, 
and compressing a pair of springy lungs.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.151
This pushes air up through 
the smaller airways,

00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:11.298
collapsing rings of cartilage as 
oxygen travels out from the lungs,

00:01:11.298 --> 00:01:14.296
to be held in the larger, upper airways.

00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:18.514
Upon surfacing, this air will be 
used to re-inflate the lungs,

00:01:18.514 --> 00:01:22.825
but for now their heart slows 
down to preserve oxygen.

00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:26.657
Blood flow is redirected towards 
only the most essential organs

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:29.109
like the heart, lungs, and brain,

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.316
which rely on reserve oxygen 
stored in blood and muscle.
