00:01:56.833 --> 00:02:01.773
To accommodate, their eyes have a much 
rounder lens to refract light underwater,

00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:03.851
as well as teardrop-shaped pupils

00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:07.380
which can expand to 25 times 
their original size.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.593
This lets in as much light as possible,

00:02:09.593 --> 00:02:14.330
helping them pinpoint their prey in 
even the dimmest conditions.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.892
But once they’ve closed in,

00:02:15.892 --> 00:02:21.352
they rely on something akin to a sixth 
sense to actually catch their meal.

00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:24.003
Their whiskers, or vibrissae,

00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:27.202
are composed of keratin 
and full of nerve fibers

00:02:27.202 --> 00:02:31.223
that run deep into the connective 
tissue of their face.
