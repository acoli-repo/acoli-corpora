00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:32.840
Hurtling around at speeds from 
4 to 18 miles an hour

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.706
and hunting for up to 30 hours at a time,

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:39.011
these majestic mammals live 
up to their name.

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:41.963
And thanks to a suite of 
physical adaptations,

00:00:41.963 --> 00:00:47.235
finely tuned over millions of years, 
they make for resourceful foragers.

00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:48.900
To find their favorite food,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.542
sea lions hunt much deeper than 
many of their semi-aquatic peers.

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:57.000
With some species diving to 
depths of nearly 400 meters,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.307
they’re able to cope with 
the mounting pressure

00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:04.379
by collapsing their pliable rib cage, 
and compressing a pair of springy lungs.
