00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:16.040
Sunning themselves on rocks or waddling 
awkwardly across the beach,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.031
it’s easy to think of these immobile 
mammals less as sea lions,

00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:22.478
and more as sea house cats.

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:25.002
But don’t be fooled by their 
beachside behavior.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:29.284
Under the waves, sea lions are 
incredible endurance hunters.

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:32.840
Hurtling around at speeds from 
4 to 18 miles an hour
