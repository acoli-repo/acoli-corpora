Yet despite these incredible adaptations,

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.966
there are changes unfolding 
in their habitats

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:35.799
too rapidly for sea lions to handle.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.944
As climate change warms the oceans, 
certain toxic algae species thrive.

00:03:40.944 --> 00:03:43.804
This algae is harmless to 
the fish who eat it,

00:03:43.804 --> 00:03:46.235
but for the sea lions which 
ingest those fish,

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:50.517
the algae’s domoic acid can trigger 
seizures and brain damage.

00:03:50.517 --> 00:03:53.918
Changing ocean conditions keep 
this algae blooming year round,

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:58.364
causing more and more sea lions 
to wash up on beaches.

00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:01.322
This tragic discovery is just one 
of the many ways
