00:00:00.916 --> 00:00:03.170
When I was preparing for this talk,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.146
I went to search for a couple of quotes

00:00:05.146 --> 00:00:06.991
that I can share with you.

00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.162
Good news: I found three

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:10.994
that I particularly liked,

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:14.472
the first by Samuel Johnson, who said,

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:16.712
"When making your choice in life,

00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:19.468
do not forget to live,"

00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:23.000
the second by Aeschylus, who reminded us that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.305
"happiness is a choice that requires effort,"

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:30.830
and the third is one by Groucho Marx
