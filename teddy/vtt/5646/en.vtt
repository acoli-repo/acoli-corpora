00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:12.887
Imagine a distant future when humans
reach beyond our pale blue dot,

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:17.019
forge cities on planets 
thousands of light-years away,

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.516
and maintain a galactic web 
of trade and transport.

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:25.406
What would it take for our civilization
to make that leap?

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:28.356
There are many things to considerâ€”
how would we communicate?

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:30.996
What might a galactic government
look like?
