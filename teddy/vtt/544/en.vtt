I am a neurosurgeon,

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:07.462
and I'm here to tell you today
that people like me need your help.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.143
And in a few moments, I will tell you how.

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:14.287
But first, let me start off by telling you
about a patient of mine.

00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:16.954
This was a woman in her 50s,

00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:19.025
she was in generally good shape,

00:00:19.049 --> 00:00:21.437
but she had been in and out
of hospital a few times

00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:24.688
due to curative breast cancer treatment.

00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:28.641
Now she had gotten a prolapse
from a cervical disc,

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:32.339
giving her radiating pain of a tense kind,
