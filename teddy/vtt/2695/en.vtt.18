00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.256
is that transformation comes
when I'm not in charge,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.457
when I don't know what's coming next,

00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:08.008
when I can't assume I am bigger
than everything around me.

00:09:09.191 --> 00:09:11.097
And the same is true in love

00:09:11.643 --> 00:09:13.919
or in moments of crisis.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:18.371
Suddenly, we're back in that trishaw again

00:09:18.395 --> 00:09:22.430
and we're bumping off the broad,
well-lit streets;

00:09:22.454 --> 00:09:26.118
and we're reminded, really,
of the first law of travel

00:09:26.142 --> 00:09:27.868
and, therefore, of life:

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.829
you're only as strong
as your readiness to surrender.
