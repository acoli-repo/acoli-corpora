00:06:31.621 --> 00:06:34.434
The parents of us all,
as some people call them,

00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:35.617
Adam and Eve,

00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:39.799
could never die, so long as they
were eating from the tree of life.

00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:42.829
But the minute they began nibbling

00:06:42.853 --> 00:06:45.435
from the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil,

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:47.263
they fell from their innocence.

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:50.833
They grew embarrassed and fretful,

00:06:50.857 --> 00:06:52.054
self-conscious.

00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:55.233
And they learned,
a little too late, perhaps,

00:06:55.257 --> 00:06:57.997
that there are certainly some things
that we need to know,

00:06:58.021 --> 00:07:01.968
but there are many, many more
that are better left unexplored.
