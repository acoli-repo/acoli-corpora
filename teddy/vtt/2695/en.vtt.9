00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:30.414
But when a mathematician tells me

00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:33.961
that minus three times
minus three makes nine,

00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:38.854
that's a kind of logic
that almost feels like trust.

00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:44.435
The opposite of knowledge, in other words,
isn't always ignorance.

00:04:44.948 --> 00:04:46.098
It can be wonder.

00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:47.632
Or mystery.

00:04:47.964 --> 00:04:49.147
Possibility.

00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:53.731
And in my life, I've found
it's the things I don't know

00:04:53.755 --> 00:04:56.434
that have lifted me up
and pushed me forwards

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:59.026
much more than the things I do know.
