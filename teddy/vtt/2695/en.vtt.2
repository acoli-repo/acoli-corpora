so he could catch the first visitors
off the all-night train.

00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:19.392
And very soon, we found
that in certain ways,

00:01:19.416 --> 00:01:21.082
we had so much in common --

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:22.967
we were both in our 20s,

00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:26.203
we were both fascinated
by foreign cultures --

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:28.658
that he invited me home.
