00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:33.863
So we turned off the wide,
crowded streets,

00:01:33.887 --> 00:01:38.097
and we began bumping
down rough, wild alleyways.

00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:40.469
There were broken shacks all around.

00:01:40.493 --> 00:01:43.335
I really lost the sense of where I was,

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:47.818
and I realized that anything
could happen to me now.

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:50.284
I could get mugged or drugged

00:01:50.308 --> 00:01:51.624
or something worse.

00:01:51.648 --> 00:01:53.032
Nobody would know.

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:58.006
Finally, he stopped and led me into a hut,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.354
which consisted of just one tiny room.
