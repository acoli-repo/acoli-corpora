00:00:01.436 --> 00:00:04.643
One hot October morning,

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:07.377
I got off the all-night train

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:08.559
in Mandalay,

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:11.701
the old royal capital of Burma,

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:13.142
now Myanmar.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.858
And out on the street, I ran into
a group of rough men

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:21.775
standing beside their bicycle rickshaws.

00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:23.169
And one of them came up

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:25.375
and offered to show me around.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:29.279
The price he quoted was outrageous.

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:33.820
It was less than I would pay
for a bar of chocolate at home.
