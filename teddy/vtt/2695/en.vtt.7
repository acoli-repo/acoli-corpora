00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:30.795
to hear some exhilarating
new ideas and discoveries

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.575
and, really, about all the ways

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.922
in which knowledge is being
pushed excitingly forwards.

00:03:36.797 --> 00:03:40.026
But at some point, knowledge gives out.

00:03:40.802 --> 00:03:42.026
And that is the moment

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.685
when your life is truly decided:

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.507
you fall in love;

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:49.928
you lose a friend;

00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:52.465
the lights go out.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.014
And it's then, when you're lost
or uneasy or carried out of yourself,

00:03:58.038 --> 00:04:00.200
that you find out who you are.
