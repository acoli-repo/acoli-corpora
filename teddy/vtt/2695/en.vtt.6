00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:02.737
At home, it's dangerously easy

00:03:02.761 --> 00:03:04.971
to assume we're on top of things.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.822
Out in the world, you are reminded
every moment that you're not,

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.855
and you can't get to the bottom
of things, either.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:17.137
Everywhere, "People wish to be settled,"

00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:19.440
Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us,

00:03:19.464 --> 00:03:22.140
"but only insofar
as we are unsettled

00:03:22.164 --> 00:03:23.850
is there any hope for us."

00:03:24.891 --> 00:03:27.318
At this conference,
we've been lucky enough

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:30.795
to hear some exhilarating
new ideas and discoveries
