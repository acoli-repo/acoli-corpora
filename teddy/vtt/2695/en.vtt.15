00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:31.197
explaining every last detail
about Japan's temples,

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.903
its fashions, its baseball games,

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.649
its soul.

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:39.606
But underneath all that,

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.807
something that I couldn't understand

00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:47.325
so moved me for reasons
I couldn't explain to you yet,

00:07:48.087 --> 00:07:51.296
that I decided to go and live in Japan.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.201
And now that I've been there for 28 years,

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.625
I really couldn't tell you
very much at all

00:07:57.649 --> 00:07:59.313
about my adopted home.
