It's also the things I don't know

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:05.439
that have often brought me closer
to everybody around me.

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:08.549
For eight straight Novembers, recently,

00:05:08.573 --> 00:05:13.001
I traveled every year across Japan
with the Dalai Lama.

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:17.101
And the one thing he said every day

00:05:17.125 --> 00:05:20.672
that most seemed to give people
reassurance and confidence

00:05:20.696 --> 00:05:22.754
was, "I don't know."

00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:26.202
"What's going to happen to Tibet?"

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:30.206
"When are we ever
going to get world peace?"
