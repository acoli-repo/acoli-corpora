00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:32.518
little black-and-white worn snapshots

00:02:32.542 --> 00:02:34.746
of his new foreign friends.

00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:40.014
So when we said goodbye that night,

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:42.625
I realized he had also shown me

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.959
the secret point of travel,

00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:47.039
which is to take a plunge,

00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:49.755
to go inwardly as well as outwardly

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.294
to places you would never go otherwise,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.498
to venture into uncertainty,

00:02:55.928 --> 00:02:57.101
ambiguity,

00:02:57.498 --> 00:02:58.780
even fear.
