00:08:00.222 --> 00:08:01.569
Which is wonderful,

00:08:01.593 --> 00:08:04.473
because it means every day
I'm making some new discovery,

00:08:04.497 --> 00:08:05.988
and in the process,

00:08:06.012 --> 00:08:09.906
looking around the corner
and seeing the hundred thousand things

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.231
I'll never know.

00:08:12.964 --> 00:08:15.430
Knowledge is a priceless gift.

00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:21.007
But the illusion of knowledge
can be more dangerous than ignorance.

00:08:21.895 --> 00:08:24.528
Thinking that you know your lover

00:08:25.115 --> 00:08:26.272
or your enemy

00:08:26.621 --> 00:08:28.076
can be more treacherous

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.548
than acknowledging you'll never know them.
