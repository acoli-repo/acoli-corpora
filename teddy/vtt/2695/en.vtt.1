00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:33.820
It was less than I would pay
for a bar of chocolate at home.

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:36.985
So I clambered into his trishaw,

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:42.880
and he began pedaling us slowly
between palaces and pagodas.

00:00:43.972 --> 00:00:49.271
And as he did, he told me how
he had come to the city from his village.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:51.674
He'd earned a degree in mathematics.

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:54.025
His dream was to be a teacher.

00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:59.257
But of course, life is hard
under a military dictatorship,

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:03.401
and so for now, this was the only way
he could make a living.
