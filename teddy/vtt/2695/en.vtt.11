00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:30.206
"When are we ever
going to get world peace?"

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:32.826
"What's the best way to raise children?"

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:37.205
"Frankly," says this very wise man,

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.466
"I don't know."

00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:43.818
The Nobel Prize-winning
economist Daniel Kahneman

00:05:43.842 --> 00:05:48.345
has spent more than 60 years now
researching human behavior,

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:50.401
and his conclusion is

00:05:50.425 --> 00:05:55.039
that we are always much more confident
of what we think we know

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.788
than we should be.

00:05:56.812 --> 00:05:59.471
We have, as he memorably puts it,

00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:03.699
an "unlimited ability
to ignore our ignorance."
