00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm here to talk to you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about the economic invisibility of nature.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The bad news

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so those invoices don't get issued.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But we need to do something about this problem.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I began my life as a markets professional

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and continued to take an interest,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but most of my recent effort

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
has been looking at the value

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of what comes to human beings from nature,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and which doesn't get priced by the markets.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
A project called TEEB was started in 2007,
