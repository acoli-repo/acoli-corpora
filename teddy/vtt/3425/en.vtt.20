change the way society works,

00:10:02.129 --> 00:10:03.383
but we're not doing it.

00:10:03.407 --> 00:10:05.831
Wizards have been arguing
literally for decades

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:10.831
that nuclear power is key
to resolving climate change.

00:10:12.174 --> 00:10:16.403
But the first pro-nuke march in history
occurred less than two years ago,

00:10:16.427 --> 00:10:19.689
and it was dwarfed by the anti-nuke
marches of the past.

00:10:19.713 --> 00:10:22.839
Prophets have been arguing,
again literally for decades,

00:10:22.863 --> 00:10:26.626
that conservation is key
to keeping freshwater supplies

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.485
without destroying the ecosystems
that generate those freshwater supplies.
