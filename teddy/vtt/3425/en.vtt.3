00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.580
Put a couple of protozoa
into a petri dish full of nutrient goo.

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:38.148
In their natural habitat, soil or water,
their environment constrains them.

00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:41.271
In the petri dish, they have
an ocean of breakfast

00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:42.661
and no natural enemies.

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:45.193
They eat and reproduce, eat and reproduce,

00:01:45.217 --> 00:01:47.476
until bang, they hit
the edge of the petri dish,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.935
at which point they either
drown in their own waste,

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.864
starve from lack of resources, or both.

00:01:51.888 --> 00:01:54.596
The outbreak ends, always, badly.

00:01:54.953 --> 00:01:57.386
Now, from the viewpoint of biology,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.352
you and I are not fundamentally different
than the protozoa in the petri dish.
