Those neighborhood-run solar facilities,

00:06:30.683 --> 00:06:32.447
they sound great,

00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:35.176

that doesn't exist yet.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.554
They're a fantasy.

00:06:37.012 --> 00:06:39.838
And recycling water? It's a brake
on growth and development.

00:06:39.862 --> 00:06:43.345
Above all, though, wizards object
to the prophets' emphasis

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.407

00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:47.869
which they see as deeply anti-democratic.

00:06:49.105 --> 00:06:53.009
If the history of the last two centuries
was one of unbridled growth,

00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:56.218
the history of the coming century
may well be the choice we make

00:06:56.242 --> 00:06:58.457
as a species between these two paths.

00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:02.918
These are the arguments that will be
resolved, in one way or another,
