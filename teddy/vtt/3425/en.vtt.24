00:11:59.717 --> 00:12:01.904
These are just ideas
from a random journalist.

00:12:01.928 --> 00:12:04.982
I'm sure there's a hundred better ones
right here in this room.

00:12:05.006 --> 00:12:06.157
The main point is,

00:12:06.181 --> 00:12:10.180
wizards and prophets working together
have many paths to success.

00:12:10.204 --> 00:12:12.876
And success would mean

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.151
important though that is.

00:12:14.175 --> 00:12:17.160

get water to everybody,

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.807
get power to everybody,

00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:24.928

00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:27.011
if we somehow safeguard the biome,

00:12:27.035 --> 00:12:28.265
it would be amazing.

00:12:29.405 --> 00:12:31.186
