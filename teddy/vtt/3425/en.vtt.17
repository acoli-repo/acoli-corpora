00:08:29.494 --> 00:08:31.445
is to stop wasting it,

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.366

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.190
in rich places as well as poor,

00:08:36.214 --> 00:08:38.801

to leaky and contaminated pipes.

00:08:41.515 --> 00:08:45.044
I mean, Cape Town, just a little
while ago, almost ran out of water.

00:08:45.068 --> 00:08:47.635

getting worse for decades,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.595

If you're a wizard, and you think
that clean, abundant,

00:08:55.892 --> 00:08:58.761
carbon-free nuclear power
is key to fighting climate change,

00:08:58.785 --> 00:09:00.026
then you have to worry
