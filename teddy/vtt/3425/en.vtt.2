00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.626
Natural selection ordinarily
keeps populations and species

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.332
within roughly defined limits.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.341
Pests, parasites, lack of resources
prevent them from expanding too much.

00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:11.804
But every now and then,
a species escapes its bounds.

00:01:12.116 --> 00:01:14.508
Crown-of-thorns starfish
in the Indian Ocean,

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:18.112
zebra mussels in the Great Lakes,
spruce budworm here in Canada.

00:01:18.136 --> 00:01:21.279
Populations explode,
a hundredfold, a thousandfold,

00:01:21.303 --> 00:01:22.509
a millionfold.

00:01:23.023 --> 00:01:25.565
So here's a fundamental
lesson from biology:

00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:27.777
outbreaks in nature don't end well.

00:01:28.126 --> 00:01:29.276
(Laughter)

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.580
Put a couple of protozoa
into a petri dish full of nutrient goo.
