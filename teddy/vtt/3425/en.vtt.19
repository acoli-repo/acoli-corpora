00:09:26.749 --> 00:09:30.702
the amount of energy generated every year
from fossil fuels has gone up

00:09:30.726 --> 00:09:34.057
by about 30 percent
since the beginning of this century.

00:09:34.443 --> 00:09:37.760
So, still think we're different
than the protozoa?

00:09:38.498 --> 00:09:40.768
Still think we're special?

00:09:42.392 --> 00:09:44.955
Actually, it's even worse than that.

00:09:44.979 --> 00:09:47.567
(Laughter)

00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:48.842
We're not in the streets.

00:09:48.866 --> 00:09:52.041
No seriously, if there's a difference
between us and the protozoa,

00:09:52.065 --> 00:09:53.607
a difference that matters,

00:09:53.631 --> 00:09:56.708
it's not just our art and science
and technology and so forth --

00:09:56.732 --> 00:09:59.963
it's that we can yell and scream,
we can go out into the streets,

00:09:59.987 --> 00:10:02.105
and, over time,
change the way society works,
