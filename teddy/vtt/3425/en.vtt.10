00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:02.048
that isn't a cesspool
of corruption and inequality?

00:05:03.055 --> 00:05:09.691
Instead, prophets pray for a world
of smaller, interconnected communities,

00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:11.881
closer to the earth,

00:05:11.905 --> 00:05:14.922
a more agrarian world
of maximum human connection

00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:16.849
and reduced corporate control.

00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:20.873
More people live
in the countryside in this vision,

00:05:20.897 --> 00:05:24.238
with power provided by neighborhood-scale
solar and wind installations

00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:26.071
that disappear into the background.

00:05:26.698 --> 00:05:30.404
Prophets don't generate water
from giant desalination plants.
