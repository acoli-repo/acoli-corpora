00:02:58.617 --> 00:03:02.594
and in my experience, their answers
fall into two broad categories,

00:03:02.618 --> 00:03:04.577
which I call "wizards" and "prophets."

00:03:04.994 --> 00:03:06.808
Wizards, techno-whizzes,

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:09.640
believe that science and technology,
properly applied,

00:03:09.664 --> 00:03:12.288
will let us produce
our way out of our dilemmas.

00:03:12.312 --> 00:03:13.989
"Be smart, make more," they say.

00:03:14.013 --> 00:03:15.664
"That way, everyone can win."

00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:18.719
Prophets believe close to the opposite.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.881
They see the world as governed
by fundamental ecological processes

00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:26.663
with limits that we
transgress to our peril.

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:29.222
"Use less, conserve," they say.

00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:31.317
"Otherwise, everybody's going to lose."
