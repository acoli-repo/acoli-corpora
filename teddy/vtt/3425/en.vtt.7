"Otherwise, everybody's going to lose."

00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:35.689
Wizards and prophets have been
butting their heads together for decades,

00:03:35.713 --> 00:03:39.396
but they both believe that technology
is key to a successful future.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.467
The trouble is, they envision
different types of technology

00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.269
and different types of futures.

00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:50.128
Wizards envision a world of glittering,
hyperefficient megacities

00:03:50.152 --> 00:03:53.114
surrounded by vast tracts
of untouched nature,

00:03:53.138 --> 00:03:55.758
economies that have
transitioned from atoms to bits,

00:03:55.782 --> 00:03:57.823
dematerialized capitalist societies

00:03:57.847 --> 00:04:00.076
that no longer depend
on exploiting nature.
