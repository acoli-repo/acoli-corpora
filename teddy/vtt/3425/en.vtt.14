00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:02.918
These are the arguments that will be
resolved, in one way or another,

00:07:02.942 --> 00:07:04.406
by our children's generation,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.246
the generation that will come
into the world of 10 billion.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.532
Now, but wait, by this point,
biologists should be rolling their eyes

00:07:10.556 --> 00:07:12.442
so loud you can barely hear me speak.

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:16.163
They should be saying,
all of this, wizards, prophets,

00:07:16.187 --> 00:07:17.539
it's a pipe dream.

00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:21.731
It doesn't matter which illusory path
you think you're taking.

00:07:22.736 --> 00:07:25.172
Outbreaks in nature don't end well.

00:07:25.196 --> 00:07:28.672
I mean, you think the protozoa
see the edge of the petri dish approaching

00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:30.791
and say, "Hey guys,
time to change society"?
