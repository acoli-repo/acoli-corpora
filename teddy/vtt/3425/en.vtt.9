You can't dematerialize
food and water, they point out.

00:04:31.557 --> 00:04:33.693
They say, you can't eat bits,

00:04:33.717 --> 00:04:37.241
and industrial agriculture has already
given us massive soil erosion,

00:04:37.265 --> 00:04:40.186
huge coastal dead zones
and ruined soil microbiomes.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.157
And you wizards, you want more of this?

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.599
And those giant desalination plants?

00:04:44.623 --> 00:04:47.592
You know they generate
equally giant piles of toxic salt

00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:49.884
that are basically
impossible to dispose of.

00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:52.608
And those megacities you like?

00:04:52.632 --> 00:04:55.697
Can you name me
an actually existing megacity

00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:58.945
that really exists in the world today,
except for possibly Tokyo,

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:02.048
that isn't a cesspool
of corruption and inequality?
