00:00:28.336 --> 00:00:31.772
then rockets up exponentially
in the 19th and 20th century.

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:35.156
Or choose a measure of consumption:

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.529
consumption of energy,
consumption of fresh water,

00:00:37.553 --> 00:00:39.624
consumption of the world's photosynthesis,

00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:41.870
and draw a graph of its value over time.

00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:45.966
In the same way, the line skitters along
at a low level for millennia,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.998
then rockets up exponentially
in the 19th and 20th century.

00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:53.077
Biologists have a word for this: outbreak.

00:00:53.894 --> 00:00:56.507
An outbreak is when
a population or species

00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:58.586
exceeds the bounds of natural selection.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.626
Natural selection ordinarily
keeps populations and species
