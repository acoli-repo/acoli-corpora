00:00:00.698 --> 00:00:01.848
How are we doing?

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.215
No, no, no, by that, I meant,

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:05.920
how are we, homo sapiens "we" ...

00:00:05.944 --> 00:00:06.952
(Laughter)

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:08.127
doing as a species?

00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:09.161
(Laughter)

00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:11.636
Now the typical way
to answer that question is this.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.785
You choose some measure
of human physical well-being:

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.507
average longevity,
average calories per day,

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:20.173
average income, overall population,
that sort of thing,

00:00:20.197 --> 00:00:23.107
and draw a graph of its value over time.

00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:25.597
In almost every case,
you get the same result.

00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:28.312
The line skitters along
at a low level for millennia,

00:00:28.336 --> 00:00:31.772
then rockets up exponentially
in the 19th and 20th century.
