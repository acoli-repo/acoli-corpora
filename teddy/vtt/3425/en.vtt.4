00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.352
you and I are not fundamentally different
than the protozoa in the petri dish.

00:02:01.884 --> 00:02:03.471
We're not special.

00:02:05.598 --> 00:02:08.734
All the things that we, in our vanity,
think make us different --

00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:11.524
art, science, technology, and so forth,
they don't matter.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:12.817
We're an outbreak species,

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:16.296
we're going to hit the edge
of the petri dish, simple as that.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.177
Well, the obvious question:
Is this actually true?

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:22.433
Are we in fact doomed
to hit the edge of the petri dish?

00:02:22.457 --> 00:02:24.726
I'd like to set aside
this question for a moment

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.274
and ask you guys another one.

00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:29.369
If we are going to escape biology,
how are we going to do it?
