00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:30.791

00:07:38.242 --> 00:07:43.889

00:07:53.704 --> 00:07:55.528
and use it to guide our future.

00:07:55.552 --> 00:07:57.276
Well, are we actually doing this?

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.077
Is there any evidence that we're actually
using our accumulated, shared knowledge
