00:04:00.755 --> 00:04:03.397
Energy, to wizards,
comes from compact nuclear plants;

00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:06.263
food from low-footprint farms
with ultraproductive,

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:09.095
genetically modified crops
tended by robots;

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.635
water from high-throughput
desalination plants,

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.785
which means we no longer
exploit rivers and aquifers.

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:17.042
Wizards envision all 10 billion of us

but walkable megacities,

00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:22.407
an urbanized world
of maximum human aspiration

00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:23.859
and maximum human liberty.

00:04:24.557 --> 00:04:28.065
Now, prophets object to every bit of this.

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:31.244
You can't dematerialize
food and water, they point out.
