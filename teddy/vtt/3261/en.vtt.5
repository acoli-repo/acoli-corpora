so they can live a normal life

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.936
and so that they can
enjoy their human rights.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.136
This is why we need to shift.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.016
We need to acknowledge
that sustainable security

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.856
builds on a foundation of human rights,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.240
builds on promoting
and respecting human rights.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.936
Also, over the past two decades,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.176

to guarantee our own security

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.056
is by defeating our enemies,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.080
and to do that, we need to rely
almost exclusively on the military.
