00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.216
We need civilian security,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.896
we need sustainable
civilian-centered security,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.456
and we need it now.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.136
We need to encourage thinking
and research around this concept,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.640
and to implement it.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.296
We live in a dangerous world.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.160
We have many threats
to peace and conflict.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.896
Much like in the days after 9/11,

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.760
we simply cannot afford
not to think about international security.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.456
But we have to learn the lessons
of the past 20 years.
