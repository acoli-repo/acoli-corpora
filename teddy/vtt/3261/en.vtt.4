00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.416
After all, the most basic human right

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.776
is the right to live
and to be free from violence,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.816
and a state's most basic responsibility

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.199
is to guarantee that right
for its citizens.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.136
Conversely, if we think
about communities all over the world

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.856
affected by war and conflict,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.216
it is insecurity and violence

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.656
that stops them from achieving
their full freedom and development.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.696
Now, they need basic security
just as much as we do

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.056
and they need it
so they can live a normal life
