It may be a tool to make sure

If civilians are killed,

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.296
if communities are targeted,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.416
this will feed a vicious circle

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.496
of war, conflict,
trauma and radicalization,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.216
and that vicious circle is at the center

We need civilian security,
