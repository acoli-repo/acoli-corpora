00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.816
this is a far more dangerous
threat to stability

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.656
than all of ISIS's weapons combined,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.816
and we should spend just as much time
and just as much energy to counter this

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.080
as what we spend
when countering ISIS militarily.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.336
Over the past two decades,
our security policy has been short-term.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.936
It has focused on the here and now.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.296
It has systematically downplayed
the link between what we do today

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.816
in the name of security

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.736
and the long-term impact of those choices.
