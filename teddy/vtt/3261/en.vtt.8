Absolutely.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.496
But rebuilding destroyed homes,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.456
restoring order,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.656
ensuring a representative

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.656

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.216
and not just for the security
of civilians in Iraq and in Syria,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.600
but for our own security
and for global stability.
