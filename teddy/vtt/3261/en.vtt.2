is to focus on protecting civilians,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.776

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.720
and in those where we are present
in the name of security.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.936
Now, this idea goes
against the fixed narrative

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.696
that we developed over the past 20 years

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.400
over what security is and how to get it,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.480
but that narrative is flawed,
and worse, it is counterproductive.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.696
Over the past 20 years,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.496
both in the United States and in Europe,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.336
we've come to accept that we must
talk about security in zero sum terms,
