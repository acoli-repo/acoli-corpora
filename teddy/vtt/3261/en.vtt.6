00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.696
Again, this clashes with my work,
with my research,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.101
with what I see in the field.

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:08.736
What I see is that building
sustainable security

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.296
has a lot less to do
with crushing enemies,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.936
has a lot less to do
with winning on the battlefield,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.536
and has a lot more to do
with protecting victims

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.960
and building stability.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.256
And to do that, well, the military alone

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.920
is simply insufficient.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.056
This is why I believe we need to shelve
the never-ending War on Terror,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.656
and we need to replace it
with a security agenda
