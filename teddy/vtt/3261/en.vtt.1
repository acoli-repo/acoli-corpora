I've worked all my life
in the field of security and defense,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.976
and I am convinced
that now, more than ever,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.416
we need to radically reframe
the way we think and act about security,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.960
and especially
about international security.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.616
By international security,
I actually mean what we do,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.976
how we prepare our countries

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.496
to better respond
and prevent external threats,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.440
and how we protect our citizens.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.456
The key to both

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.136
is to focus on protecting civilians,
