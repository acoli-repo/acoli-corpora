00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.656
and we need to replace it
with a security agenda

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.616
that is driven by the principle
of protecting civilians,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.056
no matter where they are from,
what passport they hold,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.696
or where they live:

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.096
Vancouver, New York,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.720
Kabul, Mosul, Aleppo or Douma.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.936
Sustainable security tells us
that we're more likely

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.776
to have long-term security
at home for ourselves

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.936
if we focus our engagements abroad
on protecting civilians

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.696
and on ensuring their lives are lived
in dignity and free from violence.
