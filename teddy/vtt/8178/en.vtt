Pat Mitchell: Welcome, Jane.

00:00:02.165 --> 00:00:03.624
The last time you joined us --

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.834
Jane Fonda: Hi, Pat.

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:07.086
PM: It's so good to see you, as always.

00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:09.547
The last time you joined us
on TEDWomen, Jane,

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.466
I was thinking about that this morning,

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.635
you were in the nation's
capital, Washington, DC,

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:19.015
and you were leading the weekly protests,
Fire [Drill] Fridays --

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:21.059
Fire Drill Fridays,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.145
in partnership with
the Greenpeace International.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.856
You got arrested, it made headlines.

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:31.527
and certainly, all of the civil
disobedience actions
