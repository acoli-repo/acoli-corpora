00:10:59.243 --> 00:11:02.190
We also need to go back to the ideas

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.457
that Butenandt used when he
was studying the silk moth.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:08.925
We need to go back and look systematically

00:11:08.925 --> 00:11:11.063
at all the molecules that are being produced,

00:11:11.063 --> 00:11:13.496
and work out which ones are really involved.

00:11:13.496 --> 00:11:15.602
It isn't good enough simply to pluck a couple

00:11:15.602 --> 00:11:17.546
and say, "They'll do."

00:11:17.546 --> 00:11:18.945
We have to actually demonstrate

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:21.755
that they really have the effects we claim.

00:11:21.755 --> 00:11:24.989
There is one team that I'm
actually very impressed by.

00:11:24.989 --> 00:11:28.165
They're in France, and their previous success

00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:32.542
was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone.
