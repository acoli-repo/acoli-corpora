00:05:28.992 --> 00:05:30.481
is quite different

00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:33.301
from the smell of a room of small children.

00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:36.173
What's changed? And of course, it's puberty.

00:05:36.173 --> 00:05:37.632
Along with the pubic hair

00:05:37.632 --> 00:05:39.325
and the hair in the armpits,

00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:43.067
new glands start to secrete in those places,

00:05:43.067 --> 00:05:45.682
and that's what's making the change in smell.

00:05:45.682 --> 00:05:47.830
If we were any other kind of mammal,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.019
or any other kind of animal,

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:50.156
we would say,

00:05:50.156 --> 00:05:52.028
"That must be something to do with pheromones,"

00:05:52.028 --> 00:05:54.684
and we'd start looking properly.

00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:56.660
But there are some problems, and this is why,

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.729
I think, people have not looked for

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.646
pheromones so effectively in humans.
