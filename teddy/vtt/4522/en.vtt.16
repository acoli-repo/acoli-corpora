00:07:55.845 --> 00:08:00.104
and if they bond, they send the nerve a signal

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:02.412
which goes back into the brain.

00:08:02.412 --> 00:08:04.474
We don't just have one kind of receptor.

00:08:04.474 --> 00:08:06.350
If you're a human, you have about 400

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.415
different kinds of receptors,

00:08:08.415 --> 00:08:11.382
and the brain knows what you're smelling

00:08:11.382 --> 00:08:13.193
because of the combination of receptors

00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:15.706
and nerve cells that they trigger,

00:08:15.706 --> 00:08:17.264
sending messages up to the brain

00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:20.170
in a combinatorial fashion.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.160
But it's a bit more complicated,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.295
because each of those 400

00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:25.446
comes in various variants,

00:08:25.446 --> 00:08:27.517
and depending which variant you have,

00:08:27.517 --> 00:08:31.699
you might smell coriander, or cilantro, that herb,
