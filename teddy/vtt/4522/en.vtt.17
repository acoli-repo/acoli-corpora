00:08:27.517 --> 00:08:31.699
you might smell coriander, or cilantro, that herb,

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:34.317
either as something delicious and savory

00:08:34.317 --> 00:08:36.491
or something like soap.

00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:39.177
So we each have an individual world of smell,

00:08:39.177 --> 00:08:40.818
and that complicates anything

00:08:40.818 --> 00:08:43.114
when we're studying smell.

00:08:43.114 --> 00:08:45.806
Well, we really ought to talk about armpits,

00:08:45.806 --> 00:08:49.202
and I have to say that I do
have particularly good ones.

00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:51.204
Now, I'm not going to share them with you,

00:08:51.204 --> 00:08:53.183
but this is the place that most people

00:08:53.183 --> 00:08:54.920
have looked for pheromones.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.423
There is one good reason,

00:08:56.423 --> 00:08:59.827
which is, the great apes have armpits

00:08:59.827 --> 00:09:02.155
as their unique characteristic.
