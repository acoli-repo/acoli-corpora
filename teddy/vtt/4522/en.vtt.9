00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.765
That's the thing which has
never been done with humans:

00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:34.375
nothing systematic, no real demonstration.

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:36.109
With that new concept,

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.818
we needed a new word,

00:04:37.818 --> 00:04:40.653
and that was the word "pheromone,"

00:04:40.653 --> 00:04:44.254
and it's basically transferred excitement,

00:04:44.254 --> 00:04:46.523
transferred between individuals,

00:04:46.523 --> 00:04:49.349
and since 1959, pheromones have been found

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.224
right the way across the animal kingdom,

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:53.426
in male animals, in female animals.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:54.971
It works just as well underwater

00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:56.993
for goldfish and lobsters.

00:04:56.993 --> 00:04:58.740
And almost every mammal you can think of

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.563
has had a pheromone identified,
