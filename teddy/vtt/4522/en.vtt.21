00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:30.693
So what should we be doing

00:10:30.693 --> 00:10:33.746
in our search for human pheromones?

00:10:33.746 --> 00:10:36.198
I'm fairly convinced that we do have them.

00:10:36.198 --> 00:10:38.151
We're mammals, like everybody else

00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:42.130
who's a mammal, and we probably do have them.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.713
But what I think we should do

00:10:43.713 --> 00:10:45.652
is go right back to the beginning,

00:10:45.652 --> 00:10:47.991
and basically look all over the body.

00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:49.682
No matter how embarrassing,

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:53.060
we need to search and go for the first time

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.520
where no one else has dared tread.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.668
It's going to be difficult,

00:10:56.668 --> 00:10:59.243
it's going to be embarrassing, but we need to look.

00:10:59.243 --> 00:11:02.190
We also need to go back to the ideas
