00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.563
has had a pheromone identified,

00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:04.393
and of course, an enormous number of insects.

00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:06.362
So we know that pheromones exist

00:05:06.362 --> 00:05:09.423
right the way across the animal kingdom.

00:05:09.423 --> 00:05:11.196
What about humans?

00:05:11.196 --> 00:05:12.444
Well, the first thing, of course,

00:05:12.444 --> 00:05:14.101
is that we're mammals,

00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:15.660
and mammals are smelly.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.536
As any dog owner can tell you,

00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:19.517
we smell, they smell.

00:05:19.517 --> 00:05:21.498
But the real reason we might think

00:05:21.498 --> 00:05:23.323
that humans have pheromones

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.541
is the change that occurs as we grow up.

00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:28.992
The smell of a room of teenagers

00:05:28.992 --> 00:05:30.481
is quite different
