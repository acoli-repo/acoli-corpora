00:12:59.742 --> 00:13:01.521
It's not about individual recognition.

00:13:01.521 --> 00:13:03.397
Any mother will do.

00:13:03.397 --> 00:13:04.860
Now, why is this important,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.318
apart from being simply very interesting?

00:13:07.318 --> 00:13:09.125
It's because women vary

00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:11.898
in the number of areolar glands that they have,

00:13:11.898 --> 00:13:14.094
and there is a correlation between the ease

00:13:14.094 --> 00:13:16.636
with which babies start to suckle

00:13:16.636 --> 00:13:18.498
and the number of areolar glands she has.

00:13:18.498 --> 00:13:21.296
It appears that the more secretions she's got,

00:13:21.296 --> 00:13:24.958
the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly.

00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.418
If you're a mammal,

00:13:26.418 --> 00:13:28.961
the most dangerous time in life

00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:31.270
is the first few hours after birth.
