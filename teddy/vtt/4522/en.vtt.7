00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.245
is that each of these animals

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:31.851
produces tiny quantities,

00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:33.510
and in the case of the dog,

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.412
males dogs can smell it, but we can't smell it.

00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:40.770
And it was only in 1959 that a German team,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.122
after spending 20 years in
search of these molecules,

00:03:44.122 --> 00:03:47.903
discovered, identified, the first pheromone,

00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:51.181
and this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth.

00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:54.855
Now, this was an inspired choice 
by Adolf Butenandt and his team,

00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:56.981
because he needed half a million moths

00:03:56.981 --> 00:04:00.008
to get enough material to do the chemical analysis.
