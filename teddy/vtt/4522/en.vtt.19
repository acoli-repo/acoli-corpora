00:09:28.418 --> 00:09:30.439
that we know and love.

00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:32.339
And so incidentally, if you want to reduce

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:33.769
the amount of smell,

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:35.689
clear-cutting your armpits

00:09:35.689 --> 00:09:37.945
is a very effective way of reducing

00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:39.459
the habitat for bacteria,

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:41.796
and you'll find they remain less smelly

00:09:41.796 --> 00:09:43.890
for much longer.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.436
But although we've focused on armpits,

00:09:46.436 --> 00:09:47.803
I think it's partly because they're the least

00:09:47.803 --> 00:09:51.770
embarrassing place to go and ask people for samples.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.382
There is actually another reason why we might not

00:09:54.382 --> 00:09:57.158
be looking for a universal sex pheromone there,

00:09:57.158 --> 00:10:00.997
and that's because 20 percent
