00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:31.865
for 10 dollars or more.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.088
Now, this is a very attractive idea,

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:36.530
and the molecules they mention

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.444
sound really science-y.

00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:40.028
They've got lots of syllables.

00:00:40.028 --> 00:00:42.901
It's things like androstenol, androstenone

00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:45.342
or androstadienone.

00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:46.984
It gets better and better,

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:49.774
and when you combine that with white lab coats,

00:00:49.774 --> 00:00:51.186
you must imagine that there is

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:53.700
fantastic science behind this.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.822
But sadly, these are fraudulent claims

00:00:58.822 --> 00:01:02.161
supported by dodgy science.
