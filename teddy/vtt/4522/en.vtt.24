00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.978
and these are the little bumps around the nipple,

00:12:01.978 --> 00:12:03.937
and if you're a lactating woman,

00:12:03.937 --> 00:12:06.274
these start to secrete.

00:12:06.274 --> 00:12:08.863
It's a very interesting secretion.

00:12:08.863 --> 00:12:11.866
What Benoist Schaal and his team developed

00:12:11.866 --> 00:12:14.273
was a simple test to investigate

00:12:14.273 --> 00:12:17.079
what the effect of this secretion might be,

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:20.055
in effect, a simple bioassay.

00:12:20.055 --> 00:12:22.730
So this is a sleeping baby,

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:27.719
and under its nose, we've put a clean glass rod.

00:12:27.719 --> 00:12:29.830
The baby remains sleeping,

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.171
showing no interest at all.
