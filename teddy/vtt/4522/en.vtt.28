00:13:58.261 --> 00:14:01.189
and every baby would have a better chance

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:02.510
of survival.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.050
So what I want to argue is this is one example

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.646
of where a systematic, really scientific approach

00:14:08.646 --> 00:14:11.368
can actually bring you a real understanding

00:14:11.368 --> 00:14:12.476
of pheromones.

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:15.090
There could be all sorts of medical interventions.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.344
There could be all sorts of things

00:14:16.344 --> 00:14:18.044
that humans are doing with pheromones

00:14:18.044 --> 00:14:20.092
that we simply don't know at the moment.

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:21.978
What we need to remember is pheromones

00:14:21.978 --> 00:14:23.356
are not just about sex.

00:14:23.356 --> 00:14:25.072
They're about all sorts of things to do

00:14:25.072 --> 00:14:26.795
with a mammal's life.

00:14:26.795 --> 00:14:29.484
So do go forward and do search for more.

00:14:29.484 --> 00:14:30.524
There's lots to find.
