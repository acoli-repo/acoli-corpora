00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:30.890
and there are thousands of
molecules that we give off.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.000
We're mammals. We produce a lot of smell.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.144
Nobody has gone through systematically

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:38.911
to work out which molecules really are pheromones.

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:40.541
They've just plucked a few,

00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:42.430
and all these experiments are based on those,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.440
but there's no good evidence at all.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.618
Now, that's not to say

00:01:47.618 --> 00:01:49.780
that smell is not important to people.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.282
It is, and some people are real enthusiasts,

00:01:53.282 --> 00:01:56.779
and one of these was Napoleon.

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:58.571
And famously, you may remember

00:01:58.571 --> 00:02:01.668
that out on the campaign trail for war,
