00:08:59.827 --> 00:09:02.155
as their unique characteristic.

00:09:02.155 --> 00:09:04.556
The other primates have scent glands

00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:06.386
in other parts of the body.

00:09:06.386 --> 00:09:08.740
The great apes have these armpits

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.957
full of secretory glands

00:09:10.957 --> 00:09:13.298
producing smells all the time,

00:09:13.298 --> 00:09:16.998
enormous numbers of molecules.

00:09:16.998 --> 00:09:18.701
When they're secreted from the glands,

00:09:18.701 --> 00:09:20.705
the molecules are odorless.

00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:22.780
They have no smell at all,

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.749
and it's only the wonderful bacteria

00:09:24.749 --> 00:09:26.962
growing on the rainforest of hair

00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:28.418
that actually produces the smells

00:09:28.418 --> 00:09:30.439
that we know and love.
