00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:30.359
of the senses to crack,

00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:32.074
and the Nobel Prize awarded to

00:07:32.074 --> 00:07:33.707
Richard Axel and Linda Buck

00:07:33.707 --> 00:07:36.140
was only awarded in 2004

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.930
for their discovery of how smell works.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.307
It's really hard,

00:07:40.307 --> 00:07:42.898
but in essence, nerves from the brain

00:07:42.898 --> 00:07:45.111
go up into the nose

00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:47.492
and on these nerves exposed in the nose

00:07:47.492 --> 00:07:50.546
to the outside air are receptors,

00:07:50.546 --> 00:07:53.695
and odor molecules coming in on a sniff

00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:55.845
interact with these receptors,

00:07:55.845 --> 00:08:00.104
and if they bond, they send the nerve a signal
