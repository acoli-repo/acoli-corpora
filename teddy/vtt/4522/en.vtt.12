00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.646
pheromones so effectively in humans.

00:06:02.646 --> 00:06:04.217
There are, indeed, problems.

00:06:04.217 --> 00:06:06.401
And the first of these

00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:07.918
is perhaps surprising.

00:06:07.918 --> 00:06:09.752
It's all about culture.

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:11.899
Now moths don't learn a lot

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:15.516
about what is good to smell, but humans do,

00:06:15.516 --> 00:06:17.362
and up to the age of about four,

00:06:17.362 --> 00:06:20.081
any smell, no matter how rancid,

00:06:20.081 --> 00:06:21.880
is simply interesting.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.932
And I understand that the major role of parents

00:06:23.932 --> 00:06:27.613
is to stop kids putting their fingers in poo,

00:06:27.613 --> 00:06:30.411
because it's always something nice to smell.
