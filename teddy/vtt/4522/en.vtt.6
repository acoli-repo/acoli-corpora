00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.171
So the ancient Greeks knew

00:03:03.171 --> 00:03:07.225
that dogs sent invisible signals between each other.

00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:09.599
A female dog in heat

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.515
sent an invisible signal to male dogs

00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:12.970
for miles around,

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.075
and it wasn't a sound, it was a smell.

00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:17.256
You could take the smell from the female dog,

00:03:17.256 --> 00:03:19.719
and the dogs would chase the cloth.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.327
But the problem for everybody

00:03:21.327 --> 00:03:23.440
who could see this effect

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.062
was that you couldn't identify the molecules.

00:03:25.062 --> 00:03:27.515
You couldn't demonstrate it was chemical.

00:03:27.515 --> 00:03:28.830
The reason for that, of course,

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.245
is that each of these animals
