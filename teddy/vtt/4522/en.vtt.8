00:03:56.981 --> 00:04:00.008
to get enough material to do the chemical analysis.

00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:02.097
But he created the model

00:04:02.097 --> 00:04:04.461
for how you should go about pheromone analysis.

00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:07.142
He basically went through systematically,

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:10.087
showing that only the molecule in question

00:04:10.087 --> 00:04:11.953
was the one that stimulated the males,

00:04:11.953 --> 00:04:14.006
not all the others.

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:16.164
He analyzed it very carefully.

00:04:16.164 --> 00:04:17.981
He synthesized the molecule,

00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:21.289
and then tried the synthesized
molecule on the males

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.150
and got them to respond and showed it was,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.910
indeed, that molecule.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.060
That's closing the circle.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.765
That's the thing which has
never been done with humans:
