00:00:58.822 --> 00:01:02.161
supported by dodgy science.

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.779
The problem is that, although there are many

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:07.324
good scientists working on what they think

00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:09.194
are human pheromones,

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.799
and they're publishing in respectable journals,

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.380
at the basis of this,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.716
despite very sophisticated experiments,

00:01:16.716 --> 00:01:19.269
there really is no good science behind it,

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:22.561
because it's based on a problem,

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:26.011
which is nobody has systematically gone through

00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:28.112
all the odors that humans produce --

00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:30.890
and there are thousands of
molecules that we give off.
