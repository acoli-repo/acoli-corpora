00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.496
building things like inventory systems,
payroll systems and bill-paying systems.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.016
But I had worked
on interactive word processing

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.136
and on-demand personal computation.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.440
Instead of thinking
about paper printouts and punch cards,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.656
I imagined a magic blackboard

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.056
that if you erased one number
and wrote a new thing in,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.936
all of the other numbers
would automatically change,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.720
like word processing with numbers.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.840
I imagined that my calculator
had mouse hardware on the bottom of it

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.200
and a head-up display,
like in a fighter plane.
