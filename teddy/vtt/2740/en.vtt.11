00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.200
and a head-up display,
like in a fighter plane.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.856
And I could type some numbers in,
and circle it, and press the sum button.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.616
And right in the middle of a negotiation
I'd be able to get the answer.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.640
Now I just had to take my fantasy
and turn it into reality.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.080
My father taught me about prototyping.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.176
He showed me mock-ups

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.536
that he'd make to figure out
the placement on the page

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.096
for the things for brochures
that he was printing.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.056
And he'd use it
to get feedback from customers

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.680
and OKs before he sent the job
off to the presses.
