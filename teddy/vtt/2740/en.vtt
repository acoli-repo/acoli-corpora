How many of you have used
an electronic spreadsheet,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.240
like Microsoft Excel?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.496
Very good.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.096
Now, how many of you have run a business
with a spreadsheet by hand,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.200
like my dad did for his small
printing business in Philadelphia?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.320
A lot less.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.520
Well, that's the way it was done
for hundreds of years.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.496
In early 1978,
I started working on an idea

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.920
that eventually became VisiCalc.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.136
And the next year it shipped

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.439
running on something new
called an Apple II personal computer.
