00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.256
There's a picture of me from the yearbook
sitting in the front row.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.296
(Laughter)

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.936
Now, at Harvard,
we learned by the case method.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.896
We'd do about three cases a day.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.640
Cases consist of up to a few dozen pages
describing particular business situations.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.176
They often have exhibits,
and exhibits often have words and numbers

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.360
laid out in ways that make sense
for the particular situation.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.776
They're usually all somewhat different.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.016
Here's my homework.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.216
Again, numbers, words,
laid out in ways that made sense.
