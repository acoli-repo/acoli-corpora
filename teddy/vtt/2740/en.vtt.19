The professor said, "How did you do it?"

00:09:33.469 --> 00:09:36.136
Well, I didn't want to tell him

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.680
(Laughter)

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.056
So I said, "I took this and added this

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.176

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.056
(Laughter)

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.936

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.800
to be able to show it to the public.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.416
My dad printed up a sample reference card
