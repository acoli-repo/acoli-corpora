00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.216
Again, numbers, words,
laid out in ways that made sense.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.320
Lots of calculations --
we got really close to our calculators.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.600
In fact, here's my calculator.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.976
For Halloween, I went
dressed up as a calculator.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.440
(Laughter)

00:04:13.785 --> 00:04:16.976
At the beginning of each class,
the professor would call on somebody

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.279
to present the case.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.856
What they would do is
they would explain what was going on

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.616
and then dictate information
that the professor would transcribe

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.545
onto the many motorized blackboards
in the front of the class,

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.096
and then we'd have a discussion.
