00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.056
But through luck
and an awful lot of perseverance,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.320
I was able to get
computer time around the city.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.080
After sleeping in the mud at Woodstock,
I went off to MIT to go to college,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.600
where to make money,
I worked on the Multics Project.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.336
Multics was a trailblazing
interactive time-sharing system.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.536
Have you heard of the Linux
and Unix operating systems?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.800
They came from Multics.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.616
I worked on the Multics versions

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.456
of what are known
as interpreted computer languages,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.936
that are used by people
in noncomputer fields
