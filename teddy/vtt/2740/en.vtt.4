00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.936
that are used by people
in noncomputer fields

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.960
to do their calculations
while seated at a computer terminal.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.816
After I graduated from MIT,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.680
I went to work for
Digital Equipment Corporation.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.496
At DEC, I worked on software

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.360
for the new area
of computerized typesetting.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.136
I helped newspapers
replace their reporters' typewriters

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.360
with computer terminals.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.096
I'd write software

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.816
and then I'd go out in the field
to places like the Kansas City Star,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.256
where I would train users
and get feedback.
