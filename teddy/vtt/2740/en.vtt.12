The act of making a simple, working
version of what you're trying to build

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.880
forces you to uncover key problems.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.120
And it lets you find solutions
to those problems much less expensively.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.960
So I decided to build a prototype.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.336
I went to a video terminal connected to
Harvard's time-sharing system

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.856
and got to work.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.136
One of the first problems
that I ran into was:

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.840
How do you represent values in formulas?

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.640
Let me show you what I mean.
