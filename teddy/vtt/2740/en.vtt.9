00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.096
and then we'd have a discussion.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.576
One of the really frustrating things
is when you've done all your homework,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.616
you come in the next day
only to find out that you made an error

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.176
and all of the other numbers
you did were wrong.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.976
And you couldn't participate as well.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.240
And we were marked by class participation.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.240
So, sitting there with 87 other people
in the class, I got to daydream a lot.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.136
Most programmers in those days
worked on mainframes,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.496
building things like inventory systems,
payroll systems and bill-paying systems.
