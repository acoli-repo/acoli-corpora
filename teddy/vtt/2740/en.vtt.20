My dad printed up a sample reference card

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.440
that we could use as marketing material.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:10.056
In June of 1979, our publisher
announced VisiCalc to the world,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.200
in a small booth at the giant National
Computer Conference in New York City.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.960
The New York Times had
a humorous article about the conference.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.936
"The machines perform
what seem religious rites ...

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.341
Even as the believers gather,

00:10:23.365 --> 00:10:26.461
the painters in the Coliseum sign room
are adding to the pantheon,

00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:29.656
carefully lettering 'VISICALC'
in giant black on yellow.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.496
All hail VISICALC!"
