The first thing I thought was
the programmer way of doing it.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.665
The first time you pointed to somewhere,

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:05.369
the computer would ask you
to type in a unique name.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.536
It became pretty clear pretty fast that
that was going to be too tedious.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.800
The computer had to automatically
make up the name and put it inside.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.960
So I thought, why not make it be
the order in which you create them?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.976
I tried that. Value 1, value 2.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.762
Pretty quickly I saw
that if you had more than a few values

00:07:24.786 --> 00:07:27.296
you'd never remember
on the screen where things were.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.616
Then I said, why not instead of
allowing you to put values anywhere,
