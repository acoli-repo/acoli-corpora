00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.176
over a phone line
using an acoustic coupler,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.360
and then we would test.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.640
For one of these tests I prepared
for this case about the Pepsi Challenge.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.640
Print wasn't working yet,
so I had to copy everything down.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.896
Save wasn't working,
so every time it crashed,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.920
I had to type in all of the formulas
again, over and over again.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.216
The next day in class, I raised my hand;
I got called on, and I presented the case.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.816
I did five-year projections.
I did all sorts of different scenarios.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.520
I aced the case.
VisiCalc was already useful.
