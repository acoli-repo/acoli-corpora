Restricting you to a grid
helped solve my problem.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.800
It also opened up new capabilities,
like the ability to have ranges of cells.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.936
But it wasn't too restrictive --

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.280
you could still put any value,
any formula, in any cell.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.960
And that's the way we do it to this day,
almost 40 years later.

00:08:19.109 --> 00:08:22.776
My friend Bob and I decided that we were
going to build this product together.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.216
I did more work figuring out exactly
how the program was supposed to behave.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.496
I wrote a reference card
to act as documentation.
