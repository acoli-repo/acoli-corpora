Let me show you what I mean.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.176
I thought that you would point somewhere,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.296
type in some words,
then type in some somewhere else,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.844
put in some numbers and some more numbers,
point where you want the answer.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.456
And then point to the first, press minus,
point to the second,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.680
and get the result.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.776
The problem was:
What should I put in the formula?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.420
It had to be something
the computer knew what to put in.

00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:54.136
And if you looked at the formula,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
you needed to know
where on the screen it referred to.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.736
The first thing I thought was
the programmer way of doing it.
