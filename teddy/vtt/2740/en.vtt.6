00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.336
After I was at DEC, I went
to work for a small company

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.480
that made microprocessor-based electronic
cash registers for the fast-food industry.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.056
But I had always wanted to start
a company with my friend Bob Frankston

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.456
that I met on the Multics project at MIT.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.176
So I decided to go back to school to learn
as much as I could about business.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.976
And in the fall of 1977,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I entered the MBA program
at Harvard Business School.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.336
I was one of the few
percentage of students

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.200
who had a background
in computer programming.
