00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.616
Then I said, why not instead of
allowing you to put values anywhere,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.240
I'll restrict you to a grid?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.936
Then when you pointed to a cell,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.680
the computer could put
the row and column in as a name.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.816
And, if I did it like a map and put ABC
across the top and numbers along the side,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.736
if you saw B7 in a formula,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.960
you'd know exactly
where it was on the screen.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.880
And if you had to type the formula
in yourself, you'd know what to do.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.520
Restricting you to a grid
helped solve my problem.
