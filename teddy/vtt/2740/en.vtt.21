00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.496
All hail VISICALC!"

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.096
(Gasp) New York Times:
"All hail VISICALC."

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.616
(Laughter)

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.896
That was the last mention
of the electronic spreadsheet

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.816
in the popular business press
for about two years.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.976
Most people didn't get it yet.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.200
But some did.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.120
In October of 1979, we shipped VisiCalc.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.696
It came in packaging
that looked like this.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.200
And it looked like this
running on the Apple II.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.960
And the rest, as they say, is history.
