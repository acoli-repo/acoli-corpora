00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:02.360
I would like to talk to you about

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.992
a very special group of animals.

00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:08.993
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:13.601
Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds.

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:16.613
When you see a vulture like this, the first thing

00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:20.589
that comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly,

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.548
greedy creatures that are just after your flesh,

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:30.875
associated with politicians. (Laughter) (Applause)
