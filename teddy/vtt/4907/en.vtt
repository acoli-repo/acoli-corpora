Imagine you and a friend are 
strolling through an art exhibit

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:18.655
and a striking painting catches your eye.

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:22.085
The vibrant red appears to you 
as a symbol of love,

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:25.445
but your friend is convinced 
it's a symbol of war.

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:28.955
And where you see stars in a romantic sky,

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:33.787
your friend interprets global 
warming-inducing pollutants.
