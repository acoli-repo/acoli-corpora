Carroll said to imagine someone holding
a cigarette and asking for a match.

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:33.201
You respond by handing them a lighter,

00:03:33.201 --> 00:03:36.251
gathering that their motivation is to 
light their cigarette.

00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:39.102
The words they used to ask the question 
are important,

00:03:39.102 --> 00:03:43.472
but the intentions behind the question 
dictate your understanding and ultimately,

00:03:43.472 --> 00:03:45.492
your response.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:48.518
So which end of this spectrum 
do you lean towards?

00:03:48.518 --> 00:03:52.258
Do you, like Wimsatt and Beardsley, 
believe that when it comes to art,

00:03:52.258 --> 00:03:53.998
the proof should be in the pudding?

00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:57.688
Or do you think that an artist's plans 
and motivations for their work

00:03:57.688 --> 00:03:59.348
affect its meaning?

00:03:59.348 --> 00:04:02.108
Artistic interpretation is a complex web
