00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.269
Their argument was twofold:

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:33.549
First, the artists we study are 
no longer living,

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.449
never recorded their intentions,

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:39.599
or are simply unavailable to answer 
questions about their work.

00:01:39.607 --> 00:01:44.157
Second, even if there were a bounty 
of relevant information,

00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:45.597
Wimsatt and Beardsley believed

00:01:45.597 --> 00:01:49.087
it would distract us from the 
qualities of the work itself.

00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:51.227
They compared art to a dessert:

00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:52.767
When you taste a pudding,

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:57.337
the chef's intentions don't affect whether
you enjoy its flavor or texture.

00:01:57.337 --> 00:02:01.597
All that matters, they said, 
is that the pudding "works."
