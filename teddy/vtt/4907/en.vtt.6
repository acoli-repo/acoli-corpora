They believed an intentional creator

00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:04.591
is what makes the poem subject to 
understanding at all.

00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:06.928
Other thinkers advocate for 
a middle ground,

00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:11.818
suggesting that intention is just one 
piece in a larger puzzle.

00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:15.258
Contemporary philosopher Noel Carroll 
took this stance,

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:18.928
arguing that an artist's intentions are 
relevant to their audience

00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:20.658
the same way a speaker's intentions

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:24.158
are relevant to the person they’re 
engaging in conversation.

00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:27.098
To understand how intentions function 
in conversation,

00:03:27.098 --> 00:03:31.208
Carroll said to imagine someone holding
a cigarette and asking for a match.
