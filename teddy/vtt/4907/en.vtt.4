All that matters, they said, 
is that the pudding "works."

00:02:01.597 --> 00:02:05.677
Of course, what "works" for one person 
might not "work" for another.

00:02:05.677 --> 00:02:09.018
And since different interpretations 
appeal to different people,

00:02:09.018 --> 00:02:13.268
the silver dots in our painting could be 
reasonably interpreted as fairies,

00:02:13.268 --> 00:02:15.510
stars, or pollutants.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.660
By Wimsatt and Beardsley's logic, the
artist's interpretation of her own work

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.550
would just be one among many equally
acceptable possibilities.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.202
If you find this problematic,

00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:30.292
you might be more in line with Steven 
Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels,
