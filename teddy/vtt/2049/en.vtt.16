00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby, this is what happens.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
The number of species increases 21 percent;

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
so if you have 1,000 species

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
This is very substantial.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
The size of organisms increases a third,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
so your fish are now this big.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
The abundance, how many fish you have per square meter,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
increases almost 170 percent.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And the biomass -- this is the most spectacular change --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
4.5 times greater biomass

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
on average, just after five to seven years.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
In some places up to 10 times

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
larger biomass inside the reserves.
