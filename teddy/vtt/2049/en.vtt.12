The more intact, the more complete,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
[and] the more complex your food web,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
the higher the resilience, [and] the more likely

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that the system is going to recover

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
from the short-term impacts of warming events.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And that's good news, so we need to recover that structure.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
so the ecosystem can adapt

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
to the effects of global warming.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So if we have to reset the baseline,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
how can we do it?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Well, there are several ways.
