00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Here we have the extreme with dead corals,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
microbial soup and jellyfish.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And where the diver is,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
with very few corals, algae overgrowing the corals,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
lots of bacteria,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and where the large animals are gone.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And this is what most marine scientists have seen too.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is their baseline. This is what they think is natural

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
because we started modern science

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
with scuba diving long after

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we started degrading marine ecosystems.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So I'm going to get us all on a time machine,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and we're going to the left; we're going to go back to the past
