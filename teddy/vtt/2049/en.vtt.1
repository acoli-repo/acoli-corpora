00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, if an alien came to earth --

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
let's call him Joe --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
what would Joe see?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If Joe jumped in a coral reef,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
there are many things the alien could see.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Very unlikely, Joe would jump

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
on a pristine coral reef,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
a virgin coral reef with lots of coral, sharks, crocodiles,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
manatees, groupers,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
turtles, etc.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So, probably, what Joe would see

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
would be in this part, in the greenish part of the picture.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Here we have the extreme with dead corals,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
microbial soup and jellyfish.
