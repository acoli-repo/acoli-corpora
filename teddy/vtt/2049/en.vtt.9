00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
they eat, and they keep the reef clean

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and allow the corals to replenish.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Not only do these places --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
these ancient, pristine places -- have lots of fish,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
but they also have other important components

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
of the ecosystem like the giant clams;

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
pavements of giant clams in the lagoons,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
up to 20, 25 per square meter.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and they filter the water;

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
they keep the water clean from

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
microbes and pathogens.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
But still, now we have global warming.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
If we don't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
or their remoteness, this is great.
