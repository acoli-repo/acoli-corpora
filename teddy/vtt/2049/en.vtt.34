00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
they reproduce very fast; they grow really fast; they produce millions of eggs.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Up there, you have sharks and large fish that live 25, 30 years.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
They reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism;

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
and, basically, they just maintain their biomass.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So, basically, the production surplus of these guys down there

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
is enough to maintain this biomass

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
that is not moving.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
They are like capacitors of the system.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
CA: That's very fascinating.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
So, really, our picture of a food pyramid

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
is just -- we have to change that completely.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
ES: At least in the seas.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
is the equivalent of the Serengeti,
