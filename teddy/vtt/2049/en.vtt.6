00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
then we get to the places where the corals

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
are absolutely healthy and gorgeous,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
forming spectacular structures,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and where the predators

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
are the most conspicuous thing,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
What have we learned from these places?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This is what we thought was natural.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
This is what we call the biomass pyramid.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
this is what we would expect.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Most of the biomass is low on the food chain, the herbivores,
