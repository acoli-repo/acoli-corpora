00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
was upside down;

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
this pyramid was inverted.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The top head does account for most of the biomass,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
in some places up to 85 percent,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
like Kingman Reef, which is now protected.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
The good news is that, in addition to having more predators,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
there's more of everything.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
The size of these boxes is bigger.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We have more sharks, more biomass of snappers,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
more biomass of herbivores, too,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
like these parrot fish that are like marine goats.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They clean the reef; everything that grows enough to be seen,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
they eat, and they keep the reef clean

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and allow the corals to replenish.
