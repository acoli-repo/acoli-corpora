00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
most of the corals are dead -- overgrown by algae --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and most of the fish are smaller than

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the pencils we use to count them.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We did 250 hours of diving here

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in 2005.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We didn't see a single shark.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and he described a huge abundance of sharks

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
while they were going ashore.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Let's move the dial a little bit to the past.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Fanning Island, 2,500 people.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This is what many divers would consider paradise.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is where you can see most
