00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
to subsidize fishing:

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
35 billion dollars per year.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Well, there are a couple estimates

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
of how much it would cost to create

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
a network of protected areas

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
covering 20 percent of the ocean

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
that would be only a fraction

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
of what we are now paying;

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
the government hands out to a fishery

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
that is collapsing.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
A creation of a network of reserves

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
would provide direct employment for more than a million people
