00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
In Fanning Island, the corals are not recovered.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But you see here

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a big table coral that died and collapsed.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And the fish have grazed the algae,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
so the turf of algae is a little lower.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Then you go to Palmyra Atoll

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that has more biomass of herbivores,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and the dead corals are clean,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and the corals are coming back.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And when you go to the pristine side,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
did this ever bleach?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
These places bleached too, but they recovered faster.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
The more intact, the more complete,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
[and] the more complex your food web,
