00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
the fishermen were catching more.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
If you fish less, you're actually catching more.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the fishermen are still making more money

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
by fishing less around an area that is protected.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Another example:

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
This is grouper sex,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and the groupers aggregate around the full moons

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
of December and January for a week.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
They used to aggregate up to the

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
tens of thousands, 30,000 groupers about this big

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in one hectare, in one aggregation.
