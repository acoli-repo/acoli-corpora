00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in one hectare, in one aggregation.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Fishermen knew about these things; they caught them, and they depleted them.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
When I went there for the first time in 2000,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
there were only 3,000 groupers left.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
of the entire spawning population every year.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So we did a simple analysis,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and it doesn't take rocket science

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
to figure out that, if you take 30 percent every year,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
your fishery is going to collapse very quickly.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And with the fishery, the entire reproductive ability

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
of the species goes extinct.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It happened in many places around the Caribbean.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And they would make 4,000 dollars per year,
