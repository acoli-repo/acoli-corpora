00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
or their remoteness, this is great.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But the water gets warmer for too long

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and the corals die.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So how are these fish,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
these predators going to help?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Well, what we have seen is that

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
in this particular area

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
during El Nino, year '97, '98,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the water was too warm for too long,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and many corals bleached

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and many died.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
In Christmas, where the food web is really trimmed down,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
where the large animals are gone,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
the corals have not recovered.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
In Fanning Island, the corals are not recovered.
