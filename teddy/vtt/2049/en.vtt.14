00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
But, little did I know,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And this is what I saw, lots of fish.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
After a few years, between five and seven years,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
fish come back, they eat the urchins,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and then the algae grow again.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So you have this little algal forest,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and in the size of a laptop

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
you can find more than 100 species of algae,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
mostly microscopic fit

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
hundreds of species of little animals

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that then feed the fish,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
so that the system recovers.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And this particular place, the Medes Islands Marine Reserve,
