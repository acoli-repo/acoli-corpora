00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Well, there are several ways.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
One very clear way is the marine protected areas,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
especially no-take reserves

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that we set aside

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to allow for the recovery for marine life.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And let me go back to that image

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
of the Mediterranean.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And at the same time I was watching

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Jacques Cousteau's shows on TV,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
with all this richness and abundance and diversity.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And I thought that this richness

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
belonged to tropical seas,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
But, little did I know,
