00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This is what many divers would consider paradise.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is where you can see most

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And many people think this is really, really beautiful,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
if this is your baseline.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
If we go back to a place

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
like Palmyra Atoll,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the corals are doing better and there are sharks.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You can see sharks in every single dive.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But then, if we shift the dial

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
200, 500 years back,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
then we get to the places where the corals
