00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So there is spill over;

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that help people around them,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
while at the same time

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
the reserve is protecting

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
the entire habitat. It is building resilience.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So what we have now --

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
or a world without reserves --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
is like a debit account

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
where we withdraw all the time

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and we never make any deposit.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Reserves are like savings accounts.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
We have this principal that we don't touch;

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that produces returns,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
social, economic and ecological.
