00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and we're going to the left; we're going to go back to the past

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to see what the ocean was like.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And let's start with this time machine, the Line Islands,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
where we have conducted a series

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
of National Geographic expeditions.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that spans across the equator

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and it has several uninhabited,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
unfished, pristine islands

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and a few inhabited islands.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So let's start with the first one: Christmas Island, over 5,000 people.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Most of the reefs are dead,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
most of the corals are dead -- overgrown by algae --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and most of the fish are smaller than
