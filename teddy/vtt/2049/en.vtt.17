00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
larger biomass inside the reserves.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So we have all these things

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
inside the reserve that grow, and what do they do?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
They reproduce. That's population biology 101.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
If you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
they grow larger and they reproduce a lot.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And same thing for invertebrates. This is the example.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
These are egg cases

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
laid by a snail off the coast of Chile,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Outside the reserve,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
you cannot even detect this.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
One point three million eggs per square meter
