00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Most of the biomass is low on the food chain, the herbivores,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the parrotfish, the surgeonfish that eat the algae.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Then the plankton feeders, these little damselfish,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the little animals floating in the water.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and a lower biomass of top head,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
or the sharks, the large snappers, the large groupers.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But this is a consequence.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
This view of the world is a consequence

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
of having studied degraded reefs.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
When we went to pristine reefs,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
we realized that the natural world

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
was upside down;

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
this pyramid was inverted.
