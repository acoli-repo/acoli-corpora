00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It happened in many places around the Caribbean.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And they would make 4,000 dollars per year,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
total, for the entire fishery,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
several fishing boats.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Now, if you do an economic analysis

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and project what would happen

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
if the fish were not cut,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
if we brought just 20 divers

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
one month per year,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
the revenue would be more than 20 times higher

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and that would be sustainable over time.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So how much of this do we have?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
If this is so good, if this is such a no-brainer, how much of this do we have?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And you already heard that

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
less than one percent of the ocean's protected.
