00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
so that the system recovers.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And this particular place, the Medes Islands Marine Reserve,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
is only 94 hectares,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
20 times more than fishing,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and it represents 88 percent

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
of all the tourist revenue.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So these places not only help the ecosystem

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
but also help the people

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
who can benefit from the ecosystem.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So let me just give you a summary

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
of what no-take reserves do.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
These places, when we protect them,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby, this is what happens.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
The number of species increases 21 percent;
