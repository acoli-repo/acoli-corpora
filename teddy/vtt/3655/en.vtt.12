with very fatty food.

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:04.956
Human food.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.805
Twenty-five million people

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:10.583
It's the most heavily visited park
in North America.

00:06:10.607 --> 00:06:13.392
And those people leave behind snack food

00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:15.996
and peanuts and junk food,

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.027
and the mice have started feeding on that,

00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:21.022
and it's a completely different diet
than what they're used to,

00:06:21.046 --> 00:06:22.212
and over the years,

00:06:22.236 --> 00:06:25.878
they have evolved to suit
this very fatty, very human diet.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.426
And this is another city slicker animal.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.776
This is the European garden snail.
