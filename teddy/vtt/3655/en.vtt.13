00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.776
This is the European garden snail.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.982
A very common snail,

00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:36.751
it comes in all kinds of color variations,

00:06:36.775 --> 00:06:40.307
ranging from pale yellow to dark brown.

00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:43.315
And those colors are completely determined

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:44.823
by the snail's DNA.

00:06:45.514 --> 00:06:50.421
And those colors also determine
the heat management of the snail

00:06:50.445 --> 00:06:52.379
that lives inside that shell.

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:55.667
For example, a snail
that sits in the sunlight,

00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:56.850
in the bright sun,

00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:58.996
if it has a pale yellow shell,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:05.266
it doesn't heat up as much as a snail
that sits inside a dark brown shell.
