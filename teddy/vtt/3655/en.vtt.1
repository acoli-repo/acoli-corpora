00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:31.816
And this was one of my prized finds.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.537
This is a very special beetle,

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:36.077
an amazing beetle called an ant beetle.

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:39.371
And this is a kind of beetle
that lives its entire life

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:41.308
inside an ant's nest.

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:44.376
It has evolved to speak ant.

00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:47.409
It's using the same chemical signals,

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:50.387
the same smells as the ants do,
for communicating,

00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:53.583
and right now, this beetle
is telling this worker ant,

00:00:53.607 --> 00:00:55.898
"Hey, I'm also a worker ant,

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.692
I'm hungry, please feed me."

00:00:57.716 --> 00:00:59.242
And the ant complies,

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.891
because the beetle is using
the same chemicals.
