00:04:56.893 --> 00:05:02.015
A bit like a modern-day version
of Darwin's finches on the Galapagos.

00:05:03.744 --> 00:05:05.990
And like Darwin's finches,

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:10.188
the mice in each separate park
have started evolving,

00:05:10.212 --> 00:05:13.307
have started to become
different from each other.

00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:15.553
And this is my colleague,
Jason Munshi-South,

00:05:15.577 --> 00:05:17.307
from Fordham University,

00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:18.815
who is studying this process.

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.680
He is studying the DNA
of the white-footed mice

00:05:22.704 --> 00:05:24.839
in New York City's parks,

00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:28.506
and trying to understand
how they are beginning to evolve

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.069
in that archipelago of islands.
