00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:32.057
great environmental changes
are usually caused by us.

00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:35.968
We mow, we irrigate, we plow, we build,

00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:39.051
we pump greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:40.574
that change the climate.

00:02:40.598 --> 00:02:43.387
We release exotic plants and animals

00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:45.434
in places where they didn't live before,

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:51.164
and we harvest fish and trees and game
for our food and other needs.

00:02:52.102 --> 00:02:58.039
And all these environmental changes
reach their epicenter in cities.

00:02:58.555 --> 00:03:03.151
Cities form a completely new habitat
that we have created.
