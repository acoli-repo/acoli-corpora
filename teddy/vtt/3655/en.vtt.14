00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:05.266
it doesn't heat up as much as a snail
that sits inside a dark brown shell.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.316
Just like when you're sitting
in a white car, you stay cooler

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.196
than when you're sitting
inside a black car.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.348
Now there is a phenomenon called
the urban heat islands,

00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:18.315
which means that in the center
of a big city,

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:21.014
the temperature can be
several degrees higher

00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:22.434
than outside of the big city.

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:23.815
That has to do with the fact

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:26.529
that you have these concentrations
of millions of people,

00:07:26.553 --> 00:07:28.783
and all their activities
and their machineries,

00:07:28.807 --> 00:07:30.022
they generate heat.
