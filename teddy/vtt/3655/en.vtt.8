00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.022
These are places
where wild animals and plants

00:04:00.046 --> 00:04:03.442
are evolving under our eyes very rapidly

00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:06.752
to suit these new, urban conditions.

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:10.425
Exactly like the ant beetle did
millions of years ago,

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.822
when it moved inside an ant colony.

00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:17.584
We now find animals and plants
that have moved inside the human colony

00:04:17.608 --> 00:04:19.674
and are adapting to our cities.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:21.561
And in doing so,

00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:23.259
we're also beginning to realize

00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:26.743
that evolution can actually
proceed very fast.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:30.149
It does not always take
the long lapse of ages;
