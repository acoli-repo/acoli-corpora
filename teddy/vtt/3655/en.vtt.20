00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:02.650
we're also beginning to enlist
the millions of pairs of hands

00:10:02.674 --> 00:10:05.038
and ears and eyes
that are present in the city.

00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:08.135
Citizen scientists, schoolchildren --

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:09.343
together with them,

00:10:09.367 --> 00:10:12.405
we are building
a global observation network

00:10:12.429 --> 00:10:16.786
which allows us to watch this process
of urban evolution taking place

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.135
in real time.

00:10:19.323 --> 00:10:22.799
And at the same time,
this also makes it clear to people

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:25.561
that evolution is not
just some abstract thing

00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:28.431
that you need to travel
to the Galapagos to study,

00:10:28.455 --> 00:10:33.099
or that you need to be a paleontologist
to understand what it is.
