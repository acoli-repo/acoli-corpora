00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.891
because the beetle is using
the same chemicals.

00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:03.676
Over these millions of years,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.870
this beetle has evolved a way
to live inside an ant society.

00:01:09.554 --> 00:01:10.712
Over the years,

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.379
when I was living in that village,

00:01:12.403 --> 00:01:15.537
I collected 20,000 different beetles,

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:19.096
and I built a collection
of pinned beetles.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.397
And this got me interested,
at a very early age, in evolution.

00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:28.953
How do all those different forms,
how does all this diversity come about?

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:32.998
So I became an evolutionary biologist,
