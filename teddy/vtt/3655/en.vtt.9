00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:30.149
It does not always take
the long lapse of ages;

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:32.839
it can happen under our very eyes.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.882
This, for example,
is the white-footed mouse.

00:04:37.355 --> 00:04:40.696
This is a native mammal
from the area around New York,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.799
and more than 400 years ago,
before the city was built,

00:04:43.823 --> 00:04:45.934
this mouse lived everywhere.

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:50.235
But these days, they are stuck
in little islands of green,

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.774
the city's parks, surrounded by a sea
of tarmac and traffic.

00:04:56.893 --> 00:05:02.015
A bit like a modern-day version
of Darwin's finches on the Galapagos.
