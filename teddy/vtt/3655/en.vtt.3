So I became an evolutionary biologist,

00:01:33.022 --> 00:01:34.760
like Charles Darwin.

00:01:34.784 --> 00:01:38.572
And like Charles Darwin,
I also soon became frustrated

00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:43.149
by the fact that evolution is something
that happened mostly in the past.

00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:46.597
We study the patterns that we see today,

00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:50.033

that took place in the past,

00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:53.918

00:01:58.346 --> 00:02:01.371
"We see nothing of these slow
changes in progress,
