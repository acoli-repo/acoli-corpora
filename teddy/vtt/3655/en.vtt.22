WEBVTT

00:10:58.474 --> 00:11:01.156
by the growing
conglomeration of Rotterdam,

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.656
and instead, I find shopping malls

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.791
and I find suburbs and bus lanes.

00:11:06.815 --> 00:11:10.410
And many of the animals and plants
that I was so accustomed to

00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:14.169
have disappeared,
including perhaps that ant beetle.

00:11:15.449 --> 00:11:18.553
But I take comfort in the fact
that the children growing up

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:20.581
in that village today

00:11:20.605 --> 00:11:24.468
may no longer be experiencing
that traditional nature

00:11:24.492 --> 00:11:25.680
that I grew up with,

00:11:25.704 --> 00:11:27.950
but they're surrounded
by a new type of nature,

00:11:27.974 --> 00:11:29.815
a new type of ecosystem,

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:33.903
that, to them, might be just as exciting
as the old type was to me.
