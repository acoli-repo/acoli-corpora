00:07:28.807 --> 00:07:30.022
they generate heat.

00:07:30.046 --> 00:07:33.720
Also, the wind is blocked
by the tall buildings,

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:38.053
and all the steel and brick
and concrete absorb the solar heat

00:07:38.077 --> 00:07:39.678
and they radiate it out at night.

00:07:39.702 --> 00:07:42.966
So you get this bubble of hot air
in the center of a big city,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.806
and my students and I figured
that maybe those garden snails,

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.522
with their variable shells,

00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:53.850
are adapting to the urban heat islands.

00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:55.660
Maybe in the center of a city,

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.557
we find that the shell color is evolving

00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:02.017
in a direction to reduce
overheating of the snails.
