00:02:58.555 --> 00:03:03.151
Cities form a completely new habitat
that we have created.

00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:06.516
And we clothe it in brick and concrete
and glass and steel,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.690
which are impervious surfaces

00:03:08.714 --> 00:03:12.175
that plants can only root in
with the greatest difficulty.

00:03:13.141 --> 00:03:15.982
Also in cities, we find
the greatest concentrations

00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:17.585
of chemical pollution,

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.577
of artificial light and noise.

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.116
And we find wild mixtures
of plants and animals

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.725
from all over the world
that live in the city,

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:28.814
because they have escaped
from the gardening

00:03:28.838 --> 00:03:31.029
and aquarium and pet trade.
