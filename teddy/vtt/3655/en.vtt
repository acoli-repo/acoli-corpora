00:00:01.127 --> 00:00:02.727
This is where I grew up.

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.452
A small village near the city of Rotterdam

00:00:05.476 --> 00:00:06.912
in the Netherlands.

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.643
In the 1970s and 1980s,
when I was a teenager,

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.458
this area was still a quiet place.

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:17.675
It was full of farms and fields
and swampland,

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.783
and I spent my free time there,
enjoying myself,

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:24.189
painting oil paintings like this one,

00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:26.834
collecting wildflowers, bird-watching

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:29.721
and also collecting insects.

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:31.816
And this was one of my prized finds.
