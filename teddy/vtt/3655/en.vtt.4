"We see nothing of these slow
changes in progress,

00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:05.404
until the hand of time
has marked the lapse of ages."

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.443
Or do we?

00:02:08.373 --> 00:02:09.777
Over the past few decades,

00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:13.730
evolutionary biologists
have come to realize that sometimes,

00:02:13.754 --> 00:02:18.966
evolution proceeds much faster
and it can actually be observed,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.688
especially when the environment
changes drastically

00:02:22.712 --> 00:02:25.752
and the need to adapt is great.

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.561
And of course, these days,

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:32.057
great environmental changes
are usually caused by us.
