00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:02.017
in a direction to reduce
overheating of the snails.

00:08:02.367 --> 00:08:05.870
And to study this, we started
a citizen-science project.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.805
We built a free smartphone app,

00:08:08.829 --> 00:08:11.034
which allowed people
all over the Netherlands

00:08:11.058 --> 00:08:14.027
to take pictures of snails
in their garden, in their street,

00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:15.870
also in the countryside,

00:08:15.894 --> 00:08:19.403
and upload them to a citizen
science web platform.

00:08:19.427 --> 00:08:22.474
And over a year, we got 10,000 pictures

00:08:22.498 --> 00:08:25.133
of snails that had been photographed
in the Netherlands,

00:08:25.157 --> 00:08:27.647
and when we started analyzing the results,

00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:31.363
we found that indeed,
our suspicions were confirmed.
