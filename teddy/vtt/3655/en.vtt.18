00:08:57.832 --> 00:09:00.705
And in a book that I've written
about this subject,

00:09:00.729 --> 00:09:02.236
the subject of urban evolution,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.681
I give many more examples.

00:09:03.705 --> 00:09:06.466
For example, weeds that have evolved seeds

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.879
that are better at germinating
on the pavement.

00:09:09.903 --> 00:09:13.410
Grasshoppers that have evolved a song

00:09:13.434 --> 00:09:16.966
that has a higher pitch
when they live close to noisy traffic.

00:09:17.553 --> 00:09:22.887
Mosquitoes that have evolved
to feed on the blood of human commuters

00:09:22.911 --> 00:09:25.252
inside metro stations.

00:09:25.276 --> 00:09:28.037
And even the common city pigeon

00:09:28.061 --> 00:09:31.005
that has evolved ways to detox themselves
