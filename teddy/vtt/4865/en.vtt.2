00:00:59.304 --> 00:01:03.344
but there were no buyers for an enslaved 
person who fell into sleeping spells.

00:01:03.344 --> 00:01:06.304
She was instead put to work 
with her father, Ben Ross,

00:01:06.304 --> 00:01:08.338
who taught her how to lumber.

00:01:08.338 --> 00:01:10.872
Lumbering increased 
Minty’s physical strength

00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:15.381
and put her in touch with free black 
sailors who shipped the wood to the North.

00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:18.325
From them, Minty learned about 
the secret communications

00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:20.106
that occurred along trade routes,

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:24.058
information that would prove 
invaluable later in her life.

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:28.728
In this mixed atmosphere of free 
and enslaved blacks working side by side,

00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:33.321
Minty met John Tubman, 
a free black man she married in 1844.
