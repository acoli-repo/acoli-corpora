00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.243
legally abolished slavery,

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:03.481
while the 14th expanded citizenship

00:03:03.481 --> 00:03:07.705
and the 15th gave voting rights 
to formerly enslaved black men.

00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:10.532
But she was undaunted, and she persisted.

00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:13.486
She raised funds 
for formerly enslaved persons

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:17.168
and helped build schools 
and a hospital on their behalf.

00:03:17.168 --> 00:03:22.140
In 1888, Tubman became more active
in the fight for women’s right to vote.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.443
In 1896, she appeared 
at the founding convention

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:29.514
of the National Association 
of Colored Women in Washington D.C.

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:33.383
and later at a woman’s suffrage 
meeting in Rochester, New York.
