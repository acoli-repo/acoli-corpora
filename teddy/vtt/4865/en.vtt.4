00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.458
So Tubman fled with two of her brothers, 
Ben and Harry.

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:04.731
They eventually turned back, 
fearing they were lost.

00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:06.389
But in one of her sleeping spells,

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.427
Harriet dreamed 
that she could fly like a bird.

00:02:09.427 --> 00:02:13.208
Looking down below, 
she saw the path to liberation.

00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:17.313
And in the autumn of 1849, 
she set out on her own,

00:02:17.313 --> 00:02:21.088

and to freedom.

00:02:21.088 --> 00:02:25.353
Tubman returned to the South 
13 times to free her niece,

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:26.180
brothers,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.043
parents,

00:02:27.043 --> 00:02:28.651
and many others.

00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:30.801
She earned the nickname Black Moses
