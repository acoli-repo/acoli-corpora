00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:33.321
Minty met John Tubman, 
a free black man she married in 1844.

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:37.853
After marriage, she renamed herself 
Harriet, after her mother.

00:01:37.853 --> 00:01:40.492
Harriet Tubman’s owner died in 1849.

00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:43.843
When his widow planned to sell 
off her enslaved human beings,

00:01:43.843 --> 00:01:47.294
Harriet feared she would be sold away 
from everyone she loved.

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:49.381
She had heard of 
an “underground railroad,"

00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:51.589
a secret network of safe houses,

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:52.748
boat captains,

00:01:52.748 --> 00:01:54.046
and wagon drivers

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:58.240
willing to harbor fugitive enslaved people
on their way north.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.458
So Tubman fled with two of her brothers, 
Ben and Harry.
