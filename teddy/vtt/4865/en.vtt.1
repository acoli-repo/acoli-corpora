00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:30.474
Born into chattel slavery, Araminta, 
or Minty, was the fifth of nine children.

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:33.917
Two of Minty’s older sisters 
were sold to a chain gang.

00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:35.367
Even as a small child,

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.319
Minty was hired out to different owners,

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:39.997
who subjected her to whippings 
and punishment.

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:43.698
Young Minty’s life changed forever 
on an errand to a neighborhood store.

00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:47.999
There, an overseer threw a two-pound 
weight at a fugitive enslaved person,

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.633
missed, and struck Minty instead.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.386
Her injury caused her 
to experience sleeping spells,

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.708
which we know of today as narcolepsy,

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:57.385
for the rest of her life.

00:00:57.385 --> 00:00:59.304
Minty’s owner tried to sell her,

00:00:59.304 --> 00:01:03.344
but there were no buyers for an enslaved 
person who fell into sleeping spells.
