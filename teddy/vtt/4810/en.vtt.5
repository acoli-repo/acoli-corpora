00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.204
That's because of the sheer 
volume of possibilities.

00:02:30.496 --> 00:02:32.413
A party with 48 guests

00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:38.579
has 2^(1128) possible configurations,

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.121
more than the number of atoms 
in the universe.

00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:43.246
Even with the help of computers,

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:46.079
the best we know is that the answer
to this question

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.204
is somewhere between 43 and 49 guests.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.079
What this shows us 
is that specific patterns

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.538
with seemingly astronomical odds

00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:58.204
can emerge from a relatively small set.

00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:02.663
And with a very large set,
the possibilities are almost endless.
