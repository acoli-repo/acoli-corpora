00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:03.412
Simply put, it states that given enough
elements in a set or structure,

00:01:03.412 --> 00:01:08.579
some particular interesting pattern
among them is guaranteed to emerge.

00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:12.829
As a simple example, let’s look 
at what’s called the Party Problem—

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.329
a classic illustration of Ramsey theory.

00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:18.829
Suppose there are at least six people
at a party.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.413
Amazingly enough, we can say for sure

00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:25.371
that some group of three of them
either all know each other,

00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:26.996
or have never met before,

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:29.579
without knowing a single thing about them.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:33.746
We can demonstrate that by graphing
out all the possibilities.
