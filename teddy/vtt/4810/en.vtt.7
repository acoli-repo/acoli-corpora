00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:31.788
and all their abbreviations 
and alternate spellings,

00:03:31.788 --> 00:03:33.121
they're pretty high.

00:03:33.538 --> 00:03:34.788
You can try it yourself.

00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:36.329
Just pick a favorite text,

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.954
arrange the letters in a grid,

00:03:37.954 --> 00:03:39.496
and see what you can find.

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:53.788
The sheer size of the universe guarantees
that some of its random elements

00:03:53.788 --> 00:03:56.579
will fall into specific arrangements,

00:03:56.704 --> 00:04:01.829
and because we evolved to notice patterns
and pick out signals among the noise,
