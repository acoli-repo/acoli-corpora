00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:02.954
that such a minimum number exists
for certain patterns,

00:02:02.954 --> 00:02:04.788
but no easy way to find it.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.454
In this case, as the total number
of guests grows higher,

00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:10.829
the combinations get out of control.

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:15.038
For instance, say you're trying
to find out the minimum size of a party

00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:19.204
where there's a group of five people
who all know each other or all don't.

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:21.704
Despite five being a small number,

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:24.538
the answer is virtually 
impossible to discover

00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:26.788
through an exhaustive search like this.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.204
That's because of the sheer 
volume of possibilities.
