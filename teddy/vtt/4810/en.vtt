If you line up the entire text 
of “Moby Dick,”

00:00:09.538 --> 00:00:11.954
which was published in 1851,

00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:13.788
into a giant rectangle,

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:16.454
you may notice some peculiar patterns:

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:17.829
like these words,

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.829
which seem to predict the assassination
of Martin Luther King.

00:00:22.538 --> 00:00:26.913
Or these references 
to the 1997 death of Princess Di.

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:30.746
So, was Herman Melville a secret prophet?
