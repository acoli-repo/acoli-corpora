So, was Herman Melville a secret prophet?

00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:32.996
The answer is no,

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:37.371
and we know that thanks to a mathematical
principle called Ramsey theory.

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:41.329
It's the reason we can find geometric
shapes in the night sky,

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.371
it's why we can know without checking

00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:45.371
that at least two people in London

00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:49.079
have exactly the same number 
of hairs on their head,

00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:54.079
and it explains why patterns can be found
in just about any text...

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.912
even Vanilla Ice lyrics.

00:00:56.412 --> 00:00:58.329
So what is Ramsey theory?

00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:03.412
Simply put, it states that given enough
elements in a set or structure,
