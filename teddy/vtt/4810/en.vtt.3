00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:33.746
We can demonstrate that by graphing
out all the possibilities.

00:01:33.746 --> 00:01:35.746
Each point represents a person,

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:38.454
and a line indicates 
that the pair know each other.

00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:43.538
Every pair only has two possibilities:
they either know each other or they don't.

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:46.079
There are a lot of possibilities,

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.371
but every single one has the property 
that we're looking for.

00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:54.163
Six is the lowest number of guests
where that's guaranteed to be the case,

00:01:54.163 --> 00:01:56.329
which we can express like this.

00:01:56.913 --> 00:01:59.163
Ramsey theory gives us a guarantee

00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:02.954
that such a minimum number exists
for certain patterns,
