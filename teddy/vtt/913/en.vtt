00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want you to imagine that you're a student in my lab.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What I want you to do is to create a biologically inspired design.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And so here's the challenge:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want you to help me create a fully 3D, dynamic, parameterized contact model.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The translation of that is, could you help me build a foot?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And it is a true challenge, and I do want you to help me.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Of course, in the challenge there is a prize.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's not quite the TED Prize, but it is an exclusive t-shirt from our lab.
