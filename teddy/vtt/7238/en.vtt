00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.415
For decades now,

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:05.209
we’ve been saying we should
reduce our emissions,

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:06.794
but they’ve kept increasing.

00:00:07.253 --> 00:00:11.841
One of the key reasons
is we don’t measure accurately

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:14.427
the climate impact of our actions.

00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:17.722
Imagine trying to save money,

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.057
but when you go shopping,

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:22.810
there is no price tag on any item ...

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.063
or trying to lose weight,

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:28.316
but you cannot measure
the portion sizes and the calories.

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.109
You would be bound to fail.
