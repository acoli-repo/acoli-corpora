and mobile devices,

00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:41.506
in Braille or in voice.

00:02:41.998 --> 00:02:44.134
This may not surprise you,

00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:49.218
since everyone now has digital books
in their tablets in 2015.

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:55.089

00:02:55.113 --> 00:03:00.345
already in the late 1980s,
almost 30 years ago.
