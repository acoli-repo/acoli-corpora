00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:03.320
how come there is no computer technology

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:05.470
to create books in Braille?

00:02:06.288 --> 00:02:10.652
These amazing technologies
must be able to also help people

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:13.075
with limitations like myself.

00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:17.617
That's the moment
my innovation journey began.

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:22.540
I started developing
digital book technologies,

00:02:22.564 --> 00:02:27.857
such as a digital Braille editor,
digital Braille dictionary

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.627
and a digital Braille library network.
