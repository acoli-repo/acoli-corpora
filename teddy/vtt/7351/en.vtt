00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:02.287
You know how your partner
likes their coffee,

00:00:02.287 --> 00:00:04.121
what love language they speak

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:05.788
and even their medical history.

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:08.246
But how much do you know
about their finances?

[Your Money and Your Mind

00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:17.079
Chances are, you and your better half
are among the 78 percent of people

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.704
who would rather share
their full dating history

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:21.246
and all of that drama

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.788
and all of that baggage
that comes along with it,

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.454
rather than to disclose
your full financial history.

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:29.413
And yet research shows
that your significant other

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:33.246
has a large influence on a
whole host of your behaviors.
