00:00:00.664 --> 00:00:03.416
It was chaos as I got off the elevator.

00:00:03.773 --> 00:00:06.638
I was coming back on duty
as a resident physician

00:00:06.662 --> 00:00:08.857
to cover the labor and delivery unit.

00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:12.022
And all I could see was a swarm
of doctors and nurses

00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:14.484
hovering over a patient in the labor room.

00:00:14.508 --> 00:00:17.963
They were all desperately trying
to save a woman's life.

00:00:17.987 --> 00:00:19.749
The patient was in shock.

00:00:19.773 --> 00:00:24.676
She had delivered a healthy baby boy
a few hours before I arrived.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.795
Suddenly, she collapsed,
became unresponsive,

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.459
and had profuse uterine bleeding.
