00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:30.253
if you are invisible?

00:02:30.277 --> 00:02:33.059
Well, the answer is nothing.

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:34.798
The reason you can't see in the dark

00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:36.689
is because there is no light.

00:02:36.713 --> 00:02:37.866
To see an apple,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.900
light has to hit the apple

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:40.443
and return it to your eyes.

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:41.931
Then, the retinas in your eyes

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:43.908
catch the light reflection for your brain

00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:46.489
to interpret into the image of an apple.

00:02:46.513 --> 00:02:47.680
If you're invisible,

00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:49.780
then, by definition, light would travel

00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:51.872
through you or around you

00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:54.470
instead of bouncing off you
for people to see.

00:02:54.494 --> 00:02:56.464
But that means that retinas in your eyes

00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:58.296
are not catching the light, either.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.892
Therefore, your brain has nothing

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:01.467
to interpret into an image.
