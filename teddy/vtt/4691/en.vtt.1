00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:34.534
in order to create disappearing illusions.

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:36.914
Scientists have created metamaterials

00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:37.957
to guide rays of light

00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.752
around tiny, two-dimensional objects.

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:43.005
Cameras can also film what is behind you

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.757
and project the image

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:47.208
so you appear invisible from the front.

00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:49.385
However, none of these options

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.578
can make an object as large as a person

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:54.421
appear invisible
for all angles and distances

00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:55.641
while its moving.

00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:57.768
But if you are truly invisible,

00:00:57.792 --> 00:00:59.691
as in from within,

00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:00.813
here are a few problems
