00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:01.467
to interpret into an image.

00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:03.133
Can you see your reflection

00:03:03.157 --> 00:03:04.824
without a mirror to stop the light?

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:05.671
No.

00:03:05.695 --> 00:03:07.929
So, when you can't be seen by others,

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:10.682
you also cannot see.

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:12.014
Ouch!

00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:13.515
Now, have you given any thought

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.187
as of whether the invisibility
is permanent?

00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.522
If it is, how can you
receive medical treatment

00:03:18.546 --> 00:03:20.380
from a doctor if you're injured?

00:03:20.404 --> 00:03:21.485
The doctor wouldn't know

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:23.436
where to apply ointments or bandages

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.923
because they cannot access your injury.

00:03:27.947 --> 00:03:29.492
For that matter, you can't see it either.

00:03:29.516 --> 00:03:32.324
I mean, what if you have
an illness or an infection?
