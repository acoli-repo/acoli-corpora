00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:01.168
and fibers from clothes made from cotton

00:02:01.192 --> 00:02:02.747
and other materials.

00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:05.968
Dust sticks to the moisture
on our skin when we sweat

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.846
and the tiny hairs
on our skin when we are dry.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.138
So, even if you are invisible,

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:13.601
dust would still land
on every part of you.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.561
We usually don't notice
the dust on our skin

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:17.587
because we can't see a thin layer of dust

00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:18.936
on top of our skin color.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.273
But, if you're invisible,

00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:22.937
people would see
a human-shaped blob of dust

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:26.275
walking around with extremely dirty soles.

00:02:27.073 --> 00:02:28.223
Gross!

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:29.409
What do you think the world looks like

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:30.253
if you are invisible?
