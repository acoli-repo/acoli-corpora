may seem like a rarity,
the mark of a child genius.

00:10:03.784 --> 00:10:06.354
Well, to me, it signals
something bigger:

00:10:06.378 --> 00:10:11.531
that DNA technology is finally
within the reach of every one of you.

00:10:12.999 --> 00:10:14.706
A few years ago,

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.913
a college student armed
with a personal computer

00:10:17.937 --> 00:10:19.088
could code an app,

00:10:19.112 --> 00:10:23.488
an app that is now a social network
with more than one billion users.

00:10:23.933 --> 00:10:25.893
Could we be moving into a world

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:29.188
of one personal DNA machine in every home?

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:33.347
I know families who are already
living in this reality.
