The genetic instructions encoded in DNA
inform how our bodies develop,

00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:02.884
grow, function.

00:02:02.908 --> 00:02:06.525
And in many cases, that same information
can trigger disease.

00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:08.686
Your genetic information

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.400
is strung into a long and twisted
molecule, the DNA double helix,

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:14.872
that has over three billion letters,

00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:16.460
beginning to end.

00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:19.704
But the lines that carry
meaningful information

00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:21.293
are usually very short --

00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:24.339
a few dozen to several
thousand letters long.

00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:27.510
So when we're looking to answer
a question based on DNA,

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:29.467
we actually don't need to read

00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:31.960
all those three billion
letters, typically.
