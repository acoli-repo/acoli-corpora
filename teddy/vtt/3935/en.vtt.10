00:05:00.142 --> 00:05:05.068
as curious as you would have been
if I had shown you this picture in 1980.

00:05:05.092 --> 00:05:06.377
(Laughter)

00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:08.192
You would have thought, "Wow!

00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:10.819
I can now call
my Aunt Glenda from the car

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:12.729
and wish her a happy birthday.

00:05:12.753 --> 00:05:14.728
I can call anyone, anytime.

00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:16.675
This is the future!"

00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:19.257
Little did you know,

00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:21.886
you would tap on that phone
to make dinner reservations

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.334
for you and Aunt Glenda
to celebrate together.

00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:26.888
With another tap,
you'd be ordering her gift.

00:05:26.912 --> 00:05:28.394
And yet one more tap,

00:05:28.418 --> 00:05:30.730
and you'd be "liking"
Auntie Glenda on Facebook.
