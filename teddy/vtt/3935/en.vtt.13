00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:31.542
truffles that look and feel
like the real thing,

00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:33.068
but they're of lower quality.

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:35.521
But even to a trained eye like Paul's,

00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:37.627
even when looked at under a microscope,

00:06:37.651 --> 00:06:39.802
these truffles can pass for authentic.

00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:43.752
So in order to grow
the highest quality truffles,

00:06:43.776 --> 00:06:47.015
the ones that chefs
all over the world will fight over,

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.899
Paul has to use DNA analysis.

00:06:50.594 --> 00:06:52.340
Isn't that mind-blowing?

00:06:52.364 --> 00:06:55.664
I bet you will never look
at that black truffle risotto again

00:06:55.688 --> 00:06:57.358
without thinking of its genes.

00:06:57.382 --> 00:06:58.932
(Laughter)

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.815
But personal DNA machines
can also save human lives.
