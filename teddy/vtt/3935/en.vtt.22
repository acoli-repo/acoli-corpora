00:10:58.066 --> 00:11:00.963
alongside his kids, ages seven and nine,

00:11:00.987 --> 00:11:03.091
as a way to explore the living world.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.154
Last time I called them,

00:11:05.178 --> 00:11:09.066
they were checking out homegrown produce
from the backyard garden.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.387
They were testing tomatoes
that they had picked,

00:11:11.411 --> 00:11:14.191
taking the flesh of their skin,
putting it in a test tube,

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:16.297
mixing it with chemicals to extract DNA

00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:19.799
and then using their home DNA copier

00:11:19.823 --> 00:11:23.746
to test those tomatoes
for genetically engineered traits.

00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:26.410
For the Daniels family,

00:11:26.434 --> 00:11:29.333
the personal DNA machine
is like the chemistry set

00:11:29.357 --> 00:11:30.684
for the 21st century.
