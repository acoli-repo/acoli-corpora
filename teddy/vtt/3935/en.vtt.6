00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.511
that DNA is still tiny, and surrounded
by so much other DNA,

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:07.177
that what these machines then do
is copy the target gene,

00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:09.442
and one copy piles on top of another,

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:11.631
millions and millions
and millions of copies,

00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:14.641
until that gene stands out
against the rest;

00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:16.848
until we can visualize it,

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:19.415
interpret it, read it, understand it,

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:20.717
until we can answer:

00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:22.848
Does my pig have the flu?

00:03:23.914 --> 00:03:27.411
Or other questions buried in our own DNA:

00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:29.347
Am I at risk of cancer?
