00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:32.726
the health of your herd may be gone
in the blink of an eye.

00:00:33.256 --> 00:00:34.900
If you called in a veterinarian,

00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:37.407
he or she would visit your farm
and take samples

00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:39.255
from your pigs' noses and mouths.

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:42.106
But then they would have to drive
back into the city

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.929
to test those samples
in their central lab.

00:00:45.556 --> 00:00:48.159
Two weeks later,
you'd hear back the results.

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:52.687
Two weeks may be just enough time
for infection to spread

00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:54.799
and take away your way of life.

00:00:55.616 --> 00:00:57.387
But it doesn't have to be that way.

00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:00.668
Today, farmers can take
those samples themselves.
