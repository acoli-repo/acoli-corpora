00:09:29.273 --> 00:09:31.804
That cloud of smoke is the rocket

00:09:31.828 --> 00:09:36.523
that brought Anna-Sophia's experiment
to the International Space Station,

00:09:36.547 --> 00:09:38.476
where, three days later,

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.248
astronaut Tim Peake
carried out her experiment --

00:09:42.272 --> 00:09:43.494
in microgravity.

00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:47.931
Personal DNA machines are now
aboard the International Space Station,

00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:50.542
where they can help monitor
living conditions

00:09:50.566 --> 00:09:52.660
and protect the lives of astronauts.

00:09:53.938 --> 00:09:57.779
A 16-year-old designing a DNA experiment

00:09:57.803 --> 00:09:59.716
to protect the lives of astronauts

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.302
may seem like a rarity,
the mark of a child genius.
