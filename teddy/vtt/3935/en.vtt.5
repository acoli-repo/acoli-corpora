00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:31.960
all those three billion
letters, typically.

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:34.221
That would be like getting hungry at night

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:36.635
and having to flip through
the whole phone book

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:37.914
from cover to cover,

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:39.513
pausing at every line,

00:02:39.537 --> 00:02:41.522
just to find the nearest pizza joint.

00:02:41.546 --> 00:02:42.698

humans started to invent tools

00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:50.742
that can find any specific line
of genetic information.

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:52.955
These DNA machines are wonderful.

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.708
They can find any line in DNA.

00:02:55.732 --> 00:02:57.036
But once they find it,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.511
that DNA is still tiny, and surrounded
by so much other DNA,
