00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:32.655
and within one hour get back the results,
visualize the results.

00:01:33.247 --> 00:01:35.203
This reality is possible

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:39.148
because today we're living in the era
of personal DNA technology.

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:42.874
Every one of us can actually
test DNA ourselves.

00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:47.187
DNA is the fundamental molecule
the carries genetic instructions

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:49.251
that help build the living world.

00:01:50.052 --> 00:01:51.306
Humans have DNA.

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:53.386
Pigs have DNA.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.904
Even bacteria and some
viruses have DNA too.

00:01:56.928 --> 00:02:01.152
The genetic instructions encoded in DNA
inform how our bodies develop,
