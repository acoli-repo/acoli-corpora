00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:03.705
We're talking 35 Celsius heat
and over 90 percent humidity here.

00:08:04.153 --> 00:08:07.037
But instead, Ian could use
personal DNA machines

00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:10.411
small enough to be placed
in front of the air-conditioning unit

00:08:10.435 --> 00:08:12.366
to keep sequencing the virus

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.965
and keep saving lives.

00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:17.026
This may seem like
an extreme place for DNA analysis,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.826
but let's move on to an even
more extreme environment:

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.165
outer space.

00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:24.935
Let's talk about DNA analysis in space.

00:08:25.657 --> 00:08:28.777
When astronauts live aboard
the International Space Station,

00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:32.424
they're orbiting the planet
250 miles high.
