00:05:28.418 --> 00:05:30.730
and you'd be "liking"
Auntie Glenda on Facebook.

00:05:30.754 --> 00:05:33.098
And all of this,
while sitting on the toilet.

00:05:33.122 --> 00:05:35.296
(Laughter)

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.583
It is notoriously hard to predict
where new technology might take us.

00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:45.016
And the same is true
for personal DNA technology today.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.109
For example, I could never have imagined

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:50.654
that a truffle farmer, of all people,

00:05:50.678 --> 00:05:52.767
would use personal DNA machines.

00:05:53.267 --> 00:05:56.558
Dr. Paul Thomas grows
truffles for a living.

00:05:56.582 --> 00:05:58.289
We see him pictured here,

00:05:58.313 --> 00:06:03.409
holding the first UK-cultivated truffle
in his hands, on one of his farms.
