00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:03.603
Imagine that you're a pig farmer.

00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:07.077
You live on a small farm
in the Philippines.

00:00:07.101 --> 00:00:10.760
Your animals are your family's
sole source of income --

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:12.685
as long as they're healthy.

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.079
You know that any day,

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:16.323
one of your pigs can catch the flu,

00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:17.694
the swine flu.

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:20.989
Living in tight quarters,
one pig coughing and sneezing

00:00:21.013 --> 00:00:23.953
may soon lead to the next pig
coughing and sneezing,

00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:27.352
until an outbreak of swine flu
has taken over your farm.

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:29.530
If it's a bad enough virus,

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:32.726
the health of your herd may be gone
in the blink of an eye.
