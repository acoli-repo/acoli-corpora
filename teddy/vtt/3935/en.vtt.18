00:08:57.793 --> 00:09:01.624
a high school student from New York,
Anna-Sophia Boguraev,

00:09:01.648 --> 00:09:04.517
wondered whether changes
to the DNA of astronauts

00:09:04.541 --> 00:09:06.964
could be related
to this immune suppression,

00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:10.357
and through a science competition
called "Genes In Space,"

00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:14.288
Anna-Sophia designed an experiment
to test this hypothesis

00:09:14.312 --> 00:09:18.468
using a personal DNA machine
aboard the International Space Station.

00:09:19.463 --> 00:09:25.162
Here we see Anna-Sophia
on April 8, 2016, in Cape Canaveral,

00:09:25.186 --> 00:09:29.249
watching her experiment launch
to the International Space Station.
