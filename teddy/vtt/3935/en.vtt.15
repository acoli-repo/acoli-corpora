00:07:25.274 --> 00:07:30.133
that's way too long for the patients
and the families who are suffering.

00:07:30.157 --> 00:07:34.651
Ian decided to move his lab
into Makeni, Sierra Leone.

00:07:35.194 --> 00:07:37.319
Here we see Ian Goodfellow

00:07:37.343 --> 00:07:41.411
moving over 10 tons of equipment
into a pop-up tent

00:07:41.435 --> 00:07:45.111
that he would equip to detect
and diagnose the virus

00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:47.861
and sequence it within 24 hours.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.029
But here's a surprise:

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:54.175
the same equipment that Ian could use
at his lab in the UK

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:56.790
to sequence and diagnose Ebola,

00:07:56.814 --> 00:07:58.947
just wouldn't work under these conditions.

00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:03.705
We're talking 35 Celsius heat
and over 90 percent humidity here.
