00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:00.668
Today, farmers can take
those samples themselves.

00:01:00.692 --> 00:01:04.439
They can jump right into the pen
and swab their pigs' noses and mouths

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:06.264
with a little filter paper,

00:01:06.288 --> 00:01:09.501
place that little filter paper
in a tiny tube,

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:13.406
and mix it with some chemicals
that will extract genetic material

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.343
from their pigs' noses and mouths.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.292
And without leaving their farms,

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:19.614
they take a drop of that genetic material

00:01:19.638 --> 00:01:23.429
and put it into a little analyzer
smaller than a shoebox,

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:28.473
program it to detect DNA or RNA
from the swine flu virus,

00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:32.655
and within one hour get back the results,
visualize the results.
