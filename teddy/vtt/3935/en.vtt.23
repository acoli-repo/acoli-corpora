00:11:29.357 --> 00:11:30.684
for the 21st century.

00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:35.237
Most of us may not yet
be diagnosing genetic conditions

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:36.607
in our kitchen sinks

00:11:37.123 --> 00:11:39.341

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.390
(Laughter)

00:11:40.414 --> 00:11:42.634
But we've definitely reached
a point in history

00:11:42.658 --> 00:11:48.467

in your kitchen.

00:11:49.946 --> 00:11:53.133
You could copy, paste and analyze DNA

00:11:53.157 --> 00:11:55.688
and extract meaningful
information from it.

00:11:56.394 --> 00:11:59.251
And it's at times like this
that profound transformation

00:11:59.275 --> 00:12:00.874
is bound to happen;
