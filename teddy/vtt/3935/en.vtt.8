The inventor of this DNA-copying technique

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:13.285
was awarded the Nobel Prize
in Chemistry in 1993.

00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:14.983
But for 30 years,

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:18.840
the power of genetic analysis
has been confined to the ivory tower,

00:04:18.864 --> 00:04:21.704

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:24.435
Well, several companies around the world

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:28.307

00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:31.362
to everyday people like the pig farmer,
