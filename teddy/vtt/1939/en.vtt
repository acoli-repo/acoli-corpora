00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Ever since I was a little girl

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
seeing "Star Wars" for the first time,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I've been fascinated by this idea

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of personal robots.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And as a little girl,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
much more like a helpful, trusted sidekick --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
something that would delight us, enrich our lives

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and help us save a galaxy or two.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I knew robots like that didn't really exist,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but I knew I wanted to build them.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So 20 years pass --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I am now a graduate student at MIT
