00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.611
Most of you can probably relate
to what I'm feeling right now.

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:07.338
My heart is racing in my chest.

00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:10.187
My palms are a little bit clammy.

00:00:10.856 --> 00:00:12.037
I'm sweating.

00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:14.973
And my breath is a little bit shallow.

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:18.358
Now, these familiar sensations
are obviously the result

00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:20.765
of standing up
in front of a thousand of you

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.050
and giving a talk
that might be streamed online

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:25.242
to perhaps a million more.

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.845
But the physical sensations
I'm experiencing right now

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.014
are actually the result of a much more
basic mind-body mechanism.
