have an entirely different
experience than white women

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.713
when it comes to whether
their babies are born healthy.

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:07.572
In certain parts of the country,
particularly the Deep South,

00:04:07.596 --> 00:04:10.309
the rates of mother
and infant death for black women

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.853
actually approximate
those rates in Sub-Saharan African.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.441
In those same communities,

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:19.038
the rates for white women are near zero.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.315
Even nationally, black women
are four times more likely

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:26.631
to die during pregnancy and childbirth

00:04:26.655 --> 00:04:27.893
than white women.

00:04:28.252 --> 00:04:30.590
Four times more likely to die.
