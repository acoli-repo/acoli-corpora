a safe place for the child.

Stress during pregnancy is linked
with things like high blood pressure

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:07.393
and low infant birth weight,

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:09.609
and it can begin a cascade
of health challenges

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.796
that make birth much more dangerous

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.825
for both parent and child.

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:18.186

Maybe you've never stood up
to give a TED Talk,

00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:25.542
but you've faced a big
presentation at work,

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.134
a sudden job loss,

00:02:27.158 --> 00:02:28.471
a big test,

00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:31.121
a heated conflict
with a family member or friend.
