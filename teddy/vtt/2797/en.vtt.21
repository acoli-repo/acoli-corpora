00:10:27.974 --> 00:10:30.568
A similar demographic
of women in Jennie's area

00:10:30.592 --> 00:10:33.464

Well, you'd be wrong.

00:10:53.282 --> 00:10:56.865
The visit with the provider
is not the center of Jennie's model,

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.420
and for good reason.

00:10:58.444 --> 00:11:01.545
Those visits are expensive,
and in order to maintain her model,
