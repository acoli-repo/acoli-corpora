00:03:28.932 --> 00:03:30.356
I became a doula,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.403
a lay person trained to provide support

00:03:32.427 --> 00:03:34.547
to people during pregnancy and childbirth.

00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:37.155
And because I'm Latina
and a Spanish speaker,

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:41.088
in my first volunteer doula gig
at a public hospital in North Carolina,

00:03:41.112 --> 00:03:44.435
I saw clearly how race and class
impacted the experiences

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.091
of the women that I supported.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.184
If we take a look at the statistics
about the rates of illness

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:52.011
during pregnancy and childbirth,

00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:55.173
we see clearly the pattern
outlined by Dr. Williams.

00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:57.962
African-American women in particular

00:03:57.986 --> 00:04:00.895
have an entirely different
experience than white women
