texting with clients
about all sorts of things.

00:09:00.084 --> 00:09:03.961
One woman texted to ask if a medication
she was prescribed at the hospital

00:09:03.985 --> 00:09:05.923
was OK to take while pregnant.

00:09:05.947 --> 00:09:07.624

00:09:07.648 --> 00:09:11.971
Another woman texted with pictures
of an infant born under Jennie's care.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:15.850
Lastly, when you finally are called back

in the waiting room,

00:09:18.627 --> 00:09:21.005
and done your own pee test
in the bathroom.

00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:23.868
This is a big departure
from the traditional medical model,

00:09:23.892 --> 00:09:26.780
because it places
responsibility and information

00:09:26.804 --> 00:09:28.533
back in the woman's hands.

00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:32.076
So rather than a medical setting
where you might be chastised
