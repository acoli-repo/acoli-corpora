00:05:58.284 --> 00:06:01.823
actually have better health when
they first arrive in the United States.

00:06:01.847 --> 00:06:06.412
But the longer they stay in this country,
the worse their health becomes.

00:06:06.436 --> 00:06:10.548
People like me, born in the United States

are actually more likely to have
worse health than my grandparents did.

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.231
It's what researchers call
"the immigrant paradox,"

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:18.539
and it further illustrates

00:06:18.563 --> 00:06:20.766

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.845
But here's the thing:

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:26.936
this problem, that racism

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.641
but especially black
women and babies, sick, is vast.

00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:32.435
I could spend all of my time
with you talking about it,
