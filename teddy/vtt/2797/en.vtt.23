00:11:27.869 --> 00:11:31.281
They come from long histories
of racism, classism,

00:11:31.305 --> 00:11:34.193
a society based on race
and class stratification.

00:11:34.217 --> 00:11:36.613
They involve elaborate
physiological mechanisms

00:11:36.637 --> 00:11:37.792
meant to protect us,

00:11:37.816 --> 00:11:40.313
that, when overstimulated,
actually make us sick.

00:11:40.756 --> 00:11:43.718
But if there's one thing I've learned
from my work as a doula,

00:11:43.742 --> 00:11:47.584
it's that a little bit of unconditional
support can go a really long way.

00:11:47.608 --> 00:11:50.477
History has shown that people
are incredibly resilient,

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:52.384
and while we can't eradicate racism

00:11:52.408 --> 00:11:54.670
or the stress that results
from it overnight,

00:11:54.694 --> 00:11:57.894
we might just be able to create
environments that provide a buffer

00:11:57.918 --> 00:12:00.780
to what people of color
experience on a daily basis.
