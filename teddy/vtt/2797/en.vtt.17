She sees her staff as part of a team that,
alongside the woman and her family,

00:08:42.567 --> 00:08:43.941
has one goal:

00:08:43.965 --> 00:08:46.450
get mom to term with a healthy baby.

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:50.958
Jennie says that Trina and Alexis
are actually the center of her care model,

00:08:50.982 --> 00:08:54.630
and that her role as a provider
is just to support their work.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.624
Trina spends a lot of her day
on her cell phone,

00:08:57.648 --> 00:09:00.060
texting with clients
about all sorts of things.
