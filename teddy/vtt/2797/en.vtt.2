00:00:57.448 --> 00:01:00.041
particularly over an extended
period of time,

00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:03.571
my system can get overloaded.

00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:07.264
So basically, if this response
happens infrequently: super-necessary

00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:09.540
for my well-being and survival.

00:01:09.564 --> 00:01:11.101
But if it happens too much,

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:12.867
it can actually make me sick.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.659
There's a growing body of research
examining the relationship

00:01:16.683 --> 00:01:18.769
between chronic stress and illness.

00:01:18.793 --> 00:01:20.882
Things like heart disease and even cancer

00:01:20.906 --> 00:01:23.471
are being shown to have
a relationship to stress.

00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:27.990
And that's because, over time,
too much activation from stress

00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:31.975
can interfere with my body's processes
that keep me healthy.
