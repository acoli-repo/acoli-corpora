00:04:58.049 --> 00:05:01.020
about just how different
the experiences of women of color,

00:05:01.044 --> 00:05:02.499
but particularly black women,

00:05:02.523 --> 00:05:05.322
are when it comes to pregnancy
and birth in the US.

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:08.242
But when I tell people
about these appalling statistics,

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.997
I'm usually met with an assumption
that it's about either poverty

00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:13.672
or lack of access to care.

00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:17.544

00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:22.080
Even middle-class black women
still have much worse outcomes

00:05:22.104 --> 00:05:24.683
than their middle-class
white counterparts.

00:05:25.062 --> 00:05:27.570
The gap actually widens among this group.

00:05:28.554 --> 00:05:32.073
And while access to care
is definitely still a problem,
