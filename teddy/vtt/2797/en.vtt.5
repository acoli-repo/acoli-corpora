with a family member or friend.

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:35.072
But it turns out that the kind
of stress we experience

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:38.310
and whether we're able to stay
in a relaxed state long enough

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:40.385
to keep our bodies working properly

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.687
depends a lot on who we are.

00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:45.296
There's also a growing body of research

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.298
showing that people who experience
more discrimination

00:02:49.322 --> 00:02:51.233
are more likely to have poor health.

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:54.311
Even the threat of discrimination,

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:57.777
like worrying you might be stopped
by police while driving your car,

00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:01.320
can have a negative impact on your health.
