00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:31.975
can interfere with my body's processes
that keep me healthy.

00:01:32.973 --> 00:01:35.623
Now, let's imagine for a moment
that I was pregnant.

00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:38.553
What might this kind of stress,

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:40.846
particularly over the length
of my pregnancy,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.710
what kind of impact might that have

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:45.166
on the health of my developing fetus?

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.693
You probably won't be surprised
when I tell you

00:01:48.717 --> 00:01:52.091
that this kind of stress
during pregnancy is not good.

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:55.746
It can even cause the body
to initiate labor too early,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.436
because in a basic sense,
the stress communicates

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.643
that the womb is no longer
a safe place for the child.
