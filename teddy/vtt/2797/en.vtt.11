00:05:28.554 --> 00:05:32.073
And while access to care
is definitely still a problem,

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:35.536
even women of color who receive
the recommended prenatal care

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.474
still suffer from these high rates.

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:40.284
And so we come back to the path

00:05:40.308 --> 00:05:44.459
from discrimination to stress
to poor health,

00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:48.680
and it begins to paint a picture
that many people of color know to be true:

00:05:48.704 --> 00:05:51.110
racism is actually making us sick.

00:05:52.288 --> 00:05:53.952
Still sound like a stretch?

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:58.260
Consider this: immigrants,
particularly black and Latina immigrants,

00:05:58.284 --> 00:06:01.823
actually have better health when
they first arrive in the United States.
