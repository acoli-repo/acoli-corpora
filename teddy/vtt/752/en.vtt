00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now I'm going to give you a story.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let me begin with my parents.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm a product of this

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
visionary mother and father.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
'50s and '60s

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
didn't belong to girls in India.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They belonged to boys.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
They belonged to boys who would join business

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and inherit business from parents,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and girls would be dolled up to get married.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
My family, in my city,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and almost in the country, was unique.
