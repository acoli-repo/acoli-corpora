I know you all have long to-do lists,

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:07.503
but I hate wasting time so much
that I have a to-don't list.

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:09.547
Don't scroll on social media,

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.257
don't check my phone in bed

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.800
and don't turn on the TV

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:15.678
unless I already know
what I want to watch.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.057
But last year I found myself
breaking all of those rules.

00:00:19.098 --> 00:00:21.059
I was staying up way past midnight,

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:22.351
doomscrolling,

00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:24.979
playing endless games of online Scrabble

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:29.776
and bingeing entire seasons of TV shows
that weren't even good.
