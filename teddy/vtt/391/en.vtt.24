00:11:55.339 --> 00:12:00.961
but I can hip check anybody for a taxicab
in this room, on these streets.

00:12:00.985 --> 00:12:03.307
So I was surprised
when I said to this guy ...

00:12:04.398 --> 00:12:06.001
"Would you like half?"

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:07.458
"Would you like half?"

00:12:07.482 --> 00:12:09.704
I didn't think about it, it just came out.

00:12:10.006 --> 00:12:13.077
And then, he was very puzzled,
and I could see his face change

00:12:13.101 --> 00:12:14.291
and he said to me,

00:12:14.315 --> 00:12:17.663
"Well, how about if I buy another pastry
and we'll share both of them?"

00:12:18.665 --> 00:12:21.202
And he did, and we did.

00:12:21.577 --> 00:12:22.977
And we sat and talked.

00:12:23.539 --> 00:12:25.213
We had nothing in common.

00:12:25.237 --> 00:12:26.618
(Laughter)

00:12:26.642 --> 00:12:30.868
We had nothing in common: nationality,
sexual orientation, occupation.
