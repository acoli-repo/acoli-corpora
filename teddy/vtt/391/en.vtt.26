I mean sharing 1000 calories.

00:13:02.336 --> 00:13:04.336
But I also mean it in a larger way.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.428
You know, as communities
and as a country and as a world.

What are we missing out on?

00:13:10.989 --> 00:13:15.886
So, today, we are engaged in a great
civil war of ideas and identity.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.910

00:13:18.886 --> 00:13:21.153
You know, there are rules for war.

Think about the Geneva Conventions.

00:13:23.341 --> 00:13:25.793

00:13:25.817 --> 00:13:27.617

00:13:29.372 --> 00:13:32.410
So, frankly, I think we need
a Geneva Convention of civility,
