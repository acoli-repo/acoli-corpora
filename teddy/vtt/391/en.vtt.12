I recently spoke with
Dr. Carolyn Lukensmeyer.

00:06:01.514 --> 00:06:04.347
She's kind of the guru
of civility in this country,

00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:06.205
and the executive director of a body

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.696
called the National Institute
for Civil Discourse.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.871
And she told me,

00:06:09.895 --> 00:06:14.236
"Civility does not mean appeasement
or avoiding important differences.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.522
It means listening and talking
about those differences with respect."

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:23.903
In a healthy democracy,
we need to do that.

00:06:23.927 --> 00:06:26.460
And I call that respectful engagement.

00:06:27.101 --> 00:06:30.340
But civil discourse also needs rules,
it needs boundaries.
