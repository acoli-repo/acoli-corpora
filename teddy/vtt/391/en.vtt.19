And so to this point,
when John McCain died in 2018,

his supporters noted
that he never made personal attacks.

00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:41.107

00:09:43.448 --> 00:09:46.424
He challenged people's policies,
he challenged their positions,

00:09:46.448 --> 00:09:47.900
but he never made it personal.

00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:50.289
And so that's the second rule.

00:09:51.275 --> 00:09:55.031
So the problem of civility
is not only an American one.

00:09:55.504 --> 00:09:59.314
In the Netherlands, there are calls
for a civility offensive right now,

00:09:59.338 --> 00:10:01.677
and as one Dutch philosopher has put it,
