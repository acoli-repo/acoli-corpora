00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:31.236
So when it became my turn, I said,
"I'll take that scone."

00:11:32.814 --> 00:11:34.346
The guy behind me --

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.862
I'd never turned around, never seen him --

00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:38.499
he shouted, "That's my scone!

00:11:39.291 --> 00:11:41.132
I've been waiting in line 20 minutes."

00:11:41.156 --> 00:11:43.683
And I was like, "Who are you?

00:11:43.707 --> 00:11:46.752
I've been waiting in line 20 minutes,
and you're behind me."

00:11:46.776 --> 00:11:49.235
So, I grew up here in New York,

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:51.625
and went to high school
not that far from here.

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:55.315
And I may seem, you know,
very civil here and so on,

00:11:55.339 --> 00:12:00.961
but I can hip check anybody for a taxicab
in this room, on these streets.
