(Laughter)

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:33.783
So, speaking of dinner parties,

00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:37.950
I want to take you back to 2015
and a dinner party that I went to.

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:41.077
To place this in time,

00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:44.206
this was when Caitlyn Jenner
was first coming out,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.809
shedding her identity as a Kardashian

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.888
and moving into her life
as a transgender activist.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.574
I wrote a column
in People magazine at the time,

00:00:52.598 --> 00:00:54.561
talking about the importance of names

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:57.307
and how names are our identity.

00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:01.768
And that to misuse them or not to use them
erases us in a certain way.
