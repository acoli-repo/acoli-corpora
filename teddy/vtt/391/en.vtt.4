00:01:58.887 --> 00:02:00.173
So ...

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:03.823
I am known as the Civilist.

00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:07.514
And it's probably a word
that you're not that familiar with.

00:02:08.053 --> 00:02:09.515
It's not in common parlance

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.561
and it comes from the Latin
and the French,

00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:16.656
and it means an individual
who tries to live by a moral code,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.147
who is striving to be a good citizen.

00:02:19.863 --> 00:02:22.466
The word "civility" is derived from that,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.752
and the original definition of civility

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:28.934
is citizens willing to give of themselves
for the good of the city,

00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.879
for the good of the commonwealth,
for the larger good.
