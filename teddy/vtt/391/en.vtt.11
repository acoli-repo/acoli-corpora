for pursuing the vote
for women in the 1920s.

You know, I also think about
the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.,

00:05:34.204 --> 00:05:37.458
the father of American
nonviolent civil disobedience.

00:05:37.784 --> 00:05:43.187
He was labeled as uncivil in his attempt
to promote racial and economic justice.

00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:46.241
So I think you get a sense

00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:50.292
of why civility has become
a problem, a dirty word, here.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.007
Now, does this mean we can't disagree,
that we can't speak our minds?

00:05:56.585 --> 00:05:58.093
Absolutely not.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.175
I recently spoke with
Dr. Carolyn Lukensmeyer.
