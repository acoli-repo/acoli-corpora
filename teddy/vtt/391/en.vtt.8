00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.474
And I took that to heart, it was very --

00:04:02.498 --> 00:04:05.696
The audience was very engaged
about that online, as you can imagine.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.220
There was a thousand responses,
and this one stood out to me

00:04:10.244 --> 00:04:12.244
because it was representative:

00:04:13.093 --> 00:04:16.339
"Political correctness
is a pathological system

00:04:16.363 --> 00:04:18.807
that lets liberals dominate
a conversation,

00:04:18.831 --> 00:04:21.964
label, demonize and shout down
the opposition."

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:27.696
So I think, to the right,
civility translates into censure.

00:04:29.117 --> 00:04:30.450
So that's the right.
