So, frankly, I think we need
a Geneva Convention of civility,

00:13:32.434 --> 00:13:35.172
to set the rules for discourse
for the parameters of that.

00:13:35.776 --> 00:13:40.172
To help us become better citizens
of our communities and of our countries.

00:13:41.395 --> 00:13:43.268
And if I have anything to say about it,

00:13:43.292 --> 00:13:47.069
I would base those rules
on the original definition of civility,

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.212
from the Latin and from the French.

00:13:49.236 --> 00:13:50.982
Civility:

00:13:51.006 --> 00:13:54.913
citizens willing to give of themselves
for the greater good.

00:13:55.526 --> 00:13:57.193
For the good of the city.

00:13:57.811 --> 00:14:00.938
So I think civility, with that
understanding, is not a dirty word.
