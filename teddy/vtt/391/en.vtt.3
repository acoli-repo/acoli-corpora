00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:31.871
and I'm listening,
and because I do meditation,

00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:34.714
I took my sacred pause before I responded.

00:01:34.738 --> 00:01:35.888

but we use it because it's respectful.

00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:53.520

00:01:54.268 --> 00:01:56.529
She didn't buy it
and we didn't speak for years.

00:01:56.553 --> 00:01:58.378
(Laughter)

00:01:58.887 --> 00:02:00.173
