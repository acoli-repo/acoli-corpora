00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.768
And in part, that's because modern usage
equates civility with decorum,

00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:04.537
with formal politeness, formal behavior.

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:07.942
We've gotten away
from the idea of citizenship.

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:12.672
So, let me start by talking a little bit
about my friends on the right,

00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:16.216
who have conflated civility with
what they call political correctness.

00:03:16.982 --> 00:03:19.047
And to them, callouts for civility

00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:23.395
are really very much like
what George Orwell wrote in "1984" --

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.688
he called it "newspeak."

00:03:25.188 --> 00:03:28.680
And this was an attempt
to change the way we talk

00:03:28.704 --> 00:03:31.069
by forcibly changing
the language that we use.
