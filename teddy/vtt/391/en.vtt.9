00:04:29.117 --> 00:04:30.450
So that's the right.

00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:34.863
Now, my friends on the left
also have a problem with it.

00:04:35.323 --> 00:04:37.150
And for example, there have been those

00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:39.561
who have harassed
Trump administration officials

00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:42.276
who support the President's border wall.

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:46.030
They've been called out as rude,
they've been called out as nasty,

00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:47.656
they've been called out as worse.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.912
And after one such incident last year,

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:51.810
even the Washington Post --

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:53.892
you know, left-leaning
Washington Post --

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:56.072
wrote an editorial and sided with decorum.

00:04:56.971 --> 00:05:00.622
And they argued that officials
should be allowed to dine in peace.
