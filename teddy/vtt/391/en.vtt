00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:03.500
I want to start by telling you
two things about myself

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:05.657
before I get into the full talk.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.184
And the first is that I've been writing
about manners and civility

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.379
for more than 20 years,

00:00:10.403 --> 00:00:12.870
as a book author
and as a magazine columnist.

00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:15.672
The second is,

00:00:15.696 --> 00:00:20.530
my friends know to be very wary
of inviting me over for dinner

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:22.864
because any faux pas
that happens at the table

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:24.539
is likely to wind up in print.

00:00:24.563 --> 00:00:25.657
(Laughter)

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:29.482
So, I'm watching, I can see back there
and I can see through the portals, too.

00:00:29.506 --> 00:00:30.656
(Laughter)
