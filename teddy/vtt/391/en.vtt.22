don't mistake decorum for civility.

00:11:02.165 --> 00:11:05.982
Even if you have a dowager countess
as fabulous as Dame Maggie Smith.

00:11:06.006 --> 00:11:07.014
(Laughter)

00:11:07.038 --> 00:11:08.958
[Don't be defeatist.
It's so middle class.]

00:11:08.982 --> 00:11:10.955
So let me end with one last story.

00:11:11.609 --> 00:11:15.297
Not that long ago, I was at a bakery,
and they make these amazing scones.

00:11:15.321 --> 00:11:17.613
So, long line --
there are a lot of scones.

00:11:17.637 --> 00:11:19.733
And one by one,
the scones were disappearing

00:11:19.757 --> 00:11:22.590
until there was one woman
in between me and that last scone.

00:11:22.614 --> 00:11:23.764
(Laughter)

00:11:24.315 --> 00:11:27.057
Praise the Lord, she said,
"I'll have a croissant."

00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:28.315
(Laughter)

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:31.236
So when it became my turn, I said,
"I'll take that scone."
