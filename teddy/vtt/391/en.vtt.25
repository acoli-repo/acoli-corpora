00:12:26.642 --> 00:12:30.868
We had nothing in common: nationality,
sexual orientation, occupation.

00:12:31.332 --> 00:12:35.705
But through this moment of kindness,
through this moment of connection,

00:12:35.729 --> 00:12:38.118
we developed a friendship,
we have stayed in touch.

00:12:38.142 --> 00:12:39.292
(Laughter)

00:12:39.316 --> 00:12:42.808
Although he was appalled to learn
that I'm called the Civilist after that.

00:12:42.832 --> 00:12:43.982
(Laughter)

00:12:44.474 --> 00:12:46.874
But I call this the joy of civility.

00:12:47.276 --> 00:12:48.442
The joy of civility.

00:12:48.466 --> 00:12:49.808
And it led me to wonder,

00:12:49.832 --> 00:12:53.037
what is the good we forgo,
not just the trouble we avoid,

00:12:53.061 --> 00:12:54.995
when we choose to be uncivil.

00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:59.137
And by good, I mean friendship,
I mean connection.

00:12:59.161 --> 00:13:01.224
I mean sharing 1000 calories.
