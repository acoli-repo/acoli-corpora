"If anyone were to shoot and kill you,

00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:40.172
it would not be a loss at all."

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.434
I wish that were the end of the story.

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:47.710
Because then, a few months later,
he came to my door, my front door,

00:08:47.734 --> 00:08:50.182
in a rage and tried
to break the door down.

00:08:50.206 --> 00:08:53.150
I now own mace, a security system

00:08:53.174 --> 00:08:55.848
and a Louisville Slugger baseball bat.

00:08:56.792 --> 00:08:57.942
(Sighs)

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:00.047
"Shut up or else."
