00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:00.047
"Shut up or else."

00:09:00.935 --> 00:09:02.109
So, what's to be done

00:09:02.133 --> 00:09:05.273
to forestall civility from turning ugly,
from turning violent?

00:09:05.887 --> 00:09:08.038
My first rule is to deescalate language.

00:09:08.062 --> 00:09:11.508
And I've stopped using
trigger words in print.

00:09:12.332 --> 00:09:15.295
And by trigger words, I mean

00:09:15.319 --> 00:09:18.141
I mean "xenophobe," I mean "sexist."

00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:19.432
All of those words.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.982
They set people off.

00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:23.713
They're incendiary

00:09:23.737 --> 00:09:26.244
and they do not allow us
to find common ground.

00:09:26.268 --> 00:09:28.890
They do not allow us
to find a common heart.

00:09:29.553 --> 00:09:33.717
And so to this point,
when John McCain died in 2018,
