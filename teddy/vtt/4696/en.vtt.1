00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:31.583
Euclid's "Elements" is 13 volumes
full of just geometry.

00:00:31.607 --> 00:00:34.360
In "Elements," Euclid structured
and supplemented the work

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:36.472
of many mathematicians
that came before him,

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:39.273
such as Pythagoras, Eudoxus,
Hippocrates and others.

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:42.247
Euclid laid it all out
as a logical system of proof

00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:43.983
built up from a set of definitions,

00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:46.553
common notions,
and his five famous postulates.

00:00:46.577 --> 00:00:49.443
Four of these postulates
are very simple and straightforward,

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:51.458
two points determine a line, for example.

00:00:51.482 --> 00:00:54.160
The fifth one, however,
is the seed that grows our story.

00:00:54.184 --> 00:00:58.255
This fifth mysterious postulate
is known simply as the parallel postulate.

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:59.851
You see, unlike the first four,

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:02.489
the fifth postulate is worded
in a very convoluted way.
