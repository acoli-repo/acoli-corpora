00:01:28.937 --> 00:01:31.140
from the other four,
but weren't able to do so.

00:01:31.164 --> 00:01:34.226
In the process, they began looking at
what would happen logically

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.402
if the fifth postulate
were actually not true.

00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:39.970
Some of the greatest minds in the history
of mathematics ask this question,

00:01:39.994 --> 00:01:41.964
people like Ibn al-Haytham, Omar Khayyam,

00:01:41.988 --> 00:01:44.038
Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Giovanni Saccheri,

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:47.565
János Bolyai, Carl Gauss,
and Nikolai Lobachevsky.

00:01:48.372 --> 00:01:51.231
They all experimented
with negating the parallel postulate,

00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:54.579
only to discover that this gave rise
to entire alternative geometries.

00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:57.964
These geometries became collectively known
as non-Euclidean geometries.

00:01:57.988 --> 00:02:01.436
We'll leave the details of these
different geometries for another lesson.
