As any current or past
geometry student knows,

00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:18.969
the father of geometry was Euclid,

00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:23.064
a Greek mathematician who lived
in Alexandria, Egypt, around 300 B.C.E.

00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:26.025
Euclid is known as the author
of a singularly influential work

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:27.200
known as "Elements."

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:28.812
You think your math book is long?

00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:31.583

full of just geometry.
