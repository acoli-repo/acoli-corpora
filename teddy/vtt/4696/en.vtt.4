00:01:57.988 --> 00:02:01.436
We'll leave the details of these
different geometries for another lesson.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.235
The main difference depends
on the curvature of the surface

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.054
upon which the lines are constructed.

00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:09.223
Turns out Euclid did not tell us
the entire story in "Elements,"

00:02:09.247 --> 00:02:12.165
and merely described one possible way
to look at the universe.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.867
It all depends on the context
of what you're looking at.

00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:16.288
Flat surfaces behave one way,

00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:18.529
while positively and negatively
curved surfaces

00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:20.423
display very different characteristics.

00:02:20.447 --> 00:02:22.994
At first these alternative
geometries seemed strange,

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:26.547
but were soon found to be equally adept
at describing the world around us.

00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:28.923
Navigating our planet
requires elliptical geometry

00:02:28.947 --> 00:02:32.247
while the much of the art of M.C. Escher
displays hyperbolic geometry.
