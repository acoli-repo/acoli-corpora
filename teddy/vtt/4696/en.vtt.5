00:02:28.947 --> 00:02:32.247
while the much of the art of M.C. Escher
displays hyperbolic geometry.

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:34.687
Albert Einstein used
non-Euclidean geometry as well

00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:38.352
to describe how space-time
becomes warped in the presence of matter,

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:40.661
as part of his general
theory of relativity.

00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:43.162
The big mystery is whether
Euclid had any inkling

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:45.361
of the existence
of these different geometries

00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:47.067
when he wrote his postulate.

00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:48.972
We may never know,

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:52.181
but it's hard to believe he had
no idea whatsoever of their nature,

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:53.989
being the great intellect that he was

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:56.458
and understanding the field
as thoroughly as he did.

00:02:56.482 --> 00:02:59.253
Maybe he did know and he wrote
the postulate in such a way

00:02:59.277 --> 00:03:02.163
as to leave curious minds after him
to flush out the details.
