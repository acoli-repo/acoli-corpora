00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:02.489
the fifth postulate is worded
in a very convoluted way.

00:01:02.513 --> 00:01:03.933
Euclid's version states that,

00:01:03.957 --> 00:01:05.635
"If a line falls on two other lines

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.527
so that the measure of the two interior
angles on the same side of the transversal

00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:11.350
add up to less than two right angles,

00:01:11.374 --> 00:01:13.682
then the lines eventually
intersect on that side,

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.259
and therefore are not parallel."

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:16.757
Wow, that is a mouthful!

00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:18.785
Here's the simpler, more familiar version:

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:21.317
"In a plane, through any point
not on a given line,

00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:24.710
only one new line can be drawn
that's parallel to the original one."

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.913
Many mathematicians over the centuries
tried to prove the parallel postulate

00:01:28.937 --> 00:01:31.140
from the other four,
but weren't able to do so.
