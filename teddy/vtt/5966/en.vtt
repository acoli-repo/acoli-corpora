00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:11.996
From 1930 to 1961, thousands of people

00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:15.413
were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered

00:00:15.413 --> 00:00:19.663
under Rafael Trujilloâ€™s dictatorship 
in the Dominican Republic.

00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:24.663
Three sisters would go on to lead 
an underground revolution.

00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:29.204

it threatened the man in power,

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:32.871
and their lives would come 
to a tragic early end.
