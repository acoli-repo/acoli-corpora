00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to go right into the slides.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is that I do just very straight stuff.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And my ideas are --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in my head, anyway -- they're very logical

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or I really do solve their problems,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because usually they seem to like it.
