00:00:01.595 --> 00:00:05.848
Thirteen point eight billion years ago,

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:09.675
the universe as we know it
began with a big bang,

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:15.616
and everything that we know and are
and are made of was created.

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.531
Fifty thousand years ago,

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:23.277
our brains underwent
a major genetic mutation,

00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:27.796
which resulted in the biological
reorganization of the brain.

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:33.131
Some scientists call this
"The Big Brain Bang."
