You know, those emotions

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.576
that we have a hard time
describing to each other?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.040
Like nostalgia.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.576
So, to explore this, I created
a piece of art, an experience,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.696
that asked people to share a memory,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.856
and I teamed up with some data scientists

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.456
to figure out how to take
an emotion that's so highly subjective

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.680
and convert it into something
mathematically precise.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.976
So, we created what we call
a nostalgia score

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.216
and it's the heart of this installation.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.296
To do that, the installation
asks you to share a story,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.576
the computer then analyzes it
for its simpler emotions,
