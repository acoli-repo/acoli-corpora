00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.136
and it's set up as a symbolic compass
that has four kinetic sculptures.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.216
Each one represents a direction,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.360
north, east, south and west.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.776
And there are sensors set up
on the top of each sculpture

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.056
that capture how far away
you are from them.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.896
And the data that gets collected

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.056
ends up changing the way
that sculptures move

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.120
and the direction of the compass.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.016
The thing is, the piece doesn't work
like the automatic door sensor

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.696
that just opens
when you walk in front of it.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.776
See, your contribution is only a part
of its collection of lived experiences.
