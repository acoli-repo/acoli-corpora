00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.936
So, even the more objective parts
about being human are hard to describe.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.200
Like, conversation.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.616
Have you ever really tried
to break down the steps?

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.296
So think about sitting
with your friend at a coffee shop

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.640
and just having small talk.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.880
How do you know when to take a turn?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.280
How do you know when to shift topics?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.680
And how do you even know
what topics to discuss?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.656
See, most of us
don't really think about it,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.336
because it's almost second nature.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.856
And when we get to know someone,
we learn more about what makes them tick,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.256
and then we learn
what topics we can discuss.
