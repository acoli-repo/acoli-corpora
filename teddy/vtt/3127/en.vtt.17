Big ideas, from that abstract,
nonlinear place in our consciousness

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.480
that is the culmination
of all of our experiences.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.496
And if we want computers to relate to us
and help amplify our creative abilities,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.416
I feel that we'll need to start thinking
about how to make computers be intuitive.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.536
So I wanted to explore
how something like human intuition

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.016
could be directly translated
to artificial intelligence.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.256
And I created a piece
that explores computer-based intuition

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.600
in a physical space.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.176
The piece is called Wayfinding,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.136
and it's set up as a symbolic compass
that has four kinetic sculptures.
