See, your contribution is only a part
of its collection of lived experiences.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.856
And all of those experiences
affect the way that it moves.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.616
So when you walk in front of it,

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.616
it starts to use all of the data

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.256
that it's captured
throughout its exhibition history --

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.096
or its intuition --

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.680
to mechanically respond to you
based on what it's learned from others.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.016
And what ends up happening
is that as participants

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.856
we start to learn the level
of detail that we need

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.896
in order to manage expectations

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.696
from both humans and machines.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.336
We can almost see our intuition
being played out on the computer,
