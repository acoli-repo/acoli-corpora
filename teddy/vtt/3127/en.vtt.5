00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.576
but under the surface,
there's really a ton of complexity.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.536
And translating
that complexity to machines

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.416
is what makes them modern-day moonshots.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.616
And I'm not convinced that we can
answer these deeper questions

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.120
with just ones and zeros alone.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.056
So, in the lab, I've been creating art

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.536
as a way to help me
design better experiences

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.656
for bleeding-edge technology.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.416
And it's been serving as a catalyst

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.280
to beef up the more human ways
that computers can relate to us.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.696
Through art, we're tacking
some of the hardest questions,
