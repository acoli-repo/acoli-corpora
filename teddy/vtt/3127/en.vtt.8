00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.576
the computer then analyzes it
for its simpler emotions,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.256
it checks for your tendency
to use past-tense wording

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.616
and also looks for words
that we tend to associate with nostalgia,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.680
like "home," "childhood" and "the past."

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.816
It then creates a nostalgia score

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.576
to indicate how nostalgic your story is.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.736
And that score is the driving force
behind these light-based sculptures

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.656
that serve as physical embodiments
of your contribution.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.896
And the higher the score,
the rosier the hue.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.856
You know, like looking at the world
through rose-colored glasses.
