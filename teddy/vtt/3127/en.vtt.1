00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.240
the technology has to be
just as much human as it is artificial.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.176
It has to get you.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.536
You know, like that inside joke
that'll have you and your best friend

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.496
on the floor, cracking up.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.080
Or that look of disappointment
that you can just smell from miles away.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.600
I view art as the gateway to help us
bridge this gap between human and machine:

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.416
to figure out what it means
to get each other

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.200
so that we can train AI to get us.
