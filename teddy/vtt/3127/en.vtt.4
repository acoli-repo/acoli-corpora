00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.376
The issue is, there are
many qualitative things

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.360
that we just can't put our finger on.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.600
So, think about hearing
your favorite song for the first time.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.400
What were you doing?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.200
How did you feel?

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.080
Did you get goosebumps?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.880
Or did you get fired up?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.600
Hard to describe, right?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.896
See, parts of us feel so simple,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.576
but under the surface,
there's really a ton of complexity.
