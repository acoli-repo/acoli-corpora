We can almost see our intuition
being played out on the computer,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.960
picturing all of that data
being processed in our mind's eye.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.216
My hope is that this type of art

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.656
will help us think differently
about intuition

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.960
and how to apply that to AI in the future.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.416
So these are just a few examples
of how I'm using art to feed into my work

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.536
as a designer and researcher
of artificial intelligence.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.056
And I see it as a crucial way
to move innovation forward.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.456
Because right now, there are
a lot of extremes when it comes to AI.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.296
Popular movies show it
as this destructive force
