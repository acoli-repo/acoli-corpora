Sometimes it works and sometimes
it gets into these, well,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.816
loops of misunderstanding.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.936
So even though the machine-to-machine
conversation can make sense,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.976
grammatically and colloquially,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.216
it can still end up
feeling cold and robotic.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.256
And despite checking all the boxes,
the dialogue lacks soul

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.416
and those one-off quirks
that make each of us who we are.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.496
So while it might be grammatically correct

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.176
and uses all the right
hashtags and emojis,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.336
it can end up sounding mechanical
and, well, a little creepy.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.696
And we call this the uncanny valley.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.656
You know, that creepiness factor of tech
