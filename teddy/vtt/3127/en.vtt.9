00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.856
You know, like looking at the world
through rose-colored glasses.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.496
So, when you see your score

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.176
and the physical representation of it,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.136
sometimes you'd agree
and sometimes you wouldn't.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.640
It's as if it really understood
how that experience made you feel.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.616
But other times it gets tripped up

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.200
and has you thinking
it doesn't understand you at all.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.576
But the piece really serves to show

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.656
that if we have a hard time explaining
the emotions that we have to each other,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.040
how can we teach a computer
to make sense of them?
