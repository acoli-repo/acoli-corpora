I consider myself one part artist
and one part designer.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.640
And I work at an artificial
intelligence research lab.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.416
We're trying to create technology

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.736
that you'll want to interact with
in the far future.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.400
Not just six months from now,
but try years and decades from now.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.736
And we're taking a moonshot

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.216
that we'll want to be
interacting with computers

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.360
in deeply emotional ways.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.736
So in order to do that,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.240
the technology has to be
just as much human as it is artificial.
