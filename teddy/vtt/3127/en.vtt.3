00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.960
And this is what makes life
really interesting.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.936
But this is also what makes
working on intelligent technology

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.560
extremely difficult.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.096
And right now, AI research, well,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.136
it's a bit lopsided on the tech side.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.296
And that makes a lot of sense.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.776
See, for every
qualitative thing about us --

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.256
you know, those parts of us that are
emotional, dynamic and subjective --

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.416
we have to convert it
to a quantitative metric:

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.800
something that can be represented
with facts, figures and computer code.
