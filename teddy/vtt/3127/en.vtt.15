00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.656
You know, that creepiness factor of tech

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.536
where it's close to human
but just slightly off.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.016
And the piece will start being

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.256
one way that we test
for the humanness of a conversation

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.440
and the parts that get
lost in translation.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.416
So there are other things
that get lost in translation, too,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.056
like human intuition.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.856
Right now, computers
are gaining more autonomy.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.616
They can take care of things for us,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.816
like change the temperature
of our houses based on our preferences

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.000
and even help us drive on the freeway.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.056
But there are things
that you and I do in person
