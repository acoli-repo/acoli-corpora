so that we can train AI to get us.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.736
See, to me, art is a way
to put tangible experiences

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.000
to intangible ideas,
feelings and emotions.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.400
And I think it's one
of the most human things about us.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.416
See, we're a complicated
and complex bunch.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.576
We have what feels like
an infinite range of emotions,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.096
and to top it off, we're all different.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.416
We have different family backgrounds,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.520
different experiences
and different psychologies.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.960
And this is what makes life
really interesting.
