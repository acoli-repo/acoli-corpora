Alright, to the credit of the designers,
realistic communication is really hard.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.496
And there's a whole branch of sociology,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.456
called conversation analysis,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.616
that tries to make blueprints
for different types of conversation.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.720
Types like customer service
or counseling, teaching and others.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.816
I've been collaborating
with a conversation analyst at the lab

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.536
to try to help our AI systems
hold more human-sounding conversations.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.736
This way, when you have an interaction
with a chatbot on your phone

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.616
or a voice-based system in the car,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.960
it sounds a little more human
and less cold and disjointed.
