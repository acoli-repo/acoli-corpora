00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.256
and then we learn
what topics we can discuss.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.936
But when it comes to teaching
AI systems how to interact with people,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.816
we have to teach them
step by step what to do.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.336
And right now, it feels clunky.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.496
If you've ever tried to talk
with Alexa, Siri or Google Assistant,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.720
you can tell that it or they
can still sound cold.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.096
And have you ever gotten annoyed

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.376
when they didn't understand
what you were saying

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.240
and you had to rephrase what you wanted
20 times just to play a song?

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.336
Alright, to the credit of the designers,
realistic communication is really hard.
