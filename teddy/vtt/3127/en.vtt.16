00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.056
But there are things
that you and I do in person

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.840
that are really difficult
to translate to AI.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.800
So think about the last time
that you saw an old classmate or coworker.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.560
Did you give them a hug
or go in for a handshake?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.296
You probably didn't think twice

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.656
because you've had so many
built up experiences

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.680
that had you do one or the other.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.896
And as an artist, I feel
that access to one's intuition,

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.336
your unconscious knowing,

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.416
is what helps us create amazing things.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.496
Big ideas, from that abstract,
nonlinear place in our consciousness
