00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.016
so I developed this curriculum

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.976
that's part poli-sci class,
part soccer tournament,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.440
inside of an arts festival.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.896
It accesses /peh-LO-tah/'s
field of inquiry

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.816
to create a sports-based
political action for young people.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.536
The project is called
"Moving and Passing."

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.696
It intersects curriculum development,
site-specific performance

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.616
and the politics of joy,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.776
while using soccer as a metaphor
for the urgent question

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.160
of enfranchisement among immigrant youth.
