00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.496
for first-generation Americans
and immigrant kids,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.936
to ask them to consider
movement patterns on the field

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.240
as kin to migratory patterns
across social and political borders.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.376
Whether footballers or not,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.880
immigrants in the US
play on endangered ground.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.736
I wanted to help the kids understand

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.616
that the same muscle
that they use to plan the next goal

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.800
can also be used
to navigate the next block.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.680
For me, freedom exists in the body.
