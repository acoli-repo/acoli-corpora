00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.200
but I don't really believe in art
that doesn't bleed or sweat or cry.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.616
I imagine that my kids
are going to live in a time

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.720
when the most valuable commodities
are fresh water and empathy.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.976
I love pretty dances
and majestic sculpture

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.656
as much as the next guy,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.880
but give me something else to go with it.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.136
Lift me up with the aesthetic sublime

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.856
and give me a practice or some tools
to turn that inspiration

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.960
into understanding and action.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.136
For instance, I'm a theater maker
who loves sports.
