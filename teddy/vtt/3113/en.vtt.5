00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.680
For me, freedom exists in the body.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.016
We talk about it abstractly
and even divisively,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.816
like "protect our freedom,"
"build this wall,"

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.840
"they hate us because of our freedom."

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.816
We have all these systems
that are beautifully designed

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.536
to incarcerate us or deport us,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.600
but how do we design freedom?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.856
For these kids, I wanted to track the idea
back to something that exists inside

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.256
that no one could take away,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.016
so I developed this curriculum
