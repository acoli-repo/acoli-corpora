00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.696
I'm dancing and the air is carrying me

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.440
like I might never come down.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.776
The second place that I feel free

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.896
is after scoring a goal
on the soccer pitch.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.536
My body floods with the chemical

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.656
that they put inside of EpiPens
to revive the dead,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.720
and I am weightless,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.480
raceless.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.896
My story is this: I'm a curator
at a contemporary arts center,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.200
but I don't really believe in art
that doesn't bleed or sweat or cry.
