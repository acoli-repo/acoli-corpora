00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:05.518
We are all trapped

00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:07.643
inside our own heads,

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:11.643
and our beliefs and our understandings
about the world are limited

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.393
by that perspective,

00:00:13.417 --> 00:00:16.583
which means we tell ourselves stories.

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:21.351
Right? So here we are
in this infinite data source.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.351
There's an infinite number of things
that we could think about,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:26.684
but we edit and delete.

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:30.143
We choose what to think about,
what to pay attention to.
