00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.841
I used to be really bad at earning money.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:05.110
Early on, I was
a junior financial planner,

00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:07.573
and my job was to help people
manage their wealth.

00:00:07.597 --> 00:00:10.760
But my salary was so low
that I started riding my bike to work

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:12.129
to save money on gas,

00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:14.631
and I started a garden
to save money on food.

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:16.677
Now I run a bookkeeping agency

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.324
that specifically serves
creative businesses.

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:21.730

00:00:23.782 --> 00:00:26.824
This might sound strange
coming from a former financial planner,

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:28.599
but I'm not a fan of capitalism.

00:00:28.623 --> 00:00:33.738
Almost everyone I work with and know
and love is an artist, including me.
