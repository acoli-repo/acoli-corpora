00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.280
What is important is nurturing
and giving time to relationships,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.450
I have learned this.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.560
In today’s day and age,
we don’t give time to our relationships.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.090
We think, she is our mother,
she will always love us,

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.670
our father will always look after us.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.940
We should never take
these things for granted,

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.360
it’s a simple philosophy.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.330
Only if you invest in your relationships,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.940
then only will you get something.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.360
Its really like an
emotional bank transaction.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.500

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.860
SRK: Karan Johar told us that

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.660
it’s good to keep fighting
in your relationships,
