00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.250
And then there was your grandfather
who always said,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.600
“Do whatever your heart asks you to!”

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.880
Of course my heart wanted something new
every couple of years.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.970
At the age of four
I wanted to be a hairstylist,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.350
at 10, I wanted to be a dancer,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.240
at 15 a copywriter,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.490
at 18 a fashion designer
and at 20, finally, a filmmaker.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.770
What is surprising is that
your grandfather supported me

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.630
in all these flights of fantasy.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.530
You know what was special
about your grandfather?
