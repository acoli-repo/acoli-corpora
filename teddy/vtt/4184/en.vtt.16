00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.920
and our love for Yash and Roohi.
God bless you.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.550
And before you leave,

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.310
I would like to tell you
about one of your largest virtues,

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.740
whoever is seated here,
I want to tell you that

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.640
the position of a father is
on a very high pedastal.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.650
When God chooses us to be a father,

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.440
it’s a great honor bestowed on us.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.120
I know this, I have three children,
I am a father myself.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.880
You spoke of your father

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.760
but your position is even higher
than a father

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.530
because you are a father
who is also a mother.

00:08:25.555 --> 00:08:27.965
So we wish you all the best

00:08:27.985 --> 00:08:29.415
KJ: Thank you.

00:08:29.597 --> 00:08:31.257
SRK: And our love for Yash and Roohi.
