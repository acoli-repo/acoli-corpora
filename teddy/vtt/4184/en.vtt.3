00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.960
I thought to myself: What is it that
I can gift you that nobody else can?

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.250
The answer was clear,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.780
good upbringing, the right values,
entire heritage,

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.980
that entire treasure that I got
from your grandparents.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.950
If I hand that over to the two of you,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.450
there will be no other support
that you will need in the world.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.120
Nothing at all.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.820
Every parent has expectations
from their children,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.320
your grandparents had it from me,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.160
like I have some from the two of you.
