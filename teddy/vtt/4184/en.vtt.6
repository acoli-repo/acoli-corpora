00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.530
You know what was special
about your grandfather?

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.000
He never lectured me.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.660
Whatever I learned from him
was through his behavior.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.760
The biggest lesson I learned from him,
which still helps me,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.180
is the value of relationships.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.230
He always believed
that people make people.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.820
He spent a large part of his life
in making and nurturing relationships.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.530
What can be a greater moment of pride
for a son, than knowing

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.400
that his father still lives on
in these relationships, these memories?
