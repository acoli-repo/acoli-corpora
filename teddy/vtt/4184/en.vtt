Shah Rukh Khan: On TED Talks India Nayi Soch,
we now have a speaker

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.090
who just needs
a one line introduction:

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.020
he is all about loving his family.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.240
Yes, I am talking about filmmaker,
producer and media personality, Karan Johar.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.590
Because he is a dear friend of mine,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.110
I can vouch for the fact that loving your
family is not just a tagline for him.
