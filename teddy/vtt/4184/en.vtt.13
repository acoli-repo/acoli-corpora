00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.920
But what is your take on relationships?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.630
KJ: Relationships are complicated.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.410
Making them and then nurturing them.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.140
The ones you inherit,
like parents or siblings or children,

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.090
like mine have just come into my life.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.440
We don’t choose them,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.280
but nurturing them is not just our duty,
it’s our responsibility.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.220
It’s not easy, like you would know,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.440
you have a large family,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.950
there are three children,
there’s Gauri, your sister,

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.320
and then all of us.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.050
We have, in a sense, come to you as dowry!

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.280
What is important is nurturing
and giving time to relationships,
