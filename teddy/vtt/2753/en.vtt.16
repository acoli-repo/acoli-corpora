00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:02.655
So there's basic empathy:
you feel sad, it makes me sad.

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:04.616
I see you happy, it makes me happy.

00:08:05.192 --> 00:08:07.975
Then there's something
that I call sympathy,

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:09.859
a little more removed:

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:13.832
"I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother
has just passed away.

00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:17.483
I don't feel that same grief,
but I get it; I know what you feel

00:08:17.507 --> 00:08:18.920
and it concerns me."

00:08:18.944 --> 00:08:21.561
And then if we're motivated
to act on sympathy,

00:08:21.585 --> 00:08:23.391
I call that compassion.

00:08:24.061 --> 00:08:27.611
Far from being the thing
that makes us human,

00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:30.975
human empathy is far from perfect.
