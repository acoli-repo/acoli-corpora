00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:31.209
If your companions start to move quickly,

00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:33.468
you have to feel like
you need to hurry up.

00:07:33.492 --> 00:07:35.222
We're all in a hurry now.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:38.733
The oldest form of empathy
is contagious fear.

00:07:38.757 --> 00:07:41.603
If your companions suddenly
startle and fly away,

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.791
it does not work very well for you to say,

00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:46.718
"Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left."

00:07:46.742 --> 00:07:48.274
(Laughter)

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:54.975
Empathy is old, but empathy,
like everything else in life,

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:58.910
comes on a sliding scale
and has its elaboration.

00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:02.655
So there's basic empathy:
you feel sad, it makes me sad.
