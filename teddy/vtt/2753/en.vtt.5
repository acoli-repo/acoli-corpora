Octopuses use tools,
as well as do most apes

00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:38.215
and they recognize human faces.

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:43.592
How do we celebrate the ape-like
intelligence of this invertebrate?

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.446
Mostly boiled.

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.975
If a grouper chases a fish
into a crevice in the coral,

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:55.975
it will sometimes go to where it knows
a moray eel is sleeping

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.572
and it will signal
to the moray, "Follow me,"

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.137
and the moray will understand that signal.
