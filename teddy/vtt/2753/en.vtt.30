00:14:59.717 --> 00:15:01.881
And they couldn't figure out
what was going on

00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:03.405
until somebody came out on deck

00:15:03.429 --> 00:15:06.064
and announced that one
of the people onboard had died

00:15:06.088 --> 00:15:07.859
during a nap in his bunk.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.666
How could dolphins know
that one of the human hearts

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.159
had just stopped?

00:15:14.818 --> 00:15:17.108
Why would they care?

00:15:17.132 --> 00:15:19.325
And why would it spook them?

00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:26.410
These mysterious things just hint at
all of the things that are going on

00:15:26.434 --> 00:15:29.176
in the minds that are with us on Earth

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.431
that we almost never think about at all.
