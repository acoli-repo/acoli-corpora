00:11:56.275 --> 00:12:00.124
a fellow being, the most
magnificent creature on land.

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:05.316
Of course, we take much better care
of our wildlife in the United States.

00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:09.916
In Yellowstone National Park,
we killed every single wolf.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.389
We killed every single wolf
south of the Canadian border, actually.

00:12:13.413 --> 00:12:17.806
But in the park, park rangers
did that in the 1920s,

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.421
and then 60 years later
they had to bring them back,

00:12:20.445 --> 00:12:23.352
because the elk numbers
had gotten out of control.

00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:25.785
And then people came.

00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:29.533
People came by the thousands
to see the wolves,

00:12:29.557 --> 00:12:33.052
the most accessibly
visible wolves in the world.
