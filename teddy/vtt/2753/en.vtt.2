What are other beings
doing with those brains?

00:01:04.554 --> 00:01:06.907
What are they thinking and feeling?

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.203
Is there a way to know?

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:10.901
I think there is a way in.

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:12.615
I think there are several ways in.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.072
We can look at evolution,
we can look at their brains

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:19.576
and we can watch what they do.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:25.255
The first thing to remember is:
our brain is inherited.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:29.960
The first neurons came from jellyfish.
