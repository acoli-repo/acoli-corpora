Have you ever wondered
what animals think and feel?

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.904
Let's start with a question:

00:00:07.654 --> 00:00:11.773
Does my dog really love me,
or does she just want a treat?

00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:17.958
Well, it's easy to see
that our dog really loves us,

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:20.063
easy to see, right,

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:23.737
what's going on in that fuzzy little head.

00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:25.968
What is going on?

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:28.881
Something's going on.

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:34.263
But why is the question always
do they love us?
