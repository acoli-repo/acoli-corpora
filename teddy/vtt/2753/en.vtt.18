Well, I think that's silly,

00:09:00.568 --> 00:09:04.690
because attributing human thoughts
and emotions to other species

00:09:04.714 --> 00:09:08.965
is the best first guess about what
they're doing and how they're feeling,

00:09:08.989 --> 00:09:12.302
because their brains
are basically the same as ours.

00:09:12.326 --> 00:09:14.057
They have the same structures.

00:09:14.081 --> 00:09:19.131
The same hormones that create
mood and motivation in us

00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:21.413
are in those brains as well.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:28.120
It is not scientific to say that they
are hungry when they're hunting

00:09:28.144 --> 00:09:31.091
and they're tired when
their tongues are hanging out,
