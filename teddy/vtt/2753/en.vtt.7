00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.015
Sea otters use tools

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.016
and they take time away
from what they're doing

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.181
to show their babies what to do,
which is called teaching.

00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:39.883
Chimpanzees don't teach.

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:44.809
Killer whales teach
and killer whales share food.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.913
When evolution makes something new,

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:53.290
it uses the parts it has
in stock, off the shelf,

00:03:53.314 --> 00:03:55.776
before it fabricates a new twist.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.976
And our brain has come to us

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.401
through the enormity
of the deep sweep of time.
