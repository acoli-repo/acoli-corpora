This whale is T20.

00:14:02.488 --> 00:14:06.739
He had just finished tearing a seal
into three pieces with two companions.

00:14:07.168 --> 00:14:09.860
The seal weighed about as much
as the people in the boat.

00:14:09.884 --> 00:14:11.387
They had nothing to fear.

00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:13.611
They eat seals.

00:14:14.699 --> 00:14:16.385
Why don't they eat us?

00:14:18.823 --> 00:14:22.583
Why can we trust them around our toddlers?

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:30.390
