Why can't we wait for them to die?

00:11:35.998 --> 00:11:39.466
Elephants once ranged from the shores
of the Mediterranean Sea

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.565
all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope.

00:11:41.589 --> 00:11:44.975
In 1980, there were vast
strongholds of elephant range

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:47.187
in Central and Eastern Africa.

00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:51.548
And now their range is shattered
into little shards.

00:11:51.572 --> 00:11:56.251
This is the geography of an animal
that we are driving to extinction,

00:11:56.275 --> 00:12:00.124
a fellow being, the most
magnificent creature on land.
