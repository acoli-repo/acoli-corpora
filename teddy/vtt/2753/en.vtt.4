Well, it turns out that
if you give a crayfish

00:02:02.514 --> 00:02:05.171
a lot of little tiny electric shocks

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:07.491
every time it tries
to come out of its burrow,

00:02:07.515 --> 00:02:09.700
it will develop anxiety.

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:14.551
If you give the crayfish the same drug

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:17.498
used to treat anxiety disorder in humans,

00:02:17.522 --> 00:02:20.603
it relaxes and comes out and explores.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.395
How do we show how much
we care about crayfish anxiety?

00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:27.259
Mostly, we boil them.

00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:28.599
