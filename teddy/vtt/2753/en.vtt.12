00:05:58.248 --> 00:06:03.315
They have been watching us for much longer
than we have been watching them.

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:05.629
They know us better than we know them.

00:06:06.272 --> 00:06:09.120
We have the same imperatives:

00:06:09.144 --> 00:06:13.639
take care of our babies,
find food, try to stay alive.

00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:18.307
Whether we're outfitted for hiking
in the hills of Africa

00:06:18.331 --> 00:06:22.514
or outfitted for diving under the sea,
we are basically the same.

00:06:22.538 --> 00:06:24.516
We are kin under the skin.

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.402
The elephant has the same skeleton,

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:29.768
the killer whale has the same skeleton,

00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:31.028
as do we.
