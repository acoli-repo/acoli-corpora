[A provocation from Danny Hillis:]

00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:04.873
[It's time to start talking
about engineering our climate]

00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:08.366
What if there was a way
to build a thermostat

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.133
that allowed you to turn down
the temperature of the earth

00:00:11.157 --> 00:00:12.424
anytime you wanted?

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:18.085
Now, you would think if somebody
had a plausible idea about how to do that,

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.363
everybody would be very excited about it,

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.982
and there would be lots
of research on how to do it.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.958
But in fact, a lot of people
do understand how to do that.

00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:32.862
But there's not much support
for research in this area.
