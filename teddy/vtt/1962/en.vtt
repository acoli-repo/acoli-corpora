00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you really want to understand

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the problem that we're facing with the oceans,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you have to think about the biology

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
at the same time you think about the physics.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We can't solve the problems

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
unless we start studying the ocean

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in a very much more interdisciplinary way.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So I'm going to demonstrate that through

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We'll look at sea level rise.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We'll look at ocean warming.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And then the last thing on the list there, ocean acidification --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
if you were to ask me, you know, "What do you worry about the most?
