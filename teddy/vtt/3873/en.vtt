I'm a blogger, a filmmaker and a butcher,

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:07.068
and I'll explain how
these identities come together.

00:00:07.068 --> 00:00:08.764
It started four years ago,

00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:11.420
when a friend and I opened
our first Ramadan fast

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.045
at one of the busiest mosques
in New York City.

00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:17.943
Crowds of men with beards and skullcaps
were swarming the streets.

00:00:17.943 --> 00:00:21.548
It was an FBI agent's wet dream.
(Laughter)

00:00:21.548 --> 00:00:25.046
But being a part of this community,
we knew how welcoming this space was.

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:28.363
For years, I'd seen photos 
of this space being documented

00:00:28.363 --> 00:00:30.470
as a lifeless and cold monolith,
