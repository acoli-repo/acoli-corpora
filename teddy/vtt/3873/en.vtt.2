00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.795
What emerged was a beautiful
and complicated portrait of America.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:04.820
The media coverage
forced local journalists

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.557
to revisit their Muslim communities,

00:01:06.557 --> 00:01:10.177
but what was really exciting
was seeing people from around the world

00:01:10.177 --> 00:01:13.184
being inspired to take
their own 30-mosque journey.

00:01:13.184 --> 00:01:15.001
There were even these two NFL athletes

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.277
who took a sabbatical
from the league to do so.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:20.614

was blossoming around the world,

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:23.273
I was actually stuck in Pakistan
working on a film.

00:01:23.273 --> 00:01:26.894
My codirector, Omar, and I were at 
a breaking point with many of our friends

00:01:26.894 --> 00:01:28.559
on how to position the film.

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:30.646
The movie is called "These Birds Walk,"
