00:00:28.363 --> 00:00:30.470
as a lifeless and cold monolith,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.181
much like the stereotypical image
painted of the American Muslim experience.

00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:36.474
Frustrated by this myopic view,

00:00:36.474 --> 00:00:38.876
my friend and I had this crazy idea:

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:41.877
Let's break our fast
at a different mosque in a different state

00:00:41.877 --> 00:00:43.302
each night of Ramadan

00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:45.454
and share those stories on a blog.

00:00:45.454 --> 00:00:47.734
We called it "30 Mosques in 30 Days,"

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:49.540
and we drove to all the 50 states

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.905
and shared stories from over 100
vastly different Muslim communities,

00:00:52.905 --> 00:00:56.234
ranging from the Cambodian refugees
in the L.A. projects

00:00:56.234 --> 00:00:59.426
to the black Sufis living
in the woods of South Carolina.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.795
What emerged was a beautiful
and complicated portrait of America.
