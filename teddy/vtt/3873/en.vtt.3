The movie is called "These Birds Walk,"

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:32.406
and it is about wayward street kids

00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:35.242
who are struggling to find
some semblance of family.

00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:38.710
We focus on the complexities
of youth and family discord,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.495
but our friends kept on nudging us
to comment on drones and target killings

00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:45.304
to make the film "more relevant,"

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:48.810
essentially reducing these people
who have entrusted us with their stories

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.777
into sociopolitical symbols.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.553
Of course, we didn't listen to them,

00:01:52.553 --> 00:01:55.973
and instead, we championed
the tender gestures of love

00:01:55.973 --> 00:01:58.295
and headlong flashes of youth.

00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:01.374
The agenda behind our cinematic 
immersion was only empathy,
