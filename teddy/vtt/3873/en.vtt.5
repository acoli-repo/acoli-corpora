that is raised and slaughtered humanely
following very strict Islamic guidelines.

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:37.209
Unfortunately, the majority
of halal meat in America

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.151
doesn't rise to the standard
that my faith calls for.

00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:42.852
The more I learned
about these unethical practices,

00:02:42.852 --> 00:02:44.900
the more violated I felt,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.092
particularly because businesses
from my own community

00:02:48.092 --> 00:02:51.211
were the ones taking advantage
of my orthodoxy.

00:02:51.211 --> 00:02:55.225
So, with emotions running high,
and absolutely no experience in butchery,

00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:57.474
some friends and I opened a meat store

00:02:57.474 --> 00:03:00.034
in the heart of the
East Village fashion district.
