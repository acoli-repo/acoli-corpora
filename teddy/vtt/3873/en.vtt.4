00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:01.374
The agenda behind our cinematic 
immersion was only empathy,

00:02:01.374 --> 00:02:03.958
an emotion that's largely 
deficient from films

00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.233
that come from our region of the world.

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:11.453
And as "These Birds Walk" played at film 
festivals and theaters internationally,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.943
I finally had my feet
planted at home in New York,

00:02:13.943 --> 00:02:17.505
and with all the extra time
and still no real money,

00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:21.190
my wife tasked me to cook more for us.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.577
And whenever I'd go to the local butcher
to purchase some halal meat,

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:25.946
something felt off.

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:29.313
For those that don't know,
halal is a term used for meat

00:02:29.313 --> 00:02:33.855
that is raised and slaughtered humanely
following very strict Islamic guidelines.
