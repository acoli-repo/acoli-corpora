00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:11.924
As dawn broke over Paris 
on August 21st, 1911,

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:15.845
Vincenzo Peruggia hoisted a painting 
off the wall

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:19.265
and slipped down the back stairs 
of the Louvre.

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:23.186
He was close to freedom, 
the exit just before him

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:25.688
when he encountered a two-pronged problem:

00:00:25.897 --> 00:00:28.733
the door was locked 
and footsteps were approaching.

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:33.863
Tucked under Peruggia’s arm was
Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.”
