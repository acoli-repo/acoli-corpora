00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.381
I'm going to present
three projects in rapid fire.

00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:05.976
I don't have much time to do it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.334
And I want to reinforce three ideas
with that rapid-fire presentation.

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:12.334
The first is what I like to call
a hyper-rational process.

00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:16.255
It's a process that takes rationality
almost to an absurd level,

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.184
and it transcends all the baggage

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:20.852
that normally comes
with what people would call,

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:22.976
sort of a rational
conclusion to something.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.286
And it concludes in something
that you see here,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.091
that you actually wouldn't expect
as being the result of rationality.
