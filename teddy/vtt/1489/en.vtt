Liu Bolin: By making myself invisible,

00:00:06.278 --> 00:00:09.223
I try to question the inter-canceling relationship

00:00:09.223 --> 00:00:13.102
between our civilization and its development.

00:00:13.102 --> 00:00:15.278
Interpreter: By making myself invisible, I try to explore and question

00:00:15.278 --> 00:00:19.270
the contradictory and often inter-canceling relationship

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.622
between our civilization and its development.

00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:29.828
