00:01:29.303 --> 00:01:33.068
I'm using clamps and ropes
and all sorts of materials, weights,

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:36.040
in order to hold things 
in place before I varnish

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.600
so that I can push the form 
before I begin,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.242
so that something like this
can become a piece like this,

00:01:43.242 --> 00:01:46.130
which is just made
from a single dictionary.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.368
Or something like this
can become a piece like this.

00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:56.244
Or something like this,

00:01:56.244 --> 00:02:00.255
which who knows what that's going to be
or why that's in my studio,
