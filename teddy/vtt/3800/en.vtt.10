00:04:58.178 --> 00:05:01.381
and we are seeing things shifting
and things evolving.

00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:03.505
I think that the book will evolve,

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:06.767
and just like people said
painting would die

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:11.167
when photography and printmaking
became everyday materials,

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:13.154
but what it really allowed painting to do

00:05:13.154 --> 00:05:15.706
was it allowed painting
to quit its day job.

00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:22.021
It allowed painting to not have to have
that everyday chore of telling the story,

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:25.435
and painting became free
and was allowed to tell its own story,

00:05:25.435 --> 00:05:27.512
and that's when we saw Modernism emerge,

00:05:27.512 --> 00:05:29.754
and we saw painting
go into different branches.

00:05:29.754 --> 00:05:32.238
And I think that's what's
happening with books now,
