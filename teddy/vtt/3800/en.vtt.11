And I think that's what's
happening with books now,

00:05:32.238 --> 00:05:34.933
now that most of our technology,
most of our information,

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:39.127
most of our personal and cultural 
records are in digital form,

00:05:39.127 --> 00:05:42.079
I think it's really allowing the book
to become something new.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:44.869
So I think it's a very exciting time
for an artist like me,

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:48.439
and it's very exciting to see what
will happen with the book in the future.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.768
Thank you.

00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:53.576
