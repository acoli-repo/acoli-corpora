00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.933
and if I need to look up a word,
I'll go on the computer,

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:35.259
because I can go directly
and instantly to what I'm looking up.

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.209
I think that the book was never really

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:40.204
the right format
for nonlinear information,

00:04:40.204 --> 00:04:42.278
which is why we're seeing reference books

00:04:42.278 --> 00:04:46.153
becoming the first to be 
endangered or extinct.

00:04:49.743 --> 00:04:52.510
So I don't think that the book
will ever really die.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.806
People think that now that we have
digital technology,

00:04:56.806 --> 00:04:58.178
the book is going to die,

00:04:58.178 --> 00:05:01.381
and we are seeing things shifting
and things evolving.
