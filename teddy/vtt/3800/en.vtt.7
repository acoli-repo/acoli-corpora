We're sort of creating images
when we're reading text,

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.916
and when we're looking at an image,
we actually use language

00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:35.632
in order to understand
what we're looking at.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.861
So there's sort of
a yin-yang that happens,

00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:39.138
sort of a flip flop.

00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:44.677
So I'm creating a piece
that the viewer is completing themselves.

00:03:45.477 --> 00:03:48.960
And I think of my work
as almost an archaeology.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.979
I'm excavating and I'm trying
to maximize the potential

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.068
and discover as much as I possibly can

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:56.709
and exposing it within my own work.

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:59.896
But at the same time,

00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:01.870
I'm thinking about this idea of erasure,
