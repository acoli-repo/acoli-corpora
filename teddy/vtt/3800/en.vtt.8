00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:01.870
I'm thinking about this idea of erasure,

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.351
and what's happening now that most
of our information is intangible,

00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:09.393
and this idea of loss,

00:04:09.393 --> 00:04:13.711
and this idea that not only is the format
constantly shifting within computers,

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:16.033
but the information itself,

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:18.262
now that we don't have a physical backup,

00:04:18.262 --> 00:04:23.843
has to be constantly updated
in order to not lose it.

00:04:23.843 --> 00:04:26.623
And I have several dictionaries
in my own studio,

00:04:26.623 --> 00:04:29.140
and I do use a computer every day,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.933
and if I need to look up a word,
I'll go on the computer,
