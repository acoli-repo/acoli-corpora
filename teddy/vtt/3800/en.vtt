00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:02.610
I'm an artist and I cut books.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.316
This is one of my first book works.

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:06.340
It's called "Alternate
Route to Knowledge."

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.132
I wanted to create a stack of books so
that somebody could come into the gallery

00:00:10.132 --> 00:00:12.952
and think they're just looking
at a regular stack of books,

00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:16.441
but then as they got closer they would
see this rough hole carved into it,

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.417
and wonder what was happening,
wonder why,

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:20.453
and think about the material of the book.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.543
So I'm interested in the texture,

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:26.663
but I'm more interested in the text
and the images that we find within books.

00:00:27.623 --> 00:00:31.524
In most of my work, what I do is I seal
the edges of a book with a thick varnish
