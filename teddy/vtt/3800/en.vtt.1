00:00:27.623 --> 00:00:31.524
In most of my work, what I do is I seal
the edges of a book with a thick varnish

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:34.334
so it's creating sort of a skin
on the outside of the book

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:38.202
so it becomes a solid material,
but then the pages inside are still loose,

00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:40.352
and then I carve
into the surface of the book,

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:42.883
and I'm not moving or adding anything.

00:00:42.883 --> 00:00:45.762
I'm just carving around
whatever I find interesting.

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:48.223
So everything you see
within the finished piece

00:00:48.223 --> 00:00:50.996
is exactly where it was
in the book before I began.

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.014
I think of my work as sort of
a remix, in a way,

00:00:55.014 --> 00:00:57.345
because I'm working with
somebody else's material

00:00:57.345 --> 00:01:00.973
in the same way that a D.J. might be
working with somebody else's music.
