00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.966
And with the material itself,
I'm using sandpaper

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:04.658
and sanding the edges
so not only the images suggest landscape,

00:03:04.658 --> 00:03:07.366
but the material itself
suggests a landscape as well.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:12.889
So one of the things I do
is when I'm carving through the book,

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.570
I'm thinking about images,
but I'm also thinking about text,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.775
and I think about them
in a very similar way,

00:03:18.775 --> 00:03:21.647
because what's interesting
is that when we're reading text,

00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:23.146
when we're reading a book,

00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:24.615
it puts images in our head,

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:26.638
so we're sort of filling that piece.

00:03:26.638 --> 00:03:30.039
We're sort of creating images
when we're reading text,
