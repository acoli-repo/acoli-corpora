00:01:56.244 --> 00:02:00.255
which who knows what that's going to be
or why that's in my studio,

00:02:00.255 --> 00:02:04.274
will become a piece like this.

00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:08.685
So I think one of the reasons
people are disturbed by destroying books,

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:10.228
people don't want to rip books

00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:12.359
and nobody really wants
to throw away a book,

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.552
is that we think about books
as living things,

00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:16.223
we think about them as a body,

00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:19.313
and they're created
to relate to our body, as far as scale,

00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:21.741
but they also have the potential
to continue to grow

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:23.731
and to continue to become new things.

00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:26.458
So books really are alive.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:28.988
So I think of the book as a body,

00:02:28.988 --> 00:02:31.692
and I think of the book as a technology.
