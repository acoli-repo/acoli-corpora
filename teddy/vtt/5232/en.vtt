Right now, youâ€™re probably sitting down
to watch this video,

00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:14.371
and staying seated for a few minutes
to view it is probably okay.

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:18.121
But the longer you stay put,
the more agitated your body becomes.

00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:21.288
It sits there counting down the moments
until you stand up again

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.329
and take it for a walk.

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:25.204
That may sound ridiculous.

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:27.496
Our bodies love to sit, right?

00:00:27.538 --> 00:00:28.538
Not really.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.162
Sure, sitting for brief periods
can help us recover from stress
