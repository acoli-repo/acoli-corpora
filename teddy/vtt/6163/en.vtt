When I waltzed off to high school
with my new Nokia phone,

00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:07.684
I thought I just had
the new, coolest replacement

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:10.684
for my old pink princess walkie-talkie.

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:14.559
Except now, my friends and I
could text or talk to each other

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:15.851
wherever we were,

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:17.143
instead of pretending,

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:20.393
when we were running around
each other's backyards.

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:22.143
Now, I'll be honest.

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:26.434
Back then, I didn't think a lot
about how these devices were made.

00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:28.809
They tended to show up
on Christmas morning,

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:31.667
so maybe they were made
by the elves in Santa's workshop.
