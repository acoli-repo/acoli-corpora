00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So the problems of sustainability

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
cannot be separated from the nature of the cities,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
of which the buildings are a part.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
For example, if you take, and you make a comparison

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
between a recent kind of city,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
what I'll call, simplistically, a North American city --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The city goes out in annular rings,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
consuming more and more green space,
