00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
with the greater dependence on walking and cycling --

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
then a city which is really only twice as dense,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
is only using one-tenth of the energy.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
In other words, you take these comparable examples

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and the energy leap is enormous.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that as the density increases along the bottom there,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
that the energy consumed reduces dramatically.
