If I pull back from that global picture,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and I look at the implication over a similar period of time

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
is a tool for designers,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and I cite our own experience as a company,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects --

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
then how do you measure that change of technology?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
How does it affect the design of buildings?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And particularly, how can it lead
