00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And at that period it was --

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
in a way, a number of things were happening.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
again, a word that had not been coined.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.
