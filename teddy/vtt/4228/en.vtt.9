00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I select this one because it was 1973, and it was a master plan

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
for one of the Canary Islands.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And this probably coincided with the time

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
when you had the planet Earth's sourcebook,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and you had the hippie movement.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And there are some of those qualities in this drawing,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
which seeks to sum up the recommendations.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And all the components are there which are now

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
in common parlance, in our vocabulary,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
you know, 30-odd years later:

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells.
