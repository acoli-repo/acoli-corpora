00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
In other words, as I might seek to demonstrate,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
if you could achieve the impossible,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
the equivalent of perpetual motion,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
you could design a carbon-free house, for example.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
That would be the answer.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Unfortunately, it's not the answer.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It's only the beginning of the problem.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
You cannot separate the buildings out

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
from the infrastructure of cites

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and the mobility of transit.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and we look at planet Earth,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society,
