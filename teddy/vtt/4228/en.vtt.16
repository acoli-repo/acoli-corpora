00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
then the energy consumed would be split

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
But again, that only shows part of the picture.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
then 70 percent of the energy consumption

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.
