before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But what I never said, and what I'm really going to make the point is,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that really, green is cool.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in a way celebrating the places and the spaces

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
which determine the quality of life.
