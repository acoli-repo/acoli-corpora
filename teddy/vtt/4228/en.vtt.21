is not dense compared with the really dense cities.

In the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.

You had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And now, out of typically 46 cities,

33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
for example, China or India.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
If you take China, and you just take Beijing,
