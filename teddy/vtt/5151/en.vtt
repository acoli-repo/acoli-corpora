The minute she said it,

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.857
the temperature in my classroom dropped.

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:10.696
My students are usually
laser-focused on me,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.987
but they shifted in their seats
and looked away.

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:16.887
I'm a black woman

00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:21.013
who teaches the histories
of race and US slavery.

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:25.664
I'm aware that my social identity
is always on display.

00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:28.029
And my students are vulnerable too,

00:00:28.053 --> 00:00:29.203
so I'm careful.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.412
I try to anticipate
what part of my lesson might go wrong.
