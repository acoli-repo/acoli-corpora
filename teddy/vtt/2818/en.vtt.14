00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.480
coined what is my favorite phrase ever
in talking about all of this:

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.200
"Intimate justice."

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.776
That's the idea that sex has political,
as well as personal implications,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.456
just like, who does
the dishes in your house,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.080
or who vacuums the rug.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.496
And it raises similar
issues about inequality,

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.496
about economic disparity,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.736
violence,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.200
physical and mental health.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.576
Intimate justice asks us to consider

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.936
who is entitled
to engage in an experience.
