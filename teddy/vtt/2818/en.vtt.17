00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.576
ever conducted
on American sexual behavior,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.376
they reported pain
in their sexual encounters

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.280
30 percent of the time.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.360
They also used words like "depressing,"

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.696
"humiliating,"

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.920
"degrading."

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.520
The young men never used that language.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.816
So when young women
report sexual satisfaction levels

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.760
that are equal to
or greater than young men's --

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.680
and they do in research --

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.840
that can be deceptive.
