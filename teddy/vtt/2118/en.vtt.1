00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
these types of applications and possibilities

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
are going to stream rich data into your lives.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
are all about extending our current search metaphor.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
When you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
remembering URLs, saving favorites.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
As we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the Web matching, the index crawling.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But we want to use our brain!
