00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the Web matching, the index crawling.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But we want to use our brain!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We want to navigate, explore, discover information.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So Virtual Earth is about starting off

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.
