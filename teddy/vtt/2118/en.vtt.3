00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What we want to do is mix in all types of data.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
global perspective, local knowledge.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So when you think about this problem,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
from ground vehicles, from people.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This process is an engineering problem,
