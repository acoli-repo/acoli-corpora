WEBVTT

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
vantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We sit here -- you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
what do you see in person? We need to capture that up close

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to establish that what it's like-type experience.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So a little unknown secret is --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?
