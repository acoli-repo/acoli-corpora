What we're doing is -- people like this a lot,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
You can see all types of resolution. From here, I can slowly pan the image over.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I can get the next image. I can blend and transition.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact, I might be recording history.
