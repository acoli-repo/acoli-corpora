a highly automated pipeline creating these cities.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
We think about the user interface.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
An ortho-view, a nadir-view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
while maintaining the fluidity of the model?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I'll wrap up by showing you the --

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
this is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
What we're doing is -- people like this a lot,
