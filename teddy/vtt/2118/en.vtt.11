The freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
What we're trying to do is build a virtual world.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and really derive insights from you, from all different directions.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I thank you very much for your time.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
