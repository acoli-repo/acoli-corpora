This process is an engineering problem,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Here is an example of our aerial camera.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
In addition, it's multi-spectral.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We collect four gigabits per second of data,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints,
