00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
disaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
We made it all freely available on the Web, just to --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
When we think about how all this comes together,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
it's all about software, algorithms and math.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
we need to do geo-positioning. We need to do geo-registering of the images.
