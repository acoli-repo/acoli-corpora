00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
we need to do geo-positioning. We need to do geo-registering of the images.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Extract geometry from the images.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
This process is a very calculated process.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
In fact, it was always done manual.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
for a movie because they'd have to do it manually.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
We do this all through software, algorithms and math --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
a highly automated pipeline creating these cities.
