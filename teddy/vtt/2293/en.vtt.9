Farmers are facing challenges
of drought from Asia

00:04:31.474 --> 00:04:33.954
to Africa, from Australia to Oklahoma,

00:04:33.978 --> 00:04:36.321
while heat waves linked
with climate change

00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:38.722
have killed tens of thousands of people

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:44.954
in Western Europe in 2003,
and again in Russia in 2010.

00:04:44.978 --> 00:04:49.905
In Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0
percent of the population,

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:52.514

Oxfam and Swiss Re, together
with Rockefeller Foundation,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.882
are helping farmers like this
one build hillside terraces

00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:02.513
and find other ways to conserve water,
