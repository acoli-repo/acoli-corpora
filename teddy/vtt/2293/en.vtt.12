00:05:57.042 --> 00:06:00.330
in new green roofs installed,
and they're funding this in part

00:06:00.354 --> 00:06:03.784
thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags.

00:06:03.808 --> 00:06:06.570
They're splitting the cost
of installing these green roofs

00:06:06.594 --> 00:06:08.282
with home and building owners.

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:10.813
The roofs not only temper
urban heat island impact

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:13.170
but they save energy, and therefore money,

00:06:13.194 --> 00:06:15.323
the emissions that cause climate change,

00:06:15.347 --> 00:06:17.818
and they also reduce stormwater runoff.

00:06:17.842 --> 00:06:22.570
So some solutions to heat can
provide for win-win-wins.

00:06:22.594 --> 00:06:26.332
Third, adapting to rising seas.

00:06:26.356 --> 00:06:29.978
Sea level rise threatens coastal
ecosystems, agriculture,
