For those in vulnerable,

how do you put a dollar value
on losing your country

00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:38.328
where you ancestors are buried?
And where will your people go?

00:01:38.352 --> 00:01:40.459
And how will they cope in a foreign land?

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:42.536
Will there be tensions over immigration,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.032
or conflicts over competition
for limited resources?

00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:51.024

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:59.368

00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:02.392
That's the Russians planting
a flag on the ocean bottom
