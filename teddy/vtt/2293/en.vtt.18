00:08:59.883 --> 00:09:03.211
Why? Well, there are no experts.

00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:06.531
We're entering uncharted
territory, and yet

00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:10.427
our expertise and our systems
are based on the past.

00:09:10.451 --> 00:09:13.404
"Stationarity" is the notion
that we can anticipate the future

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:16.275
based on the past, and plan accordingly,

00:09:16.299 --> 00:09:18.728
and this principle governs
much of our engineering,

00:09:18.752 --> 00:09:21.777
our design of critical
infrastructure, city water systems,

00:09:21.801 --> 00:09:25.898
building codes, even water rights
and other legal precedents.

00:09:25.922 --> 00:09:29.027
But we can simply no longer
rely on established norms.

00:09:29.051 --> 00:09:33.387
We're operating outside the bounds
of CO2 concentrations
