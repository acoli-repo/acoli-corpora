That's the Russians planting
a flag on the ocean bottom

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:05.824
to stake a claim for minerals
under the receding Arctic sea ice.

00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:09.086
But while there might be
some short-term individual winners,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.624
our collective losses
will far outweigh them.

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:14.887
Look no further than the insurance
industry as they struggle

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:16.943
to cope with mounting catastrophic losses

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:19.369
from extreme weather events.

00:02:19.393 --> 00:02:22.224
The military gets it.
They call climate change

00:02:22.248 --> 00:02:25.465
a threat multiplier that could
harm stability and security,

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.354
while governments
around the world are evaluating

00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:30.401
how to respond.
