00:06:57.424 --> 00:07:00.302
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting

00:07:00.326 --> 00:07:03.656
this vital infrastructure with levees.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.585
But there might be some changes in store

00:07:05.609 --> 00:07:07.792
that you might not imagine. For example,

00:07:07.816 --> 00:07:10.353
planes require more runway for takeoff

00:07:10.377 --> 00:07:14.219
because the heated, less dense
air, provides for less lift.

00:07:14.243 --> 00:07:17.704
San Francisco is also
spending 40 million dollars

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:20.894
to rethink and redesign its
water and sewage treatment,

00:07:20.918 --> 00:07:24.224
as water outfall pipes like this
one can be flooded with seawater,

00:07:24.248 --> 00:07:27.193
causing backups at the plant,
harming the bacteria

00:07:27.217 --> 00:07:28.884
that are needed to treat the waste.

00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:31.004
So these outfall pipes
have been retrofitted
