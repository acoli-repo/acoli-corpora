did not have access to transportation,

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:03.449
others who did refused to leave

00:04:03.473 --> 00:04:07.271
often because available
transportation and shelters

00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:09.785
refused to allow them to take their pets.

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:14.805

in an evacuation or a rescue.

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.680
Fortunately in 2006, Congress passed

00:04:17.704 --> 00:04:21.154
the Pet Evacuation and Transportation
Standards Act (Laughter)

00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:25.692

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:28.577
Second, preparing for heat and drought.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.450
Farmers are facing challenges
of drought from Asia
