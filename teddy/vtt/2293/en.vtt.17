00:08:27.683 --> 00:08:30.819
and to storm surge, as you can
see from the subway flooding.

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:34.229
But back above ground, these
raised ventilation grates

00:08:34.253 --> 00:08:36.777
for the subway system show
that solutions can be both

00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:39.443
functional and attractive.
In fact, in New York,

00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:42.595
San Francisco and London,
designers have envisioned

00:08:42.619 --> 00:08:45.483
ways to better integrate
the natural and built environments

00:08:45.507 --> 00:08:47.891
with climate change in mind.

00:08:47.915 --> 00:08:50.795
I think these are inspiring
examples of what's possible

00:08:50.819 --> 00:08:53.962
when we feel empowered to plan
for a world that will be different.

00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:56.980
But now, a word of caution.

00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:59.859
Adaptation's too important
to be left to the experts.

00:08:59.883 --> 00:09:03.211
Why? Well, there are no experts.
