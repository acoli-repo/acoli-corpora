00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.423
such as wetlands or beaches?

00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:03.680
Other examples to consider. In the U.K.,

00:08:03.704 --> 00:08:07.134
the Thames Barrier protects
London from storm surge.

00:08:07.158 --> 00:08:09.680
The Asian Cities Climate
[Change] Resilience Network

00:08:09.704 --> 00:08:12.878
is restoring vital ecosystems
like forest mangroves.

00:08:12.902 --> 00:08:15.968
These are not only important
ecosystems in their own right,

00:08:15.992 --> 00:08:20.264
but they also serve as a buffer
to protect inland communities.

00:08:20.288 --> 00:08:23.976
New York City is incredibly
vulnerable to storms,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.659
as you can see from this clever
sign, and to sea level rise,

00:08:27.683 --> 00:08:30.819
and to storm surge, as you can
see from the subway flooding.
