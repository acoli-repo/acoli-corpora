00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:31.004
So these outfall pipes
have been retrofitted

00:07:31.028 --> 00:07:34.160
to shut seawater
off from entering the system.

00:07:34.184 --> 00:07:37.088
Beyond these technical solutions, our work

00:07:37.112 --> 00:07:38.856
at the Georgetown Climate
Center with communities

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.624
encourages them to look at what existing
legal and policy tools are available

00:07:42.648 --> 00:07:46.200
and to consider how they can
accommodate change.

00:07:46.224 --> 00:07:49.152
For example, in land use,
which areas do you want

00:07:49.176 --> 00:07:52.112
to protect, through adding
a seawall, for example,

00:07:52.136 --> 00:07:55.888
alter, by raising
buildings, or retreat from,

00:07:55.912 --> 00:07:58.696
to allow the migration
of important natural systems,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.423
such as wetlands or beaches?
