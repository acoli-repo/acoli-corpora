00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:31.695
But after the feeling 
of surprise, I felt shame.

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:34.822
How could I have been so blind?

00:01:34.822 --> 00:01:36.728
For an entire month,

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:39.816
I was so trapped in my mobile app

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:43.322
that a journey to work
became one thing only:

00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:45.783
the shortest path.

00:01:45.783 --> 00:01:48.876
In this single journey,
there was no thought

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:51.507
of enjoying the road,

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:53.459
no pleasure in connecting with nature,

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.166
no possibility of looking
people in the eyes.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.951
And why?

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:03.400
Because I was saving a minute
out of my commute.
