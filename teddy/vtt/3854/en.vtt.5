00:02:27.993 --> 00:02:30.904
However, the app also assumes

00:02:30.904 --> 00:02:36.308
there are only a handful
of directions to the destination.

00:02:36.308 --> 00:02:40.116
It has the power to make
those handful of directions

00:02:40.116 --> 00:02:45.015
the definitive direction
to that destination.

00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:47.685
After that experience, I changed.

00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:51.052
I changed my research
from traditional data-mining

00:02:51.052 --> 00:02:55.324
to understanding how people
experience the city.

00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:57.553
I used computer science tools

00:02:57.553 --> 00:03:02.996
to replicate social science
experiments at scale, at web scale.
