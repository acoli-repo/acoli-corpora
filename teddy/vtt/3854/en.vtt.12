00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:02.028
More generally, my research,

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:06.626
what it tries to do is avoid
the danger of the single path,

00:06:06.626 --> 00:06:11.827
to avoid robbing people of fully
experiencing the city in which they live.

00:06:11.827 --> 00:06:15.565
Walk the path through the park,
not through the car park,

00:06:15.565 --> 00:06:17.957
and you have an entirely different path.

00:06:17.957 --> 00:06:20.905
Walk the path full of people you love

00:06:20.905 --> 00:06:22.221
and not full of cars,

00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:23.939
and you have an entirely different path.

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.392
It's that simple.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:29.822
I would like to end with this thought:

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.842
do you remember "The Truman Show?"
