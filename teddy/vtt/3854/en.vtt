00:00:01.025 --> 00:00:05.433
I have a confession to make.

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:11.593
As a scientist and engineer,
I've focused on efficiency for many years.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:17.030
But efficiency can be a cult,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.230
and today I'd like to tell you
about a journey

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.055
that moved me out of the cult
and back to a far richer reality.

00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:33.739
A few years ago, after finishing my Ph.D. 
in London, I moved to Boston.
