do you remember "The Truman Show?"

00:06:31.842 --> 00:06:34.860
It's a media satire in which a real person

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.413
doesn't know he's living
in a fabricated world.

00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:43.567
Perhaps we live in a world
fabricated for efficiency.

00:06:43.567 --> 00:06:47.073
Look at some of your daily habits,

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:53.217
and as Truman did in the movie,
escape the fabricated world.

00:06:53.226 --> 00:06:54.736
Why?

00:06:54.736 --> 00:07:01.416
Well, if you think that adventure
is dangerous, try routine. It's deadly.
