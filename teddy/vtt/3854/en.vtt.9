Based on thousands of user votes,

00:04:30.104 --> 00:04:33.308
then we are able to see
where consensus emerges.

00:04:33.308 --> 00:04:36.513
We are able to see which

00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:39.276
that make people happy.

00:04:39.276 --> 00:04:42.225
After that work, I joined Yahoo Labs,

00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:45.104
and I teamed up with Luca and Rossano,

00:04:45.104 --> 00:04:48.380
and together, we aggregated
those winning locations in London

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.726

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:55.993
a cartography weighted for human emotions.

00:04:55.993 --> 00:04:59.825
On this cartography, you're not only

00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:04.677
from point A to point B 
the shortest segments,
