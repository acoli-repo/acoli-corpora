00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.495
that I was cycling every day
on the car-packed Mass. Ave.,

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:03.734
I took a different route one day.

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:08.795
I'm not entirely sure why I took
a different route that day, a detour.

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:13.184
I just remember a feeling of surprise;

00:01:13.184 --> 00:01:17.247
surprise at finding a street with no cars,

00:01:17.247 --> 00:01:21.078
as opposed to the nearby
Mass. Ave. full of cars;

00:01:21.078 --> 00:01:26.395
surprise at finding a street 
draped by leaves and surrounded by trees.

00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:31.695
But after the feeling 
of surprise, I felt shame.
