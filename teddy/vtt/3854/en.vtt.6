WEBVTT

00:02:57.553 --> 00:03:02.996
to replicate social science
experiments at scale, at web scale.

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:08.118
I became captivated
by the beauty and genius

00:03:08.118 --> 00:03:11.020
of traditional social science experiments

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.525
done by Jane Jacobs,
Stanley Milgram, Kevin Lynch.

00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:20.192
The result of that research
has been the creation of new maps,

00:03:20.192 --> 00:03:25.021
maps where you don't only find
the shortest path, the blue one,

00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:28.342
but also the most enjoyable path,

00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:30.060
the red one.
