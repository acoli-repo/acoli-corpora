00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.662
How was that possible?

00:03:33.662 --> 00:03:35.513
Einstein once said,

"Logic will get you from A to B.

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.771
Imagination will take you everywhere."

00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:43.689
So with a bit of imagination,

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.570
we needed to understand

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.935
which parts of the city
people find beautiful.

00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:52.582
At the University of Cambridge,
with colleagues,

00:03:52.582 --> 00:03:55.740
we thought about this simple experiment.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.898
If I were to show you
these two urban scenes,

00:03:58.898 --> 00:04:01.684
and I were to ask you
which one is more beautiful,
