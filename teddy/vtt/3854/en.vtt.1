A few years ago, after finishing my Ph.D. 
in London, I moved to Boston.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.381
I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge.

00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:40.576
I bought a racing bicycle that summer,

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:43.306
and I bicycled every day to work.

00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:45.692
To find my way, I used my phone.

00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:49.593
It sent me over Mass. Ave.,
Massachusetts Avenue,

00:00:49.593 --> 00:00:53.842
the shortest route from
Boston to Cambridge.

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:55.909
But after a month

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.495
that I was cycling every day
on the car-packed Mass. Ave.,
