00:04:01.684 --> 00:04:04.376

00:04:06.096 --> 00:04:09.161

Who says A? Who says B?

00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:14.013
Brilliant.

00:04:14.013 --> 00:04:15.987

00:04:15.987 --> 00:04:17.799
we built a crowdsourcing platform,

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.913
a web game.

00:04:18.913 --> 00:04:21.792
Players are shown pairs of urban scenes,

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:28.137
and they're asked to choose which one 
is more beautiful, quiet and happy.

00:04:28.154 --> 00:04:30.104
Based on thousands of user votes,
