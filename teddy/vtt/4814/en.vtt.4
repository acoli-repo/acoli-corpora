00:01:57.846 --> 00:02:00.664
Standardizing measurements
had political advantages

00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:03.045
for the Revolutionaries as well.

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:08.285
Nobles could no longer manipulate local
units to extract more rent from commoners,

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:12.046
while the government could collect
taxes more efficiently.

00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:15.617
And switching to a new Republican Calendar
with ten-day weeks

00:02:15.617 --> 00:02:20.065
reduced church power 
by eliminating Sundays.

00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:22.805
Adoption of this new system wasn't easy.

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:25.125
In fact, it was a bit of a mess.

00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:29.016
At first, people used new units
alongside old ones,

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:32.718
and the Republican Calendar 
was eventually abandoned.
