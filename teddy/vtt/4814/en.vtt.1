00:00:29.324 --> 00:00:31.936
So what's the connection to
the French Revolution?

00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:33.453
Let's explain.

00:00:33.453 --> 00:00:35.672
For the majority of recorded 
human history,

00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:40.493
units like the weight of a grain
or the length of a hand weren't exact

00:00:40.493 --> 00:00:42.693
and varied from place to place.

00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:45.682
And different regions didn't just use
varying measurements.

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:49.173
They had completely different 
number systems as well.

00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:52.304
By the late Middle Ages,
the Hindu-Arabic decimal system

00:00:52.304 --> 00:00:56.773
mostly replaced Roman numerals 
and fractions in Europe,

00:00:56.773 --> 00:01:01.592
but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins
to promote standard decimal-based measures
