00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:32.574
the Academy of Sciences convened
to reform the system of measurements.

00:01:32.574 --> 00:01:37.095
Old standards based on arbitrary authority
or local traditions

00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:41.343
were replaced with mathematical
and natural relationships.

00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:44.695
For example, the meter,
from the Greek word for measure,

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:49.853
was defined as 1/10,000,000
between the Equator and North Pole.

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:53.955
And the new metric system was,
in the words of the Marquis de Condorcet,

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:57.846
"For all people, for all time."

00:01:57.846 --> 00:02:00.664
Standardizing measurements
had political advantages
