00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.837
in an age of international trade.

00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:08.037
After Portugal and the Netherlands
switched to metric voluntarily,

00:03:08.037 --> 00:03:09.955
other nations followed,

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:14.328
with colonial empires spreading the system
around the world.

00:03:14.328 --> 00:03:15.818
As France's main rival,

00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:21.299
Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas
and retained its traditional units.

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.598
But over the next two centuries,
the British Empire slowly transitioned,

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:28.869
first approving the metric system
as an optional alternative

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.428
before gradually making it offical.
