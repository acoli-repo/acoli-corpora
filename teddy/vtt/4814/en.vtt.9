00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:31.429
are now being replaced with standards
based on universal constants,

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:33.914
like the speed of light.

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:37.520
Consistent measurements are such
an integral part of our daily lives

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.940
that it's hard to appreciate what a major
accomplishment for humanity they've been.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.879
And just as it arose 
from a political revolution,

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:50.231
the metric system remains crucial
for the scientific revolutions to come.
