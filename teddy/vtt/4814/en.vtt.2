00:00:56.773 --> 00:01:01.592
but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins
to promote standard decimal-based measures

00:01:01.592 --> 00:01:03.383
were less successful.

00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:06.683
With a quarter million different units
in France alone,

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:11.256
any widespread change would require
massive disruption.

00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:14.837
And in 1789, that disruption came.

00:01:14.837 --> 00:01:19.264
The leaders of the French Revolution
didn't just overthrow the monarchy.

00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:22.223
They sought to completely 
transform society

00:01:22.223 --> 00:01:25.703
according to the rational principles
of the Enlightenment.

00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:27.343
When the new government took power,

00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:32.574
the Academy of Sciences convened
to reform the system of measurements.
