00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:00.328
And ironically, some regard the once
revolutionary metric system

00:04:00.328 --> 00:04:03.509
as a symbol of global conformity.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:09.650
Nevertheless, the metric system is almost
universally used in science and medicine,

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.850
and it continues to evolve according
to its original principles.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.948
For a long time,

00:04:14.948 --> 00:04:19.509
standard units were actually defined by 
carefully maintained physical prototypes.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.608
But thanks to improving technology
and precision,

00:04:22.608 --> 00:04:26.899
these objects with limited access
and unreliable longevity

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:31.429
are now being replaced with standards
based on universal constants,
