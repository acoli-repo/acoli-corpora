00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:08.422
What does the French Revolution

00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:14.460
have to do with the time NASA accidentally
crashed a $200 million orbiter

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.452
into the surface of Mars?

00:00:17.452 --> 00:00:19.781
Actually, everything.

00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:21.622
That crash happened due to an error

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:24.657
in converting between 
two measurement systems,

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.163
U.S. customary units

00:00:26.163 --> 00:00:29.324
and their S.I, or metric, equivalence.

00:00:29.324 --> 00:00:31.936
So what's the connection to
the French Revolution?
