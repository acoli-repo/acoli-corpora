00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.456
with thousands of other parts,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.856
like the wings and the seats

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.776
and the little shades
over the little windows,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.200
all coming in to become
a part of a new airplane.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.680
Think about it.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.776
These new airplanes,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.376
before they even take their first flight,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.856
they have more stamps in their passports

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.120
than Angelina Jolie.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.256
Now, this approach to processing
goes on all around the world

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.776
to manufacture many of the products

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.336
we use every day,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.680
from skin cream to airplanes.
