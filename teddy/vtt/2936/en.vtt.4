and the Trans-Pacific Partnership,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.416
because these trade agreements
allow companies

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.680

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.856
and other countries
from where the jobs were taken.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.976
So it kind of feels like the exporters win

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and the importers lose.

output in the manufacturing
sector in the US
