Now, this may sound fine in a sound bite,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.160
but what it really is is protectionism.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.920
We heard a lot about this
during the 2016 presidential election.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.056
We heard about it
during the Brexit debates

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.400
and most recently
during the French elections.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.416
In fact, it's been
a really important topic

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.576
being talked about around the world,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.016
and many aspiring political leaders

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.600
are running on platforms
positioning protectionism as a good thing.
