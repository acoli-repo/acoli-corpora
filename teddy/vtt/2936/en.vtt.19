00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.016
So if a 30 percent increase in duties
were actually passed along,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.680
we would be looking at some
pretty important increases in prices.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.440
A Lincoln MKZ would go
from 37,000 dollars to 48,000.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.120
And the price of a Sharp 60-inch HDTV

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.016
would go from 898 dollars
to 1,167 dollars.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.176
And the price of a 16-ounce jar
of CVS skin moisturizer

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.640
would go from 13 dollars to 17 dollars.
