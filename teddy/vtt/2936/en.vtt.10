in Querétaro, Mexico,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.480

a completed tail assembly.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.816
It turns out the tail assemblies
are assembled from panels

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.336
that are manufactured in France,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.576
and they're assembled in Mexico

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.520
using components imported from the US.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.056
When those tail assemblies are done,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.536
they're exported via truck to Canada

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.736
to their primary assembly plant

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.016
where they come together

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.456
with thousands of other parts,
