00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.656
we would still only
be saving or protecting

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.576
one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.640
That's right, because remember,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.056
most of those jobs, 87 percent,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.760
were lost due to improvements
in our own productivity.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.680
And unfortunately,
those jobs, they're gone for good.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.720
So the real question is,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.856
does it make sense for us
to drive up prices

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.400
to the point where many of us can't afford
the basic goods we use every day

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.496
for the purpose of saving a job
