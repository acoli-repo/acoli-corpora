00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.576
When someone mentions Cuba,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.800
what do you think about?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.256
Classic, classic cars?

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.600
Perhaps good cigars?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.696
Maybe you think
of a famous baseball player.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.056
What about when somebody
mentions North Korea?

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.175
You think about those missile tests,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.096
maybe their notorious leader

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.120
or his good friend, Dennis Rodman.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.136
(Laughter)

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.496
One thing that likely doesn't come to mind

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.280
is a vision of a country,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.216
an open economy,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.759
whose citizens have access to a wide range
of affordable consumer products.
