Would you want your architect
to install your toilet?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.736
Of course not.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.600

to the corporate world.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.776
Companies today focus on manufacturing

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.136

and they trade for everything else.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.376
So this means they rely

on a global, interconnected,
interdependent network of manufacturers

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.656

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.736
In fact, that network is so interconnected

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.000
it's almost impossible
