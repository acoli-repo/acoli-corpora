Now, I could see why they think
protectionism is good,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.720
because sometimes
it seems like trade is unfair.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.056
Some have blamed trade

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.216
for some of the problems
we've been having here at home in the US.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.616
For years we've been hearing

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.840
about the loss of high-paying
US manufacturing jobs.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.136
Many think that manufacturing
is declining in the US

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.296
because companies are moving
their operations offshore

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.736
to markets with lower-cost labor

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.320
like China, Mexico and Vietnam.
