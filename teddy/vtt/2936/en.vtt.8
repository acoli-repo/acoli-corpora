00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.016
and it feels like
the manufacturing countries win

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.600
and the importing countries lose.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.040
Well, reality's a little bit different.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.976
I'm a supply chain professional,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.760
and I live and work in Mexico.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.776
And I work in the middle

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.976
of a highly connected network
of manufacturers

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.136
all collaborating from around the world

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.560
to produce many
of the products we use today.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.816
What I see

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.416
from my front-row seat in Mexico City

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.760
actually looks more like this.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.760
And this is a more accurate depiction
of what trade really looks like.
