But look, I get it:

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.856
if you just lost your job

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.536
and then you read in the newspaper

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.176
that your old company
just struck up a deal with China,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.656
it's easy to think you were just replaced

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.880
in a one-for-one deal.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.056

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.360

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.536
Manufacturers in one country

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.496
produce products and they export them

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.160
to consumers in other countries,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.016
and it feels like
the manufacturing countries win
