00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.416
an earth-moving company
to dig the foundation,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.320
a plumber, a carpenter and so on.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.856
So why doesn't the general contractor

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.496
pick just one company

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.736
to do all the work,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.960
like, say, the architect?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.800
Because this is silly.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.056
The general contractor selects experts

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.816
because it takes years

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.576
to learn and master

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.376
how to do each of the tasks it takes
to build a house or renovate a kitchen,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.680
some of them requiring special training.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.256
Think about it:

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.720
Would you want your architect
to install your toilet?
