00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.640
would go from 13 dollars to 17 dollars.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.616
Now, remember, this is only looking
at one strand of the production chain

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.016
between the US and Mexico,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.840
so multiply this out
across all of the strands.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.256
The impact could be considerable.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.936
Now, just think about this:

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.200
even if we were able
to dismantle this network

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.696
and produce products in just one country,

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.216
which by the way is easier said than done,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.656
we would still only
be saving or protecting
