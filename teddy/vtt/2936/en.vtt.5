output in the manufacturing
sector in the US

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.816
is actually growing,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.416
but we are losing jobs.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.680
We're losing lots of them.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.096
In fact, from 2000 to 2010,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.760
5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.120
But they're not being lost
for the reasons you might think.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.960

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.056

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.536
to Miguel Sanchez in Monterrey, Mexico.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.776
No.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.080
Mike lost his job to a machine.
