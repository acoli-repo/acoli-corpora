To create "Lotus,"
we carved over 6,000 figures.

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:07.192
And this later led to a commission
by the City of New York

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:09.470
to create a 28-foot version in steel

00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:12.936
as a permanent installation
at the Eagle Academy for Young Men,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.098
a school for black and latino students,

00:01:15.122 --> 00:01:17.795
the two groups most affected
by this history.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.795
The same two groups are very affected
by a more recent phenomenon,

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.442
but let me digress.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.007
I've been collecting
wooden African figures

00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:28.515
from tourist shops and flea markets
around the world.

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.621
The authenticity and origin
of them is completely debatable,
