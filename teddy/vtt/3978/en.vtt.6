00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.852
and finally in bronze
like the image you see here,

00:03:03.876 --> 00:03:05.980
which bears the marks
of its violent creation

00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:07.812
like battle wounds or scars.

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.591
When I showed this work recently in Miami,

00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:13.400
a woman told me she felt
every gun shot to her soul.

00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:16.015
But she also felt that these artworks

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:18.039
memorialized the victims of these killings

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:21.252
as well as other victims of
racial violence throughout US history.

00:03:21.812 --> 00:03:24.846
But "Lotus" and "BAM" are larger
than just US history.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.734
While showing in Berlin last year,

00:03:26.758 --> 00:03:30.319
a philosophy student asked me
what prompted these recent killings.
