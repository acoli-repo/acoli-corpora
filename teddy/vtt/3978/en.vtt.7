00:03:26.758 --> 00:03:30.319
a philosophy student asked me
what prompted these recent killings.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.961
I showed him a photo
of a lynching postcard

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:34.350
from the early 1900s

00:03:34.374 --> 00:03:39.446
and reminded him that these killings
have been going on for over 500 years.

00:03:39.922 --> 00:03:41.828
But it's only through questions like his

00:03:41.852 --> 00:03:44.694
and more thoughtful dialogue
about history and race

00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:47.296
can we evolve as individuals and society.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.542
I hope my artwork creates a safe space

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:52.978
for this type of honest exchange

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:55.741
and an opportunity for people
to engage one another

00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:58.653
in real and necessary conversation.

00:03:58.751 --> 00:03:59.901
Thank you.

00:03:59.925 --> 00:04:06.388
