As a conceptual artist,

00:00:02.394 --> 00:00:06.702
I'm constantly looking for creative ways
to spark challenging conversations.

00:00:06.726 --> 00:00:10.425
I do this though painting, sculpture,
video and performance.

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:11.888
But regardless of the format,

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:15.364
two of my favorite materials
are history and dialogue.

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:18.235
In 2007, I created "Lotus,"

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.033
a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter,

00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:23.612
600-pound glass depiction
of a lotus blossom.

00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:27.406
In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol
for transcendence

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.858
and for purity of mind and spirit.

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:32.303
But a closer look at this lotus
