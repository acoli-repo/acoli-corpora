00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:32.303
But a closer look at this lotus

00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:35.541
reveals each petal
to be the cross-section of a slave ship.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:39.660
This iconic diagram was taken
from a British slaving manual

00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:43.517
and later used by abolitionists to show
the atrocities of slavery.

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:46.509
In America, we don't like
to talk about slavery,

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.373
nor do we look at it as a global industry.

00:00:49.397 --> 00:00:51.025
But by using this Buddhist symbol,

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.652
I hope to universalize and transcend

00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:56.065
the history and trauma of black America

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.453
and encourage discussions
about our shared past.
