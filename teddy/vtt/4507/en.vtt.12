00:05:55.694 --> 00:06:00.497
This individual has made the choice
and is closing this water diversion,

00:06:00.521 --> 00:06:02.696
leaving the water in the stream.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.361
He doesn't lose the water right,

00:06:04.385 --> 00:06:09.154
he just chooses to apply that right,
or some portion of it,

00:06:09.178 --> 00:06:11.681
to the stream, instead of to the land.

00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:14.813
Because he's the senior
water-rights holder,

00:06:14.837 --> 00:06:17.976
he can protect the water
from other users in the stream.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.250
OK?

00:06:20.274 --> 00:06:22.976
He gets paid to leave
the water in the stream.

00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:27.311
This guy's measuring the water
that this leaves in the stream.

00:06:28.565 --> 00:06:31.051
We then take the measured water,
