After all, it is their water right,

00:05:33.178 --> 00:05:37.277
and if they want to use that water right
to help the fish grow in the stream,

00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:39.308
it's their right to do so.

00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:43.976
But they have no incentive to do so.

00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:50.076
So, working with local water trusts,
we created an incentive to do so.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.252
We pay them to leave
their water in stream.

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:55.670
That's what's happening here.

00:05:55.694 --> 00:06:00.497
This individual has made the choice
and is closing this water diversion,
