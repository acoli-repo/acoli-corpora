00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:30.328
they risk losing their water right --

00:02:31.073 --> 00:02:33.750
along with the economic value
that goes with it.

00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:36.436
So they have no incentive to conserve.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.682
So it's not just
about the number of people;

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:43.910
the system itself creates
a disincentive to conserve

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:47.031
because you can lose your water
right if you don't use it.

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.294
So after decades of lawsuits
and 140 years, now, of experience,

00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:54.000
we still have this.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:57.620
It's a broken system.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:59.644
There's a disincentive to conserve,

00:02:59.668 --> 00:03:03.259
because if you don't use your water right,
you can lose your water right.
