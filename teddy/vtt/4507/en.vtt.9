00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:32.446
and for some, there's a strong correlation
between fishing and beer.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.977
(Laughter)

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:37.512
So the Montana brewers
and their customers are concerned

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:40.302
and they're looking for some way
to address the problem.

00:04:40.326 --> 00:04:43.945
So how can they address
this remaining water footprint?

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:45.474
Remember Prickly Pear.

00:04:45.498 --> 00:04:49.677
Up until now, business water stewardship

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:52.976
has been limited
to measuring and reducing,

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:57.096
and we're suggesting
that the next step is to restore.

00:04:58.123 --> 00:04:59.295
Remember Prickly Pear.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.543
It's a broken system.
