00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:31.169
The reasons vary state to state,
but mostly in the details.

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:36.609
There are 4,000 miles
of dewatered streams in Montana alone.

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:40.745
They would ordinarily
support fish and other wildlife.

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:44.205
They're the veins of the ecosystem,

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.052
and they're often empty veins.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:51.211
I want to tell you the story
of just one of these streams,

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:54.675
because it's an archetype
for the larger story.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.439
This is Prickly Pear Creek.

00:00:56.463 --> 00:01:00.988
It runs through a populated area
from East Helena to Lake Helena.
