00:07:57.128 --> 00:08:01.797
We've returned more than four billion
gallons of water to degraded ecosystems.

00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:03.850
We've connected senior
water-rights holders

00:08:03.874 --> 00:08:05.322
with brewers in Montana,

00:08:05.346 --> 00:08:08.058
with hotels and tea companies in Oregon,

00:08:08.082 --> 00:08:11.687
and with high-tech companies
that use a lot of water in the Southwest.

00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:14.099
And when we make these connections,

00:08:14.123 --> 00:08:17.328
we can and we do turn this ...

00:08:17.963 --> 00:08:19.113
into this.

00:08:19.563 --> 00:08:20.933
(Applause)

00:08:20.957 --> 00:08:22.410
Thank you very much.

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:26.134
(Applause)
