00:07:26.475 --> 00:07:31.357
It's about giving folks
concerned about their water footprints

00:07:31.381 --> 00:07:35.208
a real opportunity to put water
where it's critically needed,

00:07:35.986 --> 00:07:38.484
into these degraded ecosystems,

00:07:38.508 --> 00:07:44.106
while at the same time providing farmers
a meaningful economic choice

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:46.172
about how their water is used.

00:07:46.196 --> 00:07:48.879
These transactions
create allies, not enemies.

00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:51.358
They connect people
rather than dividing them.

00:07:51.382 --> 00:07:55.096
And they provide needed economic
support for rural communities.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.104
And most importantly, it's working.

00:07:57.128 --> 00:08:01.797
We've returned more than four billion
gallons of water to degraded ecosystems.
