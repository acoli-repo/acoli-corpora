00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.543
It's a broken system.

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:02.610
You've got a disincentive to conserve,

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:06.379
because if you don't use your water right,
you risk losing your water right.

00:05:06.403 --> 00:05:08.790
Well, we decided to connect
these two worlds --

00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:12.135
the world of the companies
with their water footprints

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.766
and the world of the farmers

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.239
with their senior water rights
on these creeks.

00:05:16.263 --> 00:05:17.569
In some states,

00:05:18.324 --> 00:05:22.976
senior water rights holders
can leave their water in the stream

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.154
while legally protecting it from others,

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:29.709
and maintaining their water right.
