00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:00.349
Now the brewers in Montana

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:04.303
have already done a lot
to reduce their water consumption,

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.592
but they still use
millions of gallons of water.

00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:08.846
I mean, there's water in beer.

00:04:10.168 --> 00:04:16.475
So what can they do
about this remaining water footprint

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.735
that can have serious effects
on the ecosystem?

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.464
These ecosystems are really important

00:04:22.488 --> 00:04:24.526
to the Montana brewers
and their customers.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.195
After all, there's a strong correlation
between water and fishing,

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:32.446
and for some, there's a strong correlation
between fishing and beer.
