00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:03.853
This results in the pressure signature
known as the N-wave.

00:04:03.853 --> 00:04:05.483
What does this shape mean?

00:04:05.483 --> 00:04:09.506
Well, the sonic boom occurs
when there is a sudden change in pressure,

00:04:09.506 --> 00:04:11.918
and the N-wave involves two booms:

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.497
one for the initial pressure rise
at the aircraft's nose,

00:04:15.497 --> 00:04:18.349
and another for when the tail passes,

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.017
and the pressure suddenly
returns to normal.

00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:23.130
This causes a double boom,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.636
but it is usually heard as a single boom
by human ears.

00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:29.878
In practice, computer models
using these principles

00:04:29.878 --> 00:04:34.023
can often predict the location
and intensity of sonic booms
