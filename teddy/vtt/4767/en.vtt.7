00:03:27.888 --> 00:03:33.051
Only after the object has passed
will the observer hear the sonic boom.

00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:37.007
Where the Mach cone meets the ground,
it forms a hyperbola,

00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:41.306
leaving a trail known as the boom carpet
as it travels forward.

00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:46.253
This makes it possible to determine
the area affected by a sonic boom.

00:03:46.253 --> 00:03:49.303
What about figuring out how strong
a sonic boom will be?

00:03:49.303 --> 00:03:52.869
This involves solving the famous
Navier-Stokes equations

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:56.265
to find the variation
of pressure in the air

00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:59.516
due to the supersonic aircraft
flying through it.

00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:03.853
This results in the pressure signature
known as the N-wave.
