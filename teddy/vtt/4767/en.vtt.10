The gigantic Diplodocus may have been
capable of cracking its tail

00:05:00.998 --> 00:05:07.937
faster than sound, at over 1200 km/h,
possibly to deter predators.

00:05:07.937 --> 00:05:12.437
Some types of shrimp can also create
a similar shock wave underwater,

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:16.163
stunning or even killing pray
at a distance

00:05:16.163 --> 00:05:19.733
with just a snap of their oversized claw.

00:05:19.733 --> 00:05:22.203
So while we humans
have made great progress

00:05:22.203 --> 00:05:24.853
in our relentless pursuit of speed,

00:05:24.853 --> 00:05:27.413
it turns out that nature was there first.
