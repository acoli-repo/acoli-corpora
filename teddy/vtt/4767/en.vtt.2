00:00:55.521 --> 00:01:03.721
to fly the Bell X-1 aircraft at 1127 km/h,

00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:06.924
becoming the first person
to break the sound barrier

00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:09.720
and travel faster than the speed of sound.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.929
The Bell X-1 was the first of many
supersonic aircraft to follow,

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.913
with later designs reaching
speeds over Mach 3.

00:01:17.913 --> 00:01:21.573
Aircraft traveling at supersonic speed
create a shock wave

00:01:21.573 --> 00:01:25.682
with a thunder-like noise
known as a sonic boom,

00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:29.179
which can cause distress to people
and animals below

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.070
or even damage buildings.
