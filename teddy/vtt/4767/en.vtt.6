00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:02.756
they will remain nested within each other.

00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:07.771
It's when an object goes supersonic,
moving faster than the sound it makes,

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.597
that the picture changes dramatically.

00:03:10.597 --> 00:03:13.200
As it overtakes sound waves
it has emitted,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.702
while generating new ones from
its current position,

00:03:15.702 --> 00:03:19.820
the waves are forced together,
forming a Mach cone.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.808
No sound is heard
as it approaches an observer

00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:27.888
because the object is traveling faster
than the sound it produces.

00:03:27.888 --> 00:03:33.051
Only after the object has passed
will the observer hear the sonic boom.
