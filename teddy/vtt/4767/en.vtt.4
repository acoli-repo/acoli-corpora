00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.887
These circles that keep growing in radius
are called wave fronts.

00:02:02.887 --> 00:02:05.904
Similarly, even though we cannot see it,

00:02:05.904 --> 00:02:09.306
a stationary sound source,
like a home stereo,

00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:12.199
creates sound waves traveling outward.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.330
The speed of the waves depends on factors

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.110
like the altitude and temperature
of the air they move through.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.463
At sea level, sound travels
at about 1225 km/h.

00:02:24.463 --> 00:02:27.290
But instead of circles
on a two-dimensional surface,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.732
the wave fronts
are now concentric spheres,
