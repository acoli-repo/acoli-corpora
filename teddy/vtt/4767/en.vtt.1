00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:32.384
But as they did so, increased turbulence

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:37.688
and large forces on the plane
prevented them from accelerating further.

00:00:37.688 --> 00:00:41.647
Some tried to circumvent
the problem through risky dives,

00:00:41.647 --> 00:00:44.085
often with tragic results.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:47.550
Finally, in 1947, design improvements,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.302
such as a movable horizontal stabilizer,
the all-moving tail,

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:55.521
allowed an American military pilot
named Chuck Yeager

00:00:55.521 --> 00:01:03.721
to fly the Bell X-1 aircraft at 1127 km/h,
