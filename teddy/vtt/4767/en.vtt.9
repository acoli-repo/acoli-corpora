00:04:29.878 --> 00:04:34.023
can often predict the location
and intensity of sonic booms

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:37.626
for given atmospheric conditions
and flight trajectories,

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:40.738
and there is ongoing research
to mitigate their effects.

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:45.809
In the meantime, supersonic flight
over land remains prohibited.

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.572
So, are sonic booms a recent creation?

00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:50.088
Not exactly.

00:04:50.088 --> 00:04:52.516
While we try to find ways to silence them,

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:56.045
a few other animals have been
using sonic booms to their advantage.

00:04:56.045 --> 00:05:00.954
The gigantic Diplodocus may have been
capable of cracking its tail
