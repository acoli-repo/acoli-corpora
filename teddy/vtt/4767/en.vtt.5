00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.732
the wave fronts
are now concentric spheres,

00:02:30.732 --> 00:02:35.901
with the sound traveling along rays
perpendicular to these waves.

00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:40.076
Now imagine a moving sound source,
such as a train whistle.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:43.034
As the source keeps moving
in a certain direction,

00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:47.566
the successive waves in front of it
will become bunched closer together.

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:52.636
This greater wave frequency is the cause
of the famous Doppler effect,

00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:55.729
where approaching objects
sound higher pitched.

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:59.927
But as long as the source is moving
slower than the sound waves themselves,

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:02.756
they will remain nested within each other.
