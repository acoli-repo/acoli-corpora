00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.070
or even damage buildings.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.070
For this reason,

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:35.345
scientists around the world
have been looking at sonic booms,

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.788
trying to predict their path
in the atmosphere,

00:01:37.788 --> 00:01:42.191
where they will land,
and how loud they will be.

00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:45.310
To better understand
how scientists study sonic booms,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.298
let's start with some basics of sound.

00:01:48.298 --> 00:01:51.931
Imagine throwing a small stone
in a still pond.

00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:53.177
What do you see?

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:55.875
The stone causes waves
to travel in the water

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:58.670
at the same speed in every direction.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.887
These circles that keep growing in radius
are called wave fronts.
