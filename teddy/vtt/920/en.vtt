00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Many times

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I go around the world to speak,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and people ask me questions

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
about the challenges,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
my moments,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
some of my regrets.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
1998:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A single mother of four,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
three months after the birth of my fourth child,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I went to do a job

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
as a research assistant.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I went to Northern Liberia.
