00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I normally teach courses on

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
how to rebuild states after war.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But today I've got a personal story to share with you.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is a picture of my family,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
my four siblings -- my mom and I -- taken in 1977.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And we're actually Cambodians.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And this picture is taken in Vietnam.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in 1977?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well to explain that, I've got a short video clip

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to explain the Khmer Rouge regime

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
during 1975 and 1979.
