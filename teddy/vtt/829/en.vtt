00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, can we dare to be optimistic?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is that a billion people have been stuck living

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and hence diverging from the rest of mankind.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And so, the real question to pose is not, "Can we be optimistic?"

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's, "How can we give credible hope to that billion people?"

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That, to my mind, is the fundamental challenge now of development.
