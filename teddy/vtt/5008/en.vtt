Hello, I'm Chris Anderson,
welcome to The TED Interview,

00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:09.539
the podcast series

00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:11.567
where I get to sit down with a TED speaker

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:14.394
and dive much deeper into their ideas

00:00:14.418 --> 00:00:17.114
than was possible
during their short TED Talk.

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.468
Now, today on the show, Kai-Fu Lee

00:00:21.492 --> 00:00:26.388
and the epic race to develop
artificial intelligence, AI.

00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:31.777
Kai-Fu was 11 years old when he moved
to America from Taiwan
