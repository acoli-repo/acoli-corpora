00:00:57.177 --> 00:01:01.681
The painting’s monumental canvas is 
disorienting from the start,

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:06.625
rendered in the abstracted Cubist style 
Picasso pioneered.

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:10.852
Cubism deliberately emphasized the 
two-dimensionality of the canvas

00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:13.471
by flattening the objects being painted.

00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:15.483
This afforded viewers multiple

00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:19.308
and often impossible perspectives 
on the same object;

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:23.580
a technique considered shocking 
even in Picasso’s domestic scenes.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.131
But in this context,

00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:28.271
the style offers a profoundly 
overwhelming view

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:32.195
of violence, destruction, and casualties.
