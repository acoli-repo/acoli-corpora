or does the spike running through 
its body convey its victimhood?

00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:36.771
Does the white bull represent Spain,

00:03:36.771 --> 00:03:40.971
the country of matadors and a common 
theme in Picasso’s work–

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:45.362
or does it stand for the 
brutality of war?

00:03:45.362 --> 00:03:49.954
In this scene of strife, these animals 
raise more questions than answers.

00:03:49.954 --> 00:03:52.771
And additional elements hidden 
throughout the frame

00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:56.518
offer even more secrets for 
close observers.

00:03:56.518 --> 00:04:01.701
At the top of the canvas flashes a bird 
desperate to escape the carnage.
