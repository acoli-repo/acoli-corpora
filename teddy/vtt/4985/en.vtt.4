but he is unable to defend 
the woman and child.

00:02:00.462 --> 00:02:03.953
Instead his broken body lies in pieces,

00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:09.091
his arm clutching a splintered sword 
in a signal of utmost defeat.

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:14.423
The tip of his sword meets a woman’s foot 
as she attempts to flee the devastation.

00:02:14.423 --> 00:02:17.337
But her other leg appears 
rooted to the spot,

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:22.529
locked in the corner of the canvas 
even as she stretches to move it.

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.038
Another victim appears 
behind this slouching figure.

00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:29.711
Falling helplessly as flames 
lick around her,

00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:34.181
she too is caught in her 
own hopeless scene.
