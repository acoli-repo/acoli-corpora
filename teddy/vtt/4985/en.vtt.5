she too is caught in her 
own hopeless scene.

00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:38.383
Each of these figures bordering the 
painting are horribly trapped,

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:41.854
giving the work an acute 
sense of claustrophobia.

00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:46.608
And where you might expect the canvas’ 
massive size to counteract this feeling,

00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:52.714
its scale only highlights the nearly 
life-sized atrocities on display.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.133
Some possible relief comes from a lamp

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:58.818
held tightly by a ghostly woman 
reaching out her window.

00:02:58.818 --> 00:03:02.809
But is her lantern’s hopeful glow 
truly lighting the scene?
