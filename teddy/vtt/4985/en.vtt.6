00:02:58.818 --> 00:03:02.809
But is her lantern’s hopeful glow 
truly lighting the scene?

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:04.698
Or is it the jagged lightbulb–

00:03:04.698 --> 00:03:07.865
thought to represent the technologies 
of modern warfare–

00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:11.022
which illuminates her view of 
the chaos below?

00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:13.814
From the coffin-like confines
of her window,

00:03:13.814 --> 00:03:17.324
her arm guides the viewer back 
into the fray,

00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:20.344
to perhaps the most controversial
symbols of all–

00:03:20.344 --> 00:03:24.286
two ghostly animals caught 
in the destruction.

00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:29.106
Does the screaming horse embody the
threat of Franco’s military nationalism;

00:03:29.106 --> 00:03:33.645
or does the spike running through 
its body convey its victimhood?
