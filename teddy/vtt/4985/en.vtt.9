Decades after its creation,

00:04:30.244 --> 00:04:35.129
"Guernica" retains its power to shock 
viewers and ignite debate,

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:39.203
and is often referenced at anti-war 
gatherings around the world.

00:04:39.203 --> 00:04:44.540

its harsh imagery, shattering symbolism

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.340
and complex political messaging.

of it’s complicated subtext,

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:58.147
