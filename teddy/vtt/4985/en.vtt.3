00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:32.195
of violence, destruction, and casualties.

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:35.679
Multiple perspectives only compound
the horror on display–

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.787
sending the eyes hurtling around the 
frame in a futile hunt for peace.

00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:45.907
On the far left, a woman holding her 
dead child releases a scream;

00:01:45.907 --> 00:01:49.635
her eyes sliding down her face 
in the shape of tears

00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:54.573
and her head bending back unnaturally 
to echo her baby’s.

00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:57.671
There is the statue of a soldier 
present below,

00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:00.462
but he is unable to defend 
the woman and child.
