Here's a video about abstract mathematics.

00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:36.598
(Video) So you're me, and you're
in math class yet again,

00:13:36.622 --> 00:13:38.624
because they make you go every single day.

00:13:38.648 --> 00:13:41.915
And you're learning about, I don't know,
the sums of infinite series.

00:13:41.939 --> 00:13:43.565
That's a high school topic, right?

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:47.505
Which is odd, because it's a cool topic,
but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:50.687
So I guess that's why they allow
infinite series in the curriculum.

00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:53.863
So, in a quite understandable need
for distraction, you're doodling

00:13:53.887 --> 00:13:56.819
and thinking more about what
the plural of "series" should be

00:13:56.843 --> 00:14:00.485
than about the topic at hand: "serieses,"
"seriese," "seriesen," and "serii?"
