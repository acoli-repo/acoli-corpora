00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.428
you could have made 30 dollars,
so in some ways,

00:07:00.452 --> 00:07:03.372
you just paid thirty dollars
to play Super Mario Kart."

00:07:03.396 --> 00:07:05.654
And I was, like, "I'll take that deal."

00:07:05.678 --> 00:07:08.027
(Laughter)

00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:11.976
But I learned what opportunity cost is.

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:16.761
And along the way, the map
of my life got better.

00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:19.642
It got bigger; it contained more places.

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:21.631
There were more things that might happen,

00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:23.614
more futures I might have.

00:07:24.662 --> 00:07:27.949
It wasn't a formal, organized
learning process,

00:07:27.973 --> 00:07:29.704
and I'm happy to admit that.

00:07:29.728 --> 00:07:32.860
It was spotty, it was inconsistent,
there was a lot I didn't know.
