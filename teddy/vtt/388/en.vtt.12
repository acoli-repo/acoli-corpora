00:05:57.702 --> 00:06:01.025
and then wondering, "Maybe there's
some more land to draw."

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:03.256
And that's when learning
really began for me.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.916
It's true that I had teachers
that didn't give up on me,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.258
and I was very fortunate
to have those teachers,

00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:12.456
because I often gave them cause to think
there was no reason to invest in me.

00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:16.030
But a lot of the learning
that I did in high school

00:06:16.054 --> 00:06:19.233
wasn't about what happened
inside the classroom,

00:06:19.257 --> 00:06:21.715
it was about what happened
outside of the classroom.

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:23.096
For instance, I can tell you

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.953
that "There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons --

00:06:25.977 --> 00:06:28.430
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes --"

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:31.770
not because I memorized
Emily Dickinson in school
