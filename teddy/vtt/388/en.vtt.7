00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:32.968
So I was a really terrible student
when I was a kid.

00:03:32.992 --> 00:03:35.664
My GPA was consistently in the low 2s.

00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:39.296
And I think the reason that I was
such a terrible student

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.475
is that I felt like education
was just a series of hurdles

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.656
that had been erected before me,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.307
and I had to jump over
in order to achieve adulthood.

00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:50.815
And I didn't really want
to jump over these hurdles,

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.773
because they seemed completely
arbitrary, so I often wouldn't,

00:03:53.797 --> 00:03:55.874
and then people would
threaten me, you know,

00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:58.827
they'd threaten me with this
"going on [my] permanent record,"

00:03:58.851 --> 00:04:01.060
or "You'll never get a good job."
