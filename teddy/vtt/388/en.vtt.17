00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:30.109
I read many, many books
during this two-year period.

00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:31.896
I read books about Stalin,

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.411
and books about how the Uzbek people
came to identify as Muslims,

00:08:35.435 --> 00:08:37.785
and I read books about
how to make atomic bombs,

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.958
but it just felt like I was
creating my own hurdles,

00:08:40.982 --> 00:08:44.338
and then jumping over them myself,
instead of feeling the excitement

00:08:44.362 --> 00:08:48.011
of being part of a community of learners,
a community of people

00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:51.018
who are engaged together
in the cartographic enterprise

00:08:51.042 --> 00:08:54.598
of trying to better understand
and map the world around us.

00:08:54.979 --> 00:08:58.068
And then, in 2006, I met that guy.

00:08:58.092 --> 00:08:59.243
His name is Ze Frank.

00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:01.904
I didn't actually meet him,
just on the Internet.
