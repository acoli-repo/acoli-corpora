also shapes the map of our lives,

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:04.066
and that in turn shapes our lives.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.745
I believe that what we map
changes the life we lead.

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.183
And I don't mean that in some, like,
secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like,

00:03:13.207 --> 00:03:16.177
you-can-think-your-way-
out-of-cancer sense.

00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:22.734
But I do believe that while maps don't
show you where you will go in your life,

00:03:22.758 --> 00:03:24.749
they show you where you might go.

00:03:24.773 --> 00:03:29.246
You very rarely go to a place
that isn't on your personal map.

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:32.968
So I was a really terrible student
when I was a kid.
