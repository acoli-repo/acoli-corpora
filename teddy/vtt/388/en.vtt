This is a map of New York State

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:06.393
that was made in 1937
by the General Drafting Company.

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:09.914
It's an extremely famous map
among cartography nerds,

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:12.659
because down here at the bottom
of the Catskill Mountains,

00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:14.562
there is a little town called Roscoe --

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:17.284
actually, this will go easier
if I just put it up here --

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:20.838
There's Roscoe, and then right
above Roscoe is Rockland, New York,

00:00:20.862 --> 00:00:24.675
and then right above that
is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.758
Agloe, New York, is very famous
to cartographers,

00:00:27.782 --> 00:00:30.058
because it's a paper town.
