00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:31.837
These people -- in my, symbol-obsessed,
twelve year-old imagination --

00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:34.420
these people who are strangling themselves

00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:36.800
as one of the first things
they do each morning,

00:04:36.824 --> 00:04:38.584
they can't possibly be happy.

00:04:38.608 --> 00:04:41.020
Why would I want to jump
over all of these hurdles

00:04:41.044 --> 00:04:43.044
and have that be the end?

00:04:43.068 --> 00:04:44.235
That's a terrible end!

00:04:45.454 --> 00:04:48.632
And then, when I was in tenth grade,
I went to this school,

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:51.418
Indian Springs School,
a small boarding school,

00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:53.252
outside of Birmingham, Alabama.

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:56.791
And all at once I became a learner.

00:04:56.815 --> 00:04:59.011
And I became a learner,
because I found myself

00:04:59.035 --> 00:05:01.059
in a community of learners.
