JG: And lastly, here's Destin,
from "Smarter Every Day,"

00:14:31.015 --> 00:14:33.424
talking about the conservation
of angular momentum,

00:14:33.448 --> 00:14:34.925
and, since it's YouTube, cats:

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:38.060
(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin.
Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day."

00:14:38.084 --> 00:14:41.426
So you've probably observed that cats
almost always land on their feet.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.410
Today's question is: why?

00:14:43.434 --> 00:14:46.190
Like most simple questions,
there's a very complex answer.

00:14:46.214 --> 00:14:48.224
For instance, let me reword this question:

00:14:48.248 --> 00:14:53.443
How does a cat go from feet-up
to feet-down in a falling reference frame,

00:14:53.467 --> 00:14:56.432
without violating the conservation
of angular momentum?

00:14:56.456 --> 00:14:57.467
(Laughter)

00:14:57.491 --> 00:15:00.968
JG: So, here's something all four
of these videos have in common:
