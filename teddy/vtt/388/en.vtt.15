It was spotty, it was inconsistent,
there was a lot I didn't know.

00:07:32.884 --> 00:07:35.178
I might know, you know, Cantor's idea

00:07:35.202 --> 00:07:38.035
that some infinite sets are larger
than other infinite sets,

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:40.956
but I didn't really understand
the calculus behind that idea.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.995
I might know the idea of opportunity cost,

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:45.329
but I didn't know the law
of diminishing returns.

00:07:45.353 --> 00:07:48.326
But the great thing about imagining
learning as cartography,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.438
instead of imagining it
as arbitrary hurdles

00:07:50.462 --> 00:07:51.820
that you have to jump over,

00:07:51.844 --> 00:07:55.316
is that you see a bit of coastline,
and that makes you want to see more.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.777
And so now I do know
at least some of the calculus

00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:59.533
that underlies all of that stuff.

00:07:59.557 --> 00:08:01.327
So, I had one learning community
