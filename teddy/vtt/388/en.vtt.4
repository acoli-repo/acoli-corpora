00:01:55.596 --> 00:02:00.074
And this is of course a completely
irresistible metaphor to a novelist,

00:02:00.098 --> 00:02:04.709
because we would all like to believe
that the stuff that we write down on paper

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:07.525
can change the actual world
in which we're actually living,

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.938
which is why my third book
is called "Paper Towns".

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:14.501
But what interests me ultimately more
than the medium in which this happened,

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:16.906
is the phenomenon itself.

00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:21.598
It's easy enough to say that the world
shapes our maps of the world, right?

00:02:21.622 --> 00:02:26.049
Like the overall shape of the world
is obviously going to affect our maps.

00:02:26.503 --> 00:02:29.818
But what I find a lot more
interesting is the way

00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:33.383
that the manner in which we map
the world changes the world.
