Contrasted to the scorching desert
that surrounds this place,

00:09:30.209 --> 00:09:31.363
so are these people.

00:09:31.387 --> 00:09:35.318
Things from all over the world have been
rebuilt here, away from their histories,

00:09:35.342 --> 00:09:38.090
and away from the people
that experience them differently.

00:09:38.114 --> 00:09:41.294
Sometimes improvements were made --
even the Sphinx got a nose job.

00:09:41.318 --> 00:09:44.209
Here, there's no reason to feel
like you're missing anything.

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:47.203

as it does to everyone else.

00:09:47.227 --> 00:09:50.784
Everything is out of context, and that
means context allows for everything:

00:09:50.808 --> 00:09:52.738
Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.

00:09:52.762 --> 00:09:56.360
This fabrication of place could be one
of the world's greatest achievements,

00:09:56.384 --> 00:09:58.405
because no one belongs here;
everyone does.

00:09:58.429 --> 00:10:01.453
As I walked around this morning,
I noticed most of the buildings
