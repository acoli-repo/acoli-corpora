As I walked around this morning,
I noticed most of the buildings

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:04.217
were huge mirrors reflecting
the sun back into the desert.

00:10:04.241 --> 00:10:05.402
But unlike most mirrors,

00:10:05.426 --> 00:10:08.801
which present you with an outside view
of yourself embedded in a place,

00:10:08.825 --> 00:10:10.270
these mirrors come back empty.

00:10:10.294 --> 00:10:12.473
John Green: Makes me
nostalgic for the days

00:10:12.497 --> 00:10:14.679
when you could see
the pixels in online video.

00:10:14.703 --> 00:10:15.710
(Laughter)

00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:19.820
Ze isn't just a great public intellectual,
he's also a brilliant community builder,

00:10:19.844 --> 00:10:22.705
and the community of people
that built up around these videos

00:10:22.729 --> 00:10:24.741
was in many ways a community of learners.

00:10:24.765 --> 00:10:28.289
So we played Ze Frank at chess
collaboratively, and we beat him.

00:10:28.313 --> 00:10:32.726
We organized ourselves to take a young man
on a road trip across the United States.
