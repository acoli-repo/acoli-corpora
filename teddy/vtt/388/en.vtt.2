Ernest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.456
and they released this map in 1937.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.799
Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map

00:01:06.823 --> 00:01:10.847
with Agloe, New York, on it,
at the same exact intersection

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.139
of two dirt roads
in the middle of nowhere.

00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:17.466
Well, you can imagine the delight
over at General Drafting.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.702
They immediately call
Rand McNally, and they say,

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:24.320
"We've caught you!
We made Agloe, New York, up.

00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:26.398
It is a fake place. It's a paper town.

00:01:26.422 --> 00:01:28.123
We're going to sue your pants off!"

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:33.490
And Rand McNally says,
"No, no, no, no, Agloe is real."
