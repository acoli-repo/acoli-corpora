Nobody on my team could have predicted
this sort of response.

00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:32.867
We seem to have struck a nerve.

00:06:33.267 --> 00:06:38.773
Looking back, I am extremely grateful
for the positive response that I received,

00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:41.861
not only from academia, but also patients,

00:06:41.885 --> 00:06:45.817
and people around the world
affected by this terrible disease.

00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:51.903
As I reflect on this success
I've encountered with the Hasini effect,

00:06:51.927 --> 00:06:56.693
I keep coming back to the people
that I was fortunate enough to work with.

00:06:57.678 --> 00:06:59.314
The undergraduate students

00:06:59.338 --> 00:07:04.444
who demonstrated superhuman powers
through their hard work and dedication.
