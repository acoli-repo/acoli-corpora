00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.817
Of those, 90 percent will succumb
to the disease due to metastases.

00:00:34.554 --> 00:00:40.077
Metastasis is a spread of cancer
from a primary site to a distal site,

00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:43.220
through the circulatory
or the lymphatic system.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.649
For instance, a female patient
with breast cancer

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:51.807
doesn't succumb to the disease simply
because she has a mass on her breast.

00:00:52.228 --> 00:00:55.022
She succumbs to the disease
because it spreads

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:59.490
to the lungs, liver,
lymph nodes, brain, bone,

00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:02.712
where it becomes unresectable
or untreatable.
