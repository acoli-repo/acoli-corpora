00:02:26.537 --> 00:02:30.133
And I was tasked
to look at how cancer cells move

00:02:30.157 --> 00:02:32.815
in a 3D collagen I matrix

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.228
that recapsulated, in a dish,

00:02:35.252 --> 00:02:39.452
the conditions that cancer cells
are exposed to in our bodies.

00:02:40.117 --> 00:02:41.903
This was new and exciting for me,

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:46.950
because previous work had been done
on 2D, flat, plastic dishes

00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:49.529
that really weren't representative

00:02:49.553 --> 00:02:53.220
of what the cancer cells
are exposed to in our bodies.

00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:55.951
Because, let's face it,

00:02:55.975 --> 00:03:00.148
the cancer cells in our bodies
aren't stuck onto plastic dishes.
