I definitely needed help.

00:04:05.593 --> 00:04:08.815
So we recruited undergraduate
students, graduate students,

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:11.434
postdoctoral fellows and professors

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:15.347
from different institutions
and multiple disciplines

00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.485
to come together and work on this idea

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:25.238
After years of conducting

00:04:25.262 --> 00:04:28.794
and merging different ideas
and perspectives,

00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:32.141
we discovered a new signaling pathway
