00:02:55.975 --> 00:03:00.148
the cancer cells in our bodies
aren't stuck onto plastic dishes.

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:04.283
It was during this time
that I attended a seminar

00:03:04.307 --> 00:03:08.347
conducted by Dr Bonnie Bassler
from Princeton University,

00:03:08.371 --> 00:03:13.037
where she talked about how bacteria cells
communicate with each other,

00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:17.254
based on their population density,
and perform a specific action.

00:03:18.236 --> 00:03:23.185
It was at this moment that a light bulb
went off in my head, and I thought,

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.741
"Wow, I see this
in my cancer cells every day,

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:28.479
when it comes to their movement."

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:31.590
The idea for my project was thus born.
