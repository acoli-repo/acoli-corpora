that targets metastasis
not by targeting tumor growth,

00:06:08.609 --> 00:06:12.276
but by targeting the complex
mechanisms that govern it,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.447

of the Hasini effect.

This work was recently published
in "Nature Communications,"

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:26.539
and my team and I received an overwhelming
response from around the world.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.910
Nobody on my team could have predicted
this sort of response.
