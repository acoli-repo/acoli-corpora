We then decided that we wanted
to block this signaling pathway

00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:05.002
and see if we could slow down
the spread of cancer.

00:05:05.307 --> 00:05:07.978
Which we did, in preclinical
animal models.

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:12.529
We came up with a drug cocktail
consisting of tocilizumab,

00:05:12.553 --> 00:05:15.538
which is currently used to treat
rheumatoid arthritis,

00:05:15.562 --> 00:05:20.440
and reparixin, which is currently
in clinical trials against breast cancer.

00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:25.998
And interestingly, what we found
was that this cocktail of drugs

00:05:26.022 --> 00:05:28.600
really had no effect on tumor growth,

00:05:28.624 --> 00:05:31.227
but directly targeted metastases.
