00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:32.141
we discovered a new signaling pathway

00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:37.260
that controls how cancer cells
communicate with each other and move,

00:04:37.284 --> 00:04:39.150
based on their cell density.

00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:42.015
Some of you might have heard this,

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.387
because most of social media knows it
as the Hasini effect.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.229
(Laughter)

00:04:49.253 --> 00:04:55.434
(Applause)

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.970
And we weren't done yet.

00:04:57.994 --> 00:05:02.018
We then decided that we wanted
to block this signaling pathway
