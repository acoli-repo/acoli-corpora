00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:31.064
called Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-8.

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:34.910
Now, like anything else in nature,

00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:39.577
when things get a little too tight,
the signal is enhanced,

00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:44.117
causing the cancer cells
to move away faster from the primary site

00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:46.386
and spread to a new site.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.895
So, if we block this signal,
using a drug cocktail that we developed,

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:56.593
we can stop the communication
between cancer cells

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:59.299
and slow down the spread of cancer.
