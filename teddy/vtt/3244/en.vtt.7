00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:31.590
The idea for my project was thus born.

00:03:32.307 --> 00:03:37.299
I hypothesized that cancer cells
are able to communicate with each other

00:03:37.323 --> 00:03:39.513
and coordinate their movement,

00:03:39.537 --> 00:03:43.823
based on how closely packed they are
in the tumor microenvironment.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.743
I became obsessed with pursuing
this hypothesis.

00:03:49.243 --> 00:03:52.030
And fortunately, I work for someone

00:03:52.054 --> 00:03:54.934
who is open to running
with my crazy ideas.

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:58.124
So, I threw myself into this project.

00:03:58.665 --> 00:04:01.521
However, I couldn't do it by myself.
