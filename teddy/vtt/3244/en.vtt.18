00:08:56.033 --> 00:09:00.966
is the fact that I get to work
with a diverse group of people,

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:06.902
who make my work stronger,
better and just so much more fun.

00:09:07.694 --> 00:09:10.392
And because of this, I have to say

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:14.098
that collaboration is my favorite
superhuman power.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.391
And what I love about this power
is that it's not unique to me.

00:09:19.415 --> 00:09:21.049
It's within all of us.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.923
My work shows that even cancer cells

00:09:24.947 --> 00:09:29.248
use collaboration to invade our bodies
and spread their wrath.

00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:35.156
For us humans, it is a superpower
that has produced incredible discoveries
