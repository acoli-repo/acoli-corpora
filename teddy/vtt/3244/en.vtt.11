00:05:28.624 --> 00:05:31.227
but directly targeted metastases.

00:05:31.982 --> 00:05:34.760
This was a significant finding,

00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:39.053
because currently, there aren't any
FDA-approved therapeutics

00:05:39.077 --> 00:05:41.696
that directly target the spread of cancer.

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:45.636
In fact, the spread of cancer, metastasis,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.763
is thought of as a byproduct
of tumor growth.

00:05:49.168 --> 00:05:52.962
Where the idea is, if we can stop
the tumor from growing,

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:55.720
we can stop the tumor from spreading.

00:05:55.744 --> 00:05:59.870
However, most of us know
that this is not true.
