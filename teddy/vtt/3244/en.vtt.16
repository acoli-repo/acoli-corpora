We are engineering
new anticancer therapeutics,

00:08:01.847 --> 00:08:05.482
to limit toxicity and to reduce
drug resistance.

00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.260
And we are developing
groundbreaking systems

00:08:09.284 --> 00:08:13.534
that will help for the development
of better human clinical trials.

00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:18.879
It blows my mind to think that all this,

00:08:18.903 --> 00:08:21.658
the incredible work that I'm pursuing --

00:08:21.682 --> 00:08:24.833
and the fact that I'm standing here,
talking to you today --

00:08:24.857 --> 00:08:28.024
all came from this tiny idea

00:08:28.048 --> 00:08:31.008
that I had when I was sitting
at the back of a seminar
