where it becomes unresectable
or untreatable.

00:01:03.927 --> 00:01:06.776
Metastasis is a complicated process.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.426
One that I've studied
for several years now.

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:13.331
And something that my team
and I discovered recently

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:17.109
was that cancer cells are able
to communicate with each other

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.276
and coordinate their movement,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.022
based on how closely packed they are
in the tumor microenvironment.

00:01:24.887 --> 00:01:28.370
They communicate with each other
through two signaling molecules

00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:31.064
called Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-8.
