When we see something interesting,
it's often automatic.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.440
We just click and pass it along.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.240
But how can you
not be a part of fake news?

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.160
First, if it's too dramatic,
too emotional, too clickbait,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.160
then it's very likely that it isn't true.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.656
The truth is boring sometimes.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.056
(Laughter)

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.400
Manipulations are always sexy.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.120
They are designed to captivate you.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.776
Do your research.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.616
This is the second point, very simple.
