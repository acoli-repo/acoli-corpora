00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.056
A lot of people
stop believing anyone at all

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.816
and this is even more dangerous.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.776
They easily become prey
to populists in elections,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.680
or even take up arms.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.296
Fake news is not only bad for journalism.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.080
It's a threat for democracy and society.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.416
Four years ago, unmarked soldiers

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.216
entered the Crimean Peninsula,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.856
and at the same time,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.040
Russian media was going crazy
with fake news about Ukraine.
