Refugee Galina Pyshnyak told this story
to Russia's First TV channel.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.016
In fact, this incident never happened.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.136
I visited Sloviansk.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.496
There is no Lenin Square.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.976
In reality, Galina's husband was an active
pro-Russia militant in Donbass.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.176
This is just one of many examples.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.096
Ukraine has been suffering
from Russian propaganda and fake news

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.536
for four years now,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.936
but Russia is not
the only player in this space.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.016
Fake news is happening
all around the world.
