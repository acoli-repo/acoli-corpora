Now, compare that to what the Civil Rights

00:06:34.606 --> 00:06:40.743
to protest the racially segregated
bus system, which they wanted to boycott.

00:06:40.743 --> 00:06:42.495
They'd been preparing for many years

00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:44.561
and decided it was time
to swing into action

00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:46.764
after Rosa Parks was arrested.

00:06:46.764 --> 00:06:48.430
But how do you get the word out --

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.593
tomorrow we're going to
start the boycott --

00:06:50.593 --> 00:06:56.001
when you don't have Facebook,
texting, Twitter, none of that?

00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:01.171
So they had to mimeograph 52,000 leaflets
