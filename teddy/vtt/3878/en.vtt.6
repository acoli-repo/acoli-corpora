00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.454
Remember the Zapatistas,

00:03:00.454 --> 00:03:05.089
the peasant uprising
in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:10.720
led by the masked, pipe-smoking,
charismatic Subcomandante Marcos?

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.599
That was probably the first movement

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.970
that got global attention
thanks to the Internet.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.338
Or consider Seattle '99,

00:03:17.338 --> 00:03:22.141
when a multinational grassroots effort
brought global attention

00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:26.826
to what was then an obscure organization,
the World Trade Organization,

00:03:26.826 --> 00:03:31.367
by also utilizing these digital
technologies to help them organize.
