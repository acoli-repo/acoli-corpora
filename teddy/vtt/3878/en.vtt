00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:05.802
So recently, we heard a lot about
how social media helps empower protest,

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.181
and that's true,

00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:08.836
but after more than a decade

00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:12.501
of studying and participating
in multiple social movements,

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.303
I've come to realize

00:00:14.303 --> 00:00:17.614
that the way technology
empowers social movements

00:00:17.614 --> 00:00:20.720
can also paradoxically help weaken them.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.604
This is not inevitable,
but overcoming it requires diving deep

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:28.897
into what makes success possible
over the long term.

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:31.458
And the lessons apply in multiple domains.
