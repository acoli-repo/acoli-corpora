00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:01.874
34 Kurdish smugglers
near the border region,

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:06.618
and Turkish media completely
censored this news.

00:01:06.618 --> 00:01:08.456
Editors sat in their newsrooms

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:11.355
and waited for the government
to tell them what to do.

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:13.955
One frustrated journalist
could not take this anymore.

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:15.645
He purchased his own plane ticket,

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:17.957
and went to the village
where this had occurred.

00:01:17.957 --> 00:01:20.623
And he was confronted by this scene:

00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:26.021
a line of coffins coming down a hill,
relatives wailing.

00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:28.462
He later he told me
how overwhelmed he felt,

00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:30.183
and didn't know what to do,
