00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:30.907
but you don't necessarily see teeth that
can bite over the long term.

00:10:31.617 --> 00:10:35.710
And crucially, the Civil Rights Movement
innovated tactically

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:42.496
from boycotts to lunch counter sit-ins
to pickets to marches to freedom rides.

00:10:42.496 --> 00:10:46.311
Today's movements scale up very quickly
without the organizational base

00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:48.900
that can see them through the challenges.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.700
They feel a little like startups
that got very big

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.705
without knowing what to do next,

00:10:54.705 --> 00:10:57.362
and they rarely manage to shift tactically

00:10:57.362 --> 00:10:59.859
because they don't have
the depth of capacity

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:02.151
to weather such transitions.
