00:09:59.207 --> 00:10:03.649
you don't just see a march
and you don't just hear a powerful speech,

00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:09.122
you also see the painstaking,
long-term work that can put on that march.

00:10:09.122 --> 00:10:10.917
And if you're in power,

00:10:10.917 --> 00:10:15.216
you realize you have to take
the capacity signaled by that march,

00:10:15.218 --> 00:10:19.724
not just the march, but the capacity
signaled by that march, seriously.

00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:23.727
In contrast, when you look
at Occupy's global marches

00:10:23.727 --> 00:10:25.369
that were organized in two weeks,

00:10:25.369 --> 00:10:26.753
you see a lot of discontent,

00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:30.907
but you don't necessarily see teeth that
can bite over the long term.
