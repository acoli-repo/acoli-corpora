Now, I want to be clear:
The magic is not in the mimeograph.

00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:13.489
It's in that capacity to work together,
think together collectively,

00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:16.671
which can only be built
over time with a lot of work.

00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:18.747
To understand all this,

00:11:18.747 --> 00:11:22.571
I interviewed a top official
from the ruling party in Turkey,

00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:24.739
and I ask him, "How do you do it?"

00:11:24.739 --> 00:11:28.442
They too use digital technology
extensively, so that's not it.

00:11:28.442 --> 00:11:30.372
So what's the secret?
