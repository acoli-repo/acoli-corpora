00:12:31.997 --> 00:12:35.147
It's not the same game,
but the differences are instructive.

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:39.009
And like all such stories, this is not
a story just of technology.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:44.091
It's what technology allows us to do
converging with what we want to do.

00:12:44.091 --> 00:12:47.877
Today's social movements
want to operate informally.

00:12:47.877 --> 00:12:50.147
They do not want institutional leadership.

00:12:50.147 --> 00:12:55.013
They want to stay out of politics because
they fear corruption and cooptation.

00:12:55.013 --> 00:12:56.546
They have a point.

00:12:56.546 --> 00:12:59.961
Modern representative democracies
are being strangled in many countries

00:12:59.961 --> 00:13:01.604
by powerful interests.
