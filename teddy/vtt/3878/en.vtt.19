did not just take care of those tasks,

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:36.954
they also created the kind of organization
that could think together collectively

00:09:36.963 --> 00:09:39.238
and make hard decisions together,

00:09:39.238 --> 00:09:43.175
create consensus and innovate,
and maybe even more crucially,

00:09:43.175 --> 00:09:46.542
keep going together through differences.

00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:51.330
So when you see this
March on Washington in 1963,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.014
when you look at that picture,

00:09:53.014 --> 00:09:56.355

Martin Luther King gave his famous

00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:59.207
"I have a dream" speech, 1963,

00:09:59.207 --> 00:10:03.649
you don't just see a march
and you don't just hear a powerful speech,
