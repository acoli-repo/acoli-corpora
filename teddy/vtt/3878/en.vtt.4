00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.533
but it got a little ridiculous at times.

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.603
When things were so intense,

00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:06.998
when CNN International
was broadcasting live from Istanbul,

00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:13.348
CNN Turkey instead was broadcasting
a documentary on penguins.

00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:17.934
Now, I love penguin documentaries,
but that wasn't the news of the day.

00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:22.231
An angry viewer put his two screens
together and snapped that picture,

00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.098
and that one too went viral,

00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:28.586
and since then, people call Turkish media
the penguin media. (Laughter)

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:30.751
But this time, people knew what to do.
