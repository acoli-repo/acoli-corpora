00:08:24.173 --> 00:08:30.581
are we overlooking some of the benefits
of slow and sustained?

00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:32.450
To understand this,

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.573
I went back to Turkey
about a year after the Gezi protests

00:08:35.573 --> 00:08:37.850
and I interviewed a range of people,

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.557
from activists to politicians,

00:08:41.557 --> 00:08:46.174
from both the ruling party
and the opposition party and movements.

00:08:46.174 --> 00:08:49.480
I found that the Gezi protesters
were despairing.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.511
They were frustrated,

00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:54.567
and they had achieved much less
than what they had hoped for.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:57.105
This echoed what I'd been hearing
around the world

00:08:57.105 --> 00:09:00.891
from many other protesters
that I'm in touch with.
