very large operations,

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:36.530
during massive clashes
near Tahrir Square in 2011.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.217
And I asked the founder
of this effort, called Tahrir Supplies,

00:05:41.217 --> 00:05:47.327
how long it took him to go from when
he had the idea to when he got started.

00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:49.686
"Five minutes," he said. Five minutes.

00:05:49.686 --> 00:05:52.234
And he had no training
or background in logistics.

00:05:52.234 --> 00:05:55.957
Or think of the Occupy movement
which rocked the world in 2011.

00:05:55.957 --> 00:05:57.935
It started with a single email

00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:03.176
from a magazine, Adbusters,
to 90,000 subscribers in its list.
