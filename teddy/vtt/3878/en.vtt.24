With that many meetings every day,
with tea offered at every one of them,

00:12:00.384 --> 00:12:03.736
which he could not refuse,
because that would be rude,

00:12:03.736 --> 00:12:08.379
he could not take even one cube of sugar
per cup of tea,

00:12:08.379 --> 00:12:12.335
because that would be many kilos of sugar,
he can't even calculate how many kilos,

00:12:12.335 --> 00:12:15.979
and at that point I realized
why he was speaking so fast.

00:12:15.979 --> 00:12:19.230
We had met in the afternoon,
and he was already way over-caffeinated.

00:12:20.527 --> 00:12:25.000
But his party won two major elections

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.658
within a year of the Gezi protests
with comfortable margins.

00:12:28.658 --> 00:12:31.997
To be sure, governments have
different resources to bring to the table.
