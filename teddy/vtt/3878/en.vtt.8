Nowadays, a network of tweets
can unleash a global awareness campaign.

00:04:02.536 --> 00:04:06.454
A Facebook page can become the hub
of a massive mobilization.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.224
Amazing.

00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:12.538
But think of the moments I just mentioned.

00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:17.203
The achievements they were
able to have, their outcomes,

00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:22.013
are not really proportional
to the size and energy they inspired.

00:04:22.013 --> 00:04:26.034
The hopes they rightfully raised
are not really matched

00:04:26.034 --> 00:04:30.502
by what they were able to have
as a result in the end.
