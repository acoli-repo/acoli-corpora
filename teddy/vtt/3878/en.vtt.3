00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:30.183
and didn't know what to do,

00:01:30.183 --> 00:01:32.156
so he took out his phone,

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:33.924
like any one of us might,

00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:37.122
and snapped that picture
and tweeted it out.

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:40.849
And voila, that picture went viral

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:45.237
and broke the censorship
and forced mass media to cover it.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:48.418
So when, a year later,
Turkey's Gezi protests happened,

00:01:48.418 --> 00:01:51.140
it started as a protest
about a park being razed,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.443
but became an anti-authoritarian protest.

00:01:53.443 --> 00:01:57.601
It wasn't surprising
that media also censored it,

00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.533
but it got a little ridiculous at times.
