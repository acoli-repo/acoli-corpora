00:04:26.034 --> 00:04:30.502
by what they were able to have
as a result in the end.

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:32.914
And this raises a question:

00:04:34.204 --> 00:04:38.429
As digital technology makes things
easier for movements,

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:42.452
why haven't successful outcomes
become more likely as well?

00:04:42.452 --> 00:04:48.017
In embracing digital platforms
for activism and politics,

00:04:48.017 --> 00:04:52.251
are we overlooking some of the benefits
of doing things the hard way?

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:53.468
Now, I believe so.

00:04:53.468 --> 00:04:55.273
I believe that the rule of thumb is:

00:04:55.273 --> 00:05:00.000
Easier to mobilize does not always mean
easier to achieve gains.
