Al Gore: Thank you very much.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.543
Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Hi, Al.
Thank you so much for being here.

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:06.753
Just as I mentioned,

00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:09.297
you gave a rousing talk
at Climate Countdown last fall

00:00:09.338 --> 00:00:11.340
about all of the things that we need to do

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:14.844
to transform climate change
and to turn things around here.

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:19.515
What would you say is the state of play
with climate action now, six months later?

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.393
AG: Well, thanks in part
to many of the people

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:24.145
that are part of the TED community,

00:00:24.187 --> 00:00:28.441
we've seen tremendous progress
in the development of affordable,

00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:32.236
cheap, solar electricity,
wind electricity,
