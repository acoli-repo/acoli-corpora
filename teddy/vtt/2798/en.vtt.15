00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.630
if we pretend there are
just simple answers,

00:07:31.654 --> 00:07:34.618
we're leading everyone off a steep cliff.

00:07:35.324 --> 00:07:38.775
Understanding complexity
is the only way to know the real threats

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:40.132
that are around the corner.

00:07:40.156 --> 00:07:42.861
It's our responsibility
to translate those threats

00:07:42.885 --> 00:07:45.070
and to help you understand what's real,

00:07:45.094 --> 00:07:48.327
so you can be prepared and know
what it takes to be ready

00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:49.768
for what comes next.

00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:52.562
I am an industrious optimist.

00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:55.146
I do believe we can fix what's broken.

00:07:55.678 --> 00:07:56.861
We all want to.

00:07:56.885 --> 00:07:59.669
There are great journalists
out there doing great work --

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:01.206
we just need new formats.
