00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:32.074
we were missing what I call
the species-level issues,

00:01:32.098 --> 00:01:35.640
because as a species,
they could actually sink us.

00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:40.383
And by failing to understand
the complex issues of our time,

00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:43.741
we were facing certain
practical implications.

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:45.517
How were we going to solve problems

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:47.812
that we didn't fundamentally understand,

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:50.100
that we couldn't track in real time,

00:01:50.124 --> 00:01:52.438
and where the people working on the issues

00:01:52.462 --> 00:01:53.805
were invisible to us

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.394
and sometimes invisible to each other?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.624
When you look back on Iraq,

00:01:59.648 --> 00:02:03.077
those years when we
were missing the story,
