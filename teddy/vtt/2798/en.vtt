00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.142
Five years ago, I had my dream job.

00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:07.057
I was a foreign correspondent
in the Middle East

00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:09.221
reporting for ABC News.

00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:11.309
But there was a crack in the wall,

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.715
a problem with our industry,

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.728
that I felt we needed to fix.

00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:20.722
You see, I got to the Middle East
right around the end of 2007,

00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:23.003
which was just around the midpoint

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:24.727
of the Iraq War.

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:28.200
But by the time I got there,
it was already nearly impossible

00:00:28.224 --> 00:00:30.752
to find stories about Iraq on air.
