The third idea?

We need to embrace complexity

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.640

to get elbow deep in complexity

00:07:22.924 --> 00:07:26.961
and to find new ways to make it easier
for everyone else to understand.

00:07:27.627 --> 00:07:28.796
If we don't do that,

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.630
if we pretend there are
just simple answers,
