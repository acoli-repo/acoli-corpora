00:05:58.772 --> 00:06:00.678
But what we saw was a public

00:06:00.702 --> 00:06:04.319
that was flooded with hysterical
and sensational coverage,

00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:07.488
sometimes inaccurate,
sometimes completely wrong.

00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:12.140
Public health experts tell me
that that actually cost us in human lives,

00:06:12.164 --> 00:06:16.837
because by sparking more panic
and by sometimes getting the facts wrong,

00:06:16.861 --> 00:06:19.033
we made it harder for people to resolve

00:06:19.057 --> 00:06:21.127
what was actually happening on the ground.

00:06:21.151 --> 00:06:24.195
All that noise made it harder
to make the right decisions.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.237
We can do better as an industry,

00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:31.626
but it requires us recognizing
how we got it wrong last time,
