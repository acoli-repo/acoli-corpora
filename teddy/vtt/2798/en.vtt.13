00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:31.626
but it requires us recognizing
how we got it wrong last time,

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.489
and deciding not to go that way next time.

00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:36.237
It's a choice.

00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:40.559
We have to resist the temptation
to use fear for ratings.

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:43.490
And that decision has to be made
in the individual newsroom

00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:45.685
and with the individual news executive.

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:48.364
Because the next deadly virus
that comes around

00:06:48.388 --> 00:06:52.169
could be much worse
and the consequences much higher,

00:06:52.193 --> 00:06:54.128
if we do what we did last time;

00:06:54.152 --> 00:06:57.728
if our reporting isn't responsible
and it isn't right.

00:06:59.192 --> 00:07:00.743
The third idea?
