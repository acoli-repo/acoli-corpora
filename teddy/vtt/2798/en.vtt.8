00:04:00.263 --> 00:04:02.082
I know that that's true.

00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:07.395
You can call me an idealist;
I call myself an industrious optimist.

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.944
And I know there are
a lot of us out there.

00:04:09.968 --> 00:04:12.360
We have ideas for how
to make things better,

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:16.372
and I want to share three of them
that we've picked up in our own work.

00:04:16.848 --> 00:04:18.637
Idea number one:

00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:22.324
we need news that's built
on deep-domain knowledge.

00:04:22.348 --> 00:04:26.106
Given the waves and waves of layoffs
at newsrooms across the country,

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.408
we've lost the art of specialization.

00:04:28.432 --> 00:04:31.115
Beat reporting is an endangered thing.
