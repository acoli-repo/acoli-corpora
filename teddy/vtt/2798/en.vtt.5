If you were a Middle-East specialist,
you knew that Syria was that important

00:02:32.313 --> 00:02:33.558
from the start.

00:02:33.582 --> 00:02:35.122
But it ended up being, really,

00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:38.084
one of the forgotten stories
of the Arab Spring.

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:41.492
I saw the implications up front.

00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:45.611
Syria is intimately tied
to regional security,

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:47.582
to global stability.

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:49.495
I felt like we couldn't let that become

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.978
another one of the stories we left behind.

00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:58.281
So I left my big TV job to start
a website, called "Syria Deeply."

00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:01.055
It was designed to be a news
and information source
