00:04:28.432 --> 00:04:31.115
Beat reporting is an endangered thing.

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.386
When it comes to foreign news,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.571
the way we can fix that
is by working with more local journalists,

00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:38.976
treating them like our partners
and collaborators,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.843
not just fixers who fetch us
phone numbers and sound bites.

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:47.083
Our local reporters in Syria
and across Africa and across Asia

00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:51.094
bring us stories that we certainly
would not have found on our own.

00:04:51.118 --> 00:04:55.334
Like this one from the suburbs
of Damascus, about a wheelchair race

00:04:55.358 --> 00:04:57.831
that gave hope
to those wounded in the war.

00:04:58.243 --> 00:05:00.116
Or this one from Sierra Leone,
