WEBVTT

00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:01.055
It was designed to be a news
and information source

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.428
that made it easier to understand
a complex issue,

00:03:04.452 --> 00:03:06.821
and for the past four years,
it's been a resource

00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:11.444
for policymakers and professionals
working on the conflict in Syria.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.363
We built a business model

00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:16.642
based on consistent,
high-quality information,

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:19.677
and convening the top minds on the issue.

00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:23.247
And we found it was a model that scaled.

00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:27.051
We got passionate requests
to do other things "Deeply."

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:30.319
So we started to work our way
down the list.
