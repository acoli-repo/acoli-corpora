WEBVTT

00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:03.124
I am a repair geek.

00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:07.920
I grew up fixing things with my dad;
it was what we did.

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:12.133
We fixed our TV,
we fixed our refrigerator,

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:14.385
we fixed stuff that didn't need fixing.

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.555
We fixed our Volkswagen Beetle.

00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:19.015
In our home,

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:23.603
if something broke, we took it
as an opportunity to have fun.

00:00:24.228 --> 00:00:28.399
We loved the idea and the challenge
of bringing things back to life.

00:00:28.858 --> 00:00:31.402
And I still love that feeling,
