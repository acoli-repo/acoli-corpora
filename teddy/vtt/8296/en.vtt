00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:03.374
As a child growing up in Barbados,

00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:06.878
there were two things
I can count on every summer:

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:10.214
school break and the hurricane season.

00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:14.594
At some point, we would go
through this whole routine

00:00:14.594 --> 00:00:18.723
of duct-taping and all the glass doors
in these big X patterns,

00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:22.685
tightly boarding up all the windows,
except for one or two --

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:25.813
so that, as my mother
would curiously put it,

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:27.565
we could let the wind come through.

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.736
And putting buckets
in the living room to catch the rain
