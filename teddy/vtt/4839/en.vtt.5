This left a powder that could be mixed
into a drinkable solution

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:34.989
or recombined with the cocoa butter

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.209
to create the solid chocolate
we know today.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.202
Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier
named Daniel Peter

00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:44.701
added powdered milk to the mix,

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.790
thus inventing milk chocolate.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.389
By the 20th century, chocolate
was no longer an elite luxury

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.851
but had become a treat for the public.

00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:58.114
Meeting the massive demand required
more cultivation of cocoa,

00:02:58.114 --> 00:03:00.815
which can only grow near the equator.
