The fashionable drink was difficult
and time consuming to produce

00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:06.859
on a large scale.

That involved using plantations
and imported slave labor

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.509
in the Caribbean and 
on islands off the coast of Africa.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.179

forever in 1828

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:24.029

by Coenraad van Houten of Amsterdam.

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:28.531

the cocoa's natural fat, or cocoa butter.

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:32.516
This left a powder that could be mixed
into a drinkable solution
