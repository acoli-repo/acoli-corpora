If you can't imagine
life without chocolate,

00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:15.942
you're lucky you weren't born before
the 16th century.

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:19.450
Until then, chocolate only existed
in Mesoamerica

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.305
in a form quite different 
from what we know.

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:24.685
As far back as 1900 BCE,

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:27.805
the people of that region had learned
to prepare the beans

00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:30.716
of the native cacao tree.
