of the native cacao tree.

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:33.216
The earliest records tell us the beans
were ground

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:36.465
and mixed with cornmeal
and chili peppers

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:37.956
to create a drink -

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:40.096
not a relaxing cup of hot cocoa,

00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:44.736
but a bitter, invigorating concoction
frothing with foam.

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.976
And if you thought we make
a big deal about chocolate today,

00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:51.166
the Mesoamericans had us beat.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.596
They believed that cacao
was a heavenly food

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:57.016
gifted to humans
by a feathered serpent god,

00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:59.539
known to the Maya as Kukulkan

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.836
and to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl.
