being shipped

00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:06.021
to South American cocoa plantations,

00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:09.151
cocoa production itself would shift
to West Africa

00:03:09.151 --> 00:03:14.701
with Cote d'Ivoire providing two-fifths
of the world's cocoa as of 2015.

00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:16.744
Yet along with the growth
of the industry,

00:03:16.744 --> 00:03:19.977
there have been horrific abuses
of human rights.

00:03:19.977 --> 00:03:22.230

West Africa,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.260
which supply Western companies,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.731
use slave and child labor,

00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:31.942
with an estimation of more than
2 million children affected.
