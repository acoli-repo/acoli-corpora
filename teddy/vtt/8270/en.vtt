In the coming years, 
artificial intelligence

00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:12.508
is probably going to change your life, 
and likely the entire world.

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:15.720
But people have a hard time
agreeing on exactly how.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.931
The following are excerpts 
from a World Economic Forum interview

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:22.727
where renowned computer science professor 
and AI expert Stuart Russell

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:25.313
helps separate the sense 
from the nonsense.

00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:29.067
Thereâ€™s a big difference between asking
a human to do something

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:32.528
and giving that as the objective
to an AI system.
