00:13:57.735 --> 00:14:00.378
by donating prosthetics
to war-torn African countries.

00:14:02.726 --> 00:14:05.031
And this is our take
on a used car dealership ad.

00:14:05.055 --> 00:14:07.545
They're now offering
a "cash for polluters" program.

00:14:07.569 --> 00:14:09.587
So now you can trade in your car

00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:13.153
for a non-polluting
type of transportation:

00:14:13.177 --> 00:14:14.502
a bicycle!

00:14:14.526 --> 00:14:16.374
(Laughter)

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.707
And here's my favorite, Dr. Zizmor,

00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:21.896
who is giving you
a beautiful, clear conscience.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.619
If you haven't taken a ride
on the New York City subway,

00:14:24.643 --> 00:14:26.149
you may not know Dr. Z.

00:14:26.173 --> 00:14:28.020
But if you have, then you do,

00:14:28.044 --> 00:14:31.467
because his cheesy rainbow ads
are everywhere.
