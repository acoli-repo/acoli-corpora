Specifically: What if some crazy person
had meticulously recreated a typical paper

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:04.383
depicting an alternate reality?

00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:09.543
This is something we actually did do
in the fall of 2008,

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.426
in a project that was conceptualized
by artist Steve Lambert,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.825
organized by The Yes Men

00:10:13.849 --> 00:10:17.904
and executed by many, many people,
some of whom are me.

00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:21.653
We made a perfectly counterfeited
"New York Times."

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.846
We didn't ask anyone
for permission, we just did it.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.914
(Laughter)

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:27.159
We had it mass-produced,

00:10:27.183 --> 00:10:30.285
and we put it in the hands of hundreds
of thousands of commuters
