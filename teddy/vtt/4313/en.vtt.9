00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:31.657
paper never forgets how it was bent.

00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:33.649
I was able to use that material memory

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:36.489
to guide the recipient
through the experience of the card.

00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:38.139
So when you first pick it up,

00:04:38.163 --> 00:04:41.827
while floppy, it's clear it wants
to bend in all of these certain ways.

00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:43.546
As people tinker with it,

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.500
they discover that bending the card
brings them through this simple story.

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.864
And as you can see,
it's a story about itself.

00:04:51.888 --> 00:04:55.023
(Laughter)

00:04:55.047 --> 00:04:58.836
This card is literally
a four-frame documentary

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.691
about receiving the card.
