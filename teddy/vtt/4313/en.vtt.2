a solar-powered Popsicle truck.

00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:08.011
(Laughter)

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:10.375
It educates the public
about renewable energy.

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.260
It's basically a physical
infographic on wheels.

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:17.800
And this unexpected pairing
of sugar, bright colors

00:01:17.824 --> 00:01:21.282
and the threat of humanity's
self-inflicted demise

00:01:21.306 --> 00:01:24.325

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:30.102
People arrive at experiences
like these with expectations.
