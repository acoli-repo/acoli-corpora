00:05:58.534 --> 00:06:02.442
it takes a hell of a lot of intervention
into getting us to see it as new again.

00:06:03.313 --> 00:06:06.802
This next project I want to show you
is a wedding invitation,

00:06:06.826 --> 00:06:09.977
which is a format
practically begging for reinvention.

00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:11.703
(Laughter)

00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:14.246
This is a card I made
for my friends Mike and Karen,

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.397
who happen to be really awesome people.

00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:20.281
Far more awesome, in fact,
than the format of wedding invitations.

00:06:20.305 --> 00:06:23.636
So it was a really good excuse
to push the boundaries of this format.

00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:26.268
And as far as how to push it,

00:06:26.292 --> 00:06:28.638
the facts of our shared
history made it clear

00:06:28.662 --> 00:06:30.653
that this card should be about music.
