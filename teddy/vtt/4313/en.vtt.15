00:07:29.284 --> 00:07:31.863
because I'm the one
who had to actually make it work.

00:07:31.887 --> 00:07:35.782
So I began spending an inordinate amount
of time thinking about needles:

00:07:35.806 --> 00:07:38.445
Like, would we find needles
with the right fidelity?

00:07:39.047 --> 00:07:40.698
I started calling paper suppliers,

00:07:40.722 --> 00:07:43.214
looking for the paper
with the best audio properties.

00:07:43.238 --> 00:07:44.427
(Laughter)

00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:46.107
And they thought I was crazy.

00:07:48.504 --> 00:07:50.869
Meanwhile, Mike and Karen
were recording a song,

00:07:50.893 --> 00:07:53.257
which they had mastered
to a clear flexi disc.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.398
I had this black-and-white
character printed on it,

00:07:56.422 --> 00:07:58.281
so that way, when the disc is turned,

00:07:58.305 --> 00:08:01.239
it completes the couple
in all of these different guises.
