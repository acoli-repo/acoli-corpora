00:10:27.183 --> 00:10:30.285
and we put it in the hands of hundreds
of thousands of commuters

00:10:30.309 --> 00:10:32.481
on a Thursday morning in New York City.

00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:33.716
(Laughter)

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.468
(Applause and cheers)

00:10:36.492 --> 00:10:37.643
Thanks!

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:39.178
(Applause)

00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:43.017
"Why?," you might ask.

00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:45.557
"Why make a fake newspaper?"

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:51.356
Well, quite frankly, because the real
newspaper is depressing.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.215
We ostensibly live in a democracy

00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:56.041
where we should have some say
in what happens in the world.

00:10:56.065 --> 00:10:59.640
But the truth is, we never see the stories
we want to see in the newspaper.
