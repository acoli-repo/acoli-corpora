Or small things can come out of left field

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:05.179
and draw us into reassessing
our complacent expectations about reality.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.419
This doesn't happen often,
but when it does, it's awesome.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.609
Because then, these small things act
as sort of a humble back door

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.110
into understanding a reality
that's infinitely surprising.

00:02:19.383 --> 00:02:21.057
So, as a little demonstration,

00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:24.119
back to the most basic
and fundamental part of myself again:

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:27.697
my name, kellianderson.com,
spelled out in block letters.

00:02:28.207 --> 00:02:30.150
This is how people find me in the world.
