My goal in this was
to get people to notice

00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:19.181
this going-through-the-motions holiday
thing that I'm sure we've all felt before.

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:22.088

00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:25.808

But paper has this memory;

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:31.657
paper never forgets how it was bent.
