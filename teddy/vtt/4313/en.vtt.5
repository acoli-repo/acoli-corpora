00:02:28.207 --> 00:02:30.150
This is how people find me in the world.

00:02:30.174 --> 00:02:31.346
It means me.

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.793
But in a more objective sense,

00:02:33.817 --> 00:02:36.000
it's really just this random
jumble of letters

00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:39.320
that I've confined to
the single possibility of making my name.

00:02:39.918 --> 00:02:42.931
So naturally, I wondered:
What else can these letters spell?

00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:47.228
Turns out, all kinds
of interesting phrases, like ...

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:52.465
"Ken doll is near dot com."

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.994
(Laughter)

00:02:54.853 --> 00:02:56.639
A little bit creepy.

00:02:58.474 --> 00:03:00.607
And "A colder melon skin."
