00:08:57.405 --> 00:09:01.324
I also love that project
because it brings attention to the fact

00:09:01.348 --> 00:09:04.092
that we approach media
with all these expectations

00:09:04.116 --> 00:09:06.278
that we do not necessarily need.

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:10.017
We have assumptions
about material experience,

00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:13.335
like that paper should be silent
or that websites should be flat.

00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:16.096
But we also have these assumptions --

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.374
(Laughter)

00:09:17.398 --> 00:09:20.134
that should be a lot scarier
in a democracy,

00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:22.677
because they're like
these little thought loopholes.

00:09:22.701 --> 00:09:25.809
We sleepwalk through our assumptions
about the authority in media

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:30.822
and assumptions put forth about political
realities by media, like newspapers.
