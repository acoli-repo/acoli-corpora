00:03:37.823 --> 00:03:41.432
What I'm after in my work,

00:03:41.456 --> 00:03:43.746
the hidden talents of everyday things --

00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:47.742
all of those overlooked powers
bestowed on the things that surround us

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:52.336

three projects

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:03.267
that reconsider the vast properties
of commonplace experience
