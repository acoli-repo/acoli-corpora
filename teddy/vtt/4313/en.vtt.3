People arrive at experiences
like these with expectations.

00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:31.715
And when we make things,

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:35.262
we're actively choosing
what to do with those expectations.

In my work, I want to create
disruptive wonder.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.502
I want to confound these expectations,

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:44.734
because I think that every day,

00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:48.561

and experiences frame reality

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:50.637

00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:53.330
The small things we make

00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:56.706
can work to reinforce
our assumptions about the world.

00:01:57.964 --> 00:02:01.162
Or small things can come out of left field
