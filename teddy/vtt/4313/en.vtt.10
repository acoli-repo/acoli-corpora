00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.691
about receiving the card.

00:05:00.715 --> 00:05:03.272
(Laughter)

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.611
So it's a recursive experience.

00:05:06.635 --> 00:05:08.006
(Applause)

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.790
Oh, well, thank you.

00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:15.742
This excites me, because it's a recursive
experience of a holiday card

00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:18.178
that gets the viewer to feel
this repetitive ritual

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:19.572
of all holiday cards.

00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:22.872
And it begins life
as a humble piece of paper

00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:24.680
that came out of my inkjet printer.

00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:27.069
I think that's pretty cool.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.359
In a sense, that project was all about
ritual becoming empty gesture.
