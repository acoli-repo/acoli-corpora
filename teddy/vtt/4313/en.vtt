00:00:00.051 --> 00:00:02.023
I'm Kelli Anderson.

00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:04.686
I work as an artist and designer.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.896
And I like to try to find
the hidden talents of everyday things.

00:00:09.354 --> 00:00:10.834
So before I get started,

00:00:10.858 --> 00:00:14.830
I want to show you a fast smattering
of some examples of what I do.

00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:18.495
But this talk today
is really less about what I make

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.927
and is more about why I make these things.

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:25.674
So, I get to tinker
with everyday experiences.

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:28.660
As we go through our everyday lives,

00:00:28.684 --> 00:00:32.745
visual and experiential things
exert this invisible authority
