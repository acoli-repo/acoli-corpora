00:14:59.244 --> 00:15:02.902
We pushed our paper beyond
its expected role in reporting the news,

00:15:02.926 --> 00:15:05.348
and we made a blueprint
for a better world.

00:15:07.746 --> 00:15:12.067
With those three projects, I demonstrate
that by rejecting normal order,

00:15:12.091 --> 00:15:14.946
by messing things up
and by rearranging the pieces,

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.789
we can expand our notion
of what we demand from reality.

00:15:19.428 --> 00:15:23.277
So today, I want to put forth this idea
that an avenue to better

00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:25.572
is through a million teeny,
tiny disruptions

00:15:25.596 --> 00:15:27.873
to whatever is sitting in front of you.

00:15:27.897 --> 00:15:30.719
So go mess with the complacently rational.
