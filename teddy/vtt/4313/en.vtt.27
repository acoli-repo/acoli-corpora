(Laughter)

00:13:31.232 --> 00:13:34.746
And we do this through the vocabulary
of their own advertising.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.981
So for Ikea, what if
instead of cheap furniture,

00:13:39.005 --> 00:13:40.785
you could buy your own wind farm?

00:13:40.809 --> 00:13:44.748
It comes flat-packed,
clearly easy to assemble --

00:13:44.772 --> 00:13:47.781
(Laughter)

00:13:47.805 --> 00:13:50.124
with that little zigzag tool
and the wooden pegs.

00:13:50.148 --> 00:13:51.720
That would be awesome, right?

00:13:53.068 --> 00:13:55.106
More nefarious are companies
like De Beers,

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.711
who are making amends
for their sale of blood diamonds

00:13:57.735 --> 00:14:00.378
by donating prosthetics
to war-torn African countries.
