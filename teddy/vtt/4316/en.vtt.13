00:06:29.852 --> 00:06:33.926
So in 1803, Érard sends
Beethoven a new piano.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.136
And it has more notes.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.997
And it can do that.

00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:41.588
So the first thing Beethoven does is,
he writes a piece that can do that.

00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:44.440
If you've got a German or a Viennese piano

00:06:44.464 --> 00:06:45.827
or a British piano,

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.671
it can't do that.

00:06:48.735 --> 00:06:50.379
So what do you do?

00:06:50.403 --> 00:06:53.397
You've gone to the music store.

00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:56.798
And you've bought the latest
Beethoven piano sonata,

00:06:56.822 --> 00:06:59.490
and you take it home,
and you've got a five-octave piano

00:06:59.514 --> 00:07:02.435
that was the brand-spanking-new,
latest technology last year.
