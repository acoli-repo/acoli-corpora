So the internet wasn't
the first time this happened,

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.578
because think about what happens
when, all of a sudden,

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:37.990
you go from "If I want to hear music,

00:02:38.014 --> 00:02:40.664
I've got to go hear Bach,
I've got to go hear Mozart."

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:43.492
That meant you had
to actually go hear Mozart.

00:02:44.182 --> 00:02:47.913
You didn't buy a CD of Mozart,
you didn't download Mozart.

00:02:47.937 --> 00:02:51.430
You couldn't even buy Mozart sheet music,
at least not easily or cheaply.

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:53.515
But if you wanted to hear Mozart or Bach,

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.725
you had to go to Germany and go hear them.

00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:58.359
But that's not true for Beethoven.

00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:02.049
And Beethoven figures out that,
in fact, there's a new market.
