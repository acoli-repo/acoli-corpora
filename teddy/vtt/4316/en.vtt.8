00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:01.188
but if you wanted to hear Rachmaninoff,

00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:03.712
you had to actually go
to the concert hall.

00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:04.926
Not anymore.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.931
Now you can buy a record of Rachmaninoff,

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.392
or you can buy a player piano

00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:11.268
and a roll that fits into another kind
of recording device.

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:12.629
And later, the radio.

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:13.908
So think about this:

00:04:13.932 --> 00:04:18.199
you're a band in Texas;
you're Doc Ross in Texas,

00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:21.824
and you've got the Texas big band
market, you've got it nailed.

00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:24.831
And all of a sudden,
there's this new thing called "radio."

00:04:24.855 --> 00:04:28.778
And now everybody can hear Count Basie
and Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman.

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:31.216
Man, the competition just sucks now.
