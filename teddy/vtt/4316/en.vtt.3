00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.487
This goes on through the 18th century
from the beginning,

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:33.673
and then we have ...

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.731
our first disruption.

00:01:36.488 --> 00:01:39.821
These two things actually happened
together, these two disruptions.

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:41.684
We get the piano, right?

00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:44.909
The piano was a new technology

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:48.040
that really starts to happen
in the 18th century,

00:01:48.064 --> 00:01:51.490
and then it becomes something
that you could mass-produce cheaply.

00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:54.759
So you can now have an instrument
that's not too expensive,

00:01:54.783 --> 00:01:56.158
that everyone can have one,

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.722
that you can have at home.

00:01:57.746 --> 00:02:00.037
So this allows for a kind of disruption,
