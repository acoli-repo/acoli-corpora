Man, the competition just sucks now.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.391
All of a sudden, the competition
has gone global,

00:04:34.415 --> 00:04:36.715
just like it does a hundred years later,

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:40.586
with the iPod, the internet
and digital files and Garage Band,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.625
that do all of these things
all over again.

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:47.231
So now, maybe we can talk
about these two guys.

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:51.727
First of all, both of these guys
are entrepreneurs.

00:04:52.612 --> 00:04:55.591
But second of all, both of these guys
are software designers.

00:04:56.154 --> 00:04:58.115
That's what Beethoven does.

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.794
He writes software that runs
on that piece of hardware over there.
