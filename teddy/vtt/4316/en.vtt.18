00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:04.343
In the 19th century, we've got performers,
and we've got composers,

00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:05.862
people who do different things.

00:09:05.886 --> 00:09:09.239
We have listeners who can now
manipulate music like you just saw.

00:09:10.076 --> 00:09:11.743
It changes expectations of quality.

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:14.745
Once everybody's heard
Count Basie and Benny Goodman,

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:18.389
maybe you're not quite so happy
with your local band as much anymore.

00:09:18.413 --> 00:09:21.900
You've now heard ... -- "I want to go
listen to Benny Goodman some more."

00:09:21.924 --> 00:09:23.552
You have now a global market.

00:09:23.576 --> 00:09:25.986
You can hear things
that you didn't use to hear.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.620
Every time this happens,
we take away some social interaction.
