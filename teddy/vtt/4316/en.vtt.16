Everything you know
about Beethoven -- basically wrong.

00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:05.353
Beethoven was a very clever entrepreneur.

00:08:05.377 --> 00:08:07.588
So the music he wrote
for the popular market --

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.879
not the pieces he was going to play
himself, but the piano sonatas --

00:08:10.903 --> 00:08:13.418
he limits himself to the amount of keys

00:08:13.442 --> 00:08:17.442
that you have at home
in some part of Southern Italy,

00:08:17.466 --> 00:08:19.304
where you have last year's piano.

00:08:20.355 --> 00:08:25.662
So what are the effects of these
disruptions in music technology?

00:08:25.686 --> 00:08:27.882
How do composers, how do people respond?

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:31.336
We've had three of these things,
and they really all worked the same way.
