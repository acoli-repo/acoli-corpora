who play very expensive instruments,
for the most part,

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:04.739
things like the organ,
complicated instruments,

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:07.487
and if you wanted to hear music
in the 18th century,

00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:08.686
it was live.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.706
You had to go to a concert.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.397

you had to go to a civic event,

00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:16.041
you had to go hear somebody
making music live.

there was no record player.

00:01:22.823 --> 00:01:26.106
If you wanted to hear music,
you had to get out of the house.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.225
There's really, basically,
no music in your house.

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.487
This goes on through the 18th century
from the beginning,
