This was the first title
I thought of for this talk,

00:00:05.074 --> 00:00:06.538
"Beethoven as Bill Gates."

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:07.712
Does that make sense?

00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:11.104
Maybe not. OK, so think about that.

00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:14.975
Being an educator,
I am going to tell you the story,

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.281
and then you'll figure it out
for yourselves.

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:22.770
So the second thought I had
was that I would tell the story

00:00:22.794 --> 00:00:26.920
of the history of music delivery,
literally from the beginning,

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:29.098
from pounding rocks to pounding rock.

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:34.504
The good news about this is
the first 10,000 years just sailed by.
