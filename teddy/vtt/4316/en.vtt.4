00:01:57.746 --> 00:02:00.037
So this allows for a kind of disruption,

00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:03.435
but it wouldn't have happened
if the second disruption hadn't happened

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:04.610
at the same time,

00:02:04.634 --> 00:02:07.855
which is that somebody figured out
how to do cheap music printing.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.418

Music is a little more complicated.

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.037
It took a little longer to figure out:

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:20.912

By 1800, there are 30.

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:27.346
By 1820, there are 150.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.725
So the internet wasn't
the first time this happened,
