00:07:28.226 --> 00:07:30.370
he's writing his third piano concerto,

00:07:30.394 --> 00:07:33.881
he goes and he gives a concert,
and he and uses all those extra notes.

00:07:34.452 --> 00:07:37.048
But what does he do when he goes
and gives the concert?

00:07:37.072 --> 00:07:38.719
He has to take the piano with him,

00:07:38.743 --> 00:07:40.839
because it's the only piano
he has in Vienna

00:07:40.863 --> 00:07:42.178
that has those extra notes.

00:07:42.202 --> 00:07:44.563
So he plays the concerto
on the piano. It's great.

00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:48.162
But he realizes, "Oh, wait. Not everybody
has one of these latest things.

00:07:48.186 --> 00:07:50.405
So he publishes piano sonatas --

00:07:51.024 --> 00:07:52.187
He waits; he delays:

00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:55.381
for the next 10 years, he still
publishes piano sonatas

00:07:55.405 --> 00:07:57.055
that don't use the extra notes.

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:58.485
He actually waits, because --

00:07:58.509 --> 00:07:59.996
This idea of Beethoven?
