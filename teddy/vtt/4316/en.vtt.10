He writes software that runs
on that piece of hardware over there.

00:05:01.818 --> 00:05:02.851
(Laughter)

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:04.173
That's a piece of hardware.

00:05:04.197 --> 00:05:07.199
That's a device that you can use
if you have my piece of paper.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.293
If you have sheet music,
does it sound good?

00:05:09.317 --> 00:05:10.561
No, it's a piece of paper.

00:05:11.258 --> 00:05:14.665
It's like those floppy disks;
they weren't very useful.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.726
You can use them as coasters, I guess.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.723
But they're not very useful on their own.

00:05:18.747 --> 00:05:21.952
So both Beethoven and Bill Gates
are software designers.

00:05:21.976 --> 00:05:24.980
What's interesting is that
they also both live at a time

00:05:25.004 --> 00:05:27.897
where the hardware
is changing very quickly.

00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:30.655
Those of you who are
old enough to remember,
