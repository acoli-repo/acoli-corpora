00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:00.538
He actually just cannot do this.

00:06:00.562 --> 00:06:02.916
He can't go -- (Musical chords)

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.598
Can't do that.

00:06:04.622 --> 00:06:08.038
So in 1803, a French piano maker --

00:06:08.062 --> 00:06:10.391
alright, think about how smart this is:

00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:12.729
If you're a piano maker,

00:06:12.753 --> 00:06:16.474
into whose hands
do you want to get that piano?

00:06:17.272 --> 00:06:18.581
Composers.

00:06:18.605 --> 00:06:20.304
Artists who will use the technology

00:06:20.328 --> 00:06:22.956
and make everybody else
have to adopt your technology.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.597
It's like sending Bill Gates
your fastest, latest computer,

00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:28.766
because you know he'll use up
all the memory.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.828
(Laughter)

00:06:29.852 --> 00:06:33.926
So in 1803, Érard sends
Beethoven a new piano.
