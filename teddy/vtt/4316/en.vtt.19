00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.620
Every time this happens,
we take away some social interaction.

00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:33.849
With Beethoven, you can now
play Beethoven at home.

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:36.161
You can't play Mozart at home.

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:39.279
But with Beethoven, you can buy
the sheet music, you can go home,

00:09:39.303 --> 00:09:41.341
you can close the door and play the piano.

00:09:41.365 --> 00:09:42.524
And only you are there.

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:44.766
Now you have headphones
that do the same thing.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.287
With each of these disruptions,

00:09:46.311 --> 00:09:48.394
it changes the amount
of social interaction.

00:09:48.418 --> 00:09:51.766
It's a new personalized
experience each time.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.678
I can play Beethoven the way I want to.

00:09:53.702 --> 00:09:55.781
I can play it faster,
I can play it slower.

00:09:55.805 --> 00:09:58.212
I can actually personalize
the experience now.

00:09:58.236 --> 00:10:00.998
There's more consumer choice,
the marketplace gets bigger.
