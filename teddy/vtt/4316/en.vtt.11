Those of you who are
old enough to remember,

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:34.366
go back to the '90s, go
back to Windows whatever,

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.375
and remember your joy
and your love of Bill Gates,

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:41.667
as every time a new
software package came out,

00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:43.124
you had to get a new computer.

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:45.652
So, guess what?

00:05:45.676 --> 00:05:49.087
When Beethoven started writing music,
he had this instrument up on top,

00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:50.796
with five octaves.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.357
This one's bigger, it's got more pedals,

00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:55.046
it's louder, it can do more stuff.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.960
When Beethoven starts off,
he doesn't have a piano that can do this.

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:00.538
He actually just cannot do this.
