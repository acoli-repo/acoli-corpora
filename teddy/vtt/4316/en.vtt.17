00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:31.336
We've had three of these things,
and they really all worked the same way.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.433
We started off with printing
and the piano.

00:08:33.457 --> 00:08:36.775
The very first thing that happens
is: it redefines the product.

00:08:37.923 --> 00:08:40.450
So the product becomes sheet music,

00:08:40.474 --> 00:08:43.243
becomes a piece of paper
that you can then take home.

00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:45.715
In the 20th century, it becomes a record,

00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:47.449
something that you then take home.

00:08:47.473 --> 00:08:49.718
In the 21st century,
it becomes a digital file.

00:08:49.742 --> 00:08:51.593
The nature of the product changes.

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:54.052
Second, there's a division of labor.

00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:57.900
If you want to listen to Bach,
you've got to go listen to Bach;

00:08:57.924 --> 00:08:59.682
there's no other way to do this.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:04.343
In the 19th century, we've got performers,
and we've got composers,
