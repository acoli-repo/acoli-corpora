00:03:26.478 --> 00:03:30.459
It creates a new class of musicians,
of composers and performers --

00:03:30.483 --> 00:03:31.867
there's a division of labor.

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:34.578
If you hire Bach to play for your wedding,

00:03:34.602 --> 00:03:35.893
guess who shows up?

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:37.913
Bach!

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:38.961
(Laughter)

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.929
That's what he does for a living, right?

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:43.575
He has no way to expand his business.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.426
But Beethoven does.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.914
Then this happens again.

00:03:46.938 --> 00:03:49.867
It happens 100 years later, so
you're starting to see a theme.

00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:51.197
By the turn of the century,

00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:53.281
it's an interesting time
for music delivery;

00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:56.934
100 years later, we get the record
player, the gramophone, the player piano.

00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.207
Now you could buy
Rachmaninoff sheet music,

00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:01.188
but if you wanted to hear Rachmaninoff,
