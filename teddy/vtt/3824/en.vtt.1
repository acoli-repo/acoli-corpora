isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor.

00:00:32.917 --> 00:00:36.975
And when we do, the results will often surprise.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:38.855
Western Australia has had a particular problem

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:42.070
with shark attacks over the last three years,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.251
unfortunately and tragically culminating

00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:47.331
in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period

00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:49.091
during that time.

00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:51.220
But Western Australia is not alone in this.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.125
The incident of shark engagements on humans

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.469
is escalating worldwide.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.213
And so it's not surprising, perhaps,

00:00:58.213 --> 00:00:59.856
that in July of this year,

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:02.335
