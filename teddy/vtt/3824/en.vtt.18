00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.210
Now that exact same shark had engaged,

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.040
or encountered this SAMS rig,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.652
which is the Elude SAMS rig,

00:09:05.652 --> 00:09:06.831
about eight minutes before,

00:09:06.831 --> 00:09:09.974
and spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it,

00:09:09.974 --> 00:09:12.779
looking for what it could
smell and sense but not see,

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:15.251
and this was the final engagement.

00:09:17.734 --> 00:09:20.687
Great white sharks are more
confident than the tigers,

00:09:20.687 --> 00:09:22.735
and here you see great white shark

00:09:22.735 --> 00:09:24.142
engaging a control rig,

00:09:24.142 --> 00:09:25.975
so a black neoprene wetsuit,

00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:27.559
and going straight to the bottom,

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:30.110
coming up
