(Applause)

00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:10.877
So, it's important for us that all 
the testing is done independently,

00:10:10.877 --> 00:10:13.195
and the University of W.A. is doing the testing.

00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:14.947
It'll be an ongoing process.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:17.356
It's subject to peer review and subject to publication.

00:10:17.356 --> 00:10:19.699
It's so important that this concept

00:10:19.699 --> 00:10:21.497
is led with the science.

00:10:21.497 --> 00:10:23.741
From the perspective of Shark 
Attack Mitigation Systems,

00:10:23.741 --> 00:10:26.146
we're a biotechnology licensing company,

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:28.433
so we don't make wetsuits ourselves.

00:10:28.433 --> 00:10:30.713
We'll license others to do that.
