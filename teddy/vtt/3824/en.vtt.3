as it can be for invention.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.046
When we began this process,

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:36.228
we were looking, it was about three years ago,

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:39.650
and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.421
in Western Australia,

and by chance, in a previous role,

had spent a lot of time in the marine environment.

00:01:52.593 --> 00:01:54.699
Harry Butler is a precursor, if you like,

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:56.610
to the late Steve Irwin.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.921
When I asked him about

00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:01.219
what the solution to the problem might be,
