00:07:58.381 --> 00:08:01.173
we can capture all the statistics
on how big the shark is,

00:08:01.173 --> 00:08:03.429
what angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves,

00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:05.285
and what its behavior is

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:08.491
in an empirical rather than a subjective way.

00:08:08.491 --> 00:08:10.979
Because we needed to
preserve the scientific method,

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:12.677
we ran a control rig

00:08:12.677 --> 00:08:16.389
which was a black neoprene rig

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:18.198
just like a normal black wetsuit

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:19.677
against the, what we call,

00:08:19.677 --> 00:08:21.805
SAMS technology rig.

00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:24.533
And the results were not just exciting,

00:08:24.533 --> 00:08:25.971
but very encouraging,

00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:28.519
and today I would like to just give you a snapshot

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:32.181
of two of those engagements.
