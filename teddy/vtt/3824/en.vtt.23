00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:30.248
translation of something that was already there

00:11:30.248 --> 00:11:33.819
into something that we can 
use for the benefit of mankind.

00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:35.743
And it strikes me that this idea of science

00:11:35.743 --> 00:11:38.799
as a tool for translation rather than invention

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:41.463
is one that we can apply much more widely than this

00:11:41.463 --> 00:11:43.410
in the pursuit of innovation.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.735
After all, did the Wright brothers

00:11:45.735 --> 00:11:47.787
discover manned flight,

00:11:47.787 --> 00:11:50.976
or did they observe the biological fact of flight

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:54.168
and translate that mechanically, replicate it

00:11:54.168 --> 00:11:56.685
in a way that humans could use?

00:11:56.685 --> 00:11:58.219
As for the humble wetsuit,

00:11:58.219 --> 00:12:00.160
who knows what oceanwear will look like
