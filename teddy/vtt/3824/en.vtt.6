00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:01.970
to ward off the shark god.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.412
So what's going on here?

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:06.290
Is this an idea lying wide out in the open

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.421
for us to consider and define?

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:13.790
We know that sharks use a range of sensors

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.162
when they engage, particularly for attack,

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:19.122
but the sight sensor is the one that they use

00:03:19.122 --> 00:03:20.686
to identify the target, and particularly

00:03:20.686 --> 00:03:24.420
in the last number of meters before the attack.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.378
It makes sense to pay attention
to the biological anecdote

00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:29.230
because that's time-tested evolution

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.703
over many millennia.
