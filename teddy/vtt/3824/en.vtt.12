WEBVTT

00:05:59.885 --> 00:06:01.712
and is intended to prevent the shark

00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:04.380
from considering that you would be ordinary food,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.726
and potentially even create confusion for the shark.

00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:11.501
And this one's configured to go with a surfboard.

00:06:11.501 --> 00:06:14.114
You can see that dark, opaque panel on the front,

00:06:14.114 --> 00:06:16.841
and it's particularly better for the surface,

00:06:16.841 --> 00:06:19.689
where being backlit and providing a silhouette

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:21.301
is problematic.

00:06:21.301 --> 00:06:24.209
Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit,

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:25.820
or the one which attempts to hide the wearer

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.310
in the water column.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.000
There are three panels on this suit,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.624
and in any given conditions,
