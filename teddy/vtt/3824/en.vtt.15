We're ethically precluded from even using

00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:34.100
humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.372
But nevertheless, we started the testing process

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.220
in January of this year,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.356
initially with tiger sharks

00:07:39.356 --> 00:07:42.695
and subsequently with great white sharks.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.130
The way we did that

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.885
was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait,

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.781
wrap it in a neoprene skin,

00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:53.344
and then run two stereo underwater cameras

00:07:53.344 --> 00:07:56.693
to watch how the shark
actually engages with that rig.

00:07:56.693 --> 00:07:58.381
And because we use stereo,

00:07:58.381 --> 00:08:01.173
we can capture all the statistics
on how big the shark is,
