00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:01.007
But the acid test is always going to be,

00:07:01.007 --> 00:07:02.339
how would sharks really behave

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.070
in the context of these patterns and shapes.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.381
And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit

00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:09.929
in the water with a predatory shark

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.295
in a natural environment

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:13.247
is actually a lot harder than you might think.

00:07:13.247 --> 00:07:16.598
(Laughter)

00:07:16.598 --> 00:07:19.164
So we have to bait the rig,

00:07:19.164 --> 00:07:20.708
because we need to get the statistical number

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:23.732
of samples through to get the scientific evidence,

00:07:23.732 --> 00:07:24.521
and by baiting the rig,

00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:26.750
we're obviously changing shark behavior.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.567
We can't put humans in the water.

00:07:28.567 --> 00:07:31.453
We're ethically precluded from even using
