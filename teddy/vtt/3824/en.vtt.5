00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:30.976
this sort of thinking.

00:02:30.976 --> 00:02:32.960
So biologically, there are plenty of species

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.556
that display banding or patterns, warning patterns,

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.258
to either be cryptical in the water

00:02:37.258 --> 00:02:39.842
or warn against being attacked,

00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:41.955
not the least of which is the pilot fish

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:44.111
which spends a big slab of its life

00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:46.390
around the business end of a shark.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.481
On the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer,

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:52.343
has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s,

00:02:52.343 --> 00:02:53.965
and anthropologically,

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:57.595
Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands

00:02:57.595 --> 00:02:59.376
in a sea snake ceremony

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:01.970
to ward off the shark god.
