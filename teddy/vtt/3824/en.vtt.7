00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.703
over many millennia.

00:03:31.703 --> 00:03:35.180
But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.911
the idea that there's a kernel of truth

00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.503
thought to be important,

00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:41.788
passed down from generation to generation,

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:45.103
so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior?

00:03:45.103 --> 00:03:46.763
I wanted to test this idea.

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:47.981
I wanted to put some science

00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.317
to this anecdotal evidence,

00:03:50.317 --> 00:03:52.273
because if science could support this concept,

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:54.368
then we might have at least part of the solution

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:57.426
to shark attack right under our very nose.

00:03:57.426 --> 00:03:59.221
To do that, I needed some experts

00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:01.074
in shark vision and shark neurology,
