00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:01.074
in shark vision and shark neurology,

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.883
and a worldwide search, again,

00:04:02.883 --> 00:04:04.322
led to the University of W.A.

00:04:04.322 --> 00:04:06.725
on the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:09.322
And professor Nathan Hart and his team

00:04:09.322 --> 00:04:11.982
had just written a paper which tells us,

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:14.334
confirms that predatory sharks see

00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:17.197
in black and white, or grayscale.

00:04:17.197 --> 00:04:19.000
So I called up Nathan,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.866
a little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:22.747
that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes

00:04:22.747 --> 00:04:26.253
to produce a wetsuit to try and
mitigate the risk of shark attack,

00:04:26.253 --> 00:04:28.425
and fortunately, he thought that was a good idea.

00:04:28.425 --> 00:04:30.887
So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research
