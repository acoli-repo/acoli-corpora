00:04:28.425 --> 00:04:30.887
So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research

00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:33.511
supported by the West Australian State Government.

00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:36.070
And we did three key things.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.790
The first is that we mapped the characteristics,

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.810
the physical characteristics of the eyes

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.748
of the three main predatory sharks,

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:46.466
so the great white, tiger and bull shark.

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:48.020
We did that genetically

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.920
and we did that anatomically.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.762
The next thing we did was to understand,

00:04:52.762 --> 00:04:54.197
using complex computer modeling,

00:04:54.197 --> 00:04:56.251
what that eye can see

00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:58.020
at different depths, distances,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.261
light conditions, and water clarity in the ocean.
