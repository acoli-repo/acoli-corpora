00:10:58.172 --> 00:11:00.866
Cheers, mate.

00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:02.956
Cheers.

00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:07.920
Thanks, gentlemen. (Applause)

00:11:09.656 --> 00:11:10.943
So what have we done here?

00:11:10.943 --> 00:11:13.960
Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.280
and use science as a tool for invention,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.136
we've paid attention to the biological evidence,

00:11:20.136 --> 00:11:21.826
we've put importance to the

00:11:21.826 --> 00:11:23.536
human anecdotal evidence,

00:11:23.536 --> 00:11:26.618
and we've used science as a tool

00:11:26.618 --> 00:11:28.021
for translation,

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:30.248
translation of something that was already there
