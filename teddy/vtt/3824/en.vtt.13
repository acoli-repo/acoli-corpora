00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.624
and in any given conditions,

00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:31.979
one or more of those panels

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.569
will match the reflective spectra of the water

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.168
so as to disappear fully or partially,

00:06:37.168 --> 00:06:39.360
leaving the last panel or panels

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.247
to create a disruptive profile in the water column.

00:06:42.247 --> 00:06:44.412
And this one's particularly well-suited

00:06:44.412 --> 00:06:46.859
to the dive configuration,

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:49.927
so when you're deeper under the water.

00:06:49.927 --> 00:06:51.637
So we knew that we had

00:06:51.637 --> 00:06:53.407
some really solid science here.

00:06:53.407 --> 00:06:55.033
We knew, if you wanted to stand out,

00:06:55.033 --> 00:06:56.205
you needed to look stripy,

00:06:56.205 --> 00:06:57.629
and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic,

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:59.181
you needed to look like this.

00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:01.007
But the acid test is always going to be,
