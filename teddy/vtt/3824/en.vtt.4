00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:01.219
what the solution to the problem might be,

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:02.731
the answer was quite surprising.

00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:04.606
He said, "Take a black wetsuit,

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:07.371
band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee,

00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:09.659
and you'll be mimicking the warning systems

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.968
of most marine species."

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:13.866
I didn't think about that much at the time,

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:17.456
and it wasn't until the next three
fatal shark attacks happened,

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:18.890
and it caused me to think,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.021
maybe there's some merit to this idea.

00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:22.486
And I turned to the web

00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:24.741
to see if there might be some clues.

00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:27.018
And it turns out the web is awash

00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:29.414
with this sort of evidence that supports

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:30.976
this sort of thinking.
