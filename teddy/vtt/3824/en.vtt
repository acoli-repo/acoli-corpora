00:00:01.202 --> 00:00:02.711
Scientific breakthrough,

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:05.324
the kind that can potentially save lives,

00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:07.388
can sometimes be lying right out in the open

00:00:07.388 --> 00:00:08.950
for us to discover,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.156
in the evolved, accumulated body

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:13.748
of human anecdote, for example,

00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:15.774
or in the time-tested adaptations

00:00:15.774 --> 00:00:19.236
that we observe in the natural world around us.

00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:21.856
Science starts with observation,

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:25.252
but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures

00:00:25.252 --> 00:00:27.197
that we might otherwise dismiss

00:00:27.197 --> 00:00:29.064
as myth or coincidence,

00:00:29.064 --> 00:00:32.917
isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor.
