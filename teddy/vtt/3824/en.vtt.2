00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:02.335
Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:05.399
with the University of Western
Australia Oceans Institute

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.173
made an announcement which captured the attention

00:01:08.173 --> 00:01:10.409
of the worldwide media and of ocean users

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.200
worldwide,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.931
and that was around the development of technology

00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:16.572
to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack

00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:19.720
based on the science of what sharks can see.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.309
And I have for you today

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:23.176
the story of that journey,

00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:25.516
but also the notion that science can be

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:27.981
as powerful as a translator

00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:31.340
as it can be for invention.
