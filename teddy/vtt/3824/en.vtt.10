light conditions, and water clarity in the ocean.

00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:03.451
And from there, we were able to pinpoint

00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:05.251
two key characteristics:

00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:08.284
what patterns and shapes would present the wearer

00:05:08.284 --> 00:05:11.516
as hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic,

00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:13.012
and what patterns and shapes might provide

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.933
the greatest contrast but provide the greatest

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:17.390
breakup of profile

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.034
so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey

00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:23.387
or shark food.

00:05:23.387 --> 00:05:25.579
The next thing we needed to do was to convert this

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:28.328
into wetsuits that people might actually wear,

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.950
and to that end, I invited Ray Smith,
