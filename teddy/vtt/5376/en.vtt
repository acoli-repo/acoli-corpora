Rosa Howard: IKEA has over
500 locations worldwide

00:00:04.278 --> 00:00:07.603
and is committed to being
climate positive by 2030.

00:00:07.627 --> 00:00:10.291
That involves everything
from the raw materials

00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:12.100
to the end of a product's life.

00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:14.124
Because of the company's scale ...

00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:17.847
Jesper Brodin: The carbon footprint
of IKEA is about 0.1 percent

00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:20.156
of the global emission of carbon.

RH: ... that's a lot of carbon.

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:23.744
And that was Jesper Brodin,

00:00:23.768 --> 00:00:27.236
CEO of Ingka Group,
which operates IKEA Retail.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.489
And this is Pia Heidenmark Cook,

00:00:29.513 --> 00:00:31.220
their head of sustainability.
