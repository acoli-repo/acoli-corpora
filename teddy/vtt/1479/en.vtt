00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
when you're faced with a complex problem?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, I hope to convince you that complex

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
doesn't always equal complicated.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is complex,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is complicated.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So here's a food web,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or a map of feeding links between species
