00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
to suffer, but just a little

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and much less than before.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And if you do that for a couple of minutes,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
you have made the experiencing self

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
of Patient A worse off,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and you have the remembering self of Patient A

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
a lot better off,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
because now you have endowed Patient A

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
with a better story

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
about his experience.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
What defines a story?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And that is true of the stories

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that memory delivers for us,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and it's also true of the stories that we make up.
