00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
but there's a lot of uncertainty.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
You have that much uncertainty.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
you have a lot of uncertainty

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
about how happy they are

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
with their experiencing self.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
So the correlation is low.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We know something about what controls

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
satisfaction of the happiness self.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
We know that money is very important,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
goals are very important.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
We know that happiness is mainly

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
being satisfied with people that we like,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
spending time with people that we like.
