00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
his colonoscopy was longer,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and every minute of pain that Patient A had,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Patient B had, and more.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But now there is another question:

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
"How much did these patients think they suffered?"

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And here is a surprise.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
The surprise is that Patient A

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
than Patient B.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The stories of the colonoscopies were different,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --
