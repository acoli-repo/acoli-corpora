00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and the second week is just as good as the first,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
then the two-week vacation

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
is twice as good as the one-week vacation.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
For the remembering self, a two-week vacation

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
is barely better than the one-week vacation

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
because there are no new memories added.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
You have not changed the story.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And in this way,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
time is actually the critical variable

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that distinguishes a remembering self

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
from an experiencing self;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
time has very little impact on the story.
