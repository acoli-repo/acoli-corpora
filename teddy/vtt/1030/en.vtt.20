of the remembering self.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And when I think about that, I think about a vacation

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
we had in Antarctica a few years ago,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and I think of it relatively often,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
relative to how much I think of other vacations.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And I probably have consumed

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
for about 25 minutes in the last four years.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Now, if I had ever opened the folder

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
with the 600 pictures in it,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I would have spent another hour.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Now, that is three weeks,
