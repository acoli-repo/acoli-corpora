00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
about happiness.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The first of these traps

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is a reluctance to admit complexity.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It turns out that the word "happiness"

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is just not a useful word anymore,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because we apply it to too many different things.
