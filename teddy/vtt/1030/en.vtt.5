the memory was ruined,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
What this is telling us, really,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
in terms of two selves.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
There is an experiencing self,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
who lives in the present

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and knows the present,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is capable of re-living the past,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but basically it has only the present.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
you know, when the doctor asks,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"
