00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
in the experiencing self's life?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And they're all -- happiness for moments

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
is a fairly complicated process.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
What are the emotions that can be measured?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And, by the way, now we are capable

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
of getting a pretty good idea

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
it's a completely different thing.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
This is not about how happily a person lives.
