Now this is a direct conflict

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
between the experiencing self and the remembering self.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

clearly, B had a worse time.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Now, what you could do with Patient A,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and we actually ran clinical experiments,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and it has been done, and it does work --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
That will cause the patient

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
to suffer, but just a little
