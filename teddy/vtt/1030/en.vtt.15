00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is our life.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
It's the finite resource that we're spending

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
while we're on this earth.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And how to spend it

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
would seem to be relevant,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
but that is not the story

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
that the remembering self keeps for us.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So we have the remembering self

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and the experiencing self,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and they're really quite distinct.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
The biggest difference between them

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
is in the handling of time.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
if you have a vacation,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and the second week is just as good as the first,
