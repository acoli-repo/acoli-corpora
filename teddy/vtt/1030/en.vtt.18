00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The experiencing self

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
has no voice in this choice.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
we choose between memories of experiences.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
we don't think of our future normally as experiences.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
We think of our future

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and you can think of the remembering self

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
sort of dragging the experiencing self
