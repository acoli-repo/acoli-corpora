00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because we apply it to too many different things.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but by and large,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this is something that we'll have to give up

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
of what well-being is.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
basically, it's between being happy in your life,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and being happy about your life

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
or happy with your life.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And those are two very different concepts,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And the third is the focusing illusion,
