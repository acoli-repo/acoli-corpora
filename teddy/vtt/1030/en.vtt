Everybody talks about happiness these days.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I had somebody count the number of books

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
among researchers.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There is a lot of happiness coaching.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Everybody would like to make people happier.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But in spite of all this flood of work,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
there are several cognitive traps

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight
