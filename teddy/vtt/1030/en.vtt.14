00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I mean, most of the moments of our life --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and I calculated, you know, the psychological present

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
is said to be about three seconds long;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
that means that, you know,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
in a life there are about 600 million of them;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
in a month, there are about 600,000 --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
most of them don't leave a trace.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Most of them are completely ignored

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
by the remembering self.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And yet, somehow you get the sense

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
that they should count,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that what happens during these moments of experience

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is our life.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
It's the finite resource that we're spending
