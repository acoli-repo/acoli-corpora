00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
sort of dragging the experiencing self

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
through experiences that

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the experiencing self doesn't need.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I have that sense that

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
when we go on vacations

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000

in the service of our remembering self.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I mean, how much do we consume our memories?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
That is one of the explanations

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that is given for the dominance

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
of the remembering self.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And when I think about that, I think about a vacation
