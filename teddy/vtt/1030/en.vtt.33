00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
to think straight about well-being,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and I hope I have given you a sense

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
of how difficult it is.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Thank you.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
(Applause)

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Thank you so much.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
came out of that Gallup survey.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Is that something you can share

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
since you do have a few moments left now?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.
