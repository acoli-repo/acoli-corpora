00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Now, that is three weeks,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and that is at most an hour and a half.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
There seems to be a discrepancy.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
but even if you do more of this,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
there is a genuine question:

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Why do we put so much weight on memory

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
relative to the weight that we put on experiences?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
So I want you to think

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
about a thought experiment.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Imagine that for your next vacation,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
you know that at the end of the vacation
