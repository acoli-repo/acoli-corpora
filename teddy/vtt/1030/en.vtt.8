00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And let me begin with one example.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
This is an old study.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Here are two patients,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
those are their recordings.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?"

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And it's a very easy question.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Clearly, Patient B suffered more --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
his colonoscopy was longer,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and every minute of pain that Patient A had,
