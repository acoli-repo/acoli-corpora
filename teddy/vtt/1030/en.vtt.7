00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and getting confused between them is part of the mess

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
about the notion of happiness.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Now, the remembering self

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
is a storyteller.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
it starts immediately.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Our memory tells us stories,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that is, what we get to keep from our experiences

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
is a story.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And let me begin with one example.
