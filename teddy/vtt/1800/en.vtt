00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'd like to talk to you today about the human brain,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
which is what we do research on at the University of California.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Just think about this problem for a second.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here is a lump of flesh, about three pounds,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which you can hold in the palm of your hand.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
ask questions about the meaning of its own existence,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about the nature of God.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings:

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
How does this all come about?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons.
