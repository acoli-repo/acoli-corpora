00:06:28.117 --> 00:06:31.738
So the robot is obviously capable
of executing any curve trajectory.

00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:33.476
So these are circular trajectories,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.000
where the robot pulls about two G's.

00:06:37.584 --> 00:06:41.286
Here you have overhead
motion capture cameras on the top

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.516
that tell the robot where it is
100 times a second.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.976
It also tells the robot
where these obstacles are.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.436
And the obstacles can be moving.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.587
And here, you'll see Daniel
throw this hoop into the air,

00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:55.270
while the robot is calculating
the position of the hoop,

00:06:55.294 --> 00:06:58.174
and trying to figure out how to best
go through the hoop.

00:06:58.742 --> 00:06:59.976
So as an academic,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.528
we're always trained to be able
to jump through hoops
