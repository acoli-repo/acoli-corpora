00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.665
So let me give you
just a very quick tutorial

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.355
on how these robots work.

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:36.976
So it has four rotors.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.048
If you spin these rotors
at the same speed,

00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:40.271
the robot hovers.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.796
If you increase the speed
of each of these rotors,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.359
then the robot flies up,
it accelerates up.

00:01:47.383 --> 00:01:49.815
Of course, if the robot were tilted,

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:51.149
inclined to the horizontal,

00:01:51.173 --> 00:01:53.976
then it would accelerate
in this direction.

00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:55.839
So to get it to tilt,

00:01:55.863 --> 00:01:57.956
there's one of two ways of doing it.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.616
So in this picture, you see
that rotor four is spinning faster
