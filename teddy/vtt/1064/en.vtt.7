00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.920
So this should be clear in these videos.

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:35.403
On the bottom right, you see a robot
performing a 360-degree flip

00:03:35.427 --> 00:03:36.975
in less than half a second.

00:03:37.396 --> 00:03:39.976
Multiple flips, a little more time.

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:42.880
So here the processes on board

00:03:42.904 --> 00:03:46.088
are getting feedback from accelerometers
and gyros on board,

00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:48.230
and calculating, like I said before,

00:03:48.254 --> 00:03:50.063
commands at 600 times a second,

00:03:50.087 --> 00:03:51.976
to stabilize this robot.

00:03:52.347 --> 00:03:55.697
So on the left, you see Daniel
throwing this robot up into the air,

00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:57.748
and it shows you
how robust the control is.

00:03:57.772 --> 00:03:59.082
No matter how you throw it,

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:02.018
the robot recovers and comes back to him.
