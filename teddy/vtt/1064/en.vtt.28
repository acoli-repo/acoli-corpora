00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:03.719
I want to introduce the creators,
Alex and Daniel, who created this video.

00:14:03.743 --> 00:14:10.621
(Applause)

00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:12.079
So before I play this video,

00:14:12.103 --> 00:14:15.300
I want to tell you that they created it
in the last three days,

00:14:15.324 --> 00:14:16.976
after getting a call from Chris.

00:14:17.483 --> 00:14:21.300
And the robots that play in the video
are completely autonomous.

00:14:21.324 --> 00:14:24.826
You will see nine robots
play six different instruments.

00:14:25.437 --> 00:14:28.408
And of course, it's made
exclusively for TED 2012.

00:14:29.273 --> 00:14:30.425
Let's watch.
