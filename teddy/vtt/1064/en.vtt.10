00:04:58.808 --> 00:05:00.390
or sent into reactor buildings,

00:05:00.414 --> 00:05:02.033
to map radiation levels.

00:05:04.323 --> 00:05:07.844
So one fundamental problem
that the robots have to solve

00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:09.447
if they are to be autonomous,

00:05:09.471 --> 00:05:12.976
is essentially figuring out how to get
from point A to point B.

00:05:13.677 --> 00:05:15.344
So this gets a little challenging,

00:05:15.368 --> 00:05:18.375
because the dynamics of this robot
are quite complicated.

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.891
In fact, they live
in a 12-dimensional space.

00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:22.708
So we use a little trick.

00:05:22.732 --> 00:05:26.145
We take this curved 12-dimensional space,

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.063
and transform it into a flat,
four-dimensional space.
