00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:00.758
And then you want to make sure

00:09:00.782 --> 00:09:03.686
that this separation
is within acceptable levels.

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:06.511
So again, the robots monitor this error

00:09:06.535 --> 00:09:10.684
and calculate the control commands
100 times a second,

00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:12.731
which then translates into motor commands,

00:09:12.755 --> 00:09:13.970
600 times a second.

00:09:13.994 --> 00:09:17.216
So this also has to be done
in a decentralized way.

00:09:17.525 --> 00:09:19.859
Again, if you have
lots and lots of robots,

00:09:19.883 --> 00:09:23.160
it's impossible to coordinate
all this information centrally

00:09:23.184 --> 00:09:26.361
fast enough in order for the robots
to accomplish the task.

00:09:26.385 --> 00:09:30.733
Plus, the robots have to base
their actions only on local information --
