00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:02.018
the robot recovers and comes back to him.

00:04:03.621 --> 00:04:05.398
So why build robots like this?

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.390
Well, robots like this
have many applications.

00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:11.409
You can send them
inside buildings like this,

00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:15.020
as first responders to look for intruders,

00:04:15.044 --> 00:04:18.345
maybe look for biochemical leaks,

00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:19.520
gaseous leaks.

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:23.556
You can also use them
for applications like construction.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.104
So here are robots carrying beams, columns

00:04:28.128 --> 00:04:29.976
and assembling cube-like structures.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.056
I'll tell you a little bit
more about this.
