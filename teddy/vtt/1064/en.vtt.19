00:09:26.385 --> 00:09:30.733
Plus, the robots have to base
their actions only on local information --

00:09:30.757 --> 00:09:32.876
what they sense from their neighbors.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.286
And then finally,

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.410
we insist that the robots be agnostic
to who their neighbors are.

00:09:38.434 --> 00:09:40.551
So this is what we call anonymity.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:48.415
So what I want to show you next
is a video of 20 of these little robots,

00:09:48.439 --> 00:09:49.976
flying in formation.

00:09:50.884 --> 00:09:53.780
They're monitoring
their neighbors' positions.

00:09:53.804 --> 00:09:55.706
They're maintaining formation.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.510
The formations can change.

00:09:57.534 --> 00:09:59.213
They can be planar formations,

00:09:59.237 --> 00:10:01.340
they can be three-dimensional formations.
