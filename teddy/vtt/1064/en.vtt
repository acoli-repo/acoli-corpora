Good morning.

00:00:07.593 --> 00:00:11.746
I'm here today to talk
about autonomous flying beach balls.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.778
(Laughter)

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:15.667
No, agile aerial robots like this one.

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:19.824
I'd like to tell you a little bit
about the challenges in building these,

00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:23.240
and some of the terrific opportunities
for applying this technology.

00:00:23.697 --> 00:00:28.305
So these robots are related
to unmanned aerial vehicles.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.590
However, the vehicles
you see here are big.
