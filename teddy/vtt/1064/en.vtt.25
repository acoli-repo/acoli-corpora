00:12:27.315 --> 00:12:30.070
And it navigates with respect
to those features.

00:12:31.056 --> 00:12:32.476
So I want to show you a clip

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.452
of algorithms developed by Frank Shen
and Professor Nathan Michael,

00:12:36.476 --> 00:12:40.245
that shows this robot entering
a building for the very first time,

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:42.691
and creating this map on the fly.

00:12:43.382 --> 00:12:46.540
So the robot then figures out
what the features are,

00:12:46.564 --> 00:12:47.715
it builds the map,

00:12:47.739 --> 00:12:50.706
it figures out where it is
with respect to the features,

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.678
and then estimates its position
100 times a second,

00:12:54.702 --> 00:12:58.520
allowing us to use the control algorithms
that I described to you earlier.

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:02.977
So this robot is actually being
commanded remotely by Frank,
