00:09:59.237 --> 00:10:01.340
they can be three-dimensional formations.

00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:03.412
As you can see here,

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:07.123
they collapse from a three-dimensional
formation into planar formation.

00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:08.678
And to fly through obstacles,

00:10:08.702 --> 00:10:11.654
they can adapt the formations on the fly.

00:10:12.766 --> 00:10:15.229
So again, these robots come
really close together.

00:10:15.253 --> 00:10:17.641
As you can see
in this figure-eight flight,

00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:19.649
they come within inches of each other.

00:10:20.117 --> 00:10:24.434
And despite the aerodynamic interactions
with these propeller blades,

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:26.606
they're able to maintain stable flight.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:33.526
