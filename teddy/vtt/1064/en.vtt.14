00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.528
we're always trained to be able
to jump through hoops

00:07:02.552 --> 00:07:04.037
to raise funding for our labs,

00:07:04.061 --> 00:07:05.976
and we get our robots to do that.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.365
(Applause)

00:07:13.264 --> 00:07:14.875
So another thing the robot can do

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:16.976
is it remembers pieces of trajectory

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.904
that it learns or is pre-programmed.

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:24.976
So here, you see the robot combining
a motion that builds up momentum,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.976
and then changes its orientation
and then recovers.

00:07:28.744 --> 00:07:31.704
So it has to do this
because this gap in the window
