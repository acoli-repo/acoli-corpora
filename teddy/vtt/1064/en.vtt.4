00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.616
So in this picture, you see
that rotor four is spinning faster

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.608
and rotor two is spinning slower.

00:02:03.632 --> 00:02:05.192
And when that happens,

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:08.267
there's a moment that causes
this robot to roll.

00:02:09.235 --> 00:02:10.490
And the other way around,

00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:16.093
if you increase the speed of rotor three
and decrease the speed of rotor one,

00:02:16.117 --> 00:02:17.976
then the robot pitches forward.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.728
And then finally,

00:02:19.752 --> 00:02:22.646
if you spin opposite pairs of rotors

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.362
faster than the other pair,

00:02:24.386 --> 00:02:27.107
then the robot yaws
about the vertical axis.

00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:28.591
So an on-board processor

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:31.922
essentially looks at what motions
need to be executed
