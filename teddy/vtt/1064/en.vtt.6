00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:02.339
The one that's most important
is the inertia,

00:03:02.363 --> 00:03:04.284
or the resistance to motion.

00:03:04.308 --> 00:03:08.784
So it turns out the inertia,
which governs angular motion,

00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:11.408
scales as a fifth power of R.

00:03:11.786 --> 00:03:13.482
So the smaller you make R,

00:03:13.506 --> 00:03:15.823
the more dramatically the inertia reduces.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.631
So as a result, the angular acceleration,

00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:21.694
denoted by the Greek letter alpha here,

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:23.337
goes as 1 over R.

00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:25.090
It's inversely proportional to R.

00:03:25.114 --> 00:03:27.884
The smaller you make it,
the more quickly you can turn.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.920
So this should be clear in these videos.
