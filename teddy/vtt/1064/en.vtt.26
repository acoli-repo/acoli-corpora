00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:02.977
So this robot is actually being
commanded remotely by Frank,

00:13:03.001 --> 00:13:06.540
but the robot can also figure out
where to go on its own.

00:13:06.865 --> 00:13:09.072
So suppose I were to send
this into a building,

00:13:09.096 --> 00:13:11.398
and I had no idea
what this building looked like.

00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:12.866
I can ask this robot to go in,

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.794
create a map,

00:13:14.818 --> 00:13:17.683
and then come back and tell me
what the building looks like.

00:13:17.707 --> 00:13:20.875
So here, the robot is not
only solving the problem

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:23.533
of how to go from point A
to point B in this map,

00:13:23.557 --> 00:13:27.956
but it's figuring out what the best
point B is at every time.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.034
So essentially it knows where to go
