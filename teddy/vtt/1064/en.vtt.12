00:05:57.648 --> 00:06:00.490
And it does that avoiding obstacles.

00:06:01.053 --> 00:06:04.616
So these minimum-snap trajectories
in this flat space are then transformed

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.965
back into this complicated
12-dimensional space,

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:10.975
which the robot must do
for control and then execution.

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:13.029
So let me show you some examples

00:06:13.053 --> 00:06:15.830
of what these minimum-snap
trajectories look like.

00:06:15.854 --> 00:06:17.005
And in the first video,

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:19.758
you'll see the robot going
from point A to point B,

00:06:19.782 --> 00:06:21.405
through an intermediate point.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.460
(Whirring noise)

00:06:28.117 --> 00:06:31.738
So the robot is obviously capable
of executing any curve trajectory.
