I'll tell you a little bit
more about this.

00:04:33.435 --> 00:04:35.976
The robots can be used
for transporting cargo.

00:04:36.323 --> 00:04:39.436
So one of the problems
with these small robots

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.461
is their payload-carrying capacity.

00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:44.502
So you might want to have
multiple robots carry payloads.

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:47.841
This is a picture of a recent
experiment we did --

00:04:47.865 --> 00:04:49.460
actually not so recent anymore --

00:04:49.484 --> 00:04:51.976
in Sendai, shortly after the earthquake.

00:04:52.678 --> 00:04:55.869
So robots like this could be sent
into collapsed buildings,

00:04:55.893 --> 00:04:58.784
to assess the damage
after natural disasters,

00:04:58.808 --> 00:05:00.390
or sent into reactor buildings,
