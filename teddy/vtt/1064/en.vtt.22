00:10:59.718 --> 00:11:02.814
But you do gain in terms
of payload-carrying capacity.

00:11:02.838 --> 00:11:06.053
Another application I want to show you --
again, this is in our lab.

00:11:06.077 --> 00:11:09.242
This is work done by Quentin Lindsey,
who's a graduate student.

00:11:09.266 --> 00:11:11.886
So his algorithm essentially
tells these robots

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.982
how to autonomously build cubic structures

00:11:16.006 --> 00:11:17.976
from truss-like elements.

00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:22.941
So his algorithm tells the robot
what part to pick up,

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:24.790
when, and where to place it.

00:11:25.211 --> 00:11:26.694
So in this video you see --

00:11:26.718 --> 00:11:28.742
and it's sped up 10, 14 times --

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:31.855
you see three different structures
being built by these robots.
