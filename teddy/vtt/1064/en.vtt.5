00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:31.922
essentially looks at what motions
need to be executed

00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:33.916
and combines these motions,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.050
and figures out what commands
to send to the motors --

00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:38.486
600 times a second.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.479
That's basically how this thing operates.

00:02:40.987 --> 00:02:43.129
So one of the advantages of this design

00:02:43.153 --> 00:02:45.052
is when you scale things down,

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:47.394
the robot naturally becomes agile.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:51.997
So here, R is the characteristic
length of the robot.

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:53.695
It's actually half the diameter.

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:58.976
And there are lots of physical parameters
that change as you reduce R.

00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:02.339
The one that's most important
is the inertia,
