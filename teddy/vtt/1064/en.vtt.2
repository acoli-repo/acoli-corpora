00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:02.848
and they're roughly
a meter or so in scale,

00:01:02.872 --> 00:01:04.332
and weigh several pounds.

00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:08.171
And so we retrofit these
with sensors and processors,

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:10.401
and these robots can fly indoors.

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:11.744
Without GPS.

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:14.085
The robot I'm holding in my hand

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:15.759
is this one,

00:01:15.783 --> 00:01:18.926
and it's been created by two students,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.598
Alex and Daniel.

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:24.348
So this weighs a little more
than a tenth of a pound.

00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:26.951
It consumes about 15 watts of power.

00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:29.808
And as you can see,
it's about eight inches in diameter.
