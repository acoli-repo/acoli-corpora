00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.063
and transform it into a flat,
four-dimensional space.

00:05:30.087 --> 00:05:33.158
And that four-dimensional space
consists of X, Y, Z,

00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:34.594
and then the yaw angle.

00:05:34.618 --> 00:05:35.976
And so what the robot does,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.976
is it plans what we call
a minimum-snap trajectory.

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.346
So to remind you of physics:

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.424
You have position, derivative, velocity;

00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:46.304
then acceleration;

00:05:46.328 --> 00:05:48.429
and then comes jerk,

00:05:48.453 --> 00:05:49.873
and then comes snap.

00:05:50.318 --> 00:05:52.770
So this robot minimizes snap.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.976
So what that effectively does,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.624
is produce a smooth and graceful motion.

00:05:57.648 --> 00:06:00.490
And it does that avoiding obstacles.
