00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.590
However, the vehicles
you see here are big.

00:00:32.058 --> 00:00:35.327
They weigh thousands of pounds,
are not by any means agile.

00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:36.976
They're not even autonomous.

00:00:37.626 --> 00:00:41.808
In fact, many of these vehicles
are operated by flight crews

00:00:41.832 --> 00:00:44.392
that can include multiple pilots,

00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:46.622
operators of sensors,

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:47.976
and mission coordinators.

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:51.405
What we're interested in
is developing robots like this --

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.119
and here are two other pictures --

00:00:53.143 --> 00:00:55.826
of robots that you can buy off the shelf.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.134
So these are helicopters with four rotors,

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:02.848
and they're roughly
a meter or so in scale,
