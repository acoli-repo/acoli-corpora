00:07:28.744 --> 00:07:31.704
So it has to do this
because this gap in the window

00:07:31.728 --> 00:07:35.186
is only slightly larger
than the width of the robot.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.543
So just like a diver
stands on a springboard

00:07:38.567 --> 00:07:41.020
and then jumps off it to gain momentum,

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:44.273
and then does this pirouette,
this two and a half somersault through

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.699
and then gracefully recovers,

00:07:45.723 --> 00:07:47.421
this robot is basically doing that.

00:07:47.445 --> 00:07:50.525
So it knows how to combine
little bits and pieces of trajectories

00:07:50.549 --> 00:07:53.548
to do these fairly difficult tasks.

00:07:54.758 --> 00:07:55.976
So I want change gears.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.839
So one of the disadvantages
of these small robots is its size.
