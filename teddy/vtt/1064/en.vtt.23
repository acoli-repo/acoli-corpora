00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:31.855
you see three different structures
being built by these robots.

00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:33.905
And again, everything is autonomous,

00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:35.212
and all Quentin has to do

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:39.171
is to give them a blueprint
of the design that he wants to build.

00:11:41.665 --> 00:11:44.476
So all these experiments
you've seen thus far,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.850
all these demonstrations,

00:11:45.874 --> 00:11:48.976
have been done with the help
of motion-capture systems.

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:52.276
So what happens when you leave your lab,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.337
and you go outside into the real world?

00:11:54.662 --> 00:11:56.368
And what if there's no GPS?

00:11:57.495 --> 00:12:01.832
So this robot is actually
equipped with a camera,
