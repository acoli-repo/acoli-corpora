00:10:33.986 --> 00:10:35.985
So once you know how to fly in formation,

00:10:36.009 --> 00:10:38.225
you can actually pick up
objects cooperatively.

00:10:38.249 --> 00:10:42.826
So this just shows that we can
double, triple, quadruple

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.008
the robots' strength,

00:10:44.032 --> 00:10:47.109
by just getting them to team
with neighbors, as you can see here.

00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:51.275
One of the disadvantages of doing that is,
as you scale things up --

00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:53.863
so if you have lots of robots
carrying the same thing,

00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:56.607
you're essentially increasing the inertia,

00:10:56.631 --> 00:10:59.250
and therefore you pay a price;
they're not as agile.

00:10:59.718 --> 00:11:02.814
But you do gain in terms
of payload-carrying capacity.
