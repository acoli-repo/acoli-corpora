00:11:57.495 --> 00:12:01.832
So this robot is actually
equipped with a camera,

00:12:01.856 --> 00:12:04.229
and a laser rangefinder, laser scanner.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.800
And it uses these sensors
to build a map of the environment.

00:12:08.824 --> 00:12:12.110
What that map consists of are features --

00:12:12.134 --> 00:12:16.005
like doorways, windows,
people, furniture --

00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:18.172
and it then figures out
where its position is,

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.597
with respect to the features.

00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:21.831
So there is no global coordinate system.

00:12:21.855 --> 00:12:24.361
The coordinate system
is defined based on the robot,

00:12:24.385 --> 00:12:26.442
where it is and what it's looking at.

00:12:27.315 --> 00:12:30.070
And it navigates with respect
to those features.
