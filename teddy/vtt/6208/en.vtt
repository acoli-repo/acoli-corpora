00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.256
"You don't belong here"

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.760
almost always means, "We can't find
a function or a role for you."

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:11.240
"You don't belong here" sometimes means,
"You're too queer to handle."

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.000
"You don't belong here"

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.056
very rarely means,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.640
"There's no way for you to exist
and be happy here."

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.336
I went to university
in Johannesburg, South Africa,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.789
and I remember the first time
a white friend of mine

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:30.413
heard me speaking Setswana,
the national language of Botswana.
