who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
their customers don't buy the branded versions.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
They like the generics.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And as a marketer, I found that curious.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And it turns out that there are three main messages

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
used by the donor agencies for these condoms:

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
fear, financing and fidelity.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They name the condoms things like Vive, "to live"
