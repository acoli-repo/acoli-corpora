There are many health issues as well.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In fact, the HIV prevalence rate

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is 1.3 percent among adults.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This might not sound like a large number,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but in a country with 76 million people,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
it means there are 930,000 that are infected.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And due to the poor infrastructure,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
only 25 percent of those

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Which is why, in part,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
donor agencies provide condoms

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
at low or no cost.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And so while I was in the DRC,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms,
