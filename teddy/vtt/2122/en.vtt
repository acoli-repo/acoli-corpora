00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I am a reformed marketer,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I now work in international development.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is the [second] largest country in Africa.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In fact, it's as large as Western Europe,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but it only has 300 miles of paved roads.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The DRC is a dangerous place.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In the past 10 years, five million people have died

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
due to a war in the east.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But war isn't the only reason

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that life is difficult in the DRC.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There are many health issues as well.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In fact, the HIV prevalence rate
