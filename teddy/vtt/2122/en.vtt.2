00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
including Damien.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's a hotel that's only open until midnight,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so it's not a place that you stay.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now Damien knows all about condoms,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but he doesn't sell them.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
He said there's just not in demand.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's not surprising,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
because only three percent of people in the DRC

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
use condoms.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Joseph and Christine,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost,
