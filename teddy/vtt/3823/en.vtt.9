WEBVTT

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.545
We recognized features --
boulders, craters --

00:04:30.545 --> 00:04:34.562
and that's how we know where we are
respective to the comet.

00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:39.091
And, of course, it's the first satellite
to go beyond the orbit of Jupiter

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:40.292
on solar cells.

00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:42.619
Now, this sounds more heroic
than it actually is,

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:47.715
because the technology
to use radio isotope thermal generators

00:04:47.715 --> 00:04:51.013
wasn't available in Europe at that time,
so there was no choice.

00:04:51.013 --> 00:04:52.590
But these solar arrays are big.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.865
This is one wing, and these are not
specially selected small people.

00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:57.699
They're just like you and me.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.090
(Laughter)
