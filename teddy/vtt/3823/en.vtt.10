00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.090
(Laughter)

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.291
We have two of these wings,
65 square meters.

00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:07.310
Now later on, of course,
when we got to the comet,

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.839
you find out that 65 square meters of sail

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:16.481
close to a body which is outgassing
is not always a very handy choice.

00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.525
Now, how did we get to the comet?

00:05:18.525 --> 00:05:22.193
Because we had to go there
for the Rosetta scientific objectives

00:05:22.193 --> 00:05:26.001
very far away -- four times the distance
of the Earth to the sun --

00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:30.111
and also at a much higher velocity
than we could achieve with fuel,
