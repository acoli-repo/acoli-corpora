00:09:57.653 --> 00:10:01.330
The lander is then pushed out
and moves towards the comet.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.120
Rosetta had to turn around

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.677
to get its cameras to actually look
at Philae while it was departing

00:10:07.677 --> 00:10:10.146
and to be able to communicate with it.

00:10:10.146 --> 00:10:14.720
Now, the landing duration
of the whole trajectory was seven hours.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.507
Now do a simple calculation:

00:10:17.507 --> 00:10:21.546
if the velocity of Rosetta is off
by one centimeter per second,

00:10:21.546 --> 00:10:25.888
seven hours is 25,000 seconds.

00:10:25.888 --> 00:10:30.253
That means 252 meters wrong on the comet.
