00:08:29.687 --> 00:08:34.286
Why 500 meters? That's the error
we have on landing the probe.

00:08:34.286 --> 00:08:37.467
So we went through this process,
and we mapped the comet.

00:08:37.467 --> 00:08:39.834
We used a technique
called photoclinometry.

00:08:39.834 --> 00:08:42.064
You use shadows thrown by the sun.

00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:45.151
What you see here is a rock
sitting on the surface of the comet,

00:08:45.151 --> 00:08:48.077
and the sun shines from above.

00:08:48.077 --> 00:08:50.236
From the shadow, we, with our brain,

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:53.880
can immediately determine
roughly what the shape of that rock is.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.922
You can program that in a computer,

00:08:55.922 --> 00:09:00.176
you then cover the whole comet,
and you can map the comet.
