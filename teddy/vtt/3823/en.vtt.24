00:11:58.448 --> 00:12:01.250
Now, for you, this will not
look very impressive,

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.523
but the scientists were thrilled
when they saw this.

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:05.940
Two dust particles:

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.934
the right one they call Boris,
and they shot it with tantalum

00:12:08.934 --> 00:12:11.048
in order to be able to analyze it.

00:12:11.048 --> 00:12:13.439
Now, we found sodium and magnesium.

00:12:13.439 --> 00:12:17.688
What this tells you is this is
the concentration of these two materials

00:12:17.688 --> 00:12:20.404
at the time the solar system was formed,

00:12:20.404 --> 00:12:23.771
so we learned things about
which materials were there

00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:26.859
when the planet was made.

00:12:26.859 --> 00:12:29.577
Of course, one of the important
elements is the imaging.

00:12:29.577 --> 00:12:32.943
This is one of the cameras of Rosetta,
the OSIRIS camera,
