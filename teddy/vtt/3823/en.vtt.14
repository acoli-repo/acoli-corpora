00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:00.903
we started arriving at a distance

00:07:00.903 --> 00:07:03.736
of two million kilometers
from the comet in May.

00:07:03.736 --> 00:07:07.845
However, the velocity
the spacecraft had was much too fast.

00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:13.906
We were going 2,800 kilometers an hour
faster than the comet, so we had to brake.

00:07:13.906 --> 00:07:15.763
We had to do eight maneuvers,

00:07:15.763 --> 00:07:18.340
and you see here,
some of them were really big.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:24.364
We had to brake the first one
by a few hundred kilometers per hour,

00:07:24.364 --> 00:07:28.674
and actually, the duration of that
was seven hours,

00:07:28.674 --> 00:07:31.622
and it used 218 kilos of fuel,
