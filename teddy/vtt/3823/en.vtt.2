00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.053
Afterwards, the big planets
like Jupiter and Saturn,

00:01:03.053 --> 00:01:05.631
they were not in their place
where they are now,

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.278
and they interacted gravitationally,

00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:11.830
and they swept the whole interior
of the solar system clean,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.432
and what we now know as comets

00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:15.545
ended up in something
called the Kuiper Belt,

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:19.213
which is a belt of objects
beyond the orbit of Neptune.

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:22.906
And sometimes these objects
run into each other,

00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:25.971
and they gravitationally deflect,

00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:30.428
and then the gravity of Jupiter
pulls them back into the solar system.
