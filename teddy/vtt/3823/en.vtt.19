00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:30.844
to actually finding
the final landing site, was 60 days.

00:09:30.844 --> 00:09:32.230
We didn't have more.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.350
To give you an idea,
the average Mars mission

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.134
takes hundreds of scientists
for years to meet

00:09:38.134 --> 00:09:40.201
about where shall we go?

00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:42.359
We had 60 days, and that was it.

00:09:42.359 --> 00:09:45.402
We finally selected the final landing site

00:09:45.402 --> 00:09:50.455
and the commands were prepared
for Rosetta to launch Philae.

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:54.830
The way this works is that Rosetta
has to be at the right point in space,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.653
and aiming towards the comet,
because the lander is passive.

00:09:57.653 --> 00:10:01.330
The lander is then pushed out
and moves towards the comet.
