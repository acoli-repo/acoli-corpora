00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.404
The other one is an ion tail,
which is charged particles,

00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:03.143
and they follow the magnetic field
in the solar system.

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:04.292
There's the coma,

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:07.199
and then there is the nucleus,
which here is too small to see,

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:09.689
and you have to remember
that in the case of Rosetta,

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.866
the spacecraft is in that center pixel.

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:15.976
We are only 20, 30, 40 kilometers
away from the comet.

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:18.297
So what's important to remember?

00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:23.166
Comets contain the original material
from which our solar system was formed,

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.526
so they're ideal to study the components

00:02:25.526 --> 00:02:29.791
that were present at the time 
when Earth, and life, started.

00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:31.673
Comets are also suspected
