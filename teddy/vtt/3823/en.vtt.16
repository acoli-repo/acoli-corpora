00:07:57.366 --> 00:08:00.617
but you will understand that
our flight dynamics engineers thought,

00:08:00.617 --> 00:08:04.471
this is not going to be
an easy thing to land on.

00:08:04.471 --> 00:08:09.115
We had hoped for some kind
of spud-like thing

00:08:09.115 --> 00:08:11.281
where you could easily land.

00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:14.572
But we had one hope: maybe it was smooth.

00:08:14.572 --> 00:08:18.310
No. That didn't work either. (Laughter)

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.003
So at that point in time,
it was clearly unavoidable:

00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:24.534
we had to map this body
in all the detail you could get,

00:08:24.534 --> 00:08:29.687
because we had to find an area
which is 500 meters in diameter and flat.

00:08:29.687 --> 00:08:34.286
Why 500 meters? That's the error
we have on landing the probe.
