00:03:59.502 --> 00:04:02.018
It's the first satellite to orbit a comet,

00:04:02.018 --> 00:04:05.640
and to escort it throughout
its whole tour through the solar system --

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.938
closest approach to the sun,
as we will see in August,

00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:11.259
and then away again to the exterior.

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.860
It's the first ever landing on a comet.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.552
We actually orbit the comet
using something which is not

00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:19.001
normally done with spacecraft.

00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.636
Normally, you look at the sky and you know
where you point and where you are.

00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:24.772
In this case, that's not enough.

00:04:24.772 --> 00:04:28.070
We navigated by looking
at landmarks on the comet.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.545
We recognized features --
boulders, craters --
