00:13:56.855 --> 00:14:00.732
But much the same as Rosetta, and that is
because you want to compare

00:14:00.732 --> 00:14:04.238
what you find in space
with what you find on the comet.

00:14:04.238 --> 00:14:06.931
These are called
ground truth measurements.

00:14:06.931 --> 00:14:10.162
These are the landing descent images

00:14:10.162 --> 00:14:12.210
that were taken by the OSIRIS camera.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.436
You see the lander getting further
and further away from Rosetta.

00:14:16.436 --> 00:14:20.244
On the top right, you see an image
taken at 60 meters by the lander,

00:14:20.244 --> 00:14:23.100
60 meters above the surface of the comet.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.514
The boulder there is some 10 meters.

00:14:25.514 --> 00:14:30.228
So this is one of the last images we took
before we landed on the comet.
