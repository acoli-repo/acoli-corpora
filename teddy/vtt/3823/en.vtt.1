00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:32.195
Along with that, what we now know
as planets, comets and asteroids formed.

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:35.608
What then happened, according to theory,

00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:39.625
is that when the Earth had cooled down
a bit after its formation,

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:44.396
comets massively impacted the Earth
and delivered water to Earth.

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:49.516
They probably also delivered
complex organic material to Earth,

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.906
and that may have bootstrapped
the emergence of life.

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:56.366
You can compare this to having
to solve a 250-piece puzzle

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.570
and not a 2,000-piece puzzle.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.053
Afterwards, the big planets
like Jupiter and Saturn,
