00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:30.428
and then the gravity of Jupiter
pulls them back into the solar system.

00:01:30.428 --> 00:01:34.120
And they then become the comets
as we see them in the sky.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.394
The important thing here to note
is that in the meantime,

00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:39.693
the four and a half billion years,

00:01:39.693 --> 00:01:42.875
these comets have been sitting
on the outside of the solar system,

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:44.290
and haven't changed --

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.193
deep, frozen versions of our solar system.

00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:49.282
In the sky, they look like this.

00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:51.233
We know them for their tails.

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:52.904
There are actually two tails.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:56.759
One is a dust tail,
which is blown away by the solar wind.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.404
The other one is an ion tail,
which is charged particles,
