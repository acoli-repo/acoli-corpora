00:11:29.312 --> 00:11:31.459
where there is a lot of stuff coming from,

00:11:31.459 --> 00:11:34.756
it gets heated in the Sun,
and then cools down on the back side.

00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:38.262
And we can see
the density variations of this.

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:42.395
These are the gases
and the organic compounds

00:11:42.395 --> 00:11:44.090
that we already have measured.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.878
You will see it's an impressive list,

00:11:45.878 --> 00:11:48.362
and there is much, much,
much more to come,

00:11:48.362 --> 00:11:50.308
because there are more measurements.

00:11:50.308 --> 00:11:53.656
Actually, there is a conference
going on in Houston at the moment

00:11:53.656 --> 00:11:56.117
where many of these results are presented.

00:11:56.827 --> 00:11:58.448
Also, we measured dust particles.

00:11:58.448 --> 00:12:01.250
Now, for you, this will not
look very impressive,
