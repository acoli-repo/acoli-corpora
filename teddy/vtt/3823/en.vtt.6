that comets were ideal bodies to study
to understand our solar system.

00:03:04.087 --> 00:03:08.599
And thus, the Rosetta mission
was approved in 1993,

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.234
and originally it was supposed
to be launched in 2003,

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:14.858
but a problem arose
with an Ariane rocket.

00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:17.923
However, our P.R. department,
in its enthusiasm,

00:03:17.923 --> 00:03:20.145
had already made
1,000 Delft Blue plates

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:22.535
with the name of the wrong comets.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:26.102
So I've never had to buy any china since.
That's the positive part.

00:03:26.102 --> 00:03:27.821
(Laughter)

00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:29.701
Once the whole problem was solved,

00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:32.882
we left Earth in 2004
