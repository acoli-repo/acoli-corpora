00:08:55.922 --> 00:09:00.176
you then cover the whole comet,
and you can map the comet.

00:09:00.176 --> 00:09:03.856
For that, we flew special trajectories
starting in August.

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:06.765
First, a triangle
of 100 kilometers on a side

00:09:06.765 --> 00:09:08.428
at 100 kilometers' distance,

00:09:08.428 --> 00:09:11.432
and we repeated the whole 
thing at 50 kilometers.

00:09:11.432 --> 00:09:15.079
At that time, we had seen the comet
at all kinds of angles,

00:09:15.079 --> 00:09:19.752
and we could use this technique
to map the whole thing.

00:09:19.752 --> 00:09:23.019
Now, this led to a selection
of landing sites.

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:27.279
This whole process we had to do,
to go from the mapping of the comet

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:30.844
to actually finding
the final landing site, was 60 days.
