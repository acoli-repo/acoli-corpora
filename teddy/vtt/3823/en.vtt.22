00:10:58.348 --> 00:11:00.600
the shape of them, the composition,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.108
there are magnetometers, everything.

00:11:03.108 --> 00:11:06.707
This is one of the results from
an instrument which measures gas density

00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:08.565
at the position of Rosetta,

00:11:08.565 --> 00:11:10.794
so it's gas which has left the comet.

00:11:10.794 --> 00:11:13.278
The bottom graph
is September of last year.

00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:16.575
There is a long-term variation,
which in itself is not surprising,

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.456
but you see the sharp peaks.

00:11:18.456 --> 00:11:20.546
This is a comet day.

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:24.656
You can see the effect of the sun
on the evaporation of gas

00:11:24.656 --> 00:11:27.604
and the fact that the comet is rotating.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.312
So there is one spot, apparently,

00:11:29.312 --> 00:11:31.459
where there is a lot of stuff coming from,
