00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:05.514
I'd like to take you on the epic quest
of the Rosetta spacecraft.

00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:09.540
To escort and land the probe on a comet,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.730
this has been my passion
for the past two years.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.545
In order to do that,

00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:18.015
I need to explain to you something
about the origin of the solar system.

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:20.238
When we go back
four and a half billion years,

00:00:20.238 --> 00:00:21.957
there was a cloud of gas and dust.

00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:26.484
In the center of this cloud,
our sun formed and ignited.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:32.195
Along with that, what we now know
as planets, comets and asteroids formed.
