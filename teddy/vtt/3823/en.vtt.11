00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:30.111
and also at a much higher velocity
than we could achieve with fuel,

00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:34.430
because we'd have to take six times as
much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.840
So what do you do?

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.323
You use gravitational flybys, slingshots,

00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:42.690
where you pass by a planet
at very low altitude,

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.455
a few thousand kilometers,

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:49.168
and then you get the velocity
of that planet around the sun for free.

00:05:49.168 --> 00:05:51.211
We did that a few times.

00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:53.690
We did Earth, we did Mars,
we did twice Earth again,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.658
and we also flew by two asteroids,
Lutetia and Steins.

00:05:58.318 --> 00:06:02.983
Then in 2011, we got so far from the sun
that if the spacecraft got into trouble,
