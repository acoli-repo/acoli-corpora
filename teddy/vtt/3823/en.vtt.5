00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:31.673
Comets are also suspected

00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:35.944
of having brought the elements
which may have bootstrapped life.

00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:40.309
In 1983, ESA set up
its long-term Horizon 2000 program,

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:44.233
which contained one cornerstone,
which would be a mission to a comet.

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:49.123
In parallel, a small mission to a comet,
what you see here, Giotto, was launched,

00:02:49.123 --> 00:02:55.329
and in 1986, flew by the comet of Halley
with an armada of other spacecraft.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.900
From the results of that mission,
it became immediately clear

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.087
that comets were ideal bodies to study
to understand our solar system.
