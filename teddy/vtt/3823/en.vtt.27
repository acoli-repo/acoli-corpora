00:13:28.935 --> 00:13:32.545
There is a very intriguing crack
in the neck of the comet.

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:34.541
You see it on the right-hand side.

00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:38.237
It's a kilometer long,
and it's two and a half meters wide.

00:13:38.237 --> 00:13:40.483
Some people suggest that actually,

00:13:40.483 --> 00:13:42.551
when we get close to the sun,

00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:44.409
the comet may split in two,

00:13:44.409 --> 00:13:46.089
and then we'll have to choose,

00:13:46.089 --> 00:13:48.341
which comet do we go for?

00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:51.514
The lander -- again, lots of instruments,

00:13:51.514 --> 00:13:56.855
mostly comparable except for the things
which hammer in the ground and drill, etc.

00:13:56.855 --> 00:14:00.732
But much the same as Rosetta, and that is
because you want to compare
