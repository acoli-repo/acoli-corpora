This is one of the cameras of Rosetta,
the OSIRIS camera,

00:12:32.943 --> 00:12:35.938
and this actually was the cover
of Science magazine

00:12:35.938 --> 00:12:38.608
on January 23 of this year.

00:12:38.608 --> 00:12:42.046
Nobody had expected
this body to look like this.

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:45.644
Boulders, rocks -- if anything, it looks
more like the Half Dome in Yosemite

00:12:45.644 --> 00:12:48.151
than anything else.

00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:50.729
We also saw things like this:

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:55.651
dunes, and what look to be,
on the righthand side, wind-blown shadows.

00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:59.575
Now we know these from Mars,
but this comet doesn't have an atmosphere,

00:12:59.575 --> 00:13:02.454
so it's a bit difficult to create
a wind-blown shadow.
