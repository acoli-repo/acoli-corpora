00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:32.882
we left Earth in 2004

00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:35.970
to the newly selected comet,
Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.826
This comet had to be specially selected

00:03:38.826 --> 00:03:41.480
because A, you have to
be able to get to it,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.261
and B, it shouldn't have been
in the solar system too long.

00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:48.208
This particular comet has been 
in the solar system since 1959.

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:51.523
That's the first time
when it was deflected by Jupiter,

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:54.500
and it got close enough
to the sun to start changing.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.151
So it's a very fresh comet.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.502
Rosetta made a few historic firsts.

00:03:59.502 --> 00:04:02.018
It's the first satellite to orbit a comet,
