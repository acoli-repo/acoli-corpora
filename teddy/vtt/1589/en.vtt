A couple of years ago,

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:04.241
Harvard Business School chose

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:06.990
the best business model of that year.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.054
It chose Somali piracy.

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:13.270
Pretty much around the same time,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.103
I discovered that there were 544 seafarers

00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:22.489
being held hostage on ships,

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.579
often anchored just off the Somali coast

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.007
in plain sight.

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.632
And I learned these two facts, and I thought,

00:00:29.632 --> 00:00:32.073
what's going on in shipping?
