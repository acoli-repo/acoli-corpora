As a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion.

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:11.718
And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the

00:00:11.718 --> 00:00:13.795
early part of the 20th century.

00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:15.711
It used mirrors

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:18.509
to create the illusion of tiny people

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.549
performing on a miniature stage. Now, I won't use mirrors,

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:27.645
but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater.

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:34.108
So let the story begin.
