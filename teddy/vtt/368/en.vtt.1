00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:34.108
So let the story begin.

00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:39.046
On a dark and stormy night -- really! --

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:43.149
it was the 10th of July, 1856.

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:45.101
Lightning lit the sky,

00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:47.188
and a baby was born.

00:00:47.188 --> 00:00:50.196
His name was Nikola,

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:51.840
Nikola Tesla.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.860
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.004
Let me show you.

00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:04.552
Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501?
