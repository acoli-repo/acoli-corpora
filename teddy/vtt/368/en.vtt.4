he would build them in his workshop.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.382
NT: I needed no models, drawings or experiments.

00:02:04.382 --> 00:02:08.139
I could picture them as real in my mind,

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.669
and there I run it, test it and improve it.

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.523
Only then do I construct it.

00:02:14.523 --> 00:02:15.620
MT: His great idea

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.771
was alternating current.

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.275
But how could he convince the public that

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:25.309
the millions of volts required to make it work were safe?

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.051
To sell his idea,

00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:29.635
he became a showman.

00:02:29.635 --> 00:02:34.937
