Nikola Tesla: The result is 118,236.

00:01:09.098 --> 00:01:13.671
Marco Tempest: Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way.

00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:15.824
When a word was mentioned,

00:01:15.824 --> 00:01:16.887

00:01:16.887 --> 00:01:20.088
instantly appeared in his mind.

00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:25.800
