00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:11.880
In 2009, two researchers ran 
a simple experiment.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.055
They took everything we know 
about our solar system

00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:21.107
and calculated where every planet would be
up to 5 billion years in the future.

00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:25.107
To do so they ran over 2,000 
numerical simulations

00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:29.829
with the same exact initial conditions
except for one difference:

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.136
the distance between Mercury and the Sun,
modified by less than a millimeter
