Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I professionally watch YouTube videos.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's true.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then why that even matters.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We all want to be stars --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
celebrities, singers, comedians --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But now Web video has made it

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
can become completely famous

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in a part of our world's culture.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
by next Saturday.
