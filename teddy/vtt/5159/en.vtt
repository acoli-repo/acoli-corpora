In January of 1953, a tidal surge 
shook the North Sea.

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.602
The titanic waves flooded 
the Dutch coastline,

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:19.425
killing almost 2,000 people.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:23.491
54 years later, a similar storm 
threatened the region.

00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.451
But this time, the Netherlands 
were ready.

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:27.801
As the water swelled,

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:32.469
state-of-the-art computer sensors 
activated emergency protocols.
