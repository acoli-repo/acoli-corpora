00:06:59.217 --> 00:07:00.688
between light blue, "goluboy,"

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:02.288
and dark blue, "siniy."

00:07:03.138 --> 00:07:07.121
So Russians have this lifetime
of experience of, in language,

00:07:07.145 --> 00:07:09.014
distinguishing these two colors.

00:07:09.038 --> 00:07:13.001
When we test people's ability
to perceptually discriminate these colors,

00:07:13.025 --> 00:07:15.546
what we find is that
Russian speakers are faster

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.128
across this linguistic boundary.

00:07:17.152 --> 00:07:19.434
They're faster to be able
to tell the difference

00:07:19.458 --> 00:07:20.916
between a light and dark blue.

00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:24.563
And when you look at people's brains
as they're looking at colors --

00:07:24.587 --> 00:07:27.922
say you have colors shifting slowly
from light to dark blue --

00:07:28.798 --> 00:07:33.250
the brains of people who use
different words for light and dark blue
