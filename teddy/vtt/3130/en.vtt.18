00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.218
In English, it's fine to say,
"He broke the vase."

00:09:01.869 --> 00:09:04.413
In a language like Spanish,

00:09:04.437 --> 00:09:07.284
you might be more likely
to say, "The vase broke,"

00:09:07.308 --> 00:09:08.869
or, "The vase broke itself."

00:09:09.332 --> 00:09:12.554
If it's an accident, you wouldn't say
that someone did it.

00:09:12.578 --> 00:09:15.984
In English, quite weirdly,
we can even say things like,

00:09:16.008 --> 00:09:17.255
"I broke my arm."

00:09:17.953 --> 00:09:19.787
Now, in lots of languages,

00:09:19.811 --> 00:09:22.982
you couldn't use that construction
unless you are a lunatic

00:09:23.006 --> 00:09:25.135
and you went out
looking to break your arm --

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:26.161
(Laughter)

00:09:26.185 --> 00:09:27.336
and you succeeded.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.624
If it was an accident,
you would use a different construction.
