00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:01.775
while thinking about quantum mechanics."

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:03.197
(Laughter)

00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:06.249
Now, if everything has gone
relatively well in your life so far,

00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:08.385
you probably haven't had
that thought before.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.411
(Laughter)

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.167
But now I've just made you think it,

00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:12.346
through language.

00:01:12.654 --> 00:01:15.378
Now of course, there isn't just
one language in the world,

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:18.047
there are about 7,000 languages
spoken around the world.

00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:21.231
And all the languages differ
from one another in all kinds of ways.

00:01:21.255 --> 00:01:24.346
Some languages have different sounds,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.089
they have different vocabularies,

00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:28.152
and they also have different structures --

00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:30.063
very importantly, different structures.
