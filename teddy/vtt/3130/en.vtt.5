They live in Pormpuraaw
at the very west edge of Cape York.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.587
What's cool about Kuuk Thaayorre is,

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:36.669
in Kuuk Thaayorre, they don't use
words like "left" and "right,"

00:02:36.693 --> 00:02:39.377
and instead, everything
is in cardinal directions:

00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:40.825
north, south, east and west.

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:43.960
And when I say everything,
I really mean everything.

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:45.535
You would say something like,

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.071
"Oh, there's an ant
on your southwest leg."

00:02:49.178 --> 00:02:51.834
Or, "Move your cup
to the north-northeast a little bit."

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:55.884
In fact, the way that you say "hello"
in Kuuk Thaayorre is you say,

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:57.174
"Which way are you going?"

00:02:57.198 --> 00:02:58.530
And the answer should be,

00:02:59.014 --> 00:03:00.786
"North-northeast in the far distance.
