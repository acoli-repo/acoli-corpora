So, two people watch the same event,

00:10:04.785 --> 00:10:06.866

00:10:10.564 --> 00:10:13.823
This has implications, of course,
for eyewitness testimony.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.952
It also has implications
for blame and punishment.

00:10:25.504 --> 00:10:27.417
even though you can witness it yourself,

00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:28.709
you can watch the video,

00:10:28.733 --> 00:10:30.895
you can watch the crime against the vase,
