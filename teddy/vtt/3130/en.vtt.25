00:12:25.775 --> 00:12:30.306
Human minds have invented
not one cognitive universe, but 7,000 --

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.688
there are 7,000 languages
spoken around the world.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.687
And we can create many more --

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:38.794
languages, of course, are living things,

00:12:38.818 --> 00:12:42.584
things that we can hone
and change to suit our needs.

00:12:43.786 --> 00:12:47.269
The tragic thing is that we're losing
so much of this linguistic diversity

00:12:47.293 --> 00:12:48.444
all the time.

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:50.360
We're losing about one language a week,

00:12:50.384 --> 00:12:51.850
and by some estimates,

00:12:51.874 --> 00:12:55.141
half of the world's languages
will be gone in the next hundred years.

00:12:55.966 --> 00:12:58.788
And the even worse news is that right now,

00:12:58.812 --> 00:13:02.520
almost everything we know about
the human mind and human brain
