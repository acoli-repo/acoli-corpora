00:10:28.733 --> 00:10:30.895
you can watch the crime against the vase,

00:10:32.157 --> 00:10:33.924
you will punish someone more,

00:10:33.948 --> 00:10:36.801
you will blame someone more
if I just said, "He broke it,"

00:10:36.825 --> 00:10:38.318
as opposed to, "It broke."

00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:42.254
The language guides
our reasoning about events.

00:10:43.996 --> 00:10:46.882
Now, I've given you a few examples

00:10:46.906 --> 00:10:50.633
of how language can profoundly
shape the way we think,

00:10:50.657 --> 00:10:52.832
and it does so in a variety of ways.

00:10:52.856 --> 00:10:54.787
So language can have big effects,

00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:56.553
like we saw with space and time,

00:10:56.577 --> 00:10:58.483
where people can lay out space and time

00:10:58.507 --> 00:11:01.748
in completely different
coordinate frames from each other.
