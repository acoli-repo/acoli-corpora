00:07:28.798 --> 00:07:33.250
the brains of people who use
different words for light and dark blue

00:07:33.274 --> 00:07:36.784
will give a surprised reaction
as the colors shift from light to dark,

00:07:36.808 --> 00:07:39.990
as if, "Ooh, something
has categorically changed,"

00:07:40.014 --> 00:07:42.460
whereas the brains
of English speakers, for example,

00:07:42.484 --> 00:07:44.624
that don't make
this categorical distinction,

00:07:44.648 --> 00:07:45.844
don't give that surprise,

00:07:45.868 --> 00:07:47.951
because nothing is categorically changing.

00:07:50.054 --> 00:07:52.558
Languages have all kinds
of structural quirks.

00:07:52.582 --> 00:07:53.919
This is one of my favorites.

00:07:53.943 --> 00:07:56.375
Lots of languages have grammatical gender;

00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:01.029
every noun gets assigned a gender,
often masculine or feminine.
