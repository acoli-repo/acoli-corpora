00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:01.029
every noun gets assigned a gender,
often masculine or feminine.

00:08:01.053 --> 00:08:03.110
And these genders differ across languages.

00:08:03.134 --> 00:08:07.675
So, for example, the sun is feminine
in German but masculine in Spanish,

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:09.047
and the moon, the reverse.

00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:13.096
Could this actually have any
consequence for how people think?

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.114
Do German speakers think of the sun
as somehow more female-like,

00:08:17.138 --> 00:08:19.044
and the moon somehow more male-like?

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:21.673
Actually, it turns out that's the case.

00:08:21.697 --> 00:08:27.120
So if you ask German and Spanish speakers
to, say, describe a bridge,

00:08:27.144 --> 00:08:28.580
like the one here --

00:08:28.604 --> 00:08:31.953
"bridge" happens to be grammatically
feminine in German,
