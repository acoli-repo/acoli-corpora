00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.783
I've told you about how speakers
of different languages think differently,

00:13:31.807 --> 00:13:35.091
but of course, that's not about
how people elsewhere think.

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:36.534
It's about how you think.

00:13:36.558 --> 00:13:40.164
It's how the language that you speak
shapes the way that you think.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.646
And that gives you the opportunity to ask,

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.741
"Why do I think the way that I do?"

00:13:45.765 --> 00:13:47.361
"How could I think differently?"

00:13:47.908 --> 00:13:49.273
And also,

00:13:49.297 --> 00:13:51.024
"What thoughts do I wish to create?"

00:13:51.842 --> 00:13:53.001
Thank you very much.

00:13:53.025 --> 00:13:55.781
