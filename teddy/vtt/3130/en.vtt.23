Language can also have
really early effects,

00:11:30.739 --> 00:11:33.609
what we saw in the case of color.

00:11:34.205 --> 00:11:36.699
These are really simple,
basic, perceptual decisions.

00:11:36.723 --> 00:11:39.083
We make thousands of them all the time,

00:11:39.107 --> 00:11:40.924
and yet, language is getting in there

00:11:40.948 --> 00:11:45.279
and fussing even with these tiny little
perceptual decisions that we make.

00:11:46.787 --> 00:11:48.646
Language can have really broad effects.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.898
So the case of grammatical gender
may be a little silly,

00:11:51.922 --> 00:11:55.755
but at the same time,
grammatical gender applies to all nouns.

00:11:56.061 --> 00:11:58.350
That means language can shape
how you're thinking

00:11:58.374 --> 00:12:01.261
about anything that can be
named by a noun.
