But folks who don't have
that linguistic trick can't do that.

00:06:35.653 --> 00:06:38.807
Languages also differ in how
they divide up the color spectrum --

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:39.981
the visual world.

00:06:40.348 --> 00:06:42.500
Some languages have
lots of words for colors,

00:06:42.524 --> 00:06:44.888
some have only a couple words,
"light" and "dark."

00:06:44.912 --> 00:06:48.535
And languages differ in where they put
boundaries between colors.

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:51.774
So, for example, in English,
there's a word for blue

00:06:51.798 --> 00:06:54.933
that covers all of the colors
that you can see on the screen,

00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:56.963
but in Russian, there isn't a single word.

00:06:56.987 --> 00:06:59.193
Instead, Russian speakers
have to differentiate

00:06:59.217 --> 00:07:00.688
between light blue, "goluboy,"
