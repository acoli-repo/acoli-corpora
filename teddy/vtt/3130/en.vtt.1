00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:32.602
and then your brain takes
those vibrations from your eardrums

00:00:32.626 --> 00:00:35.379
and transforms them into thoughts.

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:37.182
I hope.

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:38.209
(Laughter)

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:39.390
I hope that's happening.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:43.990
So because of this ability,
we humans are able to transmit our ideas

00:00:44.014 --> 00:00:46.706
across vast reaches of space and time.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.266
We're able to transmit
knowledge across minds.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.451
I can put a bizarre new idea
in your mind right now.

00:00:54.475 --> 00:00:55.630
I could say,

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:59.575
"Imagine a jellyfish waltzing in a library

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:01.775
while thinking about quantum mechanics."
