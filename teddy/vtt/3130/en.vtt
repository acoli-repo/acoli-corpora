So, I'll be speaking to you
using language ...

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.610
because I can.

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:08.787
This is one these magical abilities
that we humans have.

00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:13.066
We can transmit really complicated
thoughts to one another.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.074
So what I'm doing right now is,
I'm making sounds with my mouth

00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:18.313
as I'm exhaling.

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:20.685
I'm making tones and hisses and puffs,

00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:23.719
and those are creating
air vibrations in the air.

00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:26.189
Those air vibrations are traveling to you,

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:27.998
they're hitting your eardrums,

00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:32.602
and then your brain takes
those vibrations from your eardrums
