00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:02.932
These arguments have gone
back and forth for thousands of years.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.131
But until recently,
there hasn't been any data

00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:07.711
to help us decide either way.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.682
Recently, in my lab
and other labs around the world,

00:02:10.706 --> 00:02:12.098
we've started doing research,

00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:16.559
and now we have actual scientific data
to weigh in on this question.

00:02:16.918 --> 00:02:19.459
So let me tell you about
some of my favorite examples.

00:02:19.846 --> 00:02:23.260
I'll start with an example
from an Aboriginal community in Australia

00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:25.012
that I had the chance to work with.

00:02:25.036 --> 00:02:26.779
These are the Kuuk Thaayorre people.

00:02:26.803 --> 00:02:30.597
They live in Pormpuraaw
at the very west edge of Cape York.
