00:03:29.716 --> 00:03:31.432
because of some biological excuse:

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:34.781
"Oh, we don't have magnets
in our beaks or in our scales."

00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:37.747
No; if your language and your culture
trains you to do it,

00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:39.020
actually, you can do it.

00:03:39.044 --> 00:03:42.084
There are humans around the world
who stay oriented really well.

00:03:42.108 --> 00:03:44.236
And just to get us in agreement

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.855
about how different this is
from the way we do it,

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.643
I want you all to close
your eyes for a second

00:03:50.887 --> 00:03:52.240
and point southeast.

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:53.974
(Laughter)

00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:55.576
Keep your eyes closed. Point.

00:03:58.095 --> 00:04:00.112
OK, so you can open your eyes.
