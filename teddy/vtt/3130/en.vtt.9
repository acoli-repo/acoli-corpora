00:04:27.258 --> 00:04:30.678
There are also really big differences
in how people think about time.

00:04:30.702 --> 00:04:34.719
So here I have pictures
of my grandfather at different ages.

00:04:34.743 --> 00:04:37.970
And if I ask an English speaker
to organize time,

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:39.479
they might lay it out this way,

00:04:39.503 --> 00:04:40.654
from left to right.

00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:42.509
This has to do with writing direction.

00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:44.559
If you were a speaker of Hebrew or Arabic,

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:46.873
you might do it going
in the opposite direction,

00:04:46.897 --> 00:04:48.047
from right to left.

00:04:49.578 --> 00:04:51.163
But how would the Kuuk Thaayorre,

00:04:51.187 --> 00:04:53.581
this Aboriginal group I just
told you about, do it?

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:55.723
They don't use words
like "left" and "right."

00:04:55.747 --> 00:04:57.239
Let me give you hint.

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:59.814
When we sat people facing south,

00:04:59.838 --> 00:05:01.696
they organized time from left to right.
