00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:30.063
very importantly, different structures.

00:01:30.896 --> 00:01:32.088
That begs the question:

00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:34.724
Does the language we speak
shape the way we think?

00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:36.320
Now, this is an ancient question.

00:01:36.344 --> 00:01:39.515
People have been speculating
about this question forever.

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.856
Charlemagne, Holy Roman emperor, said,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.916
"To have a second language
is to have a second soul" --

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.443
strong statement
that language crafts reality.

00:01:47.992 --> 00:01:50.982
But on the other hand,
Shakespeare has Juliet say,

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:52.157
"What's in a name?

00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:54.515
A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet."

00:01:55.504 --> 00:01:58.557
Well, that suggests that maybe
language doesn't craft reality.

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:02.932
These arguments have gone
back and forth for thousands of years.
