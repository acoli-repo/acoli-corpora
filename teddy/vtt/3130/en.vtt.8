00:03:58.095 --> 00:04:00.112
OK, so you can open your eyes.

00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:03.915
I see you guys pointing there,
there, there, there, there ...

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.407
I don't know which way it is myself --

00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:08.095
(Laughter)

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:09.777
You have not been a lot of help.

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:11.118
(Laughter)

00:04:11.142 --> 00:04:14.062
So let's just say the accuracy
in this room was not very high.

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:17.446
This is a big difference in cognitive
ability across languages, right?

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.865
Where one group -- very
distinguished group like you guys --

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.452
doesn't know which way is which,

00:04:22.476 --> 00:04:23.812
but in another group,

00:04:23.836 --> 00:04:26.126
I could ask a five-year-old
and they would know.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.234
(Laughter)

00:04:27.258 --> 00:04:30.678
There are also really big differences
in how people think about time.
