00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.624
If it was an accident,
you would use a different construction.

00:09:30.648 --> 00:09:32.453
Now, this has consequences.

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:36.665
So, people who speak different languages
will pay attention to different things,

00:09:36.689 --> 00:09:40.095
depending on what their language
usually requires them to do.

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:44.291
So we show the same accident
to English speakers and Spanish speakers,

00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:47.600
English speakers will remember who did it,

00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:51.939
because English requires you
to say, "He did it; he broke the vase."

00:09:51.963 --> 00:09:55.166
Whereas Spanish speakers might be
less likely to remember who did it

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.341
if it's an accident,

00:09:56.365 --> 00:09:59.194
but they're more likely to remember
that it was an accident.

00:09:59.218 --> 00:10:01.654
They're more likely
to remember the intention.
