00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.121
Wow, this is bright.

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:06.112
It must use a lot of power.

00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:07.604
Well, flying you all in here

00:00:07.604 --> 00:00:10.052
must have cost a bit of energy too.

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:12.970
So the whole planet needs a lot of energy,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.871
and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel.

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.920
We've been burning gas.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.307
It's been a good run.

00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:22.175
It got us to where we are, but we have to stop.

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:24.329
We can't do that anymore.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.610
So we are trying different types of energy now,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.824
alternative energy,

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:30.322
but it proved quite difficult to find something
