00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The story starts in Kenya

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in December of 2007,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
when there was a disputed presidential election,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and in the immediate aftermath of that election,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
there was an outbreak of ethnic violence.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And there was a lawyer in Nairobi, Ory Okolloh --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
who some of you may know from her TEDTalk --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
who began blogging about it on her site,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Kenyan Pundit.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the government suddenly imposed

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a significant media blackout.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And so weblogs went from being

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
commentary as part of the media landscape
