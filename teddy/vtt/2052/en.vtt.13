00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
how much we do things because we like to do them

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
rather than because our boss told us to do them,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
or because we're being paid to do them.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
This is a graph from a paper

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
who set out to test, at the beginning of this decade,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
what they called "deterrence theory."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior:

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
If you want somebody to do less of something,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
add a punishment and they'll do less of it.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Simple, straightforward, commonsensical --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
also, largely untested.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And so they went and studied

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
10 daycare centers in Haifa, Israel.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
They studied those daycare centers
