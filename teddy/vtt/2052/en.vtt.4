00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and turn it into a platform.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's since been deployed in Mexico

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to track electoral fraud.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And it's been used most famously in Haiti

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
in the aftermath of the earthquake.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And when you look at the map

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
now posted on the Ushahidi front page,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
has gone worldwide, all right?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This went from a single idea

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and a single implementation

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in East Africa in the beginning of 2008

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to a global deployment
