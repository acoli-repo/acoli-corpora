WEBVTT

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
can achieve incredible effects

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
without an enormous amount of contractual overhead --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
a very different model

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
What's going to make the difference here

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
is what Dean Kamen said,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
the inventor and entrepreneur.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Kamen said, "Free cultures get what they celebrate."

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
We've got a choice before us.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
We've got this trillion hours a year.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
We can use it to crack each other up, and we're going to do that.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
That, we get for free.
