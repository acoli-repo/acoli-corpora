00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
"Where, oh where, can I find a picture

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
of a cute cat?"

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Ushahidi, by contrast,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
is civic value.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
It's value created by the participants

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
but enjoyed by society as a whole.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
The goals set out by Ushahidi

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
are not just to make life better

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
for the participants,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
but to make life better for everyone in the society

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
in which Ushahidi is operating.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And that kind of civic value

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
is not just a side effect

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
of opening up to human motivation.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It really is going to be a side effect
