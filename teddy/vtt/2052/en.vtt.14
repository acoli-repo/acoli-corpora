00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
10 daycare centers in Haifa, Israel.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
They studied those daycare centers

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
at the time of highest tension,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
which is pick-up time.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
At pick-up time the teachers,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
who have been with your children all day,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Meanwhile, the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work, running late, running errands --

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
want a little slack to pick the kids up late.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So Gneezy and Rustichini said,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
"How many instances of late pick-ups

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
are there at these 10 daycare centers?"

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Now they saw -- and this is what the graph is,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that there were between six and 10
