WEBVTT

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to a global deployment

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in less than three years.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now what Okolloh did

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
would not have been possible

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
without digital technology.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What Okolloh did would not have been possible

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
without human generosity.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And the interesting moment now,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the number of environments

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
where the social design challenge

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
relies on both of those things being true.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That is the resource that I'm talking about.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I call it cognitive surplus.
