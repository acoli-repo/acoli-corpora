WEBVTT

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and we like to share.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And it's those two things together --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
ancient human motivation

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and the modern tools to allow that motivation

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
to be joined up in large-scale efforts --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that are the new design resource.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And using cognitive surplus,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
we're starting to see truly incredible experiments

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in scientific, literary,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
artistic, political efforts.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Designing.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
We're also getting, of course, a lot of LOLcats.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
LOLcats are cute pictures of cats
