WEBVTT

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And so weblogs went from being

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
commentary as part of the media landscape

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to being a critical part of the media landscape

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in trying to understand where the violence was.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And Okolloh solicited

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
from her commenters

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
more information about what was going on.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The comments began pouring in,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and Okolloh would collate them. She would post them.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And she quickly said, "It's too much.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I could do this all day every day

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and I can't keep up.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
There is more information

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
about what's going on in Kenya right now

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
than any one person can manage.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If only there was a way to automate this."
