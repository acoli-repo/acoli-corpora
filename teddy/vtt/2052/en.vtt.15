00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that there were between six and 10

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
instances of late pick-ups

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
on average in these 10 daycare centers.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So they divided the daycare centers into two groups.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
The white group there

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is the control group; they change nothing.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
they said, "We are changing this bargain

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
as of right now.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
If you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
we're going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Boom. No ifs, ands or buts."

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And the minute they did that,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
the behavior in those daycare centers changed.
