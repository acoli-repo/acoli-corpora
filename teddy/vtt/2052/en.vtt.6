00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I call it cognitive surplus.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And it represents the ability

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of the world's population

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
on large, sometimes global, projects.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Cognitive surplus is made up of two things.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The first, obviously, is the world's free time and talents.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The world has over

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
a trillion hours a year

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
of free time

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to commit to shared projects.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Now, that free time existed in the 20th century,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
That's the second half of cognitive surplus.
