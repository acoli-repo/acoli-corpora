00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
when you're really designing for generosity.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
This brings me back to the LOLcats

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and to Ushahidi.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
This is, I think, the range that matters.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Both of these rely on cognitive surplus.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Both of these design for the assumption

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
that people like to create and we want to share.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Here is the critical difference between these:

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
LOLcats is communal value.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It's value created by the participants

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
for each other.
