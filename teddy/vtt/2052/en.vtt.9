LOLcats are cute pictures of cats

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
made cuter with the addition of cute captions.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And they are also

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
This is one of the participatory --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
one of the participatory models

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
we see coming out of that, along with Ushahidi.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Now I want to stipulate, as the lawyers say,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that LOLcats are the stupidest possible

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
creative act.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
There are other candidates of course,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
but LOLcats will do as a general case.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But here's the thing:

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The stupidest possible creative act
