00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The stupidest possible creative act

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
is still a creative act.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Someone who has done something like this,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
however mediocre and throwaway,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
has tried something, has put something forward in public.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And once they've done it, they can do it again,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and they could work on getting it better.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
it's a spectrum you're constantly

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
struggling to get on top of.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
The gap is between

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
doing anything and doing nothing.
