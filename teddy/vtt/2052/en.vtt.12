00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So before I talk about

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
what is, I think, the critical difference

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
between LOLcats and Ushahidi,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I want to talk about

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
their shared source.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And that source is design for generosity.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It is one of the curiosities of our historical era

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
that even as cognitive surplus

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
is becoming a resource we can design around,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
social sciences are also starting to explain

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
how important

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
our intrinsic motivations are to us,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
how much we do things because we like to do them

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
rather than because our boss told us to do them,
