00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
because what it does is it takes the tacit information

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
available to the whole population --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
everybody knows where the violence is,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but no one person knows what everyone knows --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and it takes that tacit information

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and it aggregates it,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and it maps it and it makes it public.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And that, that maneuver

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
called "crisis mapping,"

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
was kicked off in Kenya

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in January of 2008.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that the programmers who created Ushahidi

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
decided they were going to make it open source

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and turn it into a platform.
