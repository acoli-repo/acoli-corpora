00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
for each other.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Communal value on the networks we have

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
is everywhere --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
every time you see a large aggregate

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
of shared, publicly available data,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
whether it's photos on Flickr

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
or videos on Youtube or whatever.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
This is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
maybe a little more even,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but this is also

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
a largely solved problem.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I have a hard time envisioning a future

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
in which someone is saying,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
"Where, oh where, can I find a picture

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
of a cute cat?"
