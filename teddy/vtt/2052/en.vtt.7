00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
That's the second half of cognitive surplus.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The media landscape in the 20th century

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
was very good at helping people consume,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and we got, as a result,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
very good at consuming.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But now that we've been given media tools --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the Internet, mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
because we liked to be.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We were couch potatoes because that was

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the only opportunity given to us.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
We still like to consume, of course.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
But it turns out we also like to create,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and we like to share.
