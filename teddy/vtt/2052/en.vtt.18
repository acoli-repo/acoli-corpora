00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
the daycare center had no contract --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
should have been operating without any constraints.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
But that's not right.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
They were operating with social constraints

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
rather than contractual ones.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And critically, the social constraints

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
created a culture that was more generous

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
than the contractual constraints did.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
run the fine for a dozen weeks --

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and then they say, "Okay, that's it. All done; fine."

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And then a really interesting thing happens:

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Nothing changes.
