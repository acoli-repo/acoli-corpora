00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Today, with diabetes, what do we do?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
But eventually it stops working,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
perhaps even before it was symptomatic?
