00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and I'm going to start with materials.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh --

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
if you threw away all the cells,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
may contain all of the necessary factors and signals

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that would signal the body to heal itself.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And he asked a very important question.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
He asked the question,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
if I take that material, which is a natural material

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
that usually induces healing in the small intestine,
