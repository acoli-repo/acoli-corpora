00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
If the average age of your population is 30,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
then the average kind of disease that you have to treat

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
is maybe a broken ankle every now and again,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
maybe a little bit of asthma.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
now the average person is looking at diabetes,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease --

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
things that are inherently more difficult to treat,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and much more expensive to treat.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
