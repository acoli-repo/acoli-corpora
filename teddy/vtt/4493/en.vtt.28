00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
We need all sorts of new technology, new devices,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
to get the cells to the right place at the right time.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
This was a randomized trial.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
These are now two years out.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early,
