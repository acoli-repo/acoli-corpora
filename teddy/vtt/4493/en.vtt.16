00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
will re-grow that limb.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
It's a natural process,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
but it is lost as we age.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
In a child, before the age of about six months,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
if they lose their fingertip in an accident,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
they'll re-grow their fingertip.
