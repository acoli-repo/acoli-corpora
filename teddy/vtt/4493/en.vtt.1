00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
for which there's relatively little that can be done.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And what I want to lay out for you today is

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
why it's important,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
if you think it already hasn't,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and what some of the hurdles are.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I want to start with this slide,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This was an issue from 2002

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
