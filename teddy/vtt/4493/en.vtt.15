00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
similar actually one on the soldier

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that's come back from Iraq.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
face the regeneration of that limb.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
It's a wild concept.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But it's applicable, again, to every organ system.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
How can we do that?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
We need to learn to speak the body's language.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
