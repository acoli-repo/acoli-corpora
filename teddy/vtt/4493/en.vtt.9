00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
when the reality of getting old looks like this?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
This is age versus cost of health care.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
plotted over your lifetime.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And you can actually --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
