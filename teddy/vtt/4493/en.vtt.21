the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
(Laughter)

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This is the reality of diabetes.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
which is amputation, if you can't heal it.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.
