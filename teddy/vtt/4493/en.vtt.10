00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
(Laughter)

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
-- we won't get into that.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
(Laughter)

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
There are very few things, very few things that you can really do

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and experience what I would call healthy aging.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I'd suggest there are four things,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
All those things do is change who pays.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.
