They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
You can prevent.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and then treating the disease to cure the disease

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
instead of treating a symptom.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
