00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
This is not regenerative medicine.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
with devices and drugs and the like --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and I'll come back to that theme a few times --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.
