00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
with a difference.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
In this case, at the end of the bypass operation,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
you're going to see the stem cells from the patient

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that were removed at the beginning of the procedure

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
being injected directly into the heart of the patient.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And I'm standing up here because at one point

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And if you look really carefully,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
it's going to be right around this point

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
you'll actually see a back-flush.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
You see the cells coming back out.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
We need all sorts of new technology, new devices,
