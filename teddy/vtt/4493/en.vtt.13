perhaps even before it was symptomatic?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This is a newt re-growing its limb.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I'll actually show you some more important features

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
about limb regeneration in a moment.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
is doing this in every organ system of the body,
