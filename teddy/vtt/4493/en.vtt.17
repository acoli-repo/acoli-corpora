00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
they'll re-grow their fingertip.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So to engage in that conversation with the body,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
we need to speak the body's language.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
through which to converse with the body.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
The first is cellular therapies.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
using cells to do most of the work.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Therefore, if we can find the right cells

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.
