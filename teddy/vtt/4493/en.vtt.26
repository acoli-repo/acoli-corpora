This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
He chills the dish, it changes its properties

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and he peels it right out of the dish.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It's the coolest stuff.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Now I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And what I'm going to show you here

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
But this one's kind of cool.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
with a difference.
