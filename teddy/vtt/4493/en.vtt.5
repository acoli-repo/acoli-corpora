00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
to begin to think about, could you culture organs?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And they published this book in 1937,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
where they actually began to think about,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We've come a long way since then.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
But before doing that, what I'd like to do

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
is share my depression about the health care system

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and the need for this with you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Many of the talks yesterday talked about

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
