00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Therefore, if we can find the right cells

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Secondly, we can use materials.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
If we can invent materials, design materials,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
or extract materials from a natural environment,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And finally, we may be able to use smart devices

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I'm going to show you an example of each of these,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and I'm going to start with materials.
