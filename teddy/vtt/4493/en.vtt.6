00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And the longer we live, the more expensive it is

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to take care of our diseases as we get older.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
This is simply the wealth of a country

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
versus the percent of population over the age of 65.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And you can basically see that the richer a country is,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the older the people are within it.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Why is this important?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
