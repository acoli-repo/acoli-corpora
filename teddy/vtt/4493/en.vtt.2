This was an issue from 2002

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that everybody can understand.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to a clinically relevant timescale.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.
