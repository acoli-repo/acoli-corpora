00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
That material contained only natural signals.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that it didn't have before.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you --

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I'll let you know when you can look again.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
The horse just has another nostril that's developed

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
because of a riding accident.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Just a few weeks after treatment --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times --

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and the horse heals up.
