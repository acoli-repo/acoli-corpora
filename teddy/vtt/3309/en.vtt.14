00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:04.250
as I constantly checked my temperature
then and throughout the outbreak.

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:10.101
The Ebola fight was probably
the most challenging

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:13.018
but rewarding experience of my life,

00:07:13.042 --> 00:07:14.976
and I'm really grateful

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.601
for the dissatisfaction

00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:18.643
that opened up the space

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:20.083
for me to serve.

00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:25.351
Dissatisfaction can be
a constant presence in the background,

00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:26.809
or it can be sudden,

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:28.500
triggered by events.

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:30.917
Sometimes it's both.
