00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:31.393
The vagueness of those telephone
conversations disappointed me.

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:34.059
It felt like the people
who were raising the money

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:36.559
seemed so far removed from the crisis,

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:38.851
and understandably so,

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:40.559
but I wasn't satisfied

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.393
and I wasn't convinced

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:46.018
that the interventions
they would eventually implement

00:01:46.042 --> 00:01:49.250
would actually have the level of impact
that was so clearly needed.

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:53.018
There were butterflies
in my stomach for days

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:56.726
as I continued to watch
horrors unfold on television,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.309
and I continuously asked myself,

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.143
what could I be doing?
