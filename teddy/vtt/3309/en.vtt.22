00:10:56.917 --> 00:11:00.101
We're not happy about
the way things are going.

00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:02.018
We feel dissatisfied,

00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:03.292
and we feel frustrated.

00:11:04.708 --> 00:11:07.667
We can change that negative
into a positive.

00:11:10.083 --> 00:11:14.101
If you believe that things can be better,

00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:19.809
then you have the option to do something
rather than to do nothing.

00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:24.143
The scale and circumstances
of our situations will differ,

00:11:24.167 --> 00:11:25.542
but for each of us,

00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.625
we all have one thing in common.
