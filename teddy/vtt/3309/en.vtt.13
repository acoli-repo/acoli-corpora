00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:30.976
trying to stay ahead of the outbreak

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.643
but also following it

00:06:32.667 --> 00:06:34.893
to remote villages in the provinces

00:06:34.917 --> 00:06:38.601
as well as to urban slum communities.

00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:41.684
On one occasion, I got out of my car

00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:44.417
to call for help for a man
who had collapsed on the road.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:48.143
I accidentally stepped in liquid

00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:50.976
that was coming down the road
from where he lay.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.726
I rushed to my parents' house,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.101
washed my feet in chlorine.

00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:59.559
I'll never forget waiting
for that man's test results

00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:04.250
as I constantly checked my temperature
then and throughout the outbreak.
