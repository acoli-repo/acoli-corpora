00:03:56.917 --> 00:04:03.143
I was working in Freetown at the time
on a hotel construction project on May 25

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:05.351
when the first cases were announced,

00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:08.809
but I was back in London on July 30

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:12.143
when the state of emergency was announced,

00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:17.208
the same day that many airlines
stopped their flights to Sierra Leone.

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:20.684
I remember crying for hours,

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:24.208
asking God, why this? Why us?

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:27.643
But beyond the tears,

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.018
I began to feel again
