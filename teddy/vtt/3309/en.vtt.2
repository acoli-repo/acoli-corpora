00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:01.434
My husband's elderly aunt
was burned alive,

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:04.434
and I thought of my own two-year old

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:07.875
as I saw images of little children
with amputated limbs.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.809
Colleagues said to me,

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:12.726
"How could we help?"

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.601
I didn't know,

00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:18.893
so I began to call the telephone numbers
that came up on my screen

00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:22.434
as international aid agencies
started to make appeals

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:25.458
to raise money to address the tragedy.

00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:31.393
The vagueness of those telephone
conversations disappointed me.
