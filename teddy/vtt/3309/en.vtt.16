00:07:55.958 --> 00:08:00.309
Went fishing in the streams
deep in the botanical gardens.

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:06.559
The hillsides around Freetown
were covered with lush green vegetation,

00:08:06.583 --> 00:08:08.893
and the beaches were clean and pristine.

00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:13.476
The doubling of the population of Freetown
in the years that followed the civil war,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.851
and the lack of planning
and building control

00:08:16.875 --> 00:08:19.458
resulted in massive deforestation.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:24.851
The trees, the natural beauty,
were destroyed as space was made

00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:27.559
for new communities, formal or informal,

00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:30.351
and for the cutting down of firewood.
