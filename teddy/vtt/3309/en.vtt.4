00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.143
what could I be doing?

00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:02.934
What should I be doing?

00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.851
What I wanted to do was to help
children affected by the war.

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:08.125
So that's what we did.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.559
Myself, my sister and some friends

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:16.601
started the Sierra Leone
War Trust For Children, SLWT.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:20.059
We decided to focus
on the thousands of displaced people

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:21.809
that fled the fighting

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:25.351
and were now living
in really poor, difficult conditions

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:27.518
in camps in Freetown.

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:30.351
Our work started with the Ross Road Camp
