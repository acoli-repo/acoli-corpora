WEBVTT

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:30.351
Our work started with the Ross Road Camp

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:32.434
at the east end of the city.

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:35.268
Working with a local health organization,

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:40.434
we identified about 130
of the most vulnerable single mothers

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:43.059
with children under the age of five,

00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:48.476
supporting them
by providing business skills,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.434
microcredit,

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:52.684
whatever they asked us.

00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:55.476
Working in those difficult conditions,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.184
just getting the basics right,
was no small task,

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:02.351
but our collective sense
of dissatisfaction
