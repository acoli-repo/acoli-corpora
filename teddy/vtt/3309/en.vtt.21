00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:31.042
it's a much cleaner city,

00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:35.226
and those trees
that we're so well known for,

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.018
we planted 23,000 of them
last rainy season.

00:10:39.042 --> 00:10:40.309
(Applause)

00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:41.643
And in 2020,

00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:48.101
we plan to plant a million trees as part
of our "Freetown the Tree Town" campaign.

00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:51.226
(Applause)

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:56.042
Sometimes, sometimes we have
a negative feeling about things.

00:10:56.917 --> 00:11:00.101
We're not happy about
the way things are going.
