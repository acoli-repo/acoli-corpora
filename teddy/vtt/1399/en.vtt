00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
If you had caught me straight out of college

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
in the halls of the Vermont State House

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
where I was a lobbyist in training

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and asked me what I was going to do with my life,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I would have told you

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the Chinese equivalency exam,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I was going to go study law in Beijing,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and I was going to improve U.S.-China relations

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
through top-down policy changes

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and judicial system reforms.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
(Laughter)

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Applause)
