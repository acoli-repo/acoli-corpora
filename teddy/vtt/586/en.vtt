When I was young,

00:00:03.125 --> 00:00:04.458
I wanted to be on TV:

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.309
the lights, the cameras,

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.976
the makeup,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.417
the glamorous life.

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:14.101
And from my vantage point,

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:17.726
just outside of a military base
in Lawton, Oklahoma,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.726
I didn't make the distinction
between TV reporter or actor.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.351
It was all the same to me.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:24.643
It was either,

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.059
"Reporting live from Berlin"

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:30.518
or "I shall attend her here and woo her
with such spirit when she comes."
