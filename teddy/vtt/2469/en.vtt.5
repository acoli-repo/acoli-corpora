00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:30.734
Now we have sneaker addictions.

00:02:30.758 --> 00:02:32.686
In a market where in the past 12 months,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.964
there have been over
nine million pairs of shoes

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.381
resold in the United States alone,

00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:41.645
at a value of 1.2 billion dollars.

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.708
And that's a conservative estimate --

00:02:43.732 --> 00:02:46.935
I should know, I am a sneakerhead.

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.466
This is my collection.

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:52.876
In the pantheon of great collections,
mine doesn't even register.

00:02:53.392 --> 00:02:56.438
I have about 250 pairs,
but trust me, I am small-time.

00:02:56.462 --> 00:02:58.417
People have thousands.

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.443
I'm a very typical
37-year-old sneakerhead.
