00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:02.753
and how they're all related, possibly,
to the future of all online commerce.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:04.419
In 2011,

00:01:04.443 --> 00:01:07.422
the last time the Jordan 3
Black Cement was released,

00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:09.779
at a retail of 160 dollars,

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.262
it sold out globally in minutes.

00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:15.279
And that's because people were camped
outside of sneaker stores

00:01:15.303 --> 00:01:17.074
for days before it went on sale.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:18.843
And just minutes after that,

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:22.402
thousands of those pairs were on eBay
for two and three times retail.

00:01:22.923 --> 00:01:27.304
In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay
right now, four years later.

00:01:28.107 --> 00:01:29.705
But here's the thing:

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.187
this happens every single Saturday.
