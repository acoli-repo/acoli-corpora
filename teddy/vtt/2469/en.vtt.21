00:10:30.923 --> 00:10:32.305
What if the inverse is true,

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:33.915
and what if we could buy sneakers

00:10:33.939 --> 00:10:35.732
exactly the same way as we buy stock?

00:10:35.756 --> 00:10:38.645
And what if it wasn't just sneakers,
but any similar product,

00:10:38.669 --> 00:10:40.772
like watches and handbags
and women's shoes,

00:10:40.796 --> 00:10:44.144
and any collectible, any seasonal item
and any markdown item?

00:10:44.168 --> 00:10:47.411
What if there was
a stock market for commerce?

00:10:48.046 --> 00:10:50.868
A stock market of things.

00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:56.490
And not only could you buy in a much more
educated and efficient manner,

00:10:56.514 --> 00:10:59.754
but you could engage in all
the sophisticated financial transactions

00:10:59.778 --> 00:11:01.361
you can with the stock market.
