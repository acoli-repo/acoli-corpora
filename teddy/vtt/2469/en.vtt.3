00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.187
this happens every single Saturday.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.107
Every week there's another
release or two or three,

00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:38.385
and every shoe has a story

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.339
as rich and compelling
as the Jordan 3 Black Cement.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.225
This is Nike building
the marketplace for sneakerheads --

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:50.025
people who collect sneakers --

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.297
and my daughter.

00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:53.246
(Laughter)

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.337
That's an "I love Dad" T-shirt.

00:01:56.244 --> 00:01:59.413
For the brands, sneakerheads
are a very important demographic.

00:01:59.437 --> 00:02:03.359
These are the tastemakers;
these are the Apple fanboys.
