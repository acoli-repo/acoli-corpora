surpassing Adidas --
this was a big deal.

00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:02.961
And in the 12 months ending in June,

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:07.049
Skechers's net income
was 209 million dollars.

00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:11.187
That means that Nike's customers

00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:14.747
make almost twice as much profit
as their closest competitor.

00:07:15.758 --> 00:07:17.557
That --

00:07:17.581 --> 00:07:21.005
(Laughter)

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:22.605
How is that even possible?

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:26.830

00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:31.576
but Nike's gotten very good at using
supply -- limited sneakers --
