In fact, there is no central exchange.

00:09:30.634 --> 00:09:35.372
By last count, there were 48 different
online markets that I know of.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.478
Some are eBay clones,
some are mobile markets,

00:09:39.502 --> 00:09:42.524
and then you have consignment shops
and brick-and-mortar stores,

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:44.612
and sneaker conventions,
and reseller sites,

00:09:44.636 --> 00:09:47.041
and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter --

00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:50.597
literally, anywhere sneakerheads
come into contact with each other,

00:09:50.621 --> 00:09:52.611
shoes will be bought and sold.

00:09:53.504 --> 00:09:58.515
But that means no efficiencies,
no transparency,

00:09:58.539 --> 00:10:00.755
sometimes not even authenticity.
