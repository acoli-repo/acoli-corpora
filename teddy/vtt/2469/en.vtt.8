00:03:56.786 --> 00:04:01.392
now use resell data to analyze
the retail footwear industry.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:03.006
And here's the best part:

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.559
sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.085
(Laughter)

00:04:08.617 --> 00:04:11.590
Sneakerheads can track the value
of their collection over time,

00:04:11.614 --> 00:04:12.765
compare it to others,

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.019
and have access to the same
analytics you might

00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:16.963
for your online brokerage account.

00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:21.891
So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection
and identifies which 352 are his.

00:04:21.915 --> 00:04:24.804
He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars --

00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:26.829
frankly, a modest collection.

00:04:26.853 --> 00:04:30.462
At the asset level,
he can see gain-loss by shoe.
