In fact, one guy emailed to say

00:05:01.504 --> 00:05:05.768
he thought his 15-year-old son
was selling drugs

00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:08.323
and later found out
he was selling sneakers.

00:05:08.853 --> 00:05:10.014
(Laughter)

00:05:10.757 --> 00:05:13.288
And now they use the data
to do it together.

00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:16.409
And that's because sneakers
are an investment opportunity

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:17.592
where none other exists.

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:20.653
And I don't just mean the kid
selling sneakers instead of drugs.

00:05:20.677 --> 00:05:22.367
How about all kids?

00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:25.144
You have to be 18
to play the stock market.

00:05:25.967 --> 00:05:28.307
I sold chewing gum in sixth grade,

00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:29.909
Blow Pops in ninth grade

00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:32.354
and collected baseball cards
through high school.
