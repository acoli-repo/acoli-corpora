00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.492
So I thought, I wonder if I could
get ahold of some sneaker data,

00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:33.528
just to play with for my own amusement.

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.822
The goal was to develop a price guide,

00:03:35.846 --> 00:03:38.043
a real data-driven view of the market.

00:03:38.373 --> 00:03:42.702
And four years later, we're analyzing
over 25 million transactions,

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:45.642
providing real-time analytics
on thousands of sneakers.

00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.882
Now sneakerheads check prices
while camping out for releases.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.690
Others have used the data
to validate insurance claims.

00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:56.762
And the top investment banks in the world

00:03:56.786 --> 00:04:01.392
now use resell data to analyze
the retail footwear industry.
