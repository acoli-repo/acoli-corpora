00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.443
I'm a very typical
37-year-old sneakerhead.

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.772
I grew up playing basketball
when Michael Jordan played,

00:03:04.796 --> 00:03:06.136
I always wanted Air Jordans,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.129
my mother would never buy me Air Jordans,

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:10.546
as soon as I got some money
I bought Air Jordans --

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.643
literally, we all have
the exact same story.

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.362
But here's where mine diverged.

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:19.261
After starting three companies,
I took a job as a strategy consultant,

00:03:19.285 --> 00:03:23.199
when I very quickly realized that
I didn't know the first thing about data.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.738
But I learned, because I had to,

00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:28.056
and I liked it.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.492
So I thought, I wonder if I could
get ahold of some sneaker data,
