Nike, including Jordan brand,

00:06:31.768 --> 00:06:36.284
accounts for 96 percent of all shoes
sold on the secondary market.

00:06:36.308 --> 00:06:37.900
Just complete domination.

00:06:37.924 --> 00:06:40.512
Sneakerheads love Jordans.

00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:43.547
And profit on the secondary market
is about a third.

00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:48.641
That means that sneakerheads
made 380 million dollars

00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:50.553
selling Nikes last year.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.047
Let's jump to retail for a second.

00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:54.491
Skechers, earlier this year,

00:06:54.515 --> 00:06:57.305
became the number two
footwear brand in the country,

00:06:57.329 --> 00:07:00.163
surpassing Adidas --
this was a big deal.
