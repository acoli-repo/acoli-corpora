00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:06.362
This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement.

00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:10.491
This might be the most
important sneaker in history.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.914
First released in 1988,

00:00:12.938 --> 00:00:16.479
this is the shoe that started
Nike marketing as we know it.

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:20.840
This is the shoe that propelled
the entire Air Jordan lineage,

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:22.883
and perhaps saved Nike.

00:00:22.907 --> 00:00:25.820
The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement
did for sneakers

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:27.635
what the iPhone did for phones.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.130
It's been re-released four times.
