and the hype and the PR
and the brand cachet,

00:08:32.263 --> 00:08:35.803
and enable Nike to sell millions
of $60 sneakers.

00:08:37.501 --> 00:08:38.882
It's marketing.

00:08:38.906 --> 00:08:42.018
It's marketing the likes of which
has never been seen before --

00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:43.462
this isn't in any textbook.

00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:47.026
For 15 years Nike has propped up
an artificial commodities market,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.513
with a Facebook-level hyped IPO
every single weekend.

00:08:51.537 --> 00:08:54.210
Drive by any Footlocker at 8am
on a Saturday morning,

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:57.185
and there will be a line down the street
and around the block,

00:08:57.209 --> 00:09:00.070
and sometimes those kids
have been waiting there all week.
