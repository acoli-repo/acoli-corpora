and collected baseball cards
through high school.

00:05:32.378 --> 00:05:34.175
The cards are long dead,

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.572
and the candy market's
usually quite local.

00:05:37.122 --> 00:05:42.849
For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal
and accessible investment opportunity --

00:05:42.873 --> 00:05:46.640
a democratized stock market,

00:05:46.664 --> 00:05:48.735
but also unregulated.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.541
Which is why the story
you're probably most familiar with

00:05:51.565 --> 00:05:53.980
is people killing each other for sneakers.

00:05:54.606 --> 00:05:58.381
And while that definitely
happens and is tragic,

00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:02.250
it's not nearly the epidemic
some media would have you believe.
