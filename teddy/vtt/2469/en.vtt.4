These are the tastemakers;
these are the Apple fanboys.

00:02:03.383 --> 00:02:04.922
Because who else is going to buy

00:02:04.946 --> 00:02:08.162
a pair of $8,000
Back to the Future sneakers?

00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:10.441
(Laughter)

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:12.542
Yeah, 8,000 dollars.

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:15.715
And while that's obviously the anomaly,

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.917
the resell sneaker market
is definitely not.

00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:20.765

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.725
what started as an underground culture

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.730
of a few people who like sneakers
just a bit too much --

00:02:25.754 --> 00:02:27.154
(Laughter)

00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:30.734
Now we have sneaker addictions.
