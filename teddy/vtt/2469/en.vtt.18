Nike lines happen 104 times more often.

00:09:09.075 --> 00:09:10.603
So Nike sets the rules.

00:09:10.627 --> 00:09:13.401
And they do so by controlling
supply and distribution.

00:09:14.014 --> 00:09:17.911
But once a pair leaves
the retail channel, it's the Wild West.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:24.003
There are very few -- if any --
legal, unregulated markets of this size.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.803
So Nike is definitely
not the stock exchange.

00:09:27.827 --> 00:09:30.610
In fact, there is no central exchange.
