00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.136
and belonging

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.656
and origins.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.376
And these identities are based on myths,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.096
typically about ancient,
primordial origins.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.536
And these could be about Adam and Eve

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.496
or about the supremacy
of a caste or gender

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.416
or about the vitality of a supposed race

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.856
or about the past glories
of an empire or civilization

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.576
or about a piece of land

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.080
that some imagined deity has gifted.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.216
Now, people say

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.480
that origin stories and identity myths
make us feel secure.
