I'm Chetan Bhatt

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.240
and when I give my name,
I'm often asked, "Where are you from?"

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.920
And I normally say London.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.816
(Laughter)

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.336
But of course, I know
what they're really asking,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.376
so I say something like,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.976
"Well, my grandparents and my mum
were born in India,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.656
my dad and I were born in Kenya,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.576
and I was brought up in London.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.096
And then they've got me mapped.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.936
"Ah, you're a Kenyan Asian.
I've worked with one of those."

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.176
(Laughter)

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.576
And from my name they probably
assume that I'm a Hindu.
