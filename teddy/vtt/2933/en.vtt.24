I respect your right
to have and to express your religion

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.496
or your culture or your opinion,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.376
but I don't necessarily
have to respect the content.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.656
I might like some of it.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.496
I might like how an old church
looks, for example,

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.040
but this isn't the same thing.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.576
Similarly, I have a human right

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.736
to say something
that you may find offensive,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.240
but you do not have a human right
not to be offended.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.016
In a genuine democracy,
we're constantly offended

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.816
since people express
different views all the time.
