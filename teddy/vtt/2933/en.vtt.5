00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.480
that origin stories and identity myths
make us feel secure.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.656
What's wrong with that?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.336
They give us a sense of belonging.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.066
Identity is your cultural clothing,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.300
and it can make you feel
warm and fuzzy inside.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.336
But does it really?

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.336
Do we really need
identity myths to feel safe?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.376
Because I see religious,
national, ethnic disputes

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.680
as adding to human misery.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.136
Can I dare you

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.096
to refuse every origin myth

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.320
that claims you?
