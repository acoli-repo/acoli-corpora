they are also a part of me

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.640
and are here with me.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.176
Maybe that's why I find it hard
to respond to questions about identity

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.616
and about origin.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.520
And it's not just a sort of
teenage refusal to be labeled.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.696
It's about our own most identities,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.016
the ones that we put our hands up to,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.656
the ones that we cheer for,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.376
the ones that we fight for,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.216
the ones that we love or hate.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.336
And it's about how we apprehend ourselves

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.016
as well as others.
