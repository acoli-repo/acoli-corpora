00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.336
These people are manufacturing
pure, pristine identities of conviction

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.576
and of certainty.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.160
Fundamentalists see religion and culture
as their sole property, a property.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.576
But religions and cultures are processes.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.976
They're not things. They're impermanent.
They're messy. They're impure.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.736
Look at any religion
and you'll see disputes and arguments

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.760
going all the way down.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.560
Any criticism of religion in any form

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.296
has to therefore be

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.896
part of the expansive sense of humanity

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.120
we should aspire to.
