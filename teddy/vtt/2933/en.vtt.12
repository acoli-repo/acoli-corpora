00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.456
The book was unusual

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.216
because it was written
by a British supporter of Al Qaeda,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.296
and in it the author calls
for attacks in Britain.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.256
This is in 1999,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.416
so 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq
was still in the future,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.256
and he helped scout
New York bombing targets.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.096
He taught others how to make a dirty bomb
to use on the London Underground,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.560
and he plotted a massive bombing campaign
in London's shopping areas.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.256
He's a very high-risk security
prisoner in the UK

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.640
and one of the most important Al Qaeda
figures to be arrested in Britain.
