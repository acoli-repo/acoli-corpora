00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.080
and of course massive,
accelerating inequalities?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.016
Now, origin myths
are closely linked to tradition,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.496
and the word tradition
points to something old

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.456
and permanent, almost natural,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.216
and people assume tradition
is just history,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.520
simply the past
condensed into a nice story.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.936
But let's not confuse
tradition with history.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.600
The two are often in severe conflict.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.976
Origin stories are usually recently
created fictions of ancient belonging,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.256
and they're absurd
