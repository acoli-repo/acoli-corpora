00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.696
by those who have a political stake

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.360
in pounding culture
into the shape of a prison.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.256
Big political identity claims
are elite bids for power.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.376
They're not answers to social
or economic or political injustices.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.000
They often obscure them.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.296
And what about the large number
of people across the globe

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.496
who can't point
to a monument from their past,

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.856
who don't possess a sacred written text,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.936
who can't hark back

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.656
to the past glories
of a civilization or empire?

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.640
Are these people less a part of humanity?
