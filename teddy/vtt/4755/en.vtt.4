00:01:57.156 --> 00:02:00.927
This is why we don't notice
the wave nature of everyday objects.

00:02:00.927 --> 00:02:02.644
If you toss a baseball up in the air,

00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:07.029
its wavelength is a billionth of a 
trillionth of a trillionth of a meter,

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:09.364
far too tiny to ever detect.

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:12.324
Small things, 
like atoms or electrons though,

00:02:12.324 --> 00:02:16.142
can have wavelengths big enough
to measure in physics experiments.

00:02:16.142 --> 00:02:19.475
So, if we have a pure wave, 
we can measure its wavelength,

00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:23.101
and thus its momentum,
but it has no position.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.248
We can know a particles position
very well,

00:02:25.248 --> 00:02:28.489
but it doesn't have a wavelength,
so we don't know its momentum.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.600
To get a particle with both position
and momentum,
