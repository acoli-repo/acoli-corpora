00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:01.012
which means a bigger position uncertainty.

00:04:01.012 --> 00:04:03.221
That's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle,

00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:08.207
first stated by German physicist
Werner Heisenberg back in 1927.

00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:12.589
This uncertainty isn't a matter
of measuring well or badly,

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:17.107
but an inevitable result
of combining particle and wave nature.

00:04:17.107 --> 00:04:20.663
The Uncertainty Principle isn't just 
a practical limit on measurment.

00:04:20.663 --> 00:04:23.733
It's a limit on what properties 
an object can have,

00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:28.157
built into the fundamental structure
of the universe itself.
