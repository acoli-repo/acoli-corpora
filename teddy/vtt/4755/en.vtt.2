00:00:57.053 --> 00:01:01.857
Particles, by definition, exist in 
a single place at any instant in time.

00:01:01.857 --> 00:01:05.286
We can represent this by a graph
showing the probability of finding

00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:09.030
the object at a particular place,
which looks like a spike,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.707
100% at one specific position,
and zero everywhere else.

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:17.621
Waves, on the other hand,
are disturbances spread out in space,

00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:20.338
like ripples covering 
the surface of a pond.

00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:23.767
We can clearly identify features
of the wave pattern as a whole,

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:25.933
most importantly, its wavelength,

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.640
which is the distance between two 
neighboring peaks,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.459
or two neighboring valleys.
