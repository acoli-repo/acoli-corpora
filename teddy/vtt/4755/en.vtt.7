WEBVTT

00:03:28.223 --> 00:03:30.918
There's a good probability
of finding it within some range

00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:32.837
of the center of the wave packet,

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.586
and we made the wave packet
by adding lots of waves,

00:03:35.586 --> 00:03:38.012
which means there's 
some probability of finding it

00:03:38.012 --> 00:03:41.291
with the momentum corresponding
to any one of those.

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.740
Both position and momentum
are now uncertain,

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.816
and the uncertainties are connected.

00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:49.209
If you want to reduce 
the position uncertainty

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.628
by making a smaller wave packet,
you need to add more waves,

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:54.865
which means a bigger momentum uncertainty.

00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:58.047
If you want to know the momentum better,
you need a bigger wave packet,

00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:01.012
which means a bigger position uncertainty.
