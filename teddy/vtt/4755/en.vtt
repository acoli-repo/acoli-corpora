The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
is one of a handful of ideas

00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:14.686
from quantum physics to 
expand into general pop culture.

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:18.112
It says that you can never simultaneously
know the exact position

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:22.893
and the exact speed of an object
and shows up as a metaphor in everything

00:00:22.893 --> 00:00:26.409
from literary criticism
to sports commentary.

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.429
Uncertainty is often explained as a result
of measurement,

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.561
that the act of measuring an object's
position changes its speed, or vice versa.
