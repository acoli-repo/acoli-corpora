00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.561
that the act of measuring an object's
position changes its speed, or vice versa.

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:38.378
The real origin is much deeper
and more amazing.

00:00:38.378 --> 00:00:41.759
The Uncertainty Principle exists
because everything in the universe

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:46.318
behaves like both a particle and a wave
at the same time.

00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:50.458
In quantum mechanics, the exact position
and exact speed of an object

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:51.896
have no meaning.

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:53.147
To understand this,

00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:57.053
we need to think about what it means
to behave like a particle or a wave.

00:00:57.053 --> 00:01:01.857
Particles, by definition, exist in 
a single place at any instant in time.
