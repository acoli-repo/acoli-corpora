00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.600
To get a particle with both position
and momentum,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.760
we need to mix the two pictures

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.163
to make a graph that has waves,
but only in a small area.

00:02:37.163 --> 00:02:38.800
How can we do this?


00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.554
By combining waves 
with different wavelengths,

00:02:41.554 --> 00:02:46.528
which means giving our quantum object some
possibility of having different momenta.

00:02:46.528 --> 00:02:49.282
When we add two waves, 
we find that there are places

00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:52.055
where the peaks line up,
making a bigger wave,

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:55.821
and other places where the peaks of one
fill in the valleys of the other.

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:58.279
The result has regions where
we see waves

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.106
separated by regions of nothing at all.
