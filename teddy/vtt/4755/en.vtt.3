00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.459
or two neighboring valleys.

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:33.017
But we can't assign it a single position.

00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:36.282
It has a good probability of 
being in lots of different places.

00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:39.099
Wavelength is essential for
quantum physics

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.419
because an object's wavelength
is related to its momentum,

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:44.024
mass times velocity.

00:01:44.024 --> 00:01:46.909
A fast-moving object has lots of momentum,

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.019
which corresponds to 
a very short wavelength.

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:54.559
A heavy object has lots of momentum
even if it's not moving very fast,

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:57.156
which again means a very short wavelength.

00:01:57.156 --> 00:02:00.927
This is why we don't notice
the wave nature of everyday objects.
