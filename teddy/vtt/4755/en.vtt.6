WEBVTT

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.106
separated by regions of nothing at all.

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:02.590
If we add a third wave,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.709
the regions where the waves cancel out
get bigger,

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.891
a fourth and they get bigger still,
with the wavier regions becoming narrower.

00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:13.089
If we keep adding waves,
we can make a wave packet

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.168
with a clear wavelength
in one small region.

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:20.224
That's a quantum object with both
wave and particle nature,

00:03:20.224 --> 00:03:23.311
but to accomplish this,
we had to lose certainty

00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:25.805
about both position and momentum.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.223
The positions isn't restricted 
to a single point.

00:03:28.223 --> 00:03:30.918
There's a good probability
of finding it within some range
