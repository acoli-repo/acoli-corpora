00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:31.376
but shame lingered as an aftertaste.

00:00:31.376 --> 00:00:34.940
And in an attempt
to reintroduce me to sanctity,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.860
my mother told me of the miracle I was,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
said I could grow up 
to be anything I want.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.066
I decided to

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.227
be a boy.

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:45.217
It was cute.

00:00:45.217 --> 00:00:47.007
I had snapback, toothless grin,


00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:48.847
used skinned knees as street cred,

00:00:48.847 --> 00:00:51.277
played hide and seek with 
what was left of my goal.

00:00:51.277 --> 00:00:52.204
I was it.

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:54.629
The winner to a game 
the other kids couldn't play,

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.809
I was the mystery of an anatomy,

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.622
a question asked but not answered,


00:00:58.622 --> 00:01:02.918
tightroping between awkward boy
and apologetic girl,
