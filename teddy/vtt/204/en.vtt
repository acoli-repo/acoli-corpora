00:00:00.854 --> 00:00:06.403
The first time I uttered a prayer
was in a glass-stained cathedral.

00:00:06.403 --> 00:00:09.793
I was kneeling long after
the congregation was on its feet,

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:11.703
dip both hands into holy water,


00:00:11.703 --> 00:00:13.553
trace the trinity across my chest,

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:16.379
my tiny body drooping 
like a question mark

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.669
all over the wooden pew.

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.339
I asked Jesus to fix me,

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.465
and when he did not answer

00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:26.141
I befriended silence in the hopes
that my sin would burn

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:27.631
and salve my mouth

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:29.461
would dissolve like sugar on tongue,

00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:31.376
but shame lingered as an aftertaste.
