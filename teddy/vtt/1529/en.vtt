00:00:00.546 --> 00:00:02.793
I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,

00:00:02.793 --> 00:00:05.033
and this little white dog called Maui

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:06.918
was staying with me.

00:00:06.918 --> 00:00:09.390
Half the city was dark because of a power cut,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.614
and I was living on the dark side.

00:00:11.614 --> 00:00:13.723
Now, Maui was terrified of the dark,

00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:15.827
so I had to carry him up the stairs,

00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:18.915
actually down the stairs first, for his walk,

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:20.803
and then bring him back up.

00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:23.784
I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:25.883
up to the seventh floor every day.

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:27.456
And through all of this,

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:29.760
I had to hold a torch between my teeth.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.404
The stores nearby were out of flashlights
