00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
that we demonstrated in Washington. Can we look at this thing?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Watch the fingers grab. The thumb comes up. Wrist.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
This weighs 6.9 pounds.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Going to scratch his nose.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It's got 14 active degrees of freedom.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger.
