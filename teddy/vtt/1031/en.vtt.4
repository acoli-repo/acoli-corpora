00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Over the next month I visited lots of places, some out here, around the country,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
found the best of the best.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I went down to Washington. I saw these guys, and said,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I put a team together, a little over 13 months ago,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
got up to 20 some-odd people.
