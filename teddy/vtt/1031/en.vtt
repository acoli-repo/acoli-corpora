00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I got a visit almost exactly a year ago,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
a little over a year ago, from a very senior person at the Department of Defense.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Came to see me and said, "1,600 of the kids that we've sent out

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
have come back missing at least one full arm.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Whole arm. Shoulder disarticulation.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And we're doing the same thing we did for -- more or less,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that we've done since the Civil War, a stick and a hook.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And they deserve more than that."
