MRIs of whatever is their good arm,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D --

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
exact mirror image of their other limb.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So, you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of 14 actuators,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
so the more they put themselves under load, the more it attaches.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
They take the load off, and it becomes, again, compliant.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this
