WEBVTT

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.477
back into the heart of the way
we design new systems and new services,

00:16:01.501 --> 00:16:04.008
in an approach that I call
"Relational Welfare."

00:16:04.032 --> 00:16:06.548
We need to leave behind
these old, transactional,

00:16:06.572 --> 00:16:08.830
unsuitable, outdated models,

00:16:08.854 --> 00:16:12.365
and we need to adopt instead
the shared collective relational responses

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.845
that can support a family like Ella's,

00:16:14.869 --> 00:16:17.176
that can address an issue like loneliness,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.935
that can support people into work
and up the skills curve

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:21.403
in a modern labor market,

00:16:21.427 --> 00:16:25.565
that can also address challenges
of education, of health care systems,

00:16:25.589 --> 00:16:29.869
and so many more of those problems
that are pressing on our societies.
