It snaked around the walls
of their offices.

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:06.975
So many hours, so well meant,
but ultimately so futile.

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.439
And there was this moment
of absolute breakdown,

00:04:10.463 --> 00:04:12.295
and then of clarity:

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.932
we had to work in a different way.

00:04:15.652 --> 00:04:18.957
So in a really brave step,
the leaders of the city where Ella lives

00:04:18.981 --> 00:04:21.626
agreed that we could start
by reversing Ryan's ratio.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.810
So everyone who came into contact
with Ella or a family like Ella's

00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:27.746
would spend 80 percent of their time
working with the families

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.335
and only 20 percent servicing the system.
