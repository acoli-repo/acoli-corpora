they wouldn't see her for a bit.

00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:06.689
And Damon, who runs the local Circle,
calls her back and says, "How can I help?"

00:11:06.713 --> 00:11:08.624
And Belinda says, "Oh no, I'm fine --

00:11:08.648 --> 00:11:11.441
Jocelyn is doing the shopping,
Tony's doing the gardening,

00:11:11.465 --> 00:11:14.162
Melissa and Joe are going
to come in and cook and chat."

00:11:14.186 --> 00:11:17.193

had organized themselves

00:11:17.217 --> 00:11:19.121
to take care of Belinda.

00:11:20.123 --> 00:11:23.469
And Belinda's 80, although she says
that she feels 25 inside,

00:11:23.493 --> 00:11:25.057
but she also says

00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:28.527
that she felt stuck and pretty down
when she joined Circle.

00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:33.564
But the simple act of encouraging her
to come along to that first event
