00:05:28.554 --> 00:05:31.443
They showed their human qualities
and convinced the mothers

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:34.080
that they would stick with them
through thick and thin,

00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:36.163
even though they wouldn't
be soft with them.

00:05:36.187 --> 00:05:37.879
So these new teams and the families

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:40.062
were then given a sliver
of the former budget,

00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:42.577
but they could spend the money
in any way they chose.

00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:44.836
And so one of the families
went out for supper.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.465
They went to McDonald's and they sat down
and they talked and they listened

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:50.549
for the first time in a long time.

00:05:50.573 --> 00:05:52.163
Another family asked the team

00:05:52.187 --> 00:05:55.229
if they would help them do up their home.

00:05:55.253 --> 00:05:56.760
And one mother took the money

00:05:56.784 --> 00:06:00.311
and she used it as a float
to start a social enterprise.
