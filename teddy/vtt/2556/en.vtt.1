00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.166
Ella lives in a British city
on a run down estate.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.384
The shops are closed, the pub's gone,

00:00:32.408 --> 00:00:34.707
the playground's pretty desolate
and never used,

00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:37.557
and inside Ella's house,
the tension is palpable

00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:39.581
and the noise levels are deafening.

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.419
The TV's on at full volume.

00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:43.975
One of her sons is fighting
with one of her daughters.

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.770
Another son, Ryan, is keeping up this
constant stream of abuse from the kitchen,

00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:50.975
and the dogs are locked
behind the bedroom door and straining.

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:52.711
Ella is stuck.

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:55.295
She has lived with crisis for 40 years.

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:59.053
She knows nothing else,
and she knows no way out.

00:00:59.077 --> 00:01:01.726
She's had a whole series
of abusive partners,
