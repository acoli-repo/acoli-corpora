"Look, I just deliver the message
and then I leave."

00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:33.308
So, I've spent time living
with families like Ella's

00:02:33.332 --> 00:02:34.872
in different parts of the world,

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:37.134
because I want to know: what can we learn

00:02:37.158 --> 00:02:40.651
from places where our social institutions
just aren't working?

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:43.466
I want to know what it feels like
to live in Ella's family.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.501
I want to know what's going on
and what we can do differently.

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:51.614
Well, the first thing I learned
is that cost is a really slippery concept.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:54.356
Because when the government says
that a family like Ella's

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.977
costs a quarter of a million pounds
a year to manage,

00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:58.152
what it really means

00:02:58.176 --> 00:03:01.146
is that this system costs
a quarter of a million pounds a year.
