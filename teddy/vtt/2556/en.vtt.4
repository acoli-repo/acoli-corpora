00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:02.469
costs a quarter of a million pounds
per family per year

00:02:02.493 --> 00:02:03.865
and yet nothing changes.

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.975
None of these well-meaning visitors
are making a difference.

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.282
This is a chart we made in the same city
with another family like Ella's.

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:14.908
This shows 30 years of intervention
in that family's life.

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:18.763
And just as with Ella, not one of these
interventions is part of an overall plan.

00:02:18.787 --> 00:02:20.234
There's no end goal in sight.

00:02:20.258 --> 00:02:23.309
None of the interventions
are dealing with the underlying issues.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.343
These are just containment measures,
ways of managing a problem.

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:28.086
One of the policemen says to me,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.599
"Look, I just deliver the message
and then I leave."
