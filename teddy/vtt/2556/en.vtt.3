00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:31.764
and Ella and her partners and her children
were known to most of them.

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:33.902
They think nothing of calling
social services

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:36.778
to try and mediate one of the many
arguments that broke out.

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:40.251
And the family home was visited
on a regular basis by social workers,

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:44.975
youth workers, a health officer,
a housing officer, a home tutor

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.975
and the local policemen.

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.737
And the governments say
that there are 100,000 families

00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:51.860
in Britain today like Ella's,

00:01:51.884 --> 00:01:57.245
struggling to break the cycle of economic,
social and environmental deprivation.

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:59.443
And they also say
that managing this problem

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:02.469
costs a quarter of a million pounds
per family per year
