00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.373
The contemporaries of William Beveridge,

00:07:31.397 --> 00:07:33.655
who was the architect
of the first welfare state

00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:35.599
and the author of the Beveridge Report,

00:07:35.623 --> 00:07:39.122
had little faith in what they called
the average sensual or emotional man.

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:42.590
Instead, they trusted this idea
of the impersonal system

00:07:42.614 --> 00:07:46.975
and the bureaucrat who would be detached
and work in this system.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:49.114
And the impact of Beveridge

00:07:49.138 --> 00:07:51.381
on the way the modern state
sees social issues

00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:53.464
just can't be underestimated.

00:07:53.488 --> 00:07:56.664
The Beveridge Report
sold over 100,000 copies

00:07:56.688 --> 00:07:59.017
in the first weeks of publication alone.

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:02.250
People queued in the rain
on a November night to get hold of a copy,
