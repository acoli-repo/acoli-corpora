00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:01.375
Through word of mouth.

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:06.000
It turns out that in Britain today,
most new jobs are not advertised.

00:14:06.024 --> 00:14:08.167
So it's friends that tell you about a job,

00:14:08.191 --> 00:14:10.464
it's friends that recommend you for a job,

00:14:10.488 --> 00:14:14.779
and it's a rich and diverse social network
that helps you find work.

00:14:14.803 --> 00:14:17.128
Maybe some of you here
this evening are thinking,

00:14:17.152 --> 00:14:19.013
"But I found my job through an advert,"

00:14:19.037 --> 00:14:22.359
but if you think back, it was probably
a friend that showed you the ad

00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:23.960
and then encouraged you to apply.

00:14:23.984 --> 00:14:25.307
But not surprisingly,

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:28.610
people who perhaps most need
this rich and diverse network

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:31.333
are those who are most isolated from it.
