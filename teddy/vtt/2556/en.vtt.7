00:03:29.094 --> 00:03:31.522
more meetings with colleagues
to discuss the forms,

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:32.792
and maybe most shockingly,

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:35.385
the 14 percent of the time
he has to be with Ryan

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.905
is spent getting data
and information for the system.

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:39.080
So he says to Ryan,

00:03:39.104 --> 00:03:41.791
"How often have you been smoking?
Have you been drinking?

00:03:41.815 --> 00:03:43.128
When did you go to school?"

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:45.702
And this kind of interaction
rules out the possibility

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:46.938
of a normal conversation.

00:03:46.962 --> 00:03:49.080
It rules out the possibility
of what's needed

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:52.081
to build a relationship
between Tom and Ryan.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.388
When we made this chart,

00:03:54.412 --> 00:03:56.427
the frontline workers,
the professionals --

00:03:56.451 --> 00:03:58.222
they stared at it absolutely amazed.

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:00.975
It snaked around the walls
of their offices.
