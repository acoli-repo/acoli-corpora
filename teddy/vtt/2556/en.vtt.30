00:14:58.324 --> 00:15:01.215
we outperformed existing services
by a factor of three,

00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:03.199
at a fraction of the cost.

00:15:03.223 --> 00:15:06.103
And here, too, we've used technology,

00:15:06.127 --> 00:15:09.525
but not to network people in the way
that a social platform would do.

00:15:09.549 --> 00:15:13.151
We've used it to bring people face to face
and connect them with each other,

00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:16.592
building real relationships
and supporting people to find work.

00:15:18.308 --> 00:15:21.255
At the end of his life, in 1948,

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:23.268
Beveridge wrote a third report.

00:15:23.913 --> 00:15:27.274
And in it he said he had made
a dreadful mistake.

00:15:28.356 --> 00:15:32.179
He had left people
and their communities out.
