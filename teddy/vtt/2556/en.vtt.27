00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.630
our welfare states were primarily designed

00:13:30.654 --> 00:13:33.299
to get people into work,

00:13:33.323 --> 00:13:35.315
to educate them for this,

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:37.011
and to keep them healthy.

00:13:37.035 --> 00:13:39.568
But here, too, the systems are failing.

00:13:39.592 --> 00:13:40.964
And so the response has been

00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:44.525
to try and make these old systems
even more efficient and transactional --

00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:48.181
to speed up processing times, divide
people into ever-smaller categories,

00:13:48.205 --> 00:13:51.376
try and target services at them
more efficiently -- in other words,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.046
the very opposite of relational.

00:13:55.425 --> 00:13:58.829
But guess how most people find work today?

00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:01.375
Through word of mouth.
