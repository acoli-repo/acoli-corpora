00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:03.249
I want to tell you three stories

00:00:03.273 --> 00:00:05.725
about the power of relationships

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:10.038
to solve the deep and complex
social problems of this century.

00:00:10.062 --> 00:00:12.975
You know, sometimes it seems
like all these problems

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:17.788
of poverty, inequality, ill health,
unemployment, violence, addiction --

00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:20.638
they're right there in one person's life.

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:24.343
So I want to tell you about someone
like this that I know.

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:26.436
I'm going to call her Ella.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.166
Ella lives in a British city
on a run down estate.
