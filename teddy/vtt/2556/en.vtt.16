People queued in the rain
on a November night to get hold of a copy,

00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:05.640
and it was read across the country,
across the colonies, across Europe,

00:08:05.664 --> 00:08:07.405
across the United States of America,

00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:09.201
and it had this huge impact

00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:12.822
on the way that welfare states
were designed around the globe.

00:08:12.846 --> 00:08:17.907
The cultures, the bureaucracies,
the institutions -- they are global,

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:19.951
and they've come to seem
like common sense.

00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:22.059
They've become so ingrained in us,

00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:24.330
that actually we don't even
see them anymore.

00:08:24.856 --> 00:08:27.975
And I think it's really important to say
that in the 20th century,

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:30.636
they were remarkably successful,
these institutions.
