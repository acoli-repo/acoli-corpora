00:09:59.944 --> 00:10:02.298
They want on-demand, practical support.

00:10:02.322 --> 00:10:03.880
And they want to have fun.

00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:07.122
They want to go out, do interesting things
with like-minded people,

00:10:07.146 --> 00:10:10.866
and make friends like we've all
made friends at every stage of our lives.

00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:14.207
So we rented a phone line,
hired a couple of handymen,

00:10:14.231 --> 00:10:16.568
and started a service we called "Circle."

00:10:16.592 --> 00:10:20.413
And Circle offers its local membership
a toll-free 0 800 number

00:10:20.437 --> 00:10:23.166
that they can call on demand
for any support.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.359
And people have called us
for so many reasons.

00:10:25.383 --> 00:10:27.502
They've called because
their pets are unwell,

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:30.800
their DVD is broken, they've forgotten
how to use their mobile phone,
