00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:31.305
They've made some new friendships.

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:35.345
And all the same people have been
involved in this transformation --

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:37.975
same families, same workers.

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:41.906
But the relationship between them
has been supported to change.

00:06:42.556 --> 00:06:45.637
So I'm telling you about Ella
because I think that relationships

00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:47.598
are the critical resource we have

00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:50.000
in solving some of these
intractable problems.

00:06:50.024 --> 00:06:52.746
But today, our relationships
are all but written off

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.638
by our politics, our social policies,
our welfare institutions.

00:06:56.662 --> 00:06:59.338
And I've learned that this
really has to change.
