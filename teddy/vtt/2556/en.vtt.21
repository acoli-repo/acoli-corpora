00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:30.800
their DVD is broken, they've forgotten
how to use their mobile phone,

00:10:30.824 --> 00:10:32.749
or maybe they are coming out of hospital

00:10:32.773 --> 00:10:34.426
and they want someone to be there.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.600
And Circle also offers
a rich social calendar --

00:10:37.624 --> 00:10:41.739
knitting, darts, museum tours,
hot air ballooning -- you name it.

00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:46.650
But here's the interesting thing,
the really deep change:

00:10:46.674 --> 00:10:49.885
over time, the friendships
that have formed

00:10:49.909 --> 00:10:52.463
have begun to replace the practical offer.

00:10:52.964 --> 00:10:54.597
So let me tell you about Belinda.

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:58.857
Belinda's a Circle member, and she was
going into hospital for a hip operation,

00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:02.865
so she called her local Circle to say
they wouldn't see her for a bit.
