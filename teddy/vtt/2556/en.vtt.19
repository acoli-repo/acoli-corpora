Loneliness is like a collective
relational challenge,

00:09:32.064 --> 00:09:35.911
and it can't be addressed
by a traditional bureaucratic response.

00:09:36.486 --> 00:09:39.437
So some years ago,
wanting to understand this problem,

00:09:39.461 --> 00:09:42.334
I started to work with a group
of about 60 older people

00:09:42.358 --> 00:09:44.179
in South London, where I live.

00:09:44.203 --> 00:09:46.278
I went shopping, I played bingo,

00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:48.465
but mainly I was just
observing and listening.

00:09:48.489 --> 00:09:51.034
I wanted to know
what we could do differently.

00:09:51.837 --> 00:09:54.665
And if you ask them, people tell you
they want two things.

00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:57.598
They want somebody to go up a ladder
and change a light bulb,

00:09:57.622 --> 00:09:59.920
or to be there when they
come out of hospital.

00:09:59.944 --> 00:10:02.298
They want on-demand, practical support.
