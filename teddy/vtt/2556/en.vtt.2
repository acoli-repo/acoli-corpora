00:00:59.077 --> 00:01:01.726
She's had a whole series
of abusive partners,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.067
and, tragically, one of her children has
been taken into care by social services.

00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:08.363
The three children
that still live with her

00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:11.862
suffer from a whole range of problems,
and none of them are in education.

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:14.883
And Ella says to me that she
is repeating the cycle

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:17.671
of her own mother's life before her.

00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:20.975
But when I met Ella,
there were 73 different services

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.137
on offer for her and her family
in the city where she lives,

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:28.430
73 different services
run out of 24 departments in one city,

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:31.764
and Ella and her partners and her children
were known to most of them.
