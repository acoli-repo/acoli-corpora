00:02:58.176 --> 00:03:01.146
is that this system costs
a quarter of a million pounds a year.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.285
Because not one penny of this money
actually touches Ella's family

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.889
in a way that makes a difference.

00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:08.456
Instead, the system is just
like this costly gyroscope

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.459
that spins around the families,
keeping them stuck at its heart,

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.508
exactly where they are.

00:03:13.532 --> 00:03:15.855
And I also spent time
with the frontline workers,

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.702
and I learned that it
is an impossible situation.

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:23.441
So Tom, who is the social worker
for Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan,

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.975
has to spend 86 percent of his time
servicing the system:

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.070
meetings with colleagues,
filling out forms,

00:03:29.094 --> 00:03:31.522
more meetings with colleagues
to discuss the forms,
