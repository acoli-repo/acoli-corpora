00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:34.421
a few simple rules,

00:00:35.353 --> 00:00:40.045
allowing every single bird
to make autonomous decisions

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:42.350
while still flying in perfect synchrony.

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:46.979
Their alignment enables their autonomy,

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:51.168
and their autonomy
makes them fast and flexible.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.521
Now, what does this have to do
with any one of us?

00:00:57.248 --> 00:01:03.394
