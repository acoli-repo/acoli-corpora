Clearly, this model is not for everyone,

00:11:30.555 --> 00:11:33.084
and some great people leave the company.

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:35.507

00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:36.985
with less hierarchy.

00:11:38.813 --> 00:11:41.116
And all of this is hard work.

00:11:42.272 --> 00:11:43.806
But it's worth it.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.660

new product features a few times per year.

00:11:50.007 --> 00:11:53.006
Now they have releases every few weeks,

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.489
and without the handovers
and the red tape,

00:11:55.513 --> 00:11:58.272
the whole organization
becomes more efficient.

00:11:58.296 --> 00:12:01.926
And finally, if you walk the halls
of these companies today,
