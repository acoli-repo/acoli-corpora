00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:00.556
they have to be empowered and autonomous.

00:08:01.321 --> 00:08:05.440
But this means we cannot have leaders
commanding their people what to do,

00:08:05.464 --> 00:08:07.290
when to do, how to do.

00:08:07.314 --> 00:08:08.781
No micromanagers.

00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:14.570
But it also means that each employee
needs to become a leader,

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:16.746
regardless of their formal title.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.606
It's about all of us stepping up
to take initiative.

00:08:22.208 --> 00:08:25.115
Now obviously, we also cannot afford

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:28.233
to have all these teams
running in different directions,

00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:31.093
because that would
certainly lead to chaos.
