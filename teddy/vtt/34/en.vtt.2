00:00:57.248 --> 00:01:03.394
Well, it's one way of illustrating what
I believe to be the most important change

00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:06.314
that is needed in ways of working today.

00:01:07.123 --> 00:01:10.221
The world is getting faster
and more complex,

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:12.598
so we need a new way of working,

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:16.372
a way that creates
alignment around purpose,

00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:18.265
that takes out bureaucracy

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.789
and that truly empowers people
to make decisions faster.

00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:25.450
But the question is:

00:01:25.474 --> 00:01:26.917
In order to get there,

00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:30.144
what are we willing to give up?
