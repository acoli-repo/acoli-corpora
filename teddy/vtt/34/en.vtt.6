00:02:58.977 --> 00:03:01.101
surrounded by beanbags and hoodies

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:03.537
and lots of smart, creative employees.

00:03:04.262 --> 00:03:07.202
So then we asked,
"How is your company organized?"

00:03:07.808 --> 00:03:09.994
And we expected to get an org chart.

00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:13.506
But instead, they used strange drawings

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.259
with funny names like "squads"
and "chapters" and "tribes"

00:03:17.283 --> 00:03:19.035
to explain how they were organized.

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.494
So then we tried to translate
that to our own world.

00:03:23.518 --> 00:03:26.928
We asked, "How many people
are working for you?"

00:03:27.858 --> 00:03:29.509
"It depends."

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:31.058
"Who do you report to?"
