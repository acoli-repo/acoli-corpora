Autonomous decision-making
requires multidisciplinary teams.

00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:04.554
Instead of decisions going
up and down the organization,

00:07:04.578 --> 00:07:06.405
we want the team to decide.

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:10.603
But to do so, we need all the skills
and expertise for that decision

00:07:10.627 --> 00:07:12.201
in the team.

00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:14.174
And this brings difficult trade-offs.

00:07:15.077 --> 00:07:18.974
Can we physically co-locate our people
who are working in different buildings,

00:07:18.998 --> 00:07:21.480
different cities or even
different countries today?

00:07:21.504 --> 00:07:23.966
Or should we invest
in better videoconferencing?

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.143
And how do we ensure consistency
in the way we do things

00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:29.468
across these teams?
