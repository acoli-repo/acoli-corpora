Everything we do
is transparent for everyone.

00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:05.072
So, alignment is not easy,

00:10:05.096 --> 00:10:08.239
and providing autonomy
is not so obvious, either.

00:10:09.157 --> 00:10:11.127
One executive at another company

00:10:11.151 --> 00:10:15.666
likes to explain how he used to be
a master of milestone-tracking.

00:10:16.238 --> 00:10:20.115
Now, today, to know how things are going,

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:22.205
instead of looking at status reports,

00:10:22.229 --> 00:10:26.576
he needs to walk down to the team floors
to attend one of their sessions.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.672
And instead of telling people what to do,

00:10:28.696 --> 00:10:30.459
he looks for ways to help them.
