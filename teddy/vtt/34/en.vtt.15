00:07:30.092 --> 00:07:32.720
We still need some kind
of management matrix.

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:40.216
Now, all these changes to structure
and process and procedure --

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.523
they are not easy.

00:07:42.515 --> 00:07:44.452
But in the end,

00:07:44.476 --> 00:07:47.806
I found that the most
difficult thing to change

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.377
is our own behavior.

00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:52.394
Let me try to illustrate.

00:07:53.216 --> 00:07:57.519
If we want these teams to be fast,
flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up,

00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:00.556
they have to be empowered and autonomous.
