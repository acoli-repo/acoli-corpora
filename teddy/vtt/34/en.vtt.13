If the product guy has an idea,
he can just raise it

00:06:31.254 --> 00:06:34.873
to get input from the engineer
who is sitting right next to him.

00:06:35.722 --> 00:06:39.353
They can decide to test
with customers immediately --

00:06:39.377 --> 00:06:42.950
no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape,

00:06:42.974 --> 00:06:45.049
just getting stuff done.

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.930
Now, getting there is not easy.

00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:51.250
And as it turns out,

00:06:51.274 --> 00:06:52.950
"What are you willing to give up?"

00:06:52.974 --> 00:06:55.237
is exactly the right question to ask.

00:06:56.761 --> 00:07:01.434
Autonomous decision-making
requires multidisciplinary teams.
