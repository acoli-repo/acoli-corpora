00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.400
Within a year, we completely
blew up the old silos

00:05:33.424 --> 00:05:36.414
between marketing,
product, channels and IT.

00:05:36.438 --> 00:05:42.511
Three thousand employees were reorganized
into 350 multidisciplinary teams.

00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:46.308
So instead of product people
sitting just with product people

00:05:46.332 --> 00:05:48.217
and engineers with engineers,

00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:52.321
a product person and an engineer
were now members of the same team.

00:05:52.927 --> 00:05:56.048
You could be a member of a team
responsible for account opening

00:05:56.072 --> 00:05:58.557
or for the mobile banking app, etc.
