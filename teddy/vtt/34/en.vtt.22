First of all, without the handovers
and the PowerPoint,

00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:03.839
there's less of a need

Employees would just follow orders.

00:11:10.554 --> 00:11:14.364

00:11:14.388 --> 00:11:17.770
middle managers were expected
to become player-coaches.

00:11:18.408 --> 00:11:21.348

00:11:21.372 --> 00:11:24.135

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:26.958

00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:30.531
Clearly, this model is not for everyone,
