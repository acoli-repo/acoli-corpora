In these companies, the teams
typically work in short sprints,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.229
and at the end of every sprint,
they organize a demo session

00:09:37.253 --> 00:09:40.373
to share the output
of what they've done, transparently.

00:09:41.587 --> 00:09:43.237
And every day,

00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:45.516
each member of the team gives an update

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.904
of what they are working on individually.

00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:53.992
Now, all this transparency
can be uncomfortable for people,

00:09:54.016 --> 00:09:57.975
because suddenly, there is
no place to hide anymore.

00:09:57.999 --> 00:10:01.568
Everything we do
is transparent for everyone.
