00:04:03.093 --> 00:04:06.775
so they could design, build
and test ideas with customers

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.415
independently of others in the company.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.041
They did not need handovers
between departments.

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:15.478
They had all the skills needed
right there in the team.

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:19.895
Now, at the end of that day,
we had a session

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.927
to reflect on what we had learned.

00:04:22.644 --> 00:04:24.549
And we had started to like their model,

00:04:24.573 --> 00:04:28.669
so we were already thinking of how
to apply some of these ideas to a bank.
