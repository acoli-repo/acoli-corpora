00:12:27.382 --> 00:12:30.778
And the hardest part of that change
is not in structure

00:12:30.802 --> 00:12:33.427
or process or procedure,

00:12:33.451 --> 00:12:36.719
and it's also not just
senior executives taking charge.

00:12:37.394 --> 00:12:40.163
Leaders will be all of those
in the organization

00:12:40.187 --> 00:12:41.804
who embrace the change.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.495
We all have to lead the change.

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:47.177
So the question is:

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.305
What are you willing to give up?

00:12:51.503 --> 00:12:52.675
Thank you.

00:12:52.699 --> 00:12:56.388
