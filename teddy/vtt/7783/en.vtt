00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:10.882
Animated corpses appear
in stories all over the world

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:12.467
throughout recorded history.

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:15.303
But zombies have a distinct lineage—

00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:18.890
one that traces back 
to Equatorial and Central Africa.

00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:22.226
The first clue is in the word 
“zombie” itself.

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:25.271
Its exact etymological origins 
are unknown,

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:27.190
but there are several candidates.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.445
The Mitsogho people of Gabon, for example,
use the word “ndzumbi” for corpse.
