Have you ever talked with a friend
about a problem only to realize

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:14.288
that he just doesn't seem to grasp
why the issue is so important to you?

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:19.329
Have you ever presented an idea to
a group and it's met with utter confusion?

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:23.121
Or maybe you've been in an argument
when the other person suddenly accuses you

00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:26.496
of not listening
to what they're saying at all?

00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:28.288
What's going on here?

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.538
The answer is miscommunication,
