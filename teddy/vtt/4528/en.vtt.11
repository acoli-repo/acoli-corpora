And even if that host tree
dies and rots away,

00:05:32.507 --> 00:05:33.996
the strangler will persist

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.190
as a hollowed-out column
of roots and branches.

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:39.465
And if that didn't impress you,

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:41.827

00:05:43.845 --> 00:05:45.204

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:50.567

in carpets of blue.

00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:55.538
This is its pollination strategy
known as "gregarious flowering,"

00:05:55.562 --> 00:06:00.434
in which it invests all of its resources
into a single, spectacular event
