00:04:58.587 --> 00:05:01.861
you might meet the strangler fig.

00:05:02.234 --> 00:05:05.571
It grows in areas where sunlight is scant

00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:07.777
and competition is intense.

00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:11.305
And so it has a strategy
to sort of cut in line and get ahead.

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:13.642
You see, its seeds are dispersed by birds

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:17.124
that drop them atop the branches
of existing trees.

00:05:17.148 --> 00:05:19.915
And that little seed will start
to germinate from there,

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:22.419
sending its shoots upward to the sky

00:05:22.443 --> 00:05:25.089
and its roots all the way
down to the ground,

00:05:25.113 --> 00:05:29.097
all the while strangling
the host tree, often to death.

00:05:29.574 --> 00:05:32.483
And even if that host tree
dies and rots away,
