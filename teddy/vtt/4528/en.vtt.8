I wanted to paint the kinds of plants
that botanists like my uncle work with.

00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:04.049
And so I set out to create a book,

00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:06.610
supported by the National
Geographic Society,

00:04:06.634 --> 00:04:10.757
on the weirdest, wackiest
plants we could find

00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:14.848
in one of the most biodiverse
regions in the world:

00:04:14.872 --> 00:04:17.282
India's very own Western Ghats.

00:04:18.134 --> 00:04:21.168
(Applause)

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:25.126
Take a look at these fantastic
jewel-like sundews.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.167
They grow in regions where nutrient
content in the soil is poor,

00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:32.722
and so they have a little way
of supplementing their diets.
