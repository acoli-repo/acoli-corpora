00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:04.346
And I think a lot of people just tend
to see plants as background scenery,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.662
assuming that their immobility
makes them uninteresting.

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:12.483
But I began to see that it is that very
rootedness that makes them fascinating,

00:03:12.507 --> 00:03:16.051
the ingenious ways in which
they adapt and respond

00:03:16.075 --> 00:03:17.442
to threats and opportunities

00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:21.028
on timescales that make
our heads hurt to imagine.

00:03:21.052 --> 00:03:22.829
And I couldn't help but wonder:

00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:24.732
What if I could tell their stories,

00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:26.491
showcase their complexity?

00:03:26.515 --> 00:03:29.548
Perhaps we'd all start to think of plants
a little differently.
