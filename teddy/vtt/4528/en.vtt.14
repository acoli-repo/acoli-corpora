00:06:59.462 --> 00:07:02.343
The two scientists that coined this term,

00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:04.426
Elisabeth Schussler and James Wandersee,

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.261
contend that plants lack
certain visual cues.

00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:09.713
They don't have faces,

00:07:09.737 --> 00:07:10.891
they don't move,

00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:13.337
and we don't perceive them as threats.

00:07:13.361 --> 00:07:18.672
And so with the increasing onslaught
of information that our eyes receive,

00:07:18.696 --> 00:07:21.771
we just deprioritize registering plants,

00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:25.735
simply filtering out information
that we view as extraneous.

00:07:27.256 --> 00:07:29.071
But stop to think about that.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.950
Are plants really extra?
