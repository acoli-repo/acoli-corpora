00:05:55.562 --> 00:06:00.434
in which it invests all of its resources
into a single, spectacular event

00:06:00.458 --> 00:06:02.962
aimed at attracting
pollinators to the feast --

00:06:02.986 --> 00:06:04.175
which is easily done,

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:07.754
considering the Neelakurinji
is all that can be seen for miles around.

00:06:07.778 --> 00:06:09.393
But here's the catch:

00:06:09.417 --> 00:06:12.387
it happens only once every 12 years.

00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:13.434
(Applause)

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:14.973
And soon after seeding,

00:06:14.997 --> 00:06:16.859
these flowers will die,

00:06:16.883 --> 00:06:20.028
not to be seen again
for the next 12 years.

00:06:20.537 --> 00:06:25.204
This is our way of telling a story
of the Western Ghats:

00:06:25.228 --> 00:06:27.282
through plants and through
their ecosystems

00:06:27.306 --> 00:06:29.338
and the various ways
in which they interact

00:06:29.362 --> 00:06:31.307
with players in their habitats.
