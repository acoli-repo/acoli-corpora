00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:31.296
that is, the trees they live off.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.469
And so they started a rainforest
restoration program

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:38.300
aimed at growing local trees
that local birds and animals rely on.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.699
And they were looking to visually
document them in some way,

00:01:41.723 --> 00:01:45.687
but the photographers they approached
came up empty-handed.

00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:49.556
These trees were up to 140 feet tall.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.334
That's 26 times my height.

00:01:52.768 --> 00:01:56.036
Try capturing giants like that
in a single camera frame.

00:01:56.386 --> 00:01:59.222
Besides, the surrounding greenery
was just too dense

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:01.425
to clearly isolate a single tree.
