00:00:59.947 --> 00:01:03.028
And I'm well aware
that this is quite an odd profession

00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:05.547
for a 21st-century urban Indian --

00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:08.585
some might say outdated
in the age of the camera --

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:10.673
but here's how my journey began.

00:01:11.276 --> 00:01:12.688
A few years ago,

00:01:12.712 --> 00:01:16.778
I met two naturalists who work
with the Nature Conservation Foundation:

00:01:16.802 --> 00:01:19.481
Divya Mudappa and T.R. Shankar Raman.

00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:21.085
And now interestingly,

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.707
they actually began their careers
working with animals,

00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:25.154
but they soon came to realize

00:01:25.178 --> 00:01:27.250
that if they were
to protect those animals,

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:29.504
they'd also have to protect
their habitats --

00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:31.296
that is, the trees they live off.
