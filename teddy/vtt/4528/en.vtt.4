00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:01.425
to clearly isolate a single tree.

00:02:02.095 --> 00:02:05.744
And so together, we decided
to give good old painting a shot.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.624
And to tell you the truth,

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:10.194

and she there as aide,

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:25.103
we could piece these pieces
of the puzzle together

00:02:25.127 --> 00:02:26.571
into the final painting.

00:02:27.572 --> 00:02:29.824
For a lot of people
who don't know the jungles

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.073
as well as these naturalists,
