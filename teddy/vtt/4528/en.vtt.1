00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:30.454
we grow further and further
away from nature

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:32.637
to the point where we have to question:

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:36.311
What experience of nature
will the next generation have?

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:39.494
And if that generation lacks
a sort of emotional connection

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:40.908
with their surroundings,

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:43.344
then will they bother to fight and save it

00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:44.838
when we need it most?

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.560
My name is Nirupa Rao,
and I'm a botanical artist.

00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:51.916
In short, that means I paint plants,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.550
usually with watercolor,

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:57.516
in a way that aims to be not only
aesthetically appealing

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.489
but also scientifically accurate.

00:00:59.947 --> 00:01:03.028
And I'm well aware
that this is quite an odd profession
