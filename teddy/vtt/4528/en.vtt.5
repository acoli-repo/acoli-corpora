00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.073
as well as these naturalists,

00:02:32.097 --> 00:02:35.449
these paintings are the only way
that they'll get to see these trees

00:02:35.473 --> 00:02:37.026
in their entirety.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.650
We were able to document
30 of the region's most iconic species

00:02:41.674 --> 00:02:44.581
along with their fruit, flowers,
seeds and leaves.

00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:47.951
(Applause)

00:02:49.026 --> 00:02:50.177
Through this process,

00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:52.877
the jungles really came alive to me.

00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:56.348
They morphed from this
undifferentiated sea of green

00:02:56.372 --> 00:02:59.754
into individual species
with individual characters.
