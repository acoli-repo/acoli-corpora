I have a challenge for you.

00:00:03.614 --> 00:00:05.440
The next time you're stuck in traffic,

00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:08.268
take a minute to take a look
at the sea of cars around you.

00:00:08.292 --> 00:00:10.953
How many car companies
do you think you could recognize?

00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:13.626
I'm not even really into cars,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.367
but I think I'd do fairly well.

00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:17.468
But then look beyond the cars

00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:19.691
to the trees that line
the side of the road.

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:22.102
How many of those could you identify?

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:24.990
Probably not as many, right?

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:27.762
Year upon year,

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:30.454
we grow further and further
away from nature
