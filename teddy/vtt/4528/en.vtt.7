00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:34.007
And in fact, in my family, plants
have always been a source of fascination.

00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:36.069
My grand-uncle, Father Cecil Saldanha,

00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:39.649
was the first to document the flora
of our home state of Karnataka

00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:41.181
back in the '60s.

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:43.114
And my mother has all of these memories

00:03:43.138 --> 00:03:46.635
of being a little girl watching
this entire enterprise unfold.

00:03:47.248 --> 00:03:48.547
And consequently,

00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:52.000
I've come to associate plants
with adventure and discovery

00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:53.264
and excitement.

00:03:53.288 --> 00:03:56.984
And so I knew I didn't just want
to paint roses and sunflowers.

00:03:57.008 --> 00:04:01.393
I wanted to paint the kinds of plants
that botanists like my uncle work with.
