00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:32.722
and so they have a little way
of supplementing their diets.

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:38.146
They lure, trap and ingest insects
using mucilaginous glands on their leaves.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.040
The little insects are attracted
to the sweet secretions,

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:42.763
but once they come in contact,

00:04:42.787 --> 00:04:44.763
they are ensnared and the game is up.

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:46.251
And you might notice

00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:50.835
that the sundews very cleverly hold
their flowers on tall, thin stems

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:52.882
high above their murderous leaves

00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:55.413
to avoid trapping potential pollinators.

00:04:56.444 --> 00:04:58.563
Further inside the jungle,

00:04:58.587 --> 00:05:01.861
you might meet the strangler fig.
