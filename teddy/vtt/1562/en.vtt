Good morning.

00:00:03.327 --> 00:00:05.114
When I was a little boy,

00:00:05.114 --> 00:00:08.191

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:21.280
As background, I was fortunate enough to grow up

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.993
in a family of loving and talented artists

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:27.557
in one of the world's great cities.

00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:31.434
