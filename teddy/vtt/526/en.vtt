00:00:00.708 --> 00:00:05.768
So I know for sure there's at least
one thing I have in common with dentists.

00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:10.143
I absolutely hate
the holiday of Halloween.

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:13.809
Now, this hatred stems
not from a dislike of cavities,

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:16.184
nor was it a lifetime in the making.

00:00:16.207 --> 00:00:19.351
Rather, this hatred stems
from a particular incident

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:21.434
that happened nine years ago.

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:25.309
Nine years ago, I was even younger,
I was 20 years old,

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.476
and I was an intern in the White House.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.768
The other White House.

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:32.018
And my job was to work
with mayors and councilors nationwide.
