00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Good morning.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're all familiar with his fantastic work --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But we do not know his face.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Thousands of books have been written about him,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?
