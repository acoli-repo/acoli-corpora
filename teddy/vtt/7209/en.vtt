00:00:04.768 --> 00:00:08.338
The 2020s were a crux in human history.

00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:10.073
They began with the first pandemic,

00:00:10.107 --> 00:00:11.842
a slap to the face of everyone,

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:15.279
as they had to acknowledge
that they were a single civilization

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.481
on a single biosphere,

00:00:17.514 --> 00:00:21.485
utterly dependent on science
to keep them alive.

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.754
Civilization is a fragile thing.

00:00:24.288 --> 00:00:27.958
And although people started the '20s
hoping to ignore that profound truth,

00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:29.860
even after the first pandemic,

00:00:29.893 --> 00:00:33.597
the great heat waves of 2023
torched any such hope.
