00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:02.065
These are worms.

00:00:02.089 --> 00:00:04.675
Not the kind of worms
you find crawling in the dirt.

00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:06.853
These are parasitic roundworms.

00:00:06.877 --> 00:00:09.312
They live inside
a human being's intestines.

00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:12.092
Each of these worms
can grow up to 12 inches long,

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:14.497
and there are 200 of them
in this jar for a reason,

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:16.903
because that is the number
you might typically find

00:00:16.927 --> 00:00:19.371
in the belly of a single infected child.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.055
Worm infections have been around
for thousands of years.

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.079
They have influenced the outcomes of wars,

00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:26.016
and they have long stymied human health.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.627
Roundworm, hookworm,

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:29.674
whipworm, schistosomiasis:

00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:32.810
infections from these species
cause pain and discomfort.
